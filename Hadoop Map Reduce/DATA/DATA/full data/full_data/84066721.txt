course there are two sides to the question let us look at the other we often hear shopgirls spoken of no such persons exist there are girls who work in shops they make their living that way but why turn their occupation into an adjective let us be fair we do not refer to the girls who live on fifth avenue as marriagegirls  lou and nancy were chums they came to the big city to find work because there was not enough to eat at their homes to go around nancy was nineteen lou was twenty both were pretty active country girls who had no ambition to go on the stage  the little cherub that sits up aloft guided them to a cheap and respectable boardinghouse both found positions and became wageearners they remained chums it is at the end of six months that i would beg you to step forward and be introduced to them meddlesome reader my lady friends miss nancy and miss lou while you are shaking hands please take noticecautiouslyof their attire yes cautiously for they are as quick to resent a stare as a lady in a box at the horse show is  lou is a piecework ironer in a hand laundry she is clothed in a badlyfitting purple dress and her hat plume is four inches too long but her ermine muff and scarf cost 25 and its fellow beasts will be ticketed in the windows at 798 before the season is over her cheeks are pink and her light blue eyes bright contentment radiates from her  nancy you would call a shopgirlbecause you have the habit there is no type but a perverse generation is always seeking a type so this is what the type should be she has the highratted pompadour and the exaggerated straightfront her skirt is shoddy but has the correct flare no furs protect her against the bitter spring air but she wears her short broadcloth jacket as jauntily as though it were persian lamb on her face and in her eyes remorseless typeseeker is the typical shopgirl expression it is a look of silent but contemptuous revolt against cheated womanhood of sad prophecy of the vengeance to come when she laughs her loudest the look is still there the same look can be seen in the eyes of russian peasants and those of us left will see it some day on gabriels face when he comes to blow us up it is a look that should wither and abash man but he has been known to smirk at it and offer flowerswith a string tied to them  now lift your hat and come away while you receive lous cheery see you again and the sardonic sweet smile of nancy that seems somehow to miss you and go fluttering like a white moth up over the housetops to the stars  the two waited on the corner for dan dan was lous steady company faithful well he was on hand when mary would have had to hire a dozen subpoena servers to find her lamb  aint you cold nance said lou say what a chump you are for working in that old store for 8 a week i made 1850 last week of course ironing aint as swell work as selling lace behind a counter but it pays none of us ironers make less than 10 and i dont know that its any less respectful work either  you can have it said nancy with uplifted nose ill take my eight a week and hall bedroom i like to be among nice things and swell people and look what a chance ive got why one of our glove girls married a pittsburgsteel maker or blacksmith or somethingthe other day worth a million dollars ill catch a swell myself some time i aint bragging on my looks or anything but ill take my chances where theres big prizes offered what show would a girl have in a laundry  why thats where i met dan said lou triumphantly he came in for his sunday shirt and collars and saw me at the first board ironing we all try to get to work at the first board ella maginnis was sick that day and i had her place he said he noticed my arms first how round and white they was i had my sleeves rolled up some nice fellows come into laundries you can tell em by their bringing their clothes in suit cases and turning in the door sharp and sudden  how can you wear a waist like that lou said nancy gazing down at the offending article with sweet scorn in her heavylidded eyes it shows fierce taste  this waist cried lou with wideeyed indignation why i paid 16 for this waist its worth twentyfive a woman left it to be laundered and never called for it the boss sold it to me its got yards and yards of hand embroidery on it better talk about that ugly plain thing youve got on  this ugly plain thing said nancy calmly was copied from one that mrs van alstyne fisher was wearing the girls say her bill in the store last year was 12000 i made mine myself it cost me 150 ten feet away you couldnt tell it from hers  oh well said lou goodnaturedly if you want to starve and put on airs go ahead but ill take my job and good wages and after hours give me something as fancy and attractive to wear as i am able to buy  but just then dan camea serious young man with a readymade necktie who had escaped the citys brand of frivolityan electrician earning 30 dollars per week who looked upon lou with the sad eyes of romeo and thought her embroidered waist a web in which any fly should delight to be caught  my friend mr owensshake hands with miss danforth said lou  im mighty glad to know you miss danforth said dan with outstretched hand ive heard lou speak of you so often  thanks said nancy touching his fingers with the tips of her cool ones ive heard her mention youa few times  lou giggled  did you get that handshake from mrs van alstyne fisher nance she asked  if i did you can feel safe in copying it said nancy  oh i couldnt use it at all its too stylish for me its intended to set off diamond rings that high shake is wait till i get a few and then ill try it  learn it first said nancy wisely and youll be more likely to get the rings  now to settle this argument said dan with his ready cheerful smile let me make a proposition as i cant take both of you up to tiffanys and do the right thing what do you say to a little vaudeville ive got the rickets how about looking at stage diamonds since we cant shake hands with the real sparklers  the faithful squire took his place close to the curb lou next a little peacocky in her bright and pretty clothes nancy on the inside slender and soberly clothed as the sparrow but with the true van alstyne fisher walkthus they set out for their evenings moderate diversion  i do not suppose that many look upon a great department store as an educational institution but the one in which nancy worked was something like that to her she was surrounded by beautiful things that breathed of taste and refinement if you live in an atmosphere of luxury luxury is yours whether your money pays for it or anothers  the people she served were mostly women whose dress manners and position in the social world were quoted as criterions from them nancy began to take tollthe best from each according to her view  from one she would copy and practice a gesture from another an eloquent lifting of an eyebrow from others a manner of walking of carrying a purse of smiling of greeting a friend of addressing inferiors in station from her best beloved model mrs van alstyne fisher she made requisition for that excellent thing a soft low voice as clear as silver and as perfect in articulation as the notes of a thrush suffused in the aura of this high social refinement and good breeding it was impossible for her to escape a deeper effect of it as good habits are said to be better than good principles so perhaps good manners are better than good habits the teachings of your parents may not keep alive your new england conscience but if you sit on a straightback chair and repeat the words prisms and pilgrims forty times the devil will flee from you and when nancy spoke in the van alstyne fisher tones she felt the thrill of noblesse oblige to her very bones  there was another source of learning in the great departmental school whenever you see three or four shopgirls gather in a bunch and jingle their wire bracelets as an accompaniment to apparently frivolous conversation do not think that they are there for the purpose of criticizing the way ethel does her back hair the meeting may lack the dignity of the deliberative bodies of man but it has all the importance of the occasion on which eve and her first daughter first put their heads together to make adam understand his proper place in the household it is womans conference for common defense and exchange of strategical theories of attack and repulse upon and against the world which is a stage and man its audience who persists in throwing bouquets thereupon woman the most helpless of the young of any animalwith the fawns grace but without its fleetness with the birds beauty but without its power of flight with the honeybees burden of sweetness but without itsoh lets drop that similesome of us may have been stung  during this council of war they pass weapons one to another and exchange stratagems that each has devised and formulated out of the tactics of life  i says to im says sadie aint you the fresh thing who do you suppose i am to be addressing such a remark to me and what do you think he says back to me  the heads brown black flaxen red and yellow bob together the answer is given and the parry to the thrust is decided upon to be used by each thereafter in passagesatarms with the common enemy man  thus nancy learned the art of defense and to women successful defense means victory  the curriculum of a department store is a wide one perhaps no other college could have fitted her as well for her lifes ambitionthe drawing of a matrimonial prize  her station in the store was a favored one the music room was near enough for her to hear and become familiar with the works of the best composersat least to acquire the familiarity that passed for appreciation in the social world in which she was vaguely trying to set a tentative and aspiring foot she absorbed the educating influence of art wares of costly and dainty fabrics of adornments that are almost culture to women  the other girls soon became aware of nancys ambition here comes your millionaire nancy they would call to her whenever any man who looked the rôle approached her counter it got to be a habit of men who were hanging about while their women folk were shopping to stroll over to the handkerchief counter and dawdle over the cambric squares nancys imitation highbred air and genuine dainty beauty was what attracted many men thus came to display their graces before her some of them may have been millionaires others were certainly no more than their sedulous apes nancy learned to discriminate there was a window at the end of the handkerchief counter and she could see the rows of vehicles waiting for the shoppers in the street below she looked and perceived that automobiles differ as well as do their owners  once a fascinating gentleman bought four dozen handkerchiefs and wooed her across the counter with a king cophetua air when he had gone one of the girls said  whats wrong nance that you didnt warm up to that fellow he looks the swell article all right to me  him said nancy with her coolest sweetest most impersonal van alstyne fisher smile not for mine i saw him drive up outside a 12 h p machine and an irish chauffeur and you saw what kind of handkerchiefs he boughtsilk and hes got dactylis on him give me the real thing or nothing if you please  two of the most refined women in the storea forelady and a cashierhad a few swell gentlemen friends with whom they now and then dined once they included nancy in an invitation the dinner took place in a spectacular café whose tables are engaged for new years eve a year in advance there were two gentlemen friendsone without any hair on his headhigh living ungrew it and we can prove itthe other a young man whose worth and sophistication he impressed upon you in two convincing wayshe swore that all the wine was corked and he wore diamond cuff buttons this young man perceived irresistible excellencies in nancy his taste ran to shopgirls and here was one that added the voice and manners of his high social world to the franker charms of her own caste so on the following day he appeared in the store and made her a serious proposal of marriage over a box of hemstitched grassbleached irish linens nancy declined a brown pompadour ten feet away had been using her eyes and ears when the rejected suitor had gone she heaped carboys of upbraidings and horror upon nancys head  what a terrible little fool you are that fellows a millionairehes a nephew of old van skittles himself and he was talking on the level too have you gone crazy nance  have i said nancy i didnt take him did i he isnt a millionaire so hard that you could notice it anyhow his family only allows him 20000 a year to spend the baldheaded fellow was guying him about it the other night at supper  the brown pompadour came nearer and narrowed her eyes  say what do you want she inquired in a voice hoarse for lack of chewinggum aint that enough for you do you want to be a mormon and marry rockefeller and gladstone dowie and the king of spain and the whole bunch aint 20000 a year good enough for you  nancy flushed a little under the level gaze of the black shallow eyes  it wasnt altogether the money carrie she explained his friend caught him in a rank lie the other night at dinner it was about some girl he said he hadnt been to the theater with well i cant stand a liar put everything togetheri dont like him and that settles it when i sell out its not going to be on any bargain day ive got to have something that sits up in a chair like a man anyhow yes im looking out for a catch but its got to be able to do something more than make a noise like a toy bank  the physiopathic ward for yours said the brown pompadour walking away  these high ideas if not idealsnancy continued to cultivate on 8 per week she bivouacked on the trail of the great unknown catch eating her dry bread and tightening her belt day by day on her face was the faint soldierly sweet grim smile of the preordained manhunter the store was her forest and many times she raised her rifle at game that seemed broadantlered and big but always some deep unerring instinctperhaps of the huntress perhaps of the womanmade her hold her fire and take up the trail again  lou flourished in the laundry out of her 1850 per week she paid 6 for her room and board the rest went mainly for clothes her opportunities for bettering her taste and manners were few compared with nancys in the steaming laundry there was nothing but work work and her thoughts of the evening pleasures to come many costly and showy fabrics passed under her iron and it may be that her growing fondness for dress was thus transmitted to her through the conducting metal  when the days work was over dan awaited her outside her faithful shadow in whatever light she stood  sometimes he cast an honest and troubled glance at lous clothes that increased in conspicuity rather than in style but this was no disloyalty he deprecated the attention they called to her in the streets  and lou was no less faithful to her chum there was a law that nancy should go with them on whatsoever outings they might take dan bore the extra burden heartily and in good cheer it might be said that lou furnished the color nancy the tone and dan the weight of the distractionseeking trio the escort in his neat but obviously readymade suit his readymade tie and unfailing genial readymade wit never startled or clashed he was of that good kind that you are likely to forget while they are present but remember distinctly after they are gone  to nancys superior taste the flavor of these readymade pleasures was sometimes a little bitter but she was young and youth is a gourmand when it cannot be a gourmet  dan is always wanting me to marry him right away lou told her once but why should i im independent i can do as i please with the money i earn and he never would agree for me to keep on working afterward and say nance what do you want to stick to that old store for and half starve and half dress yourself i could get you a place in the laundry right now if youd come it seems to me that you could afford to be a little less stuckup if you could make a good deal more money  i dont think im stuckup lou said nancy but id rather live on half rations and stay where i am i suppose ive got the habit its the chance that i want i dont expect to be always behind a counter im learning something new every day im right up against refined and rich people all the timeeven if i do only wait on them and im not missing any pointers that i see passing around  caught your millionaire yet asked lou with her teasing laugh  i havent selected one yet answered nancy ive been looking them over  goodness the idea of picking over em dont you ever let one get by you nanceeven if hes a few dollars shy but of course youre jokingmillionaires dont think about working girls like us  it might be better for them if they did said nancy with cool wisdom some of us could teach them how to take care of their money  if one was to speak to me laughed lou i know id have a duckfit  thats because you dont know any the only difference between swells and other people is you have to watch em closer dont you think that red silk lining is just a little bit too bright for that coat lou  lou looked at the plain dull olive jacket of her friend  well no i dontbut it may seem so beside that fadedlooking thing youve got on  this jacket said nancy complacently has exactly the cut and fit of one that mrs van alstyne fisher was wearing the other day the material cost me 398 i suppose hers cost about 100 more  oh well said lou lightly it dont strike me as millionaire bait shouldnt wonder if i catch one before you do anyway  truly it would have taken a philosopher to decide upon the values of the theories held by the two friends lou lacking that certain pride and fastidiousness that keeps stores and desks filled with girls working for the barest living thumped away gaily with her iron in the noisy and stifling laundry her wages supported her even beyond the point of comfort so that her dress profited until sometimes she cast a sidelong glance of impatience at the neat but inelegant apparel of dandan the constant the immutable the undeviating  as for nancy her case was one of tens of thousands silk and jewels and laces and ornaments and the perfume and music of the fine world of goodbreeding and tastethese were made for woman they are her equitable portion let her keep near them if they are a part of life to her and if she will she is no traitor to herself as esau was for she keeps he birthright and the pottage she earns is often very scant  in this atmosphere nancy belonged and she throve in it and ate her frugal meals and schemed over her cheap dresses with a determined and contented mind she already knew woman and she was studying man the animal both as to his habits and eligibility some day she would bring down the game that she wanted but she promised herself it would be what seemed to her the biggest and the best and nothing smaller  thus she kept her lamp trimmed and burning to receive the bridegroom when he should come  but another lesson she learned perhaps unconsciously her standard of values began to shift and change sometimes the dollarmark grew blurred in her minds eye and shaped itself into letters that spelled such words as truth and honor and now and then just kindness let us make a likeness of one who hunts the moose or elk in some mighty wood he sees a little dell mossy and embowered where a rill trickles babbling to him of rest and comfort at these times the spear of nimrod himself grows blunt  so nancy wondered sometimes if persian lamb was always quoted at its market value by the hearts that it covered  one thursday evening nancy left the store and turned across sixth avenue westward to the laundry she was expected to go with lou and dan to a musical comedy  dan was just coming out of the laundry when she arrived there was a queer strained look on his face  i thought i would drop around to see if they had heard from her he said  heard from who asked nancy isnt lou there  i thought you knew said dan she hasnt been here or at the house where she lived since monday she moved all her things from there she told one of the girls in the laundry she might be going to europe  hasnt anybody seen her anywhere asked nancy  dan looked at her with his jaws set grimly and a steely gleam in his steady gray eyes  they told me in the laundry he said harshly that they saw her pass yesterdayin an automobile with one of the millionaires i suppose that you and lou were forever busying your brains about  for the first time nancy quailed before a man she laid her hand that trembled slightly on dans sleeve  youve no right to say such a thing to me danas if i had anything to do with it  i didnt mean it that way said dan softening he fumbled in his vest pocket  ive got the tickets for the show tonight he said with a gallant show of lightness if you  nancy admired pluck whenever she saw it  ill go with you dan she said  three months went by before nancy saw lou again  at twilight one evening the shopgirl was hurrying home along the border of a little quiet park she heard her name called and wheeled about in time to catch lou rushing into her arms  after the first embrace they drew their heads back as serpents do ready to attack or to charm with a thousand questions trembling on their swift tongues and then nancy noticed that prosperity had descended upon lou manifesting itself in costly furs flashing gems and creations of the tailors art  you little fool cried lou loudly and affectionately i see you are still working in that store and as shabby as ever and how about that big catch you were going to makenothing doing yet i suppose  and then lou looked and saw that something better than prosperity had descended upon nancysomething that shone brighter than gems in her eyes and redder than a rose in her cheeks and that danced like electricity anxious to be loosed from the tip of her tongue  yes im still in the store said nancy but im going to leave it next week ive made my catchthe biggest catch in the world you wont mind now lou will youim going to be married to danto danhes my dan nowwhy lou  around the corner of the park strolled one of those newcrop smoothfaced young policemen that are making the force more endurableat least to the eye he saw a woman with an expensive fur coat and diamondringed hands crouching down against the iron fence of the park sobbing turbulently while a slender plainlydressed working girl leaned close trying to console her but the gibsonian cop being of the new order passed on pretending not to notice for he was wise enough to know that these matters are beyond help so far as the power he represents is concerned though he rap the pavement with his nightstick till the sound goes up to the furthermost stars     a madison square arabian night   to carson chalmers in his apartment near the square phillips brought the evening mail beside the routine correspondence there were two items bearing the same foreign postmark  one of the incoming parcels contained a photograph of a woman the other contained an interminable letter over which chalmers hung absorbed for a long time the letter was from another woman and it contained poisoned barbs sweetly dipped in honey and feathered with innuendoes concerning the photographed woman  chalmers tore this letter into a thousand bits and began to wear out his expensive rug by striding back and forth upon it thus an animal from the jungle acts when it is caged and thus a caged man acts when he is housed in a jungle of doubt  by and by the restless mood was overcome the rug was not an enchanted one for sixteen feet he could travel along it three thousand miles was beyond its power to aid  phillips appeared he never entered he invariably appeared like a welloiled genie  will you dine here sir or out he asked  here said chalmers and in half an hour he listened glumly to the january blasts making an aeolian trombone of the empty street  wait he said to the disappearing genie as i came home across the end of the square i saw many men standing there in rows there was one mounted upon something talking why do those men stand in rows and why are they there  they are homeless men sir said phillips the man standing on the box tries to get lodging for them for the night people come around to listen and give him money then he sends as many as the money will pay for to some lodginghouse that is why they stand in rows they get sent to bed in order as they come  by the time dinner is served said chalmers have one of those men here he will dine with me  wwwhich began phillips stammering for the first time during his service  choose one at random said chalmers you might see that he is reasonably soberand a certain amount of cleanliness will not be held against him that is all  it was an unusual thing for carson chalmers to play the caliph but on that night he felt the inefficacy of conventional antidotes to melancholy something wanton and egregious something highflavored and arabian he must have to lighten his mood  on the half hour phillips had finished his duties as slave of the lamp the waiters from the restaurant below had whisked aloft the delectable dinner the dining table laid for two glowed cheerily in the glow of the pinkshaded candles  and now phillips as though he ushered a cardinalor held in charge a burglarwafted in the shivering guest who had been haled from the line of mendicant lodgers  it is a common thing to call such men wrecks if the comparison be used here it is the specific one of a derelict come to grief through fire even yet some flickering combustion illuminated the drifting hulk his face and hands had been recently washeda rite insisted upon by phillips as a memorial to the slaughtered conventions in the candlelight he stood a flaw in the decorous fittings of the apartment his face was a sickly white covered almost to the eyes with a stubble the shade of a red irish setters coat phillipss comb had failed to control the pale brown hair long matted and conformed to the contour of a constantly worn hat his eyes were full of a hopeless tricky defiance like that seen in a curs that is cornered by his tormentors his shabby coat was buttoned high but a quarter inch of redeeming collar showed above it his manner was singularly free from embarrassment when chalmers rose from his chair across the round dining table  if you will oblige me said the host i will be glad to have your company at dinner  my name is plumer said the highway guest in harsh and aggressive tones if youre like me you like to know the name of the party youre dining with  i was going on to say continued chalmers somewhat hastily that mine is chalmers will you sit opposite  plumer of the ruffled plumes bent his knee for phillips to slide the chair beneath him he had an air of having sat at attended boards before phillips set out the anchovies and olives  good barked plumer going to be in courses is it all right my jovial ruler of bagdad im your scheherezade all the way to the toothpicks youre the first caliph with a genuine oriental flavor ive struck since frost what luck and i was fortythird in line i finished counting just as your welcome emissary arrived to bid me to the feast i had about as much chance of getting a bed tonight as i have of being the next president how will you have the sad story of my life mr al raschida chapter with each course or the whole edition with the cigars and coffee  the situation does not seem a novel one to you said chalmers with a smile  by the chin whiskers of the prophetno answered the guest new yorks as full of cheap haroun al raschids as bagdad is of fleas ive been held up for my story with a loaded meal pointed at my head twenty times catch anybody in new york giving you something for nothing they spell curiosity and charity with the same set of building blocks lots of em will stake you to a dime and chopsuey and a few of em will play caliph to the tune of a top sirloin but every one of em will stand over you till they screw your autobiography out of you with foot notes appendix and unpublished fragments oh i know what to do when i see victuals coming toward me in little old bagdadonthesubway i strike the asphalt three times with my forehead and get ready to spiel yarns for my supper i claim descent from the late tommy tucker who was forced to hand out vocal harmony for his predigested wheaterina and spoopju  i do not ask your story said chalmers i tell you frankly that it was a sudden whim that prompted me to send for some stranger to dine with me i assure you you will not suffer through any curiosity of mine  oh fudge exclaimed the guest enthusiastically tackling his soup i dont mind it a bit im a regular oriental magazine with a red cover and the leaves cut when the caliph walks abroad in fact we fellows in the bed line have a sort of union rate for things of this sort somebodys always stopping and wanting to know what brought us down so low in the world for a sandwich and a glass of beer i tell em that drink did it for corned beef and cabbage and a cup of coffee i give em the hardheartedlandlordsixmonthsinthehospitallostjob story a sirloin steak and a quarter for a bed gets the wall street tragedy of the sweptaway fortune and the gradual descent this is the first spread of this kind ive stumbled against i havent got a story to fit it ill tell you what mr chalmers im going to tell you the truth for this if youll listen to it itll be harder for you to believe than the madeup ones  an hour later the arabian guest lay back with a sigh of satisfaction while phillips brought the coffee and cigars and cleared the table  did you ever hear of sherrard plumer he asked with a strange smile  i remember the name said chalmers he was a painter i think of a good deal of prominence a few years ago  five years said the guest then i went down like a chunk of lead im sherrard plumer i sold the last portrait i painted for 2000 after that i couldnt have found a sitter for a gratis picture  what was the trouble chalmers could not resist asking  funny thing answered plumer grimly never quite understood it myself for a while i swam like a cork i broke into the swell crowd and got commissions right and left the newspapers called me a fashionable painter then the funny things began to happen whenever i finished a picture people would come to see it and whisper and look queerly at one another  i soon found out what the trouble was i had a knack of bringing out in the face of a portrait the hidden character of the original i dont know how i did iti painted what i sawbut i know it did me some of my sitters were fearfully enraged and refused their pictures i painted the portrait of a very beautiful and popular society dame when it was finished her husband looked at it with a peculiar expression on his face and the next week he sued for divorce  i remember one case of a prominent banker who sat to me while i had his portrait on exhibition in my studio an acquaintance of his came in to look at it bless me says he does he really look like that i told him it was considered a faithful likeness i never noticed that expression about his eyes before said he i think ill drop downtown and change my bank account he did drop down but the bank account was gone and so was mr banker  it wasnt long till they put me out of business people dont want their secret meannesses shown up in a picture they can smile and twist their own faces and deceive you but the picture cant i couldnt get an order for another picture and i had to give up i worked as a newspaper artist for a while and then for a lithographer but my work with them got me into the same trouble if i drew from a photograph my drawing showed up characteristics and expressions that you couldnt find in the photo but i guess they were in the original all right the customers raised lively rows especially the women and i never could hold a job long so i began to rest my weary head upon the breast of old booze for comfort and pretty soon i was in the freebed line and doing oral fiction for handouts among the food bazaars does the truthful statement weary thee o caliph i can turn on the wall street disaster stop if you prefer but that requires a tear and im afraid i cant hustle one up after that good dinner  no no said chalmers earnestly you interest me very much did all of your portraits reveal some unpleasant trait or were there some that did not suffer from the ordeal of your peculiar brush  some yes said plumer children generally a good many women and a sufficient number of men all people arent bad you know when they were all right the pictures were all right as i said i dont explain it but im telling you facts  on chalmerss writingtable lay the photograph that he had received that day in the foreign mail ten minutes later he had plumer at work making a sketch from it in pastels at the end of an hour the artist rose and stretched wearily  its done he yawned youll excuse me for being so long i got interested in the job lordy but im tired no bed last night you know guess itll have to be good night now o commander of the faithful  chalmers went as far as the door with him and slipped some bills into his hand  oh ill take em said plumer all thats included in the fall thanks and for the very good dinner i shall sleep on feathers tonight and dream of bagdad i hope it wont turn out to be a dream in the morning farewell most excellent caliph  again chalmers paced restlessly upon his rug but his beat lay as far from the table whereon lay the pastel sketch as the room would permit twice thrice he tried to approach it but failed he could see the dun and gold and brown of the colors but there was a wall about it built by his fears that kept him at a distance he sat down and tried to calm himself he sprang up and rang for phillips  there is a young artist in this building he said a mr reinemando you know which is his apartment  top floor front sir said phillips  go up and ask him to favor me with his presence here for a few minutes  reineman came at once chalmers introduced himself  mr reineman said he there is a little pastel sketch on yonder table i would be glad if you will give me your opinion of it as to its artistic merits and as a picture  the young artist advanced to the table and took up the sketch chalmers half turned away leaning upon the back of a chair  howdoyou find it he asked slowly  as a drawing said the artist i cant praise it enough its the work of a masterbold and fine and true it puzzles me a little i havent seen any pastel work near as good in years  the face manthe subjectthe originalwhat would you say of that  the face said reineman is the face of one of gods own angels may i ask who  my wife shouted chalmers wheeling and pouncing upon the astonished artist gripping his hand and pounding his back she is traveling in europe take that sketch boy and paint the picture of your life from it and leave the price to me     the rubaiyat of a scotch highball   this document is intended to strike somewhere between a temperance lecture and the bartenders guide relative to the latter drink shall swell the theme and be set forth in abundance agreeably to the former not an elbow shall be crooked  bob babbitt was off the stuff which meansas you will discover by referring to the unabridged dictionary of bohemiathat he had cut out the booze that he was on the water wagon the reason for bobs sudden attitude of hostility toward the demon rumas the white ribboners miscall whiskey see the bartenders guide should be of interest to reformers and saloonkeepers  there is always hope for a man who when sober will not concede or acknowledge that he was ever drunk but when a man will say in the apt words of the phrasedistiller i had a beautiful skate on last night you will have to put stuff in his coffee as well as pray for him  one evening on his way home babbitt dropped in at the broadway bar that he liked best always there were three or four fellows there from the downtown offices whom he knew and then there would be highballs and stories and he would hurry home to dinner a little late but feeling good and a little sorry for the poor standard oil company on this evening as he entered he heard some one say babbitt was in last night as full as a boiled owl  babbitt walked to the bar and saw in the mirror that his face was as white as chalk for the first time he had looked truth in the eyes others had lied to him he had dissembled with himself he was a drunkard and had not known it what he had fondly imagined was a pleasant exhilaration had been maudlin intoxication his fancied wit had been drivel his gay humors nothing but the noisy vagaries of a sot but never again  a glass of seltzer he said to the bartender  a little silence fell upon the group of his cronies who had been expecting him to join them  going off the stuff bob one of them asked politely and with more formality than the highballs ever called forth  yes said babbitt  some one of the group took up the unwashed thread of a story he had been telling the bartender shoved over a dime and a nickel change from the quarter ungarnished with his customary smile and babbitt walked out  now babbitt had a home and a wifebut that is another story and i will tell you that story which will show you a better habit and a worse story than you could find in the man who invented the phrase  it began away up in sullivan county where so many rivers and so much trouble beginsor begin how would you say that it was july and jessie was a summer boarder at the mountain squint hotel and bob who was just out of college saw her one dayand they were married in september thats the tabloid novelone swallow of water and its gone  but those july days  let the exclamation point expound it for i shall not for particulars you might read up on romeo and juliet and abraham lincolns thrilling sonnet about you can fool some of the people c and darwins works  but one thing i must tell you about both of them were mad over omars rubaiyat they knew every verse of the old bluffer by heartnot consecutively but picking em out here and there as you fork the mushrooms in a fiftycent steak à la bordelaise sullivan county is full of rocks and trees and jessie used to sit on them andplease be goodused to sit on the rocks and bob had a way of standing behind her with his hands over her shoulders holding her hands and his face close to hers and they would repeat over and over their favorite verses of the old tentmaker they saw only the poetry and philosophy of the lines thenindeed they agreed that the wine was only an image and that what was meant to be celebrated was some divinity or maybe love or life however at that time neither of them had tasted the stuff that goes with a sixtycent table dhote  where was i oh they married and came to new york bob showed his college diploma and accepted a position filling inkstands in a lawyers office at 15 a week at the end of two years he had worked up to 50 and gotten his first taste of bohemiathe kind that wont stand the borax and formaldehyde tests  they had two furnished rooms and a little kitchen to jess accustomed to the mild but beautiful savor of a country town the dreggy bohemia was sugar and spice she hung fish seines on the walls of her rooms and bought a rakishlooking sideboard and learned to play the banjo twice or thrice a week they dined at french or italian tables dhote in a cloud of smoke and brag and unshorn hair jess learned to drink a cocktail in order to get the cherry at home she smoked a cigarette after dinner she learned to pronounce chianti and leave her olive stones for the waiter to pick up once she essayed to say la la la in a crowd but got only as far as the second one they met one or two couples while dining out and became friendly with them the sideboard was stocked with scotch and rye and a liqueur they had their new friends in to dinner and all were laughing at nothing by 1 a m some plastering fell in the room below them for which bob had to pay 450 thus they footed it merrily on the ragged frontiers of the country that has no boundary lines or government  and soon bob fell in with his cronies and learned to keep his foot on the little rail six inches above the floor for an hour or so every afternoon before he went home drink always rubbed him the right way and he would reach his rooms as jolly as a sandboy jessie would meet him at the door and generally they would dance some insane kind of a rigadoon about the floor by way of greeting once when bobs feet became confused and he tumbled headlong over a footstool jessie laughed so heartily and long that he had to throw all the couch pillows at her to make her hush  in such wise life was speeding for them on the day when bob babbitt first felt the power that the giftie gied him  but let us get back to our lamb and mint sauce  when bob got home that evening he found jessie in a long apron cutting up a lobster for the newburg usually when bob came in mellow from his hour at the bar his welcome was hilarious though somewhat tinctured with scotch smoke  by screams and snatches of song and certain audible testimonials of domestic felicity was his advent proclaimed when she heard his foot on the stairs the old maid in the hall room always stuffed cotton into her ears at first jessie had shrunk from the rudeness and favor of these spiritual greetings but as the fog of the false bohemia gradually encompassed her she came to accept them as loves true and proper greeting  bob came in without a word smiled kissed her neatly but noiselessly took up a paper and sat down in the hall room the old maid held her two plugs of cotton poised filled with anxiety  jessie dropped lobster and knife and ran to him with frightened eyes  whats the matter bob are you ill  not at all dear  then whats the matter with you  nothing  hearken brethren when shewhohasarighttoask interrogates you concerning a change she finds in your mood answer her thus tell her that you in a sudden rage have murdered your grandmother tell her that you have robbed orphans and that remorse has stricken you tell her your fortune is swept away that you are beset by enemies by bunions by any kind of malevolent fate but do not if peace and happiness are worth as much as a grain of mustard seed to youdo not answer her nothing  jessie went back to the lobster in silence she cast looks of darkest suspicion at bob he had never acted that way before  when dinner was on the table she set out the bottle of scotch and the glasses bob declined  tell you the truth jess he said ive cut out the drink help yourself of course if you dont mind ill try some of the seltzer straight  youve stopped drinking she said looking at him steadily and unsmilingly what for  it wasnt doing me any good said bob dont you approve of the idea  jessie raised her eyebrows and one shoulder slightly  entirely she said with a sculptured smile i could not conscientiously advise any one to drink or smoke or whistle on sunday  the meal was finished almost in silence bob tried to make talk but his efforts lacked the stimulus of previous evenings he felt miserable and once or twice his eye wandered toward the bottle but each time the scathing words of his bibulous friend sounded in his ear and his mouth set with determination  jessie felt the change deeply the essence of their lives seemed to have departed suddenly the restless fever the false gayety the unnatural excitement of the shoddy bohemia in which they had lived had dropped away in the space of the popping of a cork she stole curious and forlorn glances at the dejected bob who bore the guilty look of at least a wifebeater or a family tyrant  after dinner the colored maid who came in daily to perform such chores cleared away the things jessie with an unreadable countenance brought back the bottle of scotch and the glasses and a bowl of cracked ice and set them on the table  may i ask she said with some of the ice in her tones whether i am to be included in your sudden spasm of goodness if not ill make one for myself its rather chilly this evening for some reason  oh come now jess said bob goodnaturedly dont be too rough on me help yourself by all means theres no danger of your overdoing it but i thought there was with me and thats why i quit have yours and then lets get out the banjo and try over that new quickstep  ive heard said jessie in the tones of the oracle that drinking alone is a pernicious habit no i dont think i feel like playing this evening if we are going to reform we may as well abandon the evil habit of banjoplaying too  she took up a book and sat in her little willow rocker on the other side of the table neither of them spoke for half an hour  and then bob laid down his paper and got up with a strange absent look on his face and went behind her chair and reached over her shoulders taking her hands in his and laid his face close to hers  in a moment to jessie the walls of the seinehung room vanished and she saw the sullivan county hills and rills bob felt her hands quiver in his as he began the verse from old omar      come fill the cup and in the fire of spring      the winter garment of repentance fling      the bird of time has but a little way      to flyand lo the bird is on the wing  and then he walked to the table and poured a stiff drink of scotch into a glass  but in that moment a mountain breeze had somehow found its way in and blown away the mist of the false bohemia  jessie leaped and with one fierce sweep of her hand sent the bottle and glasses crashing to the floor the same motion of her arm carried it around bobs neck where it met its mate and fastened tight  oh my god bobbienot that versei see now i wasnt always such a fool was i the other one boythe one that says remould it to the hearts desire say that oneto the hearts desire  i know that one said bob it goes     ah love could you and i with him conspire      to grasp this sorry scheme of things entire      would not we  let me finish it said jessie     would not we shatter it to bitsand then      remould it nearer to the hearts desire  its shattered all right said bob crunching some glass under his heel  in some dungeon below the accurate ear of mrs pickens the landlady located the smash  its that wild mr babbitt coming home soused again she said and hes got such a nice little wife too     the pendulum   eightyfirst streetlet em out please yelled the shepherd in blue  a flock of citizen sheep scrambled out and another flock scrambled aboard dingding the cattle cars of the manhattan elevated rattled away and john perkins drifted down the stairway of the station with the released flock  john walked slowly toward his flat slowly because in the lexicon of his daily life there was no such word as perhaps there are no surprises awaiting a man who has been married two years and lives in a flat as he walked john perkins prophesied to himself with gloomy and downtrodden cynicism the foregone conclusions of the monotonous day  katy would meet him at the door with a kiss flavored with cold cream and butterscotch he would remove his coat sit upon a macadamized lounge and read in the evening paper of russians and japs slaughtered by the deadly linotype for dinner there would be pot roast a salad flavored with a dressing warranted not to crack or injure the leather stewed rhubarb and the bottle of strawberry marmalade blushing at the certificate of chemical purity on its label after dinner katy would show him the new patch in her crazy quilt that the iceman had cut for her off the end of his fourinhand at halfpast seven they would spread newspapers over the furniture to catch the pieces of plastering that fell when the fat man in the flat overhead began to take his physical culture exercises exactly at eight hickey  mooney of the vaudeville team unbooked in the flat across the hall would yield to the gentle influence of delirium tremens and begin to overturn chairs under the delusion that hammerstein was pursuing them with a fivehundreddollaraweek contract then the gent at the window across the airshaft would get out his flute the nightly gas leak would steal forth to frolic in the highways the dumbwaiter would slip off its trolley the janitor would drive mrs zanowitskis five children once more across the yalu the lady with the champagne shoes and the skye terrier would trip downstairs and paste her thursday name over her bell and letterboxand the evening routine of the frogmore flats would be under way  john perkins knew these things would happen and he knew that at a quarter past eight he would summon his nerve and reach for his hat and that his wife would deliver this speech in a querulous tone  now where are you going id like to know john perkins  thought id drop up to mccloskeys he would answer and play a game or two of pool with the fellows  of late such had been john perkinss habit at ten or eleven he would return sometimes katy would be asleep sometimes waiting up ready to melt in the crucible of her ire a little more gold plating from the wrought steel chains of matrimony for these things cupid will have to answer when he stands at the bar of justice with his victims from the frogmore flats  tonight john perkins encountered a tremendous upheaval of the commonplace when he reached his door no katy was there with her affectionate confectionate kiss the three rooms seemed in portentous disorder all about lay her things in confusion shoes in the middle of the floor curling tongs hair bows kimonos powder box jumbled together on dresser and chairsthis was not katys way with a sinking heart john saw the comb with a curling cloud of her brown hair among its teeth some unusual hurry and perturbation must have possessed her for she always carefully placed these combings in the little blue vase on the mantel to be some day formed into the coveted feminine rat  hanging conspicuously to the gas jet by a string was a folded paper john seized it it was a note from his wife running thus      dear john i just had a telegram saying mother is very sick    i am going to take the 430 train brother sam is going to meet    me at the depot there there is cold mutton in the ice box i    hope it isnt her quinzy again pay the milkman 50 cents she    had it bad last spring dont forget to write to the company    about the gas meter and your good socks are in the top drawer    i will write tomorrow     hastily               katy   never during their two years of matrimony had he and katy been separated for a night john read the note over and over in a dumbfounded way here was a break in a routine that had never varied and it left him dazed  there on the back of a chair hung pathetically empty and formless the red wrapper with black dots that she always wore while getting the meals her weekday clothes had been tossed here and there in her haste a little paper bag of her favorite butterscotch lay with its string yet unwound a daily paper sprawled on the floor gaping rectangularly where a railroad timetable had been clipped from it everything in the room spoke of a loss of an essence gone of its soul and life departed john perkins stood among the dead remains with a queer feeling of desolation in his heart  he began to set the rooms tidy as well as he could when he touched her clothes a thrill of something like terror went through him he had never thought what existence would be without katy she had become so thoroughly annealed into his life that she was like the air he breathednecessary but scarcely noticed now without warning she was gone vanished as completely absent as if she had never existed of course it would be only for a few days or at most a week or two but it seemed to him as if the very hand of death had pointed a finger at his secure and uneventful home  john dragged the cold mutton from the icebox made coffee and sat down to a lonely meal face to face with the strawberry marmalades shameless certificate of purity bright among withdrawn blessings now appeared to him the ghosts of pot roasts and the salad with tan polish dressing his home was dismantled a quinzied motherinlaw had knocked his lares and penates skyhigh after his solitary meal john sat at a front window  he did not care to smoke outside the city roared to him to come join in its dance of folly and pleasure the night was his he might go forth unquestioned and thrum the strings of jollity as free as any gay bachelor there he might carouse and wander and have his fling until dawn if he liked and there would be no wrathful katy waiting for him bearing the chalice that held the dregs of his joy he might play pool at mccloskeys with his roistering friends until aurora dimmed the electric bulbs if he chose the hymeneal strings that had curbed him always when the frogmore flats had palled upon him were loosened katy was gone  john perkins was not accustomed to analyzing his emotions but as he sat in his katybereft 10x12 parlor he hit unerringly upon the keynote of his discomfort he knew now that katy was necessary to his happiness his feeling for her lulled into unconsciousness by the dull round of domesticity had been sharply stirred by the loss of her presence has it not been dinned into us by proverb and sermon and fable that we never prize the music till the sweetvoiced bird has flownor in other no less florid and true utterances  im a doubledyed dub mused john perkins the way ive been treating katy off every night playing pool and bumming with the boys instead of staying home with her the poor girl here all alone with nothing to amuse her and me acting that way john perkins youre the worst kind of a shine im going to make it up for the little girl ill take her out and let her see some amusement and ill cut out the mccloskey gang right from this minute  yes there was the city roaring outside for john perkins to come dance in the train of momus and at mccloskeys the boys were knocking the balls idly into the pockets against the hour for the nightly game but no primrose way nor clicking cue could woo the remorseful soul of perkins the bereft the thing that was his lightly held and half scorned had been taken away from him and he wanted it backward to a certain man named adam whom the cherubim bounced from the orchard could perkins the remorseful trace his descent  near the right hand of john perkins stood a chair on the back of it stood katys blue shirtwaist it still retained something of her contour midway of the sleeves were fine individual wrinkles made by the movements of her arms in working for his comfort and pleasure a delicate but impelling odor of bluebells came from it john took it and looked long and soberly at the unresponsive grenadine katy had never been unresponsive tearsyes tearscame into john perkinss eyes when she came back things would be different he would make up for all his neglect what was life without her  the door opened katy walked in carrying a little hand satchel john stared at her stupidly  my im glad to get back said katy ma wasnt sick to amount to anything sam was at the depot and said she just had a little spell and got all right soon after they telegraphed so i took the next train back im just dying for a cup of coffee  nobody heard the click and rattle of the cogwheels as the thirdfloor front of the frogmore flats buzzed its machinery back into the order of things a band slipped a spring was touched the gear was adjusted and the wheels revolve in their old orbit  john perkins looked at the clock it was 815 he reached for his hat and walked to the door  now where are you going id like to know john perkins asked katy in a querulous tone  thought id drop up to mccloskeys said john and play a game or two of pool with the fellows     two thanksgiving day gentlemen   there is one day that is ours there is one day when all we americans who are not selfmade go back to the old home to eat saleratus biscuits and marvel how much nearer to the porch the old pump looks than it used to bless the day president roosevelt gives it to us we hear some talk of the puritans but dont just remember who they were bet we can lick em anyhow if they try to land again plymouth rocks well that sounds more familiar lots of us have had to come down to hens since the turkey trust got its work in but somebody in washington is leaking out advance information to em about these thanksgiving proclamations  the big city east of the cranberry bogs has made thanksgiving day an institution the last thursday in november is the only day in the year on which it recognizes the part of america lying across the ferries it is the one day that is purely american yes a day of celebration exclusively american  and now for the story which is to prove to you that we have traditions on this side of the ocean that are becoming older at a much rapider rate than those of england arethanks to our gitup and enterprise  stuffy pete took his seat on the third bench to the right as you enter union square from the east at the walk opposite the fountain every thanksgiving day for nine years he had taken his seat there promptly at 1 oclock for every time he had done so things had happened to himcharles dickensy things that swelled his waistcoat above his heart and equally on the other side  but today stuffy petes appearance at the annual trysting place seemed to have been rather the result of habit than of the yearly hunger which as the philanthropists seem to think afflicts the poor at such extended intervals  certainly pete was not hungry he had just come from a feast that had left him of his powers barely those of respiration and locomotion his eyes were like two pale gooseberries firmly imbedded in a swollen and gravysmeared mask of putty his breath came in short wheezes a senatorial roll of adipose tissue denied a fashionable set to his upturned coat collar buttons that had been sewed upon his clothes by kind salvation fingers a week before flew like popcorn strewing the earth around him ragged he was with a split shirt front open to the wishbone but the november breeze carrying fine snowflakes brought him only a grateful coolness for stuffy pete was overcharged with the caloric produced by a superbountiful dinner beginning with oysters and ending with plum pudding and including it seemed to him all the roast turkey and baked potatoes and chicken salad and squash pie and ice cream in the world wherefore he sat gorged and gazed upon the world with afterdinner contempt  the meal had been an unexpected one he was passing a red brick mansion near the beginning of fifth avenue in which lived two old ladies of ancient family and a reverence for traditions they even denied the existence of new york and believed that thanksgiving day was declared solely for washington square one of their traditional habits was to station a servant at the postern gate with orders to admit the first hungry wayfarer that came along after the hour of noon had struck and banquet him to a finish stuffy pete happened to pass by on his way to the park and the seneschals gathered him in and upheld the custom of the castle  after stuffy pete had gazed straight before him for ten minutes he was conscious of a desire for a more varied field of vision with a tremendous effort he moved his head slowly to the left and then his eyes bulged out fearfully and his breath ceased and the roughshod ends of his short legs wriggled and rustled on the gravel  for the old gentleman was coming across fourth avenue toward his bench  every thanksgiving day for nine years the old gentleman had come there and found stuffy pete on his bench that was a thing that the old gentleman was trying to make a tradition of every thanksgiving day for nine years he had found stuffy there and had led him to a restaurant and watched him eat a big dinner they do those things in england unconsciously but this is a young country and nine years is not so bad the old gentleman was a staunch american patriot and considered himself a pioneer in american tradition in order to become picturesque we must keep on doing one thing for a long time without ever letting it get away from us something like collecting the weekly dimes in industrial insurance or cleaning the streets  the old gentleman moved straight and stately toward the institution that he was rearing truly the annual feeding of stuffy pete was nothing national in its character such as the magna charta or jam for breakfast was in england but it was a step it was almost feudal it showed at least that a custom was not impossible to new yahemamerica  the old gentleman was thin and tall and sixty he was dressed all in black and wore the oldfashioned kind of glasses that wont stay on your nose his hair was whiter and thinner than it had been last year and he seemed to make more use of his big knobby cane with the crooked handle  as his established benefactor came up stuffy wheezed and shuddered like some womans overfat pug when a street dog bristles up at him he would have flown but all the skill of santosdumont could not have separated him from his bench well had the myrmidons of the two old ladies done their work  good morning said the old gentleman i am glad to perceive that the vicissitudes of another year have spared you to move in health about the beautiful world for that blessing alone this day of thanksgiving is well proclaimed to each of us if you will come with me my man i will provide you with a dinner that should make your physical being accord with the mental  that is what the old gentleman said every time every thanksgiving day for nine years the words themselves almost formed an institution nothing could be compared with them except the declaration of independence always before they had been music in stuffys ears but now he looked up at the old gentlemans face with tearful agony in his own the fine snow almost sizzled when it fell upon his perspiring brow but the old gentleman shivered a little and turned his back to the wind  stuffy had always wondered why the old gentleman spoke his speech rather sadly he did not know that it was because he was wishing every time that he had a son to succeed him a son who would come there after he was gonea son who would stand proud and strong before some subsequent stuffy and say in memory of my father then it would be an institution  but the old gentleman had no relatives he lived in rented rooms in one of the decayed old family brownstone mansions in one of the quiet streets east of the park in the winter he raised fuchsias in a little conservatory the size of a steamer trunk in the spring he walked in the easter parade in the summer he lived at a farmhouse in the new jersey hills and sat in a wicker armchair speaking of a butterfly the ornithoptera amphrisius that he hoped to find some day in the autumn he fed stuffy a dinner these were the old gentlemans occupations  stuffy pete looked up at him for a half minute stewing and helpless in his own selfpity the old gentlemans eyes were bright with the givingpleasure his face was getting more lined each year but his little black necktie was in as jaunty a bow as ever and the linen was beautiful and white and his gray mustache was curled carefully at the ends and then stuffy made a noise that sounded like peas bubbling in a pot speech was intended and as the old gentleman had heard the sounds nine times before he rightly construed them into stuffys old formula of acceptance  thankee sir ill go with ye and much obliged im very hungry sir  the coma of repletion had not prevented from entering stuffys mind the conviction that he was the basis of an institution his thanksgiving appetite was not his own it belonged by all the sacred rights of established custom if not by the actual statute of limitations to this kind old gentleman who bad preempted it true america is free but in order to establish tradition some one must be a repetenda repeating decimal the heroes are not all heroes of steel and gold see one here that wielded only weapons of iron badly silvered and tin  the old gentleman led his annual protege southward to the restaurant and to the table where the feast had always occurred they were recognized  here comes de old guy said a waiter dat blows dat same bum to a meal every thanksgiving  the old gentleman sat across the table glowing like a smoked pearl at his cornerstone of future ancient tradition the waiters heaped the table with holiday foodand stuffy with a sigh that was mistaken for hungers expression raised knife and fork and carved for himself a crown of imperishable bay  no more valiant hero ever fought his way through the ranks of an enemy turkey chops soups vegetables pies disappeared before him as fast as they could be served gorged nearly to the uttermost when he entered the restaurant the smell of food had almost caused him to lose his honor as a gentleman but he rallied like a true knight he saw the look of beneficent happiness on the old gentlemans facea happier look than even the fuchsias and the ornithoptera amphrisius had ever brought to itand he had not the heart to see it wane  in an hour stuffy leaned back with a battle won thankee kindly sir he puffed like a leaky steam pipe thankee kindly for a hearty meal then he arose heavily with glazed eyes and started toward the kitchen a waiter turned him about like a top and pointed him toward the door the old gentleman carefully counted out 130 in silver change leaving three nickels for the waiter  they parted as they did each year at the door the old gentleman going south stuffy north  around the first corner stuffy turned and stood for one minute then he seemed to puff out his rags as an owl puffs out his feathers and fell to the sidewalk like a sunstricken horse  when the ambulance came the young surgeon and the driver cursed softly at his weight there was no smell of whiskey to justify a transfer to the patrol wagon so stuffy and his two dinners went to the hospital there they stretched him on a bed and began to test him for strange diseases with the hope of getting a chance at some problem with the bare steel  and lo an hour later another ambulance brought the old gentleman and they laid him on another bed and spoke of appendicitis for he looked good for the bill  but pretty soon one of the young doctors met one of the young nurses whose eyes he liked and stopped to chat with her about the cases  that nice old gentleman over there now he said you wouldnt think that was a case of almost starvation proud old family i guess he told me he hadnt eaten a thing for three days     the assessor of success   hastings beauchamp morley sauntered across union square with a pitying look at the hundreds that lolled upon the park benches they were a motley lot he thought the men with stolid animal unshaven faces the women wriggling and selfconscious twining and untwining their feet that hung four inches above the gravelled walks  were i mr carnegie or mr rockefeller i would put a few millions in my inside pocket and make an appointment with all the park commissioners around the corner if necessary and arrange for benches in all the parks of the world low enough for women to sit upon and rest their feet upon the ground after that i might furnish libraries to towns that would pay for em or build sanitariums for crank professors and call em colleges if i wanted to  womens rights societies have been laboring for many years after equality with man with what result when they sit on a bench they must twist their ankles together and uncomfortably swing their highest french heels clear of earthly support begin at the bottom ladies get your feet on the ground and then rise to theories of mental equality  hastings beauchamp morley was carefully and neatly dressed that was the result of an instinct due to his birth and breeding it is denied us to look further into a mans bosom than the starch on his shirt front so it is left to us only to recount his walks and conversation  morley had not a cent in his pockets but he smiled pityingly at a hundred grimy unfortunate ones who had no more and who would have no more when the suns first rays yellowed the tall papercutter building on the west side of the square but morley would have enough by then sundown had seen his pockets empty before but sunrise had always seen them lined  first he went to the house of a clergyman off madison avenue and presented a forged letter of introduction that holily purported to issue from a pastorate in indiana this netted him 5 when backed up by a realistic romance of a delayed remittance  on the sidewalk twenty steps from the clergymans door a palefaced fat man huskily enveloped him with a raised red fist and the voice of a bell buoy demanding payment of an old score  why bergman man sang morley dulcetly is this you i was just on my way up to your place to settle up that remittance from my aunt arrived only this morning wrong address was the trouble come up to the corner and ill square up glad to see you saves me a walk  four drinks placated the emotional bergman there was an air about morley when he was backed by money in hand that would have stayed off a call loan at rothschilds when he was penniless his bluff was pitched half a tone lower but few are competent to detect the difference in the notes  you gum to mine blace and bay me tomorrow mr morley said bergman oxcuse me dat i dun you on der street but i haf not seen you in dree mont prost  morley walked away with a crooked smile on his pale smooth face the credulous drinksoftened german amused him he would have to avoid twentyninth street in the future he had not been aware that bergman ever went home by that route  at the door of a darkened house two squares to the north morley knocked with a peculiar sequence of raps the door opened to the length of a sixinch chain and the pompous important black face of an african guardian imposed itself in the opening morley was admitted  in a thirdstory room in an atmosphere opaque with smoke he hung for ten minutes above a roulette wheel then downstairs he crept and was outsped by the important negro jingling in his pocket the 40 cents in silver that remained to him of his fivedollar capital at the corner he lingered undecided  across the street was a drug store well lighted sending forth gleams from the german silver and crystal of its soda fountain and glasses along came a youngster of five headed for the dispensary stepping high with the consequence of a big errand possibly one to which his advancing age had earned him promotion in his hand he clutched something tightly publicly proudly conspicuously  morley stopped him with his winning smile and soft speech  me said the youngster im doin to the drug tore for mamma she dave me a dollar to buy a bottle of medcin  now now now said morley such a big man you are to be doing errands for mamma i must go along with my little man to see that the cars dont run over him and on the way well have some chocolates or would he rather have lemon drops  morley entered the drug store leading the child by the hand he presented the prescription that had been wrapped around the money  on his face was a smile predatory parental politic profound  aqua pura one pint said he to the druggist sodium chloride ten grains fiat solution and dont try to skin me because i know all about the number of gallons of h2o in the croton reservoir and i always use the other ingredient on my potatoes  fifteen cents said the druggist with a wink after he had compounded the order i see you understand pharmacy a dollar is the regular price  to gulls said morley smilingly  he settled the wrapped bottle carefully in the childs arms and escorted him to the corner in his own pocket he dropped the 85 cents accruing to him by virtue of his chemical knowledge  look out for the cars sonny he said cheerfully to his small victim  two street cars suddenly swooped in opposite directions upon the youngster morley dashed between them and pinned the infantile messenger by the neck holding him in safety then from the corner of his street he sent him on his way swindled happy and sticky with vile cheap candy from the italians fruit stand  morley went to a restaurant and ordered a sirloin and a pint of inexpensive chateau breuille he laughed noiselessly but so genuinely that the waiter ventured to premise that good news had come his way  why no said morley who seldom held conversation with any one it is not that it is something else that amuses me do you know what three divisions of people are easiest to overreach in transactions of all kinds  sure said the waiter calculating the size of the tip promised by the careful knot of morleys tie theres the buyers from the dry goods stores in the south during august and honeymooners from staten island and  wrong said morley chuckling happily the answer is justmen women and children the worldwell say new york and as far as summer boarders can swim out from long islandis full of greenhorns two minutes longer on the broiler would have made this steak fit to be eaten by a gentleman francois  if yez tinks its on de bum said the waiter oill  morley lifted his hand in protestslightly martyred protest  it will do he said magnanimously and now green chartreuse frappe and a demitasse  morley went out leisurely and stood on a corner where two tradeful arteries of the city cross with a solitary dime in his pocket he stood on the curb watching with confident cynical smiling eyes the tides of people that flowed past him into that stream he must cast his net and draw fish for his further sustenance and need good izaak walton had not the half of his selfreliance and baitlore  a joyful party of fourtwo women and two menfell upon him with cries of delight there was a dinner party onwhere had he been for a fortnight pastwhat luck to thus run upon him they surrounded and engulfed himhe must join themtra la laand the rest  one with a white hat plume curving to the shoulder touched his sleeve and cast at the others a triumphant look that said see what i can do with him and added her queens command to the invitations  i leave you to imagine said morley pathetically how it desolates me to forego the pleasure but my friend carruthers of the new york yacht club is to pick me up here in his motor car at 8  the white plume tossed and the quartet danced like midges around an arc light down the frolicsome way  morley stood turning over and over the dime in his pocket and laughing gleefully to himself front he chanted under his breath front does it it is trumps in the game how they take it in men women and childrenforgeries waterandsalt lieshow they all take it in  an old man with an illfitting suit a straggling gray beard and a corpulent umbrella hopped from the conglomeration of cabs and street cars to the sidewalk at morleys side  stranger said he excuse me for troubling you but do you know anybody in this here town named solomon smothers hes my son and ive come down from ellenville to visit him be darned if i know what i done with his street and number  i do not sir said morley half closing his eyes to veil the joy in them you had better apply to the police  the police said the old man i aint done nothin to call in the police about i just come down to see ben he lives in a fivestory house he writes me if you know anybody by that name and could  i told you i did not said morley coldly i know no one by the name of smithers and i advise you to  smothers not smithers interrupted the old man hopefully a heavyset man sandy complected about twentynine two front teeth out about five foot  oh smothers exclaimed morley sol smothers why he lives in the next house to me i thought you said smithers  morley looked at his watch you must have a watch you can do it for a dollar better go hungry than forego a gunmetal or the ninetyeightcent one that the railroadsaccording to these watchmakersare run by  the bishop of long island said morley was to meet me here at 8 to dine with me at the kingfishers club but i cant leave the father of my friend sol smothers alone on the street by st swithin mr smothers we wall street men have to work tired is no name for it i was about to step across to the other corner and have a glass of ginger ale with a dash of sherry when you approached me you must let me take you to sols house mr smothers but before we take the car i hope you will join me in  an hour later morley seated himself on the end of a quiet bench in madison square with a twentyfivecent cigar between his lips and 140 in deeply creased bills in his inside pocket content lighthearted ironical keenly philosophic he watched the moon drifting in and out amidst a maze of flying clouds an old ragged man with a lowbowed head sat at the other end of the bench  presently the old man stirred and looked at his bench companion in morleys appearance he seemed to recognize something superior to the usual nightly occupants of the benches  kind sir he whined if you could spare a dime or even a few pennies to one who  morley cut short his stereotyped appeal by throwing him a dollar  god bless you said the old man ive been trying to find work for  work echoed morley with his ringing laugh you are a fool my friend the world is a rock to you no doubt but you must be an aaron and smite it with your rod then things better than water will gush out of it for you that is what the world is for it gives to me whatever i want from it  god has blessed you said the old man it is only work that i have known and now i can get no more  i must go home said morley rising and buttoning his coat i stopped here only for a smoke i hope you may find work  may your kindness be rewarded this night said the old man  oh said morley you have your wish already i am satisfied i think good luck follows me like a dog i am for yonder bright hotel across the square for the night and what a moon that is lighting up the city tonight i think no one enjoys the moonlight and such little things as i do well a goodnight to you  morley walked to the corner where he would cross to his hotel he blew slow streams of smoke from his cigar heavenward a policeman passing saluted to his benign nod what a fine moon it was  the clock struck nine as a girl just entering womanhood stopped on the corner waiting for the approaching car she was hurrying as if homeward from employment or delay her eyes were clear and pure she was dressed in simple white she looked eagerly for the car and neither to the right nor the left  morley knew her eight years before he had sat on the same bench with her at school there had been no sentiment between themnothing but the friendship of innocent days  but he turned down the side street to a quiet spot and laid his suddenly burning face against the cool iron of a lamppost and said dully  god i wish i could die     the buyer from cactus city   it is well that hay fever and colds do not obtain in the healthful vicinity of cactus city texas for the dry goods emporium of navarro  platt situated there is not to be sneezed at  twenty thousand people in cactus city scatter their silver coin with liberal hands for the things that their hearts desire the bulk of this semiprecious metal goes to navarro  platt their huge brick building covers enough ground to graze a dozen head of sheep you can buy of them a rattlesnakeskin necktie an automobile or an eightyfive dollar latest style ladies tan coat in twenty different shades navarro  platt first introduced pennies west of the colorado river they had been ranchmen with business heads who saw that the world did not necessarily have to cease its revolutions after free grass went out  every spring navarro senior partner fiftyfive half spanish cosmopolitan able polished had gone on to new york to buy goods this year he shied at taking up the long trail he was undoubtedly growing older and he looked at his watch several times a day before the hour came for his siesta  john he said to his junior partner you shall go on this year to buy the goods  platt looked tired  im told said he that new york is a plumb dead town but ill go i can take a whirl in san antone for a few days on my way and have some fun  two weeks later a man in a texas full dress suitblack frock coat broadbrimmed soft white hat and laydown collar 34 inch high with black wrought iron necktieentered the wholesale cloak and suit establishment of zizzbaum  son on lower broadway  old zizzbaum had the eye of an osprey the memory of an elephant and a mind that unfolded from him in three movements like the puzzle of the carpenters rule he rolled to the front like a brunette polar bear and shook platts hand  and how is the good mr navarro in texas he said the trip was too long for him this year so we welcome mr platt instead  a bulls eye said platt and id give forty acres of unirrigated pecos county land to know how you did it  i knew grinned zizzbaum just as i know that the rainfall in el paso for the year was 285 inches or an increase of 15 inches and that therefore navarro  platt will buy a 15000 stock of suits this spring instead of 10000 as in a dry year but that will be tomorrow there is first a cigar in my private office that will remove from your mouth the taste of the ones you smuggle across the rio grande and likebecause they are smuggled  it was late in the afternoon and business for the day had ended zizzbaum left platt with a halfsmoked cigar and came out of the private office to son who was arranging his diamond scarfpin before a mirror ready to leave  abey he said you will have to take mr platt around tonight and show him things they are customers for ten years mr navarro and i we played chess every moment of spare time when he came that is good but mr platt is a young man and this is his first visit to new york he should amuse easily  all right said abey screwing the guard tightly on his pin ill take him on after hes seen the flatiron and the head waiter at the hotel astor and heard the phonograph play under the old apple tree itll be half past ten and mr texas will be ready to roll up in his blanket ive got a supper engagement at 1130 but hell be all to the mrs winslow before then  the next morning at 10 platt walked into the store ready to do business he had a bunch of hyacinths pinned on his lapel zizzbaum himself waited on him navarro  platt were good customers and never failed to take their discount for cash  and what did you think of our little town asked zizzbaum with the fatuous smile of the manhattanite  i shouldnt care to live in it said the texan your son and i knocked around quite a little last night youve got good water but cactus city is better lit up  weve got a few lights on broadway dont you think mr platt  and a good many shadows said platt i think i like your horses best i havent seen a crowbait since ive been in town  zizzbaum led him up stairs to show the samples of suits  ask miss asher to come he said to a clerk  miss asher came and platt of navarro  platt felt for the first time the wonderful bright light of romance and glory descend upon him he stood still as a granite cliff above the cañon of the colorado with his wideopen eyes fixed upon her she noticed his look and flushed a little which was contrary to her custom  miss asher was the crack model of zizzbaum  son she was of the blond type known as medium and her measurements even went the required 382542 standard a little better she had been at zizzbaums two years and knew her business her eye was bright but cool and had she chosen to match her gaze against the optic of the famed basilisk that fabulous monsters gaze would have wavered and softened first incidentally she knew buyers  now mr platt said zizzbaum i want you to see these princess gowns in the light shades they will be the thing in your climate this first if you please miss asher  swiftly in and out of the dressingroom the prize model flew each time wearing a new costume and looking more stunning with every change she posed with absolute selfpossession before the stricken buyer who stood tonguetied and motionless while zizzbaum orated oilily of the styles on the models face was her faint impersonal professional smile that seemed to cover something like weariness or contempt  when the display was over platt seemed to hesitate zizzbaum was a little anxious thinking that his customer might be inclined to try elsewhere but platt was only looking over in his mind the best building sites in cactus city trying to select one on which to build a house for his wifetobewho was just then in the dressingroom taking off an evening gown of lavender and tulle  take your time mr platt said zizzbaum think it over tonight you wont find anybody else meet our prices on goods like these im afraid youre having a dull time in new york mr platt a young man like youof course you miss the society of the ladies wouldnt you like a nice young lady to take out to dinner this evening miss asher now is a very nice young lady she will make it agreeable for you  why she doesnt know me said platt wonderingly she doesnt know anything about me would she go im not acquainted with her  would she go repeated zizzbaum with uplifted eyebrows sure she would go i will introduce you sure she would go  he called miss asher loudly  she came calm and slightly contemptuous in her white shirt waist and plain black skirt  mr platt would like the pleasure of your company to dinner this evening said zizzbaum walking away  sure said miss asher looking at the ceiling id be much pleased nineeleven west twentieth street what time  say seven oclock  all right but please dont come ahead of time i room with a school teacher and she doesnt allow any gentlemen to call in the room there isnt any parlor so youll have to wait in the hall ill be ready  at half past seven platt and miss asher sat at a table in a broadway restaurant she was dressed in a plain filmy black platt didnt know that it was all a part of her days work  with the unobtrusive aid of a good waiter he managed to order a respectable dinner minus the usual broadway preliminaries  miss asher flashed upon him a dazzling smile  maynt i have something to drink she asked  why certainly said platt anything you want  a dry martini she said to the waiter  when it was brought and set before her platt reached over and took it away  what is this he asked  a cocktail of course  i thought it was some kind of tea you ordered this is liquor you cant drink this what is your first name  to my intimate friends said miss asher freezingly it is helen  listen helen said platt leaning over the table for many years every time the spring flowers blossomed out on the prairies i got to thinking of somebody that id never seen or heard of i knew it was you the minute i saw you yesterday im going back home tomorrow and youre going with me i know it for i saw it in your eyes when you first looked at me you neednt kick for youve got to fall into line heres a little trick i picked out for you on my way over  he flicked a twocarat diamond solitaire ring across the table miss asher flipped it back to him with her fork  dont get fresh she said severely  im worth a hundred thousand dollars said platt ill build you the finest house in west texas  you cant buy me mr buyer said miss asher if you had a hundred million i didnt think id have to call you down you didnt look like the others to me at first but i see youre all alike  all who asked platt  all you buyers you think because we girls have to go out to dinner with you or lose our jobs that youre privileged to say what you please well forget it i thought you were different from the others but i see i was mistaken  platt struck his fingers on the table with a gesture of sudden illuminating satisfaction  ive got it he exclaimed almost hilariouslythe nicholson place over on the north side theres a big grove of live oaks and a natural lake the old house can be pulled down and the new one set further back  put out your pipe said miss asher im sorry to wake you up but you fellows might as well get wise once for all to where you stand im supposed to go to dinner with you and help jolly you along so youll trade with old zizzy but dont expect to find me in any of the suits you buy  do you mean to tell me said platt that you go out this way with customers and they allthey all talk to you like i have  they all make plays said miss asher but i must say that youve got em beat in one respect they generally talk diamonds while youve actually dug one up  how long have you been working helen  got my name pat havent you ive been supporting myself for eight years i was a cash girl and a wrapper and then a shop girl until i was grown and then i got to be a suit model mr texas man dont you think a little wine would make this dinner a little less dry  youre not going to drink wine any more dear its awful to think how ill come to the store tomorrow and get you i want you to pick out an automobile before we leave thats all we need to buy here  oh cut that out if you knew how sick i am of hearing such talk  after the dinner they walked down broadway and came upon dianas little wooded park the trees caught platts eye at once and he must turn along under the winding walk beneath them the lights shone upon two bright tears in the models eyes  i dont like that said platt whats the matter  dont you mind said miss asher well its becausewell i didnt think you were that kind when i first saw you but you are all like and now will you take me home or will i have to call a cop  platt took her to the door of her boardinghouse they stood for a minute in the vestibule she looked at him with such scorn in her eyes that even his heart of oak began to waver his arm was half way around her waist when she struck him a stinging blow on the face with her open hand  as he stepped back a ring fell from somewhere and bounded on the tiled floor platt groped for it and found it  now take your useless diamond and go mr buyer she said  this was the other onethe wedding ring said the texan holding the smooth gold band on the palm of his hand  miss ashers eyes blazed upon him in the half darkness  was that what you meantdid you  somebody opened the door from inside the house  goodnight said platt ill see you at the store tomorrow  miss asher ran up to her room and shook the school teacher until she sat up in bed ready to scream fire  where is it she cried  thats what i want to know said the model youve studied geography emma and you ought to know where is a town called caccaccaraccaracas city i think they called it  how dare you wake me up for that said the school teacher caracas is in venezuela of course  whats it like  why its principally earthquakes and negroes and monkeys and malarial fever and volcanoes  i dont care said miss asher blithely im going there tomorrow     the badge of policeman oroon   it cannot be denied that men and women have looked upon one another for the first time and become instantly enamored it is a risky process this love at first sight before she has seen him in bradstreet or he has seen her in curl papers but these things do happen and one instance must form a theme for this storythough not thank heaven to the overshadowing of more vital and important subjects such as drink policemen horses and earldoms  during a certain war a troop calling itself the gentle riders rode into history and one or two ambuscades the gentle riders were recruited from the aristocracy of the wild men of the west and the wild men of the aristocracy of the east in khaki there is little telling them one from another so they became good friends and comrades all around  ellsworth remsen whose old knickerbocker descent atoned for his modest rating at only ten millions ate his canned beef gayly by the campfires of the gentle riders the war was a great lark to him so that he scarcely regretted polo and planked shad  one of the troopers was a well set up affable cool young man who called himself oroon to this young man remsen took an especial liking the two rode side by side during the famous mooted uphill charge that was disputed so hotly at the time by the spaniards and afterward by the democrats  after the war remsen came back to his polo and shad one day a well set up affable cool young man disturbed him at his club and he and oroon were soon pounding each other and exchanging opprobrious epithets after the manner of longlost friends oroon looked seedy and out of luck and perfectly contented but it seemed that his content was only apparent  get me a job remsen he said ive just handed a barber my last shilling  no trouble at all said remsen i know a lot of men who have banks and stores and things downtown any particular line you fancy  yes said oroon with a look of interest i took a walk in your central park this morning id like to be one of those bobbies on horseback that would be about the ticket besides its the only thing i could do i can ride a little and the fresh air suits me think you could land that for me  remsen was sure that he could and in a very short time he did and they who were not above looking at mounted policemen might have seen a well set up affable cool young man on a prancing chestnut steed attending to his duties along the driveways of the park  and now at the extreme risk of wearying old gentlemen who carry leather fob chains and elderly ladies whobut no grandmother herself yet thrills at foolish immortal romeothere must be a hint of love at first sight  it came just as remsen was strolling into fifth avenue from his club a few doors away  a motor car was creeping along foot by foot impeded by a freshet of vehicles that filled the street in the car was a chauffeur and an old gentleman with snowy side whiskers and a scotch plaid cap which could not be worn while automobiling except by a personage not even a wine agent would dare do it but these two were of no consequenceexcept perhaps for the guiding of the machine and the paying for it at the old gentlemans side sat a young lady more beautiful than pomegranate blossoms more exquisite than the first quarter moon viewed at twilight through the tops of oleanders remsen saw her and knew his fate he could have flung himself under the very wheels that conveyed her but he knew that would be the last means of attracting the attention of those who ride in motor cars slowly the auto passed and if we place the poets above the autoists carried the heart of remsen with it here was a large city of millions and many women who at a certain distance appear to resemble pomegranate blossoms yet he hoped to see her again for each one fancies that his romance has its own tutelary guardian and divinity  luckily for remsens peace of mind there came a diversion in the guise of a reunion of the gentle riders of the city there were not many of themperhaps a scoreand there was wassail and things to eat and speeches and the spaniard was bearded again in recapitulation and when daylight threatened them the survivors prepared to depart but some remained upon the battlefield one of these was trooper oroon who was not seasoned to potent liquids his legs declined to fulfil the obligations they had sworn to the police department  im stewed remsen said oroon to his friend why do they build hotels that go round and round like catherine wheels theyll take away my shield and break me i can think and talk conconconsecsecsecutively but i ssstammer with my feet ive got to go on duty in three hours the jig is up remsen the jig is up i tell you  look at me said remsen who was his smiling self pointing to his own face whom do you see here  goo fellow said oroon dizzily goo old remsen  not so said remsen you see mounted policeman oroon look at your faceno you cant do that without a glassbut look at mine and think of yours how much alike are we as two french table dhote dinners with your badge on your horse in your uniform will i charm nursemaids and prevent the grass from growing under peoples feet in the park this day i will have your badge and your honor besides having the jolliest lark ive been blessed with since we licked spain  promptly on time the counterfeit presentment of mounted policeman oroon singlefooted into the park on his chestnut steed in a uniform two men who are unlike will look alike two who somewhat resemble each other in feature and figure will appear as twin brothers so remsen trotted down the bridle paths enjoying himself hugely so few real pleasures do tenmillionaires have  along the driveway in the early morning spun a victoria drawn by a pair of fiery bays there was something foreign about the affair for the park is rarely used in the morning except by unimportant people who love to be healthy poor and wise in the vehicle sat an old gentleman with snowy sidewhiskers and a scotch plaid cap which could not be worn while driving except by a personage at his side sat the lady of remsens heartthe lady who looked like pomegranate blossoms and the gibbous moon  remsen met them coming at the instant of their passing her eyes looked into his and but for the ever cowards heart of a true lover he could have sworn that she flushed a faint pink he trotted on for twenty yards and then wheeled his horse at the sound of runaway hoofs the bays had bolted  remsen sent his chestnut after the victoria like a shot there was work cut out for the impersonator of policeman oroon the chestnut ranged alongside the off bay thirty seconds after the chase began rolled his eye back at remsen and said in the only manner open to policemens horses  well you duffer are you going to do your share youre not oroon but it seems to me if youd lean to the right you could reach the reins of that foolish slowrunning bayah youre all right oroon couldnt have done it more neatly  the runaway team was tugged to an inglorious halt by remsens tough muscles the driver released his hands from the wrapped reins jumped from his seat and stood at the heads of the team the chestnut approving his new rider danced and pranced reviling equinely the subdued bays remsen lingering was dimly conscious of a vague impossible unnecessary old gentleman in a scotch cap who talked incessantly about something and he was acutely conscious of a pair of violet eyes that would have drawn saint pyrites from his iron pillaror whatever the allusion isand of the ladys smile and looka little frightened but a look that with the ever coward heart of a true lover he could not yet construe they were asking his name and bestowing upon him wellbred thanks for his heroic deed and the scotch cap was especially babbling and insistent but the eloquent appeal was in the eyes of the lady  a little thrill of satisfaction ran through remsen because he had a name to give which without undue pride was worthy of being spoken in high places and a small fortune which with due pride he could leave at his end without disgrace  he opened his lips to speak and closed them again  who was he mounted policeman oroon the badge and the honor of his comrade were in his hands if ellsworth remsen tenmillionaire and knickerbocker had just rescued pomegranate blossoms and scotch cap from possible death where was policeman oroon off his beat exposed disgraced discharged love had come but before that there had been something that demanded precedencethe fellowship of men on battlefields fighting an alien foe  remsen touched his cap looked between the chestnuts ears and took refuge in vernacularity  dont mention it he said stolidly we policemen are paid to do these things its our duty  and he rode awayrode away cursing noblesse oblige but knowing he could never have done anything else  at the end of the day remsen sent the chestnut to his stable and went to oroons room the policeman was again a well set up affable cool young man who sat by the window smoking cigars  i wish you and the rest of the police force and all badges horses brass buttons and men who cant drink two glasses of brut without getting upset were at the devil said remsen feelingly  oroon smiled with evident satisfaction  good old remsen he said affably i know all about it they trailed me down and cornered me here two hours ago there was a little row at home you know and i cut sticks just to show them i dont believe i told you that my governor was the earl of ardsley funny you should bob against them in the park if you damaged that horse of mine ill never forgive you im going to buy him and take him back with me oh yes and i think my sisterlady angela you knowwants particularly for you to come up to the hotel with me this evening didnt lose my badge did you remsen ive got to turn that in at headquarters when i resign     brickdust row   blinker was displeased a man of less culture and poise and wealth would have sworn but blinker always remembered that he was a gentlemana thing that no gentleman should do so he merely looked bored and sardonic while he rode in a hansom to the center of disturbance which was the broadway office of lawyer oldport who was agent for the blinker estate  i dont see said blinker why i should be always signing confounded papers i am packed and was to have left for the north woods this morning now i must wait until tomorrow morning i hate night trains my best razors are of course at the bottom of some unidentifiable trunk it is a plot to drive me to bay rum and a monologueing thumbhanded barber give me a pen that doesnt scratch i hate pens that scratch  sit down said doublechinned gray lawyer oldport the worst has not been told you oh the hardships of the rich the papers are not yet ready to sign they will be laid before you tomorrow at eleven you will miss another day twice shall the barber tweak the helpless nose of a blinker be thankful that your sorrows do not embrace a haircut  if said blinker rising the act did not involve more signing of papers i would take my business out of your hands at once give me a cigar please  if said lawyer oldport i had cared to see an old friends son gulped down at one mouthful by sharks i would have ordered you to take it away long ago now lets quit fooling alexander besides the grinding task of signing your name some thirty times tomorrow i must impose upon you the consideration of a matter of businessof business and i may say humanity or right i spoke to you about this five years ago but you would not listenyou were in a hurry for a coaching trip i think the subject has come up again the property  oh property interrupted blinker dear mr oldport i think you mentioned tomorrow lets have it all at one dose tomorrowsignatures and property and snappy rubber bands and that smelly sealingwax and all have luncheon with me well ill try to remember to drop in at eleven tomorrow morning  the blinker wealth was in lands tenements and hereditaments as the legal phrase goes lawyer oldport had once taken alexander in his little pulmonary gasoline runabout to see the many buildings and rows of buildings that he owned in the city for alexander was sole heir they had amused blinker very much the houses looked so incapable of producing the big sums of money that lawyer oldport kept piling up in banks for him to spend  in the evening blinker went to one of his clubs intending to dine nobody was there except some old fogies playing whist who spoke to him with grave politeness and glared at him with savage contempt everybody was out of town but here he was kept in like a schoolboy to write his name over and over on pieces of paper his wounds were deep  blinker turned his back on the fogies and said to the club steward who had come forward with some nonsense about cold fresh salmon roe  symons im going to coney island he said it as one might say alls off im going to jump into the river  the joke pleased symons he laughed within a sixteenth of a note of the audibility permitted by the laws governing employees  certainly sir he tittered of course sir i think i can see you at coney mr blinker  blinker got a pager and looked up the movements of sunday steamboats then he found a cab at the first corner and drove to a north river pier he stood in line as democratic as you or i and bought a ticket and was trampled upon and shoved forward until at last he found himself on the upper deck of the boat staring brazenly at a girl who sat alone upon a camp stool but blinker did not intend to be brazen the girl was so wonderfully good looking that he forgot for one minute that he was the prince incog and behaved just as he did in society  she was looking at him too and not severely a puff of wind threatened blinkers straw hat he caught it warily and settled it again the movement gave the effect of a bow the girl nodded and smiled and in another instant he was seated at her side she was dressed all in white she was paler than blinker imagined milkmaids and girls of humble stations to be but she was as tidy as a cherry blossom and her steady supremely frank gray eyes looked out from the intrepid depths of an unshadowed and untroubled soul  how dare you raise your hat to me she asked with a smileredeemed severity  i didnt blinker said but he quickly covered the mistake by extending it to i didnt know how to keep from it after i saw you  i do not allow gentlemen to sit by me to whom i have not been introduced she said with a sudden haughtiness that deceived him he rose reluctantly but her clear teasing laugh brought him down to his chair again  i guess you werent going far she declared with beautys magnificent selfconfidence  are you going to coney island asked blinker  me she turned upon him wideopen eyes full of bantering surprise why what a question cant you see that im riding a bicycle in the park her drollery took the form of impertinence  and i am laying brick on a tall factory chimney said blinker maynt we see coney together im all alone and ive never been there before it depends said the girl on how nicely you behave ill consider your application until we get there  blinker took pains to provide against the rejection of his application he strove to please to adopt the metaphor of his nonsensical phrase he laid brick upon brick on the tall chimney of his devoirs until at length the structure was stable and complete the manners of the best society come around finally to simplicity and as the girls way was that naturally they were on a mutual plane of communication from the beginning  he learned that she was twenty and her name was florence that she trimmed hats in a millinery shop that she lived in a furnished room with her best chum ella who was cashier in a shoe store and that a glass of milk from the bottle on the windowsill and an egg that boils itself while you twist up your hair makes a breakfast good enough for any one florence laughed when she heard blinker  well she said it certainly shows that you have imagination it gives the smiths a chance for a little rest anyhow  they landed at coney and were dashed on the crest of a great human wave of mad pleasureseekers into the walks and avenues of fairyland gone into vaudeville  with a curious eye a critical mind and a fairly withheld judgment blinker considered the temples pagodas and kiosks of popularized delights hoi polloi trampled hustled and crowded him basket parties bumped him sticky children tumbled howling under his feet candying his clothes insolent youths strolling among the booths with hardwon canes under one arm and easily won girls on the other blew defiant smoke from cheap cigars into his face the publicity gentlemen with megaphones each before his own stupendous attraction roared like niagara in his ears music of all kinds that could be tortured from brass reed hide or string fought in the air to gain space for its vibrations against its competitors but what held blinker in awful fascination was the mob the multitude the proletariat shrieking struggling hurrying panting hurling itself in incontinent frenzy with unabashed abandon into the ridiculous sham palaces of trumpery and tinsel pleasures the vulgarity of it its brutal overriding of all the tenets of repression and taste that were held by his caste repelled him strongly  in the midst of his disgust he turned and looked down at florence by his side she was ready with her quick smile and upturned happy eyes as bright and clear as the water in trout pools the eyes were saying that they had the right to be shining and happy for was their owner not with her for the present man her gentleman friend and holder of the keys to the enchanted city of fun  blinker did not read her look accurately but by some miracle he suddenly saw coney aright  he no longer saw a mass of vulgarians seeking gross joys he now looked clearly upon a hundred thousand true idealists their offenses were wiped out counterfeit and false though the garish joys of these spangled temples were he perceived that deep under the gilt surface they offered saving and apposite balm and satisfaction to the restless human heart here at least was the husk of romance the empty but shining casque of chivalry the breathcatching though safeguarded dip and flight of adventure the magic carpet that transports you to the realms of fairyland though its journey be through but a few poor yards of space he no longer saw a rabble but his brothers seeking the ideal there was no magic of poesy here or of art but the glamour of their imagination turned yellow calico into cloth of gold and the megaphones into the silver trumpets of joys heralds  almost humbled blinker rolled up the shirt sleeves of his mind and joined the idealists  you are the lady doctor he said to florence how shall we go about doing this jolly conglomeration of fairy tales incorporated  we will begin there said the princess pointing to a fun pagoda on the edge of the sea and we will take them all in one by one  they caught the eight oclock returning boat and sat filled with pleasant fatigue against the rail in the bow listening to the italians fiddle and harp blinker had thrown off all care the north woods seemed to him an uninhabitable wilderness what a fuss he had made over signing his namepooh he could sign it a hundred times and her name was as pretty as she wasflorence he said it to himself a great many times  as the boat was nearing its pier in the north river a twofunnelled drab foreignlooking seagoing steamer was dropping down toward the bay the boat turned its nose in toward its slip the steamer veered as if to seek midstream and then yawed seemed to increase its speed and struck the coney boat on the side near the stern cutting into it with a terrifying shock and crash  while the six hundred passengers on the boat were mostly tumbling about the decks in a shrieking panic the captain was shouting at the steamer that it should not back off and leave the rent exposed for the water to enter but the steamer tore its way out like a savage sawfish and cleaved its heartless way full speed ahead  the boat began to sink at its stern but moved slowly toward the slip the passengers were a frantic mob unpleasant to behold  blinker held florence tightly until the boat had righted itself she made no sound or sign of fear he stood on a camp stool ripped off the slats above his head and pulled down a number of the life preservers he began to buckle one around florence the rotten canvas split and the fraudulent granulated cork came pouring out in a stream florence caught a handful of it and laughed gleefully  it looks like breakfast food she said take it off theyre no good  she unbuckled it and threw it on the deck she made blinker sit down and sat by his side and put her hand in his whatll you bet we dont reach the pier all right she said and began to hum a song  and now the captain moved among the passengers and compelled order the boat would undoubtedly make her slip he said and ordered the women and children to the bow where they could land first the boat very low in the water at the stern tried gallantly to make his promise good  florence said blinker as she held him close by an arm and hand i love you  thats what they all say she replied lightly  i am not one of they all he persisted i never knew any one i could love before i could pass my life with you and be happy every day i am rich i can make things all right for you  thats what they all say said the girl again weaving the words into her little reckless song  dont say that again said blinker in a tone that made her look at him in frank surprise  why shouldnt i say it she asked calmly they all do  who are they he asked jealous for the first time in his existence  why the fellows i know  do you know so many  oh well im not a wall flower she answered with modest complacency  where do you see thesethese men at your home  of course not i meet them just as i did you sometimes on the boat sometimes in the park sometimes on the street im a pretty good judge of a man i can tell in a minute if a fellow is one who is likely to get fresh  what do you mean by fresh  why try to kiss youme i mean  do any of them try that asked blinker clenching his teeth  sure all men do you know that  do you allow them  some not many they wont take you out anywhere unless you do  she turned her head and looked searchingly at blinker her eyes were as innocent as a childs there was a puzzled look in them as though she did not understand him  whats wrong about my meeting fellows she asked wonderingly  everything he answered almost savagely why dont you entertain your company in the house where you live is it necessary to pick up tom dick and harry on the streets  she kept her absolutely ingenuous eyes upon his if you could see the place where i live you wouldnt ask that i live in brickdust row they call it that because theres red dust from the bricks crumbling over everything ive lived there for more than four years theres no place to receive company you cant have anybody come to your room what else is there to do a girl has got to meet the men hasnt she  yes he said hoarsely a girl has got to meet ahas got to meet the men  the first time one spoke to me on the street she continued i ran home and cried all night but you get used to it i meet a good many nice fellows at church i go on rainy days and stand in the vestibule until one comes up with an umbrella i wish there was a parlor so i could ask you to call mr blinkerare you really sure it isnt smith now  the boat landed safely blinker had a confused impression of walking with the girl through quiet crosstown streets until she stopped at a corner and held out her hand  i live just one more block over she said thank you for a very pleasant afternoon  blinker muttered something and plunged northward till he found a cab a big gray church loomed slowly at his right blinker shook his fist at it through the window  i gave you a thousand dollars last week he cried under his breath and she meets them in your very doors there is something wrong there is something wrong  at eleven the next day blinker signed his name thirty times with a new pen provided by lawyer oldport  now let me go to the woods he said surlily  you are not looking well said lawyer oldport the trip will do you good but listen if you will to that little matter of business of which i spoke to you yesterday and also five years ago there are some buildings fifteen in number of which there are new fiveyear leases to be signed your father contemplated a change in the lease provisions but never made it he intended that the parlors of these houses should not be sublet but that the tenants should be allowed to use them for reception rooms these houses are in the shopping district and are mainly tenanted by young working girls as it is they are forced to seek companionship outside this row of red brick  blinker interrupted him with a loud discordant laugh  brickdust row for an even hundred he cried and i own it have i guessed right  the tenants have some such name for it said lawyer oldport  blinker arose and jammed his hat down to his eyes  do what you please with it he said harshly remodel it burn it raze it to the ground but man its too late i tell you its too late its too late its too late     the making of a new yorker   besides many other things raggles was a poet he was called a tramp but that was only an elliptical way of saying that he was a philosopher an artist a traveller a naturalist and a discoverer but most of all he was a poet in all his life he never wrote a line of verse he lived his poetry his odyssey would have been a limerick had it been written but to linger with the primary proposition raggles was a poet  raggless specialty had he been driven to ink and paper would have been sonnets to the cities he studied cities as women study their reflections in mirrors as children study the glue and sawdust of a dislocated doll as the men who write about wild animals study the cages in the zoo a city to raggles was not merely a pile of bricks and mortar peopled by a certain number of inhabitants it was a thing with a soul characteristic and distinct an individual conglomeration of life with its own peculiar essence flavor and feeling two thousand miles to the north and south east and west raggles wandered in poetic fervor taking the cities to his breast he footed it on dusty roads or sped magnificently in freight cars counting time as of no account and when he had found the heart of a city and listened to its secret confession he strayed on restless to another fickle ragglesbut perhaps he had not met the civic corporation that could engage and hold his critical fancy  through the ancient poets we have learned that the cities are feminine so they were to poet raggles and his mind carried a concrete and clear conception of the figure that symbolized and typified each one that he had wooed  chicago seemed to swoop down upon him with a breezy suggestion of mrs partington plumes and patchouli and to disturb his rest with a soaring and beautiful song of future promise but raggles would awake to a sense of shivering cold and a haunting impression of ideals lost in a depressing aura of potato salad and fish  thus chicago affected him perhaps there is a vagueness and inaccuracy in the description but that is raggless fault he should have recorded his sensations in magazine poems  pittsburg impressed him as the play of othello performed in the russian language in a railroad station by dockstaders minstrels a royal and generous lady this pittsburg thoughhomely hearty with flushed face washing the dishes in a silk dress and white kid slippers and bidding raggles sit before the roaring fireplace and drink champagne with his pigs feet and fried potatoes  new orleans had simply gazed down upon him from a balcony he could see her pensive starry eyes and catch the flutter of her fan and that was all only once he came face to face with her it was at dawn when she was flushing the red bricks of the banquette with a pail of water she laughed and hummed a chansonette and filled raggless shoes with icecold water allons  boston construed herself to the poetic raggles in an erratic and singular way it seemed to him that he had drunk cold tea and that the city was a white cold cloth that had been bound tightly around his brow to spur him to some unknown but tremendous mental effort and after all he came to shovel snow for a livelihood and the cloth becoming wet tightened its knots and could not be removed  indefinite and unintelligible ideas you will say but your disapprobation should be tempered with gratitude for these are poets fanciesand suppose you had come upon them in verse  one day raggles came and laid siege to the heart of the great city of manhattan she was the greatest of all and he wanted to learn her note in the scale to taste and appraise and classify and solve and label her and arrange her with the other cities that had given him up the secret of their individuality and here we cease to be raggless translator and become his chronicler  raggles landed from a ferryboat one morning and walked into the core of the town with the blasé air of a cosmopolite he was dressed with care to play the rôle of an unidentified man no country race class clique union party clan or bowling association could have claimed him his clothing which had been donated to him piecemeal by citizens of different height but same number of inches around the heart was not yet as uncomfortable to his figure as those speciments of raiment selfmeasured that are railroaded to you by transcontinental tailors with a suit case suspenders silk handkerchief and pearl studs as a bonus without moneyas a poet should bebut with the ardor of an astronomer discovering a new star in the chorus of the milky way or a man who has seen ink suddenly flow from his fountain pen raggles wandered into the great city  late in the afternoon he drew out of the roar and commotion with a look of dumb terror on his countenance he was defeated puzzled discomfited frightened other cities had been to him as long primer to read as country maidens quickly to fathom as sendpriceofsubscriptionwithanswer rebuses to solve as oyster cocktails to swallow but here was one as cold glittering serene impossible as a fourcarat diamond in a window to a lover outside fingering damply in his pocket his ribboncounter salary  the greetings of the other cities he had knowntheir homespun kindliness their human gamut of rough charity friendly curses garrulous curiosity and easily estimated credulity or indifference this city of manhattan gave him no clue it was walled against him like a river of adamant it flowed past him in the streets never an eye was turned upon him no voice spoke to him his heart yearned for the clap of pittsburgs sooty hand on his shoulder for chicagos menacing but social yawp in his ear for the pale and eleemosynary stare through the bostonian eyeglasseven for the precipitate but unmalicious boottoe of louisville or st louis  on broadway raggles successful suitor of many cities stood bashful like any country swain for the first time he experienced the poignant humiliation of being ignored and when he tried to reduce this brilliant swiftly changing icecold city to a formula he failed utterly poet though he was it offered him no color similes no points of comparison no flaw in its polished facets no handle by which he could hold it up and view its shape and structure as he familiarly and often contemptuously had done with other towns the houses were interminable ramparts loopholed for defense the people were bright but bloodless spectres passing in sinister and selfish array  the thing that weighed heaviest on raggless soul and clogged his poets fancy was the spirit of absolute egotism that seemed to saturate the people as toys are saturated with paint each one that he considered appeared a monster of abominable and insolent conceit humanity was gone from them they were toddling idols of stone and varnish worshipping themselves and greedy for though oblivious of worship from their fellow graven images frozen cruel implacable impervious cut to an identical pattern they hurried on their ways like statues brought by some miracles to motion while soul and feeling lay unaroused in the reluctant marble  gradually raggles became conscious of certain types one was an elderly gentleman with a snowwhite short beard pink unwrinkled face and stony sharp blue eyes attired in the fashion of a gilded youth who seemed to personify the citys wealth ripeness and frigid unconcern another type was a woman tall beautiful clear as a steel engraving goddesslike calm clothed like the princesses of old with eyes as coldly blue as the reflection of sunlight on a glacier and another was a byproduct of this town of marionettesa broad swaggering grim threateningly sedate fellow with a jowl as large as a harvested wheat field the complexion of a baptized infant and the knuckles of a prizefighter this type leaned against cigar signs and viewed the world with frappéd contumely  a poet is a sensitive creature and raggles soon shrivelled in the bleak embrace of the undecipherable the chill sphinxlike ironical illegible unnatural ruthless expression of the city left him downcast and bewildered had it no heart better the woodpile the scolding of vinegarfaced housewives at back doors the kindly spleen of bartenders behind provincial freelunch counters the amiable truculence of rural constables the kicks arrests and happygolucky chances of the other vulgar loud crude cities than this freezing heartlessness  raggles summoned his courage and sought alms from the populace unheeding regardless they passed on without the wink of an eyelash to testify that they were conscious of his existence and then he said to himself that this fair but pitiless city of manhattan was without a soul that its inhabitants were manikins moved by wires and springs and that he was alone in a great wilderness  raggles started to cross the street there was a blast a roar a hissing and a crash as something struck him and hurled him over and over six yards from where he had been as he was coming down like the stick of a rocket the earth and all the cities thereof turned to a fractured dream  raggles opened his eyes first an odor made itself known to himan odor of the earliest spring flowers of paradise and then a hand soft as a falling petal touched his brow bending over him was the woman clothed like the princess of old with blue eyes now soft and humid with human sympathy under his head on the pavement were silks and furs with raggless hat in his hand and with his face pinker than ever from a vehement burst of oratory against reckless driving stood the elderly gentleman who personified the citys wealth and ripeness from a nearby café hurried the byproduct with the vast jowl and baby complexion bearing a glass full of a crimson fluid that suggested delightful possibilities  drink dis sport said the byproduct holding the glass to raggless lips  hundreds of people huddled around in a moment their faces wearing the deepest concern two flattering and gorgeous policemen got into the circle and pressed back the overplus of samaritans an old lady in a black shawl spoke loudly of camphor a newsboy slipped one of his papers beneath raggless elbow where it lay on the muddy pavement a brisk young man with a notebook was asking for names  a bell clanged importantly and the ambulance cleaned a lane through the crowd a cool surgeon slipped into the midst of affairs  how do you feel old man asked the surgeon stooping easily to his task the princess of silks and satins wiped a red drop or two from raggless brow with a fragrant cobweb  me said raggles with a seraphic smile i feel fine  he had found the heart of his new city  in three days they let him leave his cot for the convalescent ward in the hospital he had been in there an hour when the attendants heard sounds of conflict upon investigation they found that raggles had assaulted and damaged a brother convalescenta glowering transient whom a freight train collision had sent in to be patched up  whats all this about inquired the head nurse  he was runnin down me town said raggles  what town asked the nurse  noo york said raggles     vanity and some sables   when kid brady was sent to the rope by molly mckeevers blueblack eyes he withdrew from the stovepipe gang so much for the power of a colleens blanderin tongue and stubborn trueheartedness if you are a man who read this may such an influence be sent you before 2 oclock tomorrow if you are a woman may your pomeranian greet you this morning with a cold nosea sign of doghealth and your happiness  the stovepipe gang borrowed its name from a subdistrict of the city called the stovepipe which is a narrow and natural extension of the familiar district known as hells kitchen the stovepipe strip of town runs along eleventh and twelfth avenues on the river and bends a hard and sooty elbow around little lost homeless dewitt clinton park consider that a stovepipe is an important factor in any kitchen and the situation is analyzed the chefs in hells kitchen are many and the stovepipe gang wears the cordon blue  the members of this unchartered but widely known brotherhood appeared to pass their time on street corners arrayed like the lilies of the conservatory and busy with nail files and penknives thus displayed as a guarantee of good faith they carried on an innocuous conversation in a 200word vocabulary to the casual observer as innocent and immaterial as that heard in clubs seven blocks to the east  but off exhibition the stovepipes were not mere street corner ornaments addicted to posing and manicuring their serious occupation was the separating of citizens from their coin and valuables preferably this was done by weird and singular tricks without noise or bloodshed but whenever the citizen honored by their attentions refused to impoverish himself gracefully his objections came to be spread finally upon some police station blotter or hospital register  the police held the stovepipe gang in perpetual suspicion and respect as the nightingales liquid note is heard in the deepest shadows so along the stovepipes dark and narrow confines the whistle for reserves punctures the dull ear of night whenever there was smoke in the stovepipe the tasselled men in blue knew there was fire in hells kitchen  kid brady promised molly to be good kid was the vainest the strongest the wariest and the most successful plotter in the gang therefore the boys were sorry to give him up  but they witnessed his fall to a virtuous life without protest for in the kitchen it is considered neither unmanly nor improper for a guy to do as his girl advises  black her eye for loves sake if you will but it is alltothegood business to do a thing when she wants you to do it  turn off the hydrant said the kid one night when molly tearful besought him to amend his ways im going to cut out the gang you for mine and the simple life on the side ill tell you mollill get work and in a year well get married ill do it for you well get a flat and a flute and a sewing machine and a rubber plant and live as honest as we can  oh kid sighed molly wiping the powder off his shoulder with her handkerchief id rather hear you say that than to own all of new york and we can be happy on so little  the kid looked down at his speckless cuffs and shining patent leathers with a suspicion of melancholy  itll hurt hardest in the rags department said he ive kind of always liked to rig out swell when i could you know how i hate cheap things moll this suit set me back sixtyfive anything in the wearing apparel line has got to be just so or its to the misfit parlors for it for mine if i work i wont have so much coin to hand over to the little man with the big shears  never mind kid ill like you just as much in a blue jumper as i would in a red automobile  before the kid had grown large enough to knock out his father he had been compelled to learn the plumbers art so now back to this honorable and useful profession he returned but it was as an assistant that he engaged himself and it is the master plumber and not the assistant who wears diamonds as large as hailstones and looks contemptuously upon the marble colonnades of senator clarks mansion  eight months went by as smoothly and surely as though they had elapsed on a theater program the kid worked away at his pipes and solder with no symptoms of backsliding the stovepipe gang continued its piracy on the high avenues cracked policemens heads held up late travelers invented new methods of peaceful plundering copied fifth avenues cut of clothes and neckwear fancies and comported itself according to its lawless bylaws but the kid stood firm and faithful to his molly even though the polish was gone from his fingernails and it took him 15 minutes to tie his purple silk ascot so that the worn places would not show  one evening he brought a mysterious bundle with him to mollys house  open that moll he said in his large quiet way its for you  mollys eager fingers tore off the wrappings she shrieked aloud and in rushed a sprinkling of little mckeevers and ma mckeever dishwashy but an undeniable relative of the late mrs eve  again molly shrieked and something dark and long and sinuous flew and enveloped her neck like an anaconda  russian sables said the kid pridefully enjoying the sight of mollys round cheek against the clinging fur the real thing they dont grow anything in russia too good for you moll  molly plunged her hands into the muff overturned a row of the family infants and flew to the mirror hint for the beauty column to make bright eyes rosy checks and a bewitching smile recipeone set russian sables apply  when they were alone molly became aware of a small cake of the ice of common sense floating down the full tide of her happiness  youre a bird all right kid she admitted gratefully i never had any furs on before in my life but aint russian sables awful expensive seems to me ive heard they were  have i ever chucked any bargainsale stuff at you moll asked the kid with calm dignity did you ever notice me leaning on the remnant counter or peering in the window of the fiveandten call that scarf 250 and the muff 175 and you wont make any mistake about the price of russian sables the swell goods for me say they look fine on you moll  molly hugged the sables to her bosom in rapture and then her smile went away little by little and she looked the kid straight in the eye sadly and steadily  he knew what every look of hers meant and he laughed with a faint flush upon his face  cut it out he said with affectionate roughness i told you i was done with that i bought em and paid for em all right with my own money  out of the money you worked for kid out of 75 a month  sure i been saving up  lets seesaved 425 in eight months kid  ah let up said the kid with some heat i had some money when i went to work do you think ive been holding em up again i told you id quit theyre paid for on the square put em on and come out for a walk  molly calmed her doubts sables are soothing proud as a queen she went forth in the streets at the kids side in all that region of lowlying streets russian sables had never been seen before the word sped and doors and windows blossomed with heads eager to see the swell furs kid brady had given his girl all down the street there were ohs and ahs and the reported fabulous sum paid for the sables was passed from lip to lip increasing as it went at her right elbow sauntered the kid with the air of princes work had not diminished his love of pomp and show and his passion for the costly and genuine on a corner they saw a group of the stovepipe gang loafing immaculate they raised their hats to the kids girl and went on with their calm unaccented palaver  three blocks behind the admired couple strolled detective ransom of the central office ransom was the only detective on the force who could walk abroad with safety in the stovepipe district he was fair dealing and unafraid and went there with the hypothesis that the inhabitants were human many liked him and now and then one would tip off to him something that he was looking for  whats the excitement

he touched the kids arm from behind  let me see you a moment brady he said quietly his eye rested for a second on the long fur scarf thrown stylishly back over mollys left shoulder the kid with his oldtime police hating frown on his face stepped a yard or two aside with the detective  did you go to mrs hethcotes on west 7th street yesterday to fix a leaky water pipe asked ransom  i did said the kid what of it  the ladys 1000 set of russian sables went out of the house about the same time you did the description fits the ones this lady has on  to hharlem with you cried the kid angrily you

looked with an odd smile at mollys distressed and anxious face  no use he said grimly theyre the hethcote sables all right youll have to turn em over moll but they aint too good for you if they cost a million  molly with anguish in her face hung upon the kids arm  oh kiddy youve broke my heart she said i was so proud of youand now theyll do youand wheres our happiness gone  go home said the kid

ransom come on away     the social triangle   at the stroke of six ikey snigglefritz laid down his goose ikey was a tailors apprentice are there tailors apprentices nowadays  at any rate ikey toiled and snipped and basted and pressed and patched and sponged all day in the steamy fetor of a tailorshop but when work was done ikey hitched his wagon to such stars as his firmament let shine  it was saturday night and the boss laid twelve begrimed and begrudged dollars in his hand ikey dabbled discreetly in water donned coat hat and collar with its frazzled tie and chalcedony pin and set forth in pursuit of his ideals  for each of us when our days work is done must seek our ideal whether it be love or pinochle or lobster à la newburg or the sweet silence of the musty bookshelves  behold ikey as he ambles up the street beneath the roaring el between the rows of reeking sweatshops pallid stooping insignificant squalid doomed to exist forever in penury of body and mind yet as he swings his cheap cane and projects the noisome inhalations from his cigarette you perceive that he nurtures in his narrow bosom the bacillus of society  ikeys legs carried him to and into that famous place of entertainment known as the café maginnisfamous because it was the rendezvous of billy mcmahan the greatest man the most wonderful man ikey thought that the world had ever produced  billy mcmahan was the district leader upon him the tiger purred and his hand held manna to scatter now as ikey entered mcmahan stood flushed and triumphant and mighty the centre of a huzzaing concourse of his lieutenants and constituents it seems there had been an election a signal victory had been won the city had been swept back into line by a resistless besom of ballots  ikey slunk along the bar and gazed breathquickened at his idol  how magnificent was billy mcmahan with his great smooth laughing face his gray eye shrewd as a chicken hawks his diamond ring his voice like a bugle call his princes air his plump and active roll of money his clarion call to friend and comradeoh what a king of men he was how he obscured his lieutenants though they themselves loomed large and serious blue of chin and important of mien with hands buried deep in the pockets of their short overcoats but billyoh what small avail are words to paint for you his glory as seen by ikey snigglefritz  the café maginnis rang to the note of victory the whitecoated bartenders threw themselves featfully upon bottle cork and glass from a score of clear havanas the air received its paradox of clouds the leal and the hopeful shook billy mcmahans hand and there was born suddenly in the worshipful soul of ikey snigglefritz an audacious thrilling impulse  he stepped forward into the little cleared space in which majesty moved and held out his hand  billy mcmahan grasped it unhesitatingly shook it and smiled  made mad now by the gods who were about to destroy him ikey threw away his scabbard and charged upon olympus  have a drink with me billy he said familiarly you and your friends  dont mind if i do old man said the great leader just to keep the ball rolling  the last spark of ikeys reason fled  wine he called to the bartender waving a trembling hand  the corks of three bottles were drawn the champagne bubbled in the long row of glasses set upon the bar billy mcmahan took his and nodded with his beaming smile at ikey the lieutenants and satellites took theirs and growled heres to you ikey took his nectar in delirium all drank  ikey threw his weeks wages in a crumpled roll upon the bar  crect said the bartender smoothing the twelve onedollar notes the crowd surged around billy mcmahan again some one was telling how brannigan fixed em over in the eleventh ikey leaned against the bar a while and then went out  he went down hester street and up chrystie and down delancey to where he lived and there his women folk a bibulous mother and three dingy sisters pounced upon him for his wages and at his confession they shrieked and objurgated him in the pithy rhetoric of the locality  but even as they plucked at him and struck him ikey remained in his ecstatic trance of joy his head was in the clouds the star was drawing his wagon compared with what he had achieved the loss of wages and the bray of womens tongues were slight affairs  he had shaken the hand of billy mcmahan                                                     billy mcmahan had a wife and upon her visiting cards was engraved the name mrs william darragh mcmahan and there was a certain vexation attendant upon these cards for small as they were there were houses in which they could not be inserted billy mcmahan was a dictator in politics a fourwalled tower in business a mogul dreaded loved and obeyed among his own people he was growing rich the daily papers had a dozen men on his trail to chronicle his every word of wisdom he had been honored in caricature holding the tiger cringing in leash  but the heart of billy was sometimes sore within him there was a race of men from which he stood apart but that he viewed with the eye of moses looking over into the promised land he too had ideals even as had ikey snigglefritz and sometimes hopeless of attaining them his own solid success was as dust and ashes in his mouth and mrs william darragh mcmahan wore a look of discontent upon her plump but pretty face and the very rustle of her silks seemed a sigh  there was a brave and conspicuous assemblage in the dining saloon of a noted hostelry where fashion loves to display her charms at one table sat billy mcmahan and his wife mostly silent they were but the accessories they enjoyed little needed the indorsement of speech mrs mcmahans diamonds were outshone by few in the room the waiter bore the costliest brands of wine to their table in evening dress with an expression of gloom upon his smooth and massive countenance you would look in vain for a more striking figure than billys  four tables away sat alone a tall slender man about thirty with thoughtful melancholy eyes a van dyke beard and peculiarly white thin hands he was dining on filet mignon dry toast and apollinaris that man was cortlandt van duyckink a man worth eighty millions who inherited and held a sacred seat in the exclusive inner circle of society  billy mcmahan spoke to no one around him because he knew no one van duyckink kept his eyes on his plate because he knew that every one present was hungry to catch his he could bestow knighthood and prestige by a nod and he was chary of creating a too extensive nobility  and then billy mcmahan conceived and accomplished the most startling and audacious act of his life he rose deliberately and walked over to cortlandt van duyckinks table and held out his hand  say mr van duyckink he said ive heard you was talking about starting some reforms among the poor people down in my district im mcmahan you know say now if thats straight ill do all i can to help you and what i says goes in that neck of the woods dont it oh say i rather guess it does  van duyckinks rather sombre eyes lighted up he rose to his lank height and grasped billy mcmahans hand  thank you mr mcmahan he said in his deep serious tones i have been thinking of doing some work of that sort i shall be glad of your assistance it pleases me to have become acquainted with you  billy walked back to his seat his shoulder was tingling from the accolade bestowed by royalty a hundred eyes were now turned upon him in envy and new admiration mrs william darragh mcmahan trembled with ecstasy so that her diamonds smote the eye almost with pain and now it was apparent that at many tables there were those who suddenly remembered that they enjoyed mr mcmahans acquaintance he saw smiles and bows about him he became enveloped in the aura of dizzy greatness his campaign coolness deserted him  wine for that gang he commanded the waiter pointing with his finger wine over there wine to those three gents by that green bush tell em its on me dn it wine for everybody  the waiter ventured to whisper that it was perhaps inexpedient to carry out the order in consideration of the dignity of the house and its custom  all right said billy if its against the rules i wonder if twould do to send my friend van duyckink a bottle no well itll flow all right at the caffy tonight just the same itll be rubber boots for anybody who comes in there any time up to 2 a m  billy mcmahan was happy  he had shaken the hand of cortlandt van duyckink                                                     the big palegray auto with its shining metal work looked out of place moving slowly among the push carts and trashheaps on the lower east side so did cortlandt van duyckink with his aristocratic face and white thin hands as he steered carefully between the groups of ragged scurrying youngsters in the streets and so did miss constance schuyler with her dim ascetic beauty seated at his side  oh cortlandt she breathed isnt it sad that human beings have to live in such wretchedness and poverty and youhow noble it is of you to think of them to give your time and money to improve their condition  van duyckink turned his solemn eyes upon her  it is little he said sadly that i can do the question is a large one and belongs to society but even individual effort is not thrown away look constance on this street i have arranged to build soup kitchens where no one who is hungry will be turned away and down this other street are the old buildings that i shall cause to be torn down and there erect others in place of those deathtraps of fire and disease  down delancey slowly crept the palegray auto away from it toddled coveys of wondering tanglehaired barefooted unwashed children it stopped before a crazy brick structure foul and awry  van duyckink alighted to examine at a better perspective one of the leaning walls down the steps of the building came a young man who seemed to epitomize its degradation squalor and infelicitya narrowchested pale unsavory young man puffing at a cigarette  obeying a sudden impulse van duyckink stepped out and warmly grasped the hand of what seemed to him a living rebuke  i want to know you people he said sincerely i am going to help you as much as i can we shall be friends  as the auto crept carefully away cortlandt van duyckink felt an unaccustomed glow about his heart he was near to being a happy man  he had shaken the hand of ikey snigglefritz     the purple dress   we are to consider the shade known as purple it is a color justly in repute among the sons and daughters of man emperors claim it for their especial dye good fellows everywhere seek to bring their noses to the genial hue that follows the commingling of the red and blue we say of princes that they are born to the purple and no doubt they are for the colic tinges their faces with the royal tint equally with the snubnosed countenance of a woodchoppers brat all women love itwhen it is the fashion  and now purple is being worn you notice it on the streets of course other colors are quite stylish as wellin fact i saw a lovely thing the other day in olive green albatross with a triplelapped flounce skirt trimmed with insert squares of silk and a draped fichu of lace opening over a shirred vest and double puff sleeves with a lace band holding two gathered frillsbut you see lots of purple too oh yes you do just take a walk down twentythird street any afternoon  therefore maidathe girl with the big brown eyes and cinnamoncolored hair in the beehive storesaid to gracethe girl with the rhinestone brooch and peppermintpepsin flavor to her speechim going to have a purple dressa tailormade purple dressfor thanksgiving  oh are you said grace putting away some 7½ gloves into the 6¾ box well its me for red you see more red on fifth avenue and the men all seem to like it  i like purple best said maida and old schlegel has promised to make it for 8 its going to be lovely im going to have a plaited skirt and a blouse coat trimmed with a band of galloon under a white cloth collar with two rows of  sly boots said grace with an educated wink  soutache braid over a surpliced white vest and a plaited basque and  sly bootssly boots repeated grace  plaited gigot sleeves with a drawn velvet ribbon over an inside cuff what do you mean by saying that  you think mr ramsay likes purple i heard him say yesterday he thought some of the dark shades of red were stunning  i dont care said maida i prefer purple and them that dont like it can just take the other side of the street  which suggests the thought that after all the followers of purple may be subject to slight delusions danger is near when a maiden thinks she can wear purple regardless of complexions and opinions and when emperors think their purple robes will wear forever  maida had saved 18 after eight months of economy and this had bought the goods for the purple dress and paid schlegel 4 on the making of it on the day before thanksgiving she would have just enough to pay the remaining 4 and then for a holiday in a new dresscan earth offer anything more enchanting  old bachman the proprietor of the beehive store always gave a thanksgiving dinner to his employees on every one of the subsequent 364 days excusing sundays he would remind them of the joys of the past banquet and the hopes of the coming ones thus inciting them to increased enthusiasm in work the dinner was given in the store on one of the long tables in the middle of the room they tacked wrapping paper over the front windows and the turkeys and other good things were brought in the back way from the restaurant on the corner you will perceive that the beehive was not a fashionable department store with escalators and pompadours it was almost small enough to be called an emporium and you could actually go in there and get waited on and walk out again and always at the thanksgiving dinners mr ramsay  oh bother i should have mentioned mr ramsay first of all he is more important than purple or green or even the red cranberry sauce  mr ramsay was the head clerk and as far as i am concerned i am for him he never pinched the girls arms when he passed them in dark corners of the store and when he told them stories when business was dull and the girls giggled and said oh pshaw it wasnt g bernard they meant at all besides being a gentleman mr ramsay was queer and original in other ways he was a health crank and believed that people should never eat anything that was good for them he was violently opposed to anybody being comfortable and coming in out of snow storms or wearing overshoes or taking medicine or coddling themselves in any way every one of the ten girls in the store had little porkchopandfriedonion dreams every night of becoming mrs ramsay for next year old bachman was going to take him in for a partner and each one of them knew that if she should catch him she would knock those cranky health notions of his sky high before the wedding cake indigestion was over  mr ramsay was master of ceremonies at the dinners always they had two italians in to play a violin and harp and had a little dance in the store  and here were two dresses being conceived to charm ramsayone purple and the other red of course the other eight girls were going to have dresses too but they didnt count very likely theyd wear some shirtwaistandblackskirtaffairsnothing as resplendent as purple or red  grace had saved her money too she was going to buy her dress readymade oh whats the use of bothering with a tailorwhen youve got a figger its easy to get a fitthe readymade are intended for a perfect figgerexcept i have to have em all taken in at the waistthe average figger is so large waisted  the night before thanksgiving came maida hurried home keen and bright with the thoughts of the blessed morrow her thoughts were of purple but they were white themselvesthe joyous enthusiasm of the young for the pleasures that youth must have or wither she knew purple would become her andfor the thousandth time she tried to assure herself that it was purple mr ramsay said he liked and not red she was going home first to get the 4 wrapped in a piece of tissue paper in the bottom drawer of her dresser and then she was going to pay schlegel and take the dress home herself  grace lived in the same house she occupied the hall room above maidas  at home maida found clamor and confusion the landladys tongue clattering sourly in the halls like a churn dasher dabbing in buttermilk and then grace come down to her room crying with eyes as red as any dress  she says ive got to get out said grace the old beast because i owe her 4 shes put my trunk in the hall and locked the door i cant go anywhere else i havent got a cent of money  you had some yesterday said maida  i paid it on my dress said grace i thought shed wait till next week for the rent  sniffle sniffle sob

up and look at it ill pay the money back a dollar a weekhonest i will  thanksgiving  the dinner was to be at noon at a quarter to twelve grace switched into maidas room yes she looked charming red was her color maida sat by the window in her old cheviot skirt and blue waist darning a st oh doing fancy work  why goodness me aint you dressed yet shrilled the red one how does it fit in the back dont you think these velvet tabs look awful swell why aint you dressed maida  my dress didnt get finished in time said maida im not going to the dinner  thats too bad why im awfully sorry maida why dont you put on anything and come alongits just the store folks you know and they wont mind  i was set on my purple said maida if i cant have it i wont go at all dont bother about me run along or youll be late you look awful nice in red  at her window maida sat through the long morning and past the time of the dinner at the store in her mind she could hear the girls shrieking over a pullbone could hear old bachmans roar over his own deeplyconcealed jokes could see the diamonds of fat mrs bachman who came to the store only on thanksgiving days could see mr ramsay moving about alert kindly looking to the comfort of all  at four in the afternoon with an expressionless face and a lifeless air she slowly made her way to schlegels shop and told him she could not pay the 4 due on the dress  gott cried schlegel angrily for what do you look so glum take him away he is ready pay me some time haf i not seen you pass mine shop every day in two years if i make clothes is it that i do not know how to read beoples because you will pay me some time when you can take him away he is made goot and if you look bretty in him all right so pay me when you can  maida breathed a millionth part of the thanks in her heart and hurried away with her dress as she left the shop a smart dash of rain struck upon her face she smiled and did not feel it  ladies who shop in carriages you do not understand girls whose wardrobes are charged to the old mans account you cannot begin to comprehendyou could not understand why maida did not feel the cold dash of the thanksgiving rain  at five oclock she went out upon the street wearing her purple dress the rain had increased and it beat down upon her in a steady windblown pour people were scurrying home and to cars with closeheld umbrellas and tight buttoned raincoats many of them turned their heads to marvel at this beautiful serene happyeyed girl in the purple dress walking through the storm as though she were strolling in a garden under summer skies  i say you do not understand it ladies of the full purse and varied wardrobe you do not know what it is to live with a perpetual longing for pretty thingsto starve eight months in order to bring a purple dress and a holiday together what difference if it rained hailed blew snowed cycloned  maida had no umbrella nor overshoes she had her purple dress and she walked abroad let the elements do their worst a starved heart must have one crumb during a year the rain ran down and dripped from her fingers  some one turned a corner and blocked her way she looked up into mr ramsays eyes sparkling with admiration and interest  why miss maida said he you look simply magnificent in your new dress i was greatly disappointed not to see you at our dinner and of all the girls i ever knew you show the greatest sense and intelligence there is nothing more healthful and invigorating than braving the weather as you are doing may i walk with you  and maida blushed and sneezed     the foreign policy of company 99   john byrnes hosecart driver of engine company no 99 was afflicted with what his comrades called japanitis  byrnes had a war map spread permanently upon a table in the second story of the enginehouse and he could explain to you at any hour of the day or night the exact positions conditions and intentions of both the russian and japanese armies he had little clusters of pins stuck in the map which represented the opposing forces and these he moved about from day to day in conformity with the war news in the daily papers  wherever the japs won a victory john byrnes would shift his pins and then he would execute a war dance of delight and the other firemen would hear him yell go it you blamed little sawedoff huckleberryeyed monkeyfaced hot tamales eat em up you little sleightohand bowlegged bull terriersgive em another of them yalu looloos and youll eat rice in st petersburg talk about your russianssay wouldnt they give you a painsky when it comes to a scrapovitch  not even on the fair island of nippon was there a more enthusiastic champion of the mikados men supporters of the russian cause did well to keep clear of enginehouse no 99  sometimes all thoughts of the japs left john byrness head that was when the alarm of fire had sounded and he was strapped in his drivers seat on the swaying cart guiding erebus and joe the finest team in the whole departmentaccording to the crew of 99  of all the codes adopted by man for regulating his actions toward his fellowmortals the greatest are thesethe code of king arthurs knights of the round table the constitution of the united states and the unwritten rules of the new york fire department the round table methods are no longer practicable since the invention of street cars and breachofpromise suits and our constitution is being found more and more unconstitutional every day so the code of our firemen must be considered in the lead with the golden rule and jeffriess new punch trying for place and show  the constitution says that one man is as good as another but the fire department says he is better this is a too generous theory but the law will not allow itself to be construed otherwise all of which comes perilously near to being a paradox and commends itself to the attention of the s p c a  one of the transatlantic liners dumped out at ellis island a lump of protozoa which was expected to evolve into an american citizen a steward kicked him down the gangway a doctor pounced upon his eyes like a raven seeking for trachoma or ophthalmia he was hustled ashore and ejected into the city in the name of libertyperhaps theoretically thus inoculating against kingocracy with a drop of its own virus this hypodermic injection of europeanism wandered happily into the veins of the city with the broad grin of a pleased child it was not burdened with baggage cares or ambitions its body was lithely built and clothed in a sort of foreign fustian its face was brightly vacant with a small flat nose and was mostly covered by a thick ragged curling beard like the coat of a spaniel in the pocket of the imported thing were a few coinsdenariiscudikopeckspfennigspilasterswhatever the financial nomenclature of his unknown country may have been  prattling to himself always broadly grinning pleased by the roar and movement of the barbarous city into which the steamship cutrates had shunted him the alien strayed away from the sea which he hated as far as the district covered by engine company no 99 light as a cork he was kept bobbing along by the human tide the crudest atom in all the silt of the stream that emptied into the reservoir of liberty  while crossing third avenue he slowed his steps enchanted by the thunder of the elevated trains above him and the soothing crash of the wheels on the cobbles and then there was a new delightful chord in the uproarthe musical clanging of a gong and a great shining juggernaut belching fire and smoke that people were hurrying to see  this beautiful thing entrancing to the eye dashed past and the protoplasmic immigrant stepped into the wake of it with his broad enraptured uncomprehending grin and so stepping stepped into the path of no 99s flying hosecart with john byrnes gripping with arms of steel the reins over the plunging backs of erebus and joe  the unwritten constitutional code of the fireman has no exceptions or amendments it is a simple thingas simple as the rule of three there was the heedless unit in the right of way there was the hosecart and the iron pillar of the elevated railroad  john byrnes swung all his weight and muscle on the left rein the team and cart swerved that way and crashed like a torpedo into the pillar the men on the cart went flying like skittles the drivers strap burst the pillar rang with the shock and john byrnes fell on the car track with a broken shoulder twenty feet away while erebusbeautiful ravenblack bestloved erebuslay whickering in his harness with a broken leg  in consideration for the feelings of engine company no 99 the details will be lightly touched the company does not like to be reminded of that day there was a great crowd and hurry calls were sent in and while the ambulance gong was clearing the way the men of no 99 heard the crack of the s p c a agents pistol and turned their heads away not daring to look toward erebus again  when the firemen got back to the enginehouse they found that one of them was dragging by the collar the cause of their desolation and grief they set it in the middle of the floor and gathered grimly about it through its whiskers the calamitous object chattered effervescently and waved its hands  sounds like a seidlitz powder said mike dowling disgustedly and it makes me sicker than one call that a manthat hoss was worth a steamer full of such twolegged animals its a immigrantthats what it is  look at the doctors chalk mark on its coat said reilly the desk man its just landed it must be a kind of a dago or a hun or one of them finns i guess thats the kind of truck that europe unloads onto us  think of a thing like that getting in the way and laying john up in hospital and spoiling the best fire team in the city groaned another fireman it ought to be taken down to the dock and drowned  somebody go around and get sloviski suggested the engine driver and lets see what nation is responsible for this conglomeration of hair and head noises  sloviski kept a delicatessen store around the corner on third avenue and was reputed to be a linguist  one of the men fetched hima fat cringing man with a discursive eye and the odors of many kinds of meats upon him  take a whirl at this importation with your jawbreakers sloviski requested mike dowling we cant quite figure out whether hes from the hackensack bottoms or hongkongontheganges  sloviski addressed the stranger in several dialects that ranged in rhythm and cadence from the sounds produced by a tonsilitis gargle to the opening of a can of tomatoes with a pair of scissors the immigrant replied in accents resembling the uncorking of a bottle of ginger ale  i have you his name reported sloviski you shall not pronounce it writing of it in paper is better they gave him paper and he wrote demetre svangvsk  looks like short hand said the desk man  he speaks some language continued the interpreter wiping his forehead of austria and mixed with a little turkish and den he have some magyar words and a polish or two and many like the roumanian but not without talk of one tribe in bessarabia i do not him quite understand  would you call him a dago or a polocker or what asked mike frowning at the polyglot description  he is aanswered sloviskihe is ai dink he come fromi dink he is a fool he concluded impatient at his linguistic failure and if you pleases i will go back at mine delicatessen  whatever he is hes a bird said mike dowling and you want to watch him fly  taking by the wing the alien fowl that had fluttered into the nest of liberty mike led him to the door of the enginehouse and bestowed upon him a kick hearty enough to convey the entire animus of company 99 demetre svangvsk hustled away down the sidewalk turning once to show his ineradicable grin to the aggrieved firemen  in three weeks john byrnes was back at his post from the hospital with great gusto he proceeded to bring his war map up to date my money on the japs every time he declared why look at them russianstheyre nothing but wolves wipe em out i sayand the little old jiu jitsu gang are just the cherry blossoms to do the trick and dont you forget it  the second day after byrness reappearance came demetre svangvsk the unidentified to the enginehouse with a broader grin than ever he managed to convey the idea that he wished to congratulate the hosecart driver on his recovery and to apologize for having caused the accident this he accomplished by so many extravagant gestures and explosive noises that the company was diverted for half an hour then they kicked him out again and on the next day he came back grinning how or where he lived no one knew and then john byrness nineyearold son chris who brought him convalescent delicacies from home to eat took a fancy to svangvsk and they allowed him to loaf about the door of the enginehouse occasionally  one afternoon the big drab automobile of the deputy fire commissioner buzzed up to the door of no 99 and the deputy stepped inside for an informal inspection the men kicked svangvsk out a little harder than usual and proudly escorted the deputy around 99 in which everything shone like my ladys mirror  the deputy respected the sorrow of the company concerning the loss of erebus and he had come to promise it another mate for joe that would do him credit so they let joe out of his stall and showed the deputy how deserving he was of the finest mate that could be in horsedom  while they were circling around joe confabbing chris climbed into the deputys auto and threw the power full on the men heard a monster puffing and a shriek from the lad and sprang out too late the big auto shot away luckily taking a straight course down the street the boy knew nothing of its machinery he sat clutching the cushions and howling with the power on nothing could have stopped that auto except a brick house and there was nothing for chris to gain by such a stoppage  demetre svangvsk was just coming in again with a grin for another kick when chris played his merry little prank while the others sprang for the door demetre sprang for joe he glided upon the horses bare back like a snake and shouted something at him like the crack of a dozen whips one of the firemen afterward swore that joe answered him back in the same language ten seconds after the auto started the big horse was eating up the asphalt behind it like a strip of macaroni  some people two blocks and a half away saw the rescue they said that the auto was nothing but a drab noise with a black speck in the middle of it for chris when a big bay horse with a lizard lying on its back cantered up alongside of it and the lizard reached over and picked the black speck out of the noise  only fifteen minutes after svangvsks last kicking at the handsor rather the feetof engine company no 99 he rode joe back through the door with the boy safe but acutely conscious of the licking he was going to receive  svangvsk slipped to the floor leaned his head against joes and made a noise like a clucking hen joe nodded and whistled loudly through his nostrils putting to shame the knowledge of sloviski of the delicatessen  john byrnes walked up to svangvsk who grinned expecting to be kicked byrnes gripped the outlander so strongly by the hand that demetre grinned anyhow conceiving it to be a new form of punishment  the heathen rides like a cossack remarked a fireman who had seen a wild west showtheyre the greatest riders in the world  the word seemed to electrify svangvsk he grinned wider than ever  yasyasme cossack he spluttered striking his chest  cossack repeated john byrnes thoughtfully aint that a kind of a russian  theyre one of the russian tribes sure said the desk man who read books between fire alarms  just then alderman foley who was on his way home and did not know of the runaway stopped at the door of the enginehouse and called to byrnes  hello there jimmy me boyhows the war coming along japs still got the bear on the trot have they  oh i dont know said john byrnes argumentatively them japs havent got any walkover you wait till kuropatkin gets a good whack at em and they wont be kneehigh to a puddleducksky     the lost blend   since the bar has been blessed by the clergy and cocktails open the dinners of the elect one may speak of the saloon teetotalers need not listen if they choose there is always the slot restaurant where a dime dropped into the cold bouillon aperture will bring forth a dry martini  con lantry worked on the sober side of the bar in kenealys café you and i stood onelegged like geese on the other side and went into voluntary liquidation with our weeks wages opposite danced con clean temperate clearheaded polite whitejacketed punctual trustworthy young responsible and took our money  the saloon whether blessed or cursed stood in one of those little places which are parallelograms instead of streets and inhabited by laundries decayed knickerbocker families and bohemians who have nothing to do with either  over the café lived kenealy and his family his daughter katherine had eyes of dark irishbut why should you be told be content with your geraldine or your eliza ann for con dreamed of her and when she called softly at the foot of the back stairs for the pitcher of beer for dinner his heart went up and down like a milk punch in the shaker orderly and fit are the rules of romance and if you hurl the last shilling of your fortune upon the bar for whiskey the bartender shall take it and marry his bosss daughter and good will grow out of it  but not so con for in the presence of woman he was tonguetied and scarlet he who would quell with his eye the sonorous youth whom the claret punch made loquacious or smash with lemon squeezer the obstreperous or hurl gutterward the cantankerous without a wrinkle coming to his white lawn tie when he stood before woman he was voiceless incoherent stuttering buried beneath a hot avalanche of bashfulness and misery what then was he before katherine a trembler with no word to say for himself a stone without blarney the dumbest lover that ever babbled of the weather in the presence of his divinity  there came to kenealys two sunburned men riley and mcquirk they had conference with kenealy and then they took possession of a back room which they filled with bottles and siphons and jugs and druggists measuring glasses all the appurtenances and liquids of a saloon were there but they dispensed no drinks all day long the two sweltered in there pouring and mixing unknown brews and decoctions from the liquors in their store riley had the education and he figured on reams of paper reducing gallons to ounces and quarts to fluid drams mcquirk a morose man with a red eye dashed each unsuccessful completed mixture into the waste pipes with curses gentle husky and deep they labored heavily and untiringly to achieve some mysterious solution like two alchemists striving to resolve gold from the elements  into this back room one evening when his watch was done sauntered con his professional curiosity had been stirred by these occult bartenders at whose bar none drank and who daily drew upon kenealys store of liquors to follow their consuming and fruitless experiments  down the back stairs came katherine with her smile like sunrise on gweebarra bay  good evening mr lantry says she and what is the news today if you please  it looks like rrain stammered the shy one backing to the wall  it couldnt do better said katherine im thinking theres nothing the worse off for a little water in the back room riley and mcquirk toiled like bearded witches over their strange compounds from fifty bottles they drew liquids carefully measured after rileys figures and shook the whole together in a great glass vessel then mcquirk would dash it out with gloomy profanity and they would begin again  sit down said riley to con and ill tell you  last summer me and tim concludes that an american bar in this nation of nicaragua would pay there was a town on the coast where theres nothing to eat but quinine and nothing to drink but rum the natives and foreigners lay down with chills and get up with fevers and a good mixed drink is natures remedy for all such tropical inconveniences  so we lays in a fine stock of wet goods in new york and bar fixtures and glassware and we sails for that santa palma town on a lime steamer on the way me and tim sees flying fish and plays sevenup with the captain and steward and already begins to feel like the highball kings of the tropics of capricorn  when we gets in five hours of the country that we was going to introduce to long drinks and short change the captain calls us over to the starboard binnacle and recollects a few things  i forgot to tell you boys says he that nicaragua slapped an import duty of 48 per cent ad valorem on all bottled goods last month the president took a bottle of cincinnati hair tonic by mistake for tobasco sauce and hes getting even barrelled goods is free  sorry you didnt mention it sooner says we and we bought two fortytwo gallon casks from the captain and opened every bottle we had and dumped the stuff all together in the casks that 48 per cent would have ruined us so we took the chances on making that 1200 cocktail rather than throw the stuff away  well when we landed we tapped one of the barrels the mixture was something heartrending it was the color of a plate of bowery pea soup and it tasted like one of those coffee substitutes your aunt makes you take for the heart trouble you get by picking losers we gave a nigger four fingers of it to try it and he lay under a cocoanut tree three days beating the sand with his heels and refused to sign a testimonial  but the other barrel say bartender did you ever put on a straw hat with a yellow band around it and go up in a balloon with a pretty girl with 8000000 in your pocket all at the same time thats what thirty drops of it would make you feel like with two fingers of it inside you you would bury your face in your hands and cry because there wasnt anything more worth while around for you to lick than little jim jeffries yes sir the stuff in that second barrel was distilled elixir of battle money and high life it was the color of gold and as clear as glass and it shone after dark like the sunshine was still in it a thousand years from now youll get a drink like that across the bar  well we started up business with that one line of drinks and it was enough the piebald gentry of that country stuck to it like a hive of bees if that barrel had lasted that country would have become the greatest on earth when we opened up of mornings we had a line of generals and colonels and expresidents and revolutionists a block long waiting to be served we started in at 50 cents silver a drink the last ten gallons went easy at 5 a gulp it was wonderful stuff it gave a man courage and ambition and nerve to do anything at the same time he didnt care whether his money was tainted or fresh from the ice trust when that barrel was half gone nicaragua had repudiated the national debt removed the duty on cigarettes and was about to declare war on the united states and england  twas by accident we discovered this king of drinks and twill be by good luck if we strike it again for ten months weve been trying small lots at a time weve mixed barrels of all the harmful ingredients known to the profession of drinking ye could have stocked ten bars with the whiskies brandies cordials bitters gins and wines me and tim have wasted a glorious drink like that to be denied to the world tis a sorrow and a loss of money the united states as a nation would welcome a drink of that sort and pay for it  all the while mcquirk had been carefully measuring and pouring together small quantities of various spirits as riley called them from his latest pencilled prescription the completed mixture was of a vile mottled chocolate color mcquirk tasted it and hurled it with appropriate epithets into the waste sink  tis a strange story even if true said con ill be going now along to my supper  take a drink said riley weve all kinds except the lost blend  i never drink said con anything stronger than water i am just after meeting miss katherine by the stairs she said a true word theres not anything says she but is better off for a little water  when con had left them riley almost felled mcquirk by a blow on the back  did ye hear that he shouted two fools are we the six dozen bottles of pollinaris we had on the shipye opened them yourselfwhich barrel did ye pour them inwhich barrel ye mudhead  i mind said mcquirk slowly twas in the second barrel we opened i mind the blue piece of paper pasted on the side of it  weve got it now cried riley twas that we lacked tis the water that does the trick everything else we had right hurry man and get two bottles of pollinaris from the bar while i figure out the proportionments with me pencil  an hour later con strolled down the sidewalk toward kenealys café thus faithful employees haunt during their recreation hours the vicinity where they labor drawn by some mysterious attraction  a police patrol wagon stood at the side door three able cops were half carrying half hustling riley and mcquirk up its rear steps the eyes and faces of each bore the bruises and cuts of sanguinary and assiduous conflict yet they whooped with strange joy and directed upon the police the feeble remnants of their pugnacious madness  began fighting each other in the back room explained kenealy to con and singing that was worse smashed everything pretty much up but theyre good men theyll pay for everything trying to invent some new kind of cocktail they was ill see they come out all right in the morning  con sauntered into the back room to view the battlefield as he went through the hall katherine was just coming down the stairs  good evening again mr lantry said she and is there no news from the weather yet  still threatens rrain said con slipping past with red in his smooth pale cheek  riley and mcquirk had indeed waged a great and friendly battle broken bottles and glasses were everywhere the room was full of alcohol fumes the floor was variegated with spirituous puddles  on the table stood a 32ounce glass graduated measure in the bottom of it were two tablespoonfuls of liquida bright golden liquid that seemed to hold the sunshine a prisoner in its auriferous depths  con smelled it he tasted it he drank it  as he returned through the hall katherine was just going up the stairs  no news yet mr lantry she asked with her teasing laugh  con lifted her clear from the floor and held her there  the news is he said that were to be married  put me down sir she cried indignantly or i will oh con where oh wherever did you get the nerve to say it     a harlem tragedy   harlem  mrs fink had dropped into mrs cassidys flat one flight below  aint it a beaut said mrs cassidy  she turned her face proudly for her friend mrs fink to see one eye was nearly closed with a great greenishpurple bruise around it her lip was cut and bleeding a little and there were red fingermarks on each side of her neck  my husband wouldnt ever think of doing that to me said mrs fink concealing her envy  i wouldnt have a man declared mrs cassidy that didnt beat me up at least once a week shows he thinks something of you say but that last dose jack gave me wasnt no homeopathic one i can see stars yet but hell be the sweetest man in town for the rest of the week to make up for it this eye is good for theater tickets and a silk shirt waist at the very least  i should hope said mrs fink assuming complacency that mr fink is too much of a gentleman ever to raise his hand against me  oh go on maggie said mrs cassidy laughing and applying witch hazel youre only jealous your old man is too frappéd and slow to ever give you a punch he just sits down and practises physical culture with a newspaper when he comes homenow aint that the truth  mr fink certainly peruses of the papers when he comes home acknowledged mrs fink with a toss of her head but he certainly dont ever make no steve odonnell out of me just to amuse himselfthats a sure thing  mrs cassidy laughed the contented laugh of the guarded and happy matron with the air of cornelia exhibiting her jewels she drew down the collar of her kimono and revealed another treasured bruise marooncolored edged with olive and orangea bruise now nearly well but still to memory dear  mrs fink capitulated the formal light in her eye softened to envious admiration she and mrs cassidy had been chums in the downtown paperbox factory before they had married one year before now she and her man occupied the flat above mame and her man therefore she could not put on airs with mame  dont it hurt when he soaks you asked mrs fink curiously  hurtmrs cassidy gave a soprano scream of delight well saydid you ever have a brick house fall on youwell thats just the way it feelsjust like when theyre digging you out of the ruins jacks got a left that spells two matinees and a new pair of oxfordsand his rightwell it takes a trip to coney and six pairs of openwork silk lisle threads to make that good  but what does he beat you for inquired mrs fink with wideopen eyes  silly said mrs cassidy indulgently why because hes full its generally on saturday nights  but what cause do you give him persisted the seeker after knowledge  why didnt i marry him jack comes in tanked up and im here aint i who else has he got a right to beat id just like to catch him once beating anybody else sometimes its because supper aint ready and sometimes its because it is jack aint particular about causes he just lushes till he remembers hes married and then he makes for home and does me up saturday nights i just move the furniture with sharp corners out of the way so i wont cut my head when he gets his work in hes got a left swing that jars you sometimes i take the count in the first round but when i feel like having a good time during the week or want some new rags i come up again for more punishment thats what i done last night jack knows ive been wanting a black silk waist for a month and i didnt think just one black eye would bring it tell you what mag ill bet you the ice cream he brings it tonight  mrs fink was thinking deeply  my mart she said never hit me a lick in his life its just like you said mame he comes in grouchy and aint got a word to say he never takes me out anywhere hes a chairwarmer at home for fair he buys me things but he looks so glum about it that i never appreciate em  mrs cassidy slipped an arm around her chum you poor thing she said but everybody cant have a husband like jack marriage wouldnt be no failure if they was all like him these discontented wives you hear aboutwhat they need is a man to come home and kick their slats in once a week and then make it up in kisses and chocolate creams thatd give em some interest in life what i want is a masterful man that slugs you when hes jagged and hugs you when he aint jagged preserve me from the man that aint got the sand to do neither  mrs fink sighed  the hallways were suddenly filled with sound the door flew open at the kick of mr cassidy his arms were occupied with bundles mame flew and hung about his neck her sound eye sparkled with the love light that shines in the eye of the maori maid when she recovers consciousness in the hut of the wooer who has stunned and dragged her there  hello old girl shouted mr cassidy he shed his bundles and lifted her off her feet in a mighty hug i got tickets for barnum  baileys and if youll bust the string of one of them bundles i guess youll find that silk waistwhy good evening mrs finki didnt see you at first hows old mart coming along  hes very well mr cassidythanks said mrs fink i must be going along up now martll be home for supper soon ill bring you down that pattern you wanted tomorrow mame  mrs fink went up to her flat and had a little cry it was a meaningless cry the kind of cry that only a woman knows about a cry from no particular cause altogether an absurd cry the most transient and the most hopeless cry in the repertory of grief why had martin never thrashed her he was as big and strong as jack cassidy did he not care for her at all he never quarrelled he came home and lounged about silent glum idle he was a fairly good provider but he ignored the spices of life  mrs finks ship of dreams was becalmed her captain ranged between plum duff and his hammock if only he would shiver his timbers or stamp his foot on the quarterdeck now and then and she had thought to sail so merrily touching at ports in the delectable isles but now to vary the figure she was ready to throw up the sponge tired out without a scratch to show for all those tame rounds with her sparring partner for one moment she almost hated mamemame with her cuts and bruises her salve of presents and kisses her stormy voyage with her fighting brutal loving mate  mr fink came home at 7 he was permeated with the curse of domesticity beyond the portals of his cozy home he cared not to roam to roam he was the man who had caught the street car the anaconda that had swallowed its prey the tree that lay as it had fallen  like the supper mart asked mrs fink who had striven over it  mmmyep grunted mr fink  after supper he gathered his newspapers to read he sat in his stocking feet  arise some new dante and sing me the befitting corner of perdition for the man who sitteth in the house in his stockinged feet sisters of patience who by reason of ties or duty have endured it in silk yarn cotton lisle thread or woollendoes not the new canto belong  the next day was labor day the occupations of mr cassidy and mr fink ceased for one passage of the sun labor triumphant would parade and otherwise disport itself  mrs fink took mrs cassidys pattern down early mame had on her new silk waist even her damaged eye managed to emit a holiday gleam jack was fruitfully penitent and there was a hilarious scheme for the day afoot with parks and picnics and pilsener in it  a rising indignant jealousy seized mrs fink as she returned to her flat above oh happy mame with her bruises and her quickfollowing balm but was mame to have a monopoly of happiness surely martin fink was as good a man as jack cassidy was his wife to go always unbelabored and uncaressed a sudden brilliant breathless idea came to mrs fink she would show mame that there were husbands as able to use their fists and perhaps to be as tender afterward as any jack  the holiday promised to be a nominal one with the finks mrs fink had the stationary washtubs in the kitchen filled with a two weeks wash that had been soaking overnight mr fink sat in his stockinged feet reading a newspaper thus labor day presaged to speed  jealousy surged high in mrs finks heart and higher still surged an audacious resolve if her man would not strike herif he would not so far prove his manhood his prerogative and his interest in conjugal affairs he must be prompted to his duty  mr fink lit his pipe and peacefully rubbed an ankle with a stockinged toe he reposed in the state of matrimony like a lump of unblended suet in a pudding this was his level elysiumto sit at ease vicariously girdling the world in print amid the wifely splashing of suds and the agreeable smells of breakfast dishes departed and dinner ones to come many ideas were far from his mind but the furthest one was the thought of beating his wife  mrs fink turned on the hot water and set the washboards in the suds up from the flat below came the gay laugh of mrs cassidy it sounded like a taunt a flaunting of her own happiness in the face of the unslugged bride above now was mrs finks time  suddenly she turned like a fury upon the man reading  you lazy loafer she cried must i work my arms off washing and toiling for the ugly likes of you are you a man or are you a kitchen hound  mr fink dropped his paper motionless from surprise she feared that he would not strikethat the provocation had been insufficient she leaped at him and struck him fiercely in the face with her clenched hand in that instant she felt a thrill of love for him such as she had not felt for many a day rise up martin fink and come into your kingdom oh she must feel the weight of his hand nowjust to show that he caredjust to show that he cared  mr fink sprang to his feetmaggie caught him again on the jaw with a wide swing of her other hand she closed her eyes in that fearful blissful moment before his blow should comeshe whispered his name to herselfshe leaned to the expected shock hungry for it  in the flat below mr cassidy with a shamed and contrite face was powdering mames eye in preparation for their junket from the flat above came the sound of a womans voice highraised a bumping a stumbling and a shuffling a chair overturnedunmistakable sounds of domestic conflict  mart and mag scrapping postulated mr cassidy didnt know they ever indulged shall i trot up and see if they need a sponge holder  one of mrs cassidys eyes sparkled like a diamond the other twinkled at least like paste  oh oh she said softly and without apparent meaning in the feminine ejaculatory manner i wonder ifwonder if wait jack till i go up and see  up the stairs she sped as her foot struck the hallway above out from the kitchen door of her flat wildly flounced mrs fink  oh maggie cried mrs cassidy in a delighted whisper did he oh did he  mrs fink ran and laid her face upon her chums shoulder and sobbed hopelessly  mrs cassidy took maggies face between her hands and lifted it gently tearstained it was flushing and paling but its velvety pinkandwhite becomingly freckled surface was unscratched unbruised unmarred by the recreant fist of mr fink  tell me maggie pleaded mame or ill go in there and find out what was it did he hurt youwhat did he do  mrs finks face went down again despairingly on the bosom of her friend  for gods sake dont open that door mame she sobbed and dont ever tell nobodykeep it under your hat hehe never touched me andhesoh gawdhes washin the clotheshes washin the clothes     the guilty party   a redhaired unshaven untidy man sat in a rocking chair by a window he had just lighted a pipe and was puffing blue clouds with great satisfaction he had removed his shoes and donned a pair of blue faded carpetslippers with the morbid thirst of the confirmed daily news drinker he awkwardly folded back the pages of an evening paper eagerly gulping down the strong black headlines to be followed as a chaser by the milder details of the smaller type  in an adjoining room a woman was cooking supper odors from strong bacon and boiling coffee contended against the cutplug fumes from the vespertine pipe  outside was one of those crowded streets of the east side in which as twilight falls satan sets up his recruiting office a mighty host of children danced and ran and played in the street some in rags some in clean white and beribboned some wild and restless as young hawks some gentlefaced and shrinking some shrieking rude and sinful words some listening awed but soon grown familiar to embracehere were the children playing in the corridors of the house of sin above the playground forever hovered a great bird the bird was known to humorists as the stork but the people of chrystie street were better ornithologists they called it a vulture  a little girl of twelve came up timidly to the man reading and resting by the window and said  papa wont you play a game of checkers with me if you arent too tired  the redhaired unshaven untidy man sitting shoeless by the window answered with a frown  checkers no i wont cant a man who works hard all day have a little rest when he comes home why dont you go out and play with the other kids on the sidewalk  the woman who was cooking came to the door  john she said i dont like for lizzie to play in the street they learn too much there that aint good for em shes been in the house all day long it seems that you might give up a little of your time to amuse her when you come home  let her go out and play like the rest of em if she wants to be amused said the redhaired unshaven untidy man and dont bother me                                                     youre on said kid mullaly fifty dollars to 25 i take annie to the dance put up  the kids black eyes were snapping with the fire of the baited and challenged he drew out his roll and slapped five tens upon the bar the three or four young fellows who were thus taken more slowly produced their stake the bartender exofficio stakeholder took the money laboriously wrapped it recorded the bet with an inchlong pencil and stuffed the whole into a corner of the cash register  and oh whatll be done to youll be a plenty said a bettor with anticipatory glee  thats my lookout said the kid sternly fill em up all around mike  after the round burke the kids sponge spongeholder pal mentor and grand vizier drew him out to the bootblack stand at the saloon corner where all the official and important matters of the small hours social club were settled as tony polished the light tan shoes of the clubs president and secretary for the fifth time that day burke spake words of wisdom to his chief  cut that blond out kid was his advice or therell be trouble what do you want to throw down that girl of yours for youll never find one thatll freeze to you like liz has shes worth a hallful of annies  im no annie admirer said the kid dropping a cigarette ash on his polished toe and wiping it off on tonys shoulder but i want to teach liz a lesson she thinks i belong to her shes been bragging that i darent speak to another girl liz is all rightin some ways shes drinking a little too much lately and she uses language that a lady oughtnt  youre engaged aint you asked burke  sure well get married next year maybe  i saw you make her drink her first glass of beer said burke that was two years ago when she used to came down to the corner of chrystie bareheaded to meet you after supper she was a quiet sort of a kid then and couldnt speak without blushing  shes a little spitfire sometimes now said the kid i hate jealousy thats why im going to the dance with annie itll teach her some sense  well you better look a little out were burkes last words if liz was my girl and i was to sneak out to a dance coupled up with an annie id want a suit of chain armor on under my gladsome rags all right  through the land of the storkvulture wandered liz her black eyes searched the passing crowds fierily but vaguely now and then she hummed bars of foolish little songs between times she set her small white teeth together and spake crisp words that the east side has added to language  lizs skirt was green silk her waist was a large brownandpink plaid wellfitting and not without style she wore a cluster ring of huge imitation rubies and a locket that banged her knees at the bottom of a silver chain her shoes were run down over twisted high heels and were strangers to polish her hat would scarcely have passed into a flour barrel  the family entrance of the blue jay café received her at a table she sat and punched the button with the air of milady ringing for her carriage the waiter came with his largechinned lowvoiced manner of respectful familiarity liz smoothed her silken skirt with a satisfied wriggle she made the most of it here she could order and be waited upon it was all that her world offered her of the prerogative of woman  whiskey tommy she said as her sisters further uptown murmur champagne james  sure miss lizzie whatll the chaser be  seltzer and say tommy has the kid been around today  why no miss lizzie i havent saw him today  fluently came the miss lizzie for the kid was known to be one who required rigid upholdment of the dignity of his fiancee  im lookin for m said liz after the chaser had sputtered under her nose its got to me that he says hell take annie karlson to the dance let him the pinkeyed white rat im lookin

repeated liz softening a little to sentiment under the magic of the distillers art i always used to play out on the street of evenins cause there was nothin doin for me at home for a long time i just sat on doorsteps and looked at the lights and the people goin by and then the kid came along one evenin and sized me up and i was mashed on the spot for fair the first drink he made me take i cried all night at home and got a lickin for makin a noise and nowsay tommy you ever see this annie karlson if it wasnt for peroxide the chloroform limit would have put her out long ago oh im lookin for m you tell the kid if he comes in me ill cut his heart out leave it to me another whiskey tommy  a little unsteadily but with watchful and brilliant eyes liz walked up the avenue on the doorstep of a brick tenement a curlyhaired child sat puzzling over the convolutions of a tangled string liz flopped down beside her with a crooked shifting smile on her flushed face but her eyes had grown clear and artless of a sudden  let me show you how to make a catscradle kid she said tucking her green silk skirt under her rusty shoes  and while they sat there the lights were being turned on for the dance in the hall of the small hours social club it was the bimonthly dance a dress affair in which the members took great pride and bestirred themselves huskily to further and adorn  at 9 oclock the president kid mullaly paced upon the floor with a lady on his arm as the loreleys was her hair golden her yes was softened to a yah but its quality of assent was patent to the most milesian ears she stepped upon her own train and blushed andshe smiled into the eyes of kid mullaly  and then as the two stood in the middle of the waxed floor the thing happened to prevent which many lamps are burning nightly in many studies and libraries  out from the circle of spectators in the hall leaped fate in a green silk skirt under the nom de guerre of liz her eyes were hard and blacker than jet she did not scream or waver most unwomanly she cried out one oaththe kids own favorite oathand in his own deep voice and then while the small hours social club went frantically to pieces she made good her boast to tommy the waitermade good as far as the length of her knife blade and the strength of her arm permitted  and next came the primal instinct of selfpreservationor was it selfannihilation the instinct that society has grafted on the natural branch  liz ran out and down the street swift and true as a woodcock flying through a grove of saplings at dusk  and then followed the big citys biggest shame its most ancient and rotten surviving canker its pollution and disgrace its blight and perversion its forever infamy and guilt fostered unreproved and cherished handed down from a longago century of the basest barbaritythe hue and cry nowhere but in the big cities does it survive and here most of all where the ultimate perfection of culture citizenship and alleged superiority joins bawling in the chase  they pursueda shrieking mob of fathers mothers lovers and maidenshowling yelling calling whistling crying for blood well may the wolf in the big city stand outside the door well may his heart the gentler falter at the siege  knowing her way and hungry for her surcease she darted down the familiar ways until at last her feet struck the dull solidity of the rotting pier and then it was but a few more panting stepsand good mother east river took liz to her bosom soothed her muddily but quickly and settled in five minutes the problem that keeps lights burning o nights in thousands of pastorates and colleges                                                     its mighty funny what kind of dreams one has sometimes poets call them visions but a vision is only a dream in blank verse i dreamed the rest of this story  i thought i was in the next world i dont know how i got there i suppose i had been riding on the ninth avenue elevated or taking patent medicine or trying to pull jim jeffriess nose or doing some such little injudicious stunt but anyhow there i was and there was a great crowd of us outside the courtroom where the judgments were going on and every now and then a very beautiful and imposing courtofficer angel would come outside the door and call another case  while i was considering my own worldly sins and wondering whether there would be any use of my trying to prove an alibi by claiming that i lived in new jersey the bailiff angel came to the door and sang out  case no 99852743  up stepped a plainclothes manthere were lots of em there dressed exactly like preachers and hustling us spirits around just like cops do on earthand by the arm he draggedwhom do you think why liz  the court officer took her inside and closed the door i went up to mr flycop and inquired about the case  a very sad one says he laying the points of his manicured fingers together an utterly incorrigible girl i am special terrestrial officer the reverend jones the case was assigned to me the girl murdered her fiance and committed suicide she had no defense my report to the court relates the facts in detail all of which are substantiated by reliable witnesses the wages of sin is death praise the lord  the court officer opened the door and stepped out  poor girl said special terrestrial officer the reverend jones with a tear in his eye it was one of the saddest cases that i ever met with of course she was  discharged said the court officer come here jonesy first thing you know youll be switched to the potpie squad how would you like to be on the missionary force in the south sea islandshey now you quit making these false arrests or youll be transferredsee the guilty party youve not to look for in this case is a redhaired unshaven untidy man sitting by the window reading in his stocking feet while his children play in the streets get a move on you  now wasnt that a silly dream     according to their lights   somewhere in the depths of the big city where the unquiet dregs are forever being shaken together young murray and the captain had met and become friends both were at the lowest ebb possible to their fortunes both had fallen from at least an intermediate heaven of respectability and importance and both were typical products of the monstrous and peculiar social curriculum of their overweening and bumptious civic alma mater  the captain was no longer a captain one of those sudden moral cataclysms that sometimes sweep the city had hurled him from a high and profitable position in the police department ripping off his badge and buttons and washing into the hands of his lawyers the solid pieces of real estate that his frugality had enabled him to accumulate the passing of the flood left him low and dry one month after his dishabilitation a saloonkeeper plucked him by the neck from his freelunch counter as a tabby plucks a strange kitten from her nest and cast him asphaltward this seems low enough but after that he acquired a pair of cloth top button congress gaiters and wrote complaining letters to the newspapers and then he fought the attendant at the municipal lodging house who tried to give him a bath when murray first saw him he was holding the hand of an italian woman who sold apples and garlic on essex street and quoting the words of a song book ballad  murrays fall had been more luciferian if less spectacular all the pretty tiny little kickshaws of gotham had once been his the megaphone man roars out at you to observe the house of his uncle on a grand and revered avenue but there had been an awful row about something and the prince had been escorted to the door by the butler which in said avenue is equivalent to the impact of the avuncular shoe a weak prince hal without inheritance or sword he drifted downward to meet his humorless falstaff and to pick the crusts of the streets with him  one evening they sat on a bench in a little downtown park the great bulk of the captain which starvation seemed to increasedrawing irony instead of pity to his petitions for aidwas heaped against the arm of the bench in a shapeless mass his red face spotted by tufts of vermilion weekold whiskers and topped by a sagging white straw hat looked in the gloom like one of those structures that you may observe in a dark third avenue window challenging your imagination to say whether it be something recent in the way of ladies hats or a strawberry shortcake a tightdrawn beltlast relic of his official sprucenessmade a deep furrow in his circumference the captains shoes were buttonless in a smothered bass he cursed his star of illluck  murray at his side was shrunk into his dingy and ragged suit of blue serge his hat was pulled low he sat quiet and a little indistinct like some ghost that had been dispossessed  im hungry growled the captainby the top sirloin of the bull of bashan im starving to death right now i could eat a bowery restaurant clear through to the stovepipe in the alley cant you think of nothing murray you sit there with your shoulders scrunched up giving an imitation of reginald vanderbilt driving his coachwhat good are them airs doing you now think of some place we can get something to chew  you forget my dear captain said murray without moving that our last attempt at dining was at my suggestion  you bet it was groaned the captain you bet your life it was have you got any more like that to makehey  i admit we failed sighed murray i was sure malone would be good for one more free lunch after the way he talked baseball with me the last time i spent a nickel in his establishment  i had this hand said the captain extending the unfortunate memberi had this hand on the drumstick of a turkey and two sardine sandwiches when them waiters grabbed us  i was within two inches of the olives said murray stuffed olives i havent tasted one in a year  whatll we do grumbled the captain we cant starve  cant we said murray quietly im glad to hear that i was afraid we could  you wait here said the captain rising heavily and puffily to his feet im going to try to make one more turn you stay here till i come back murray i wont be over half an hour if i turn the trick ill come back flush  he made some elephantine attempts at smartening his appearance he gave his fiery mustache a heavenward twist he dragged into sight a pair of blackedged cuffs deepened the crease in his middle by tightening his belt another hole and set off jaunty as a zoo rhinoceros across the south end of the park  when he was out of sight murray also left the park hurrying swiftly eastward he stopped at a building whose steps were flanked by two green lights  a police captain named maroney he said to the desk sergeant was dismissed from the force after being tried under charges three years ago i believe sentence was suspended is this man wanted now by the police  why are ye asking inquired the sergeant with a frown  i thought there might be a reward standing explained murray easily i know the man well he seems to be keeping himself pretty shady at present i could lay my hands on him at any time if there should be a reward  theres no reward interrupted the sergeant shortly the mans not wanted and neither are ye so get out ye are frindly with um and ye would be selling um out with ye quick or ill give ye a start  murray gazed at the officer with serene and virtuous dignity  i would be simply doing my duty as a citizen and gentleman he said severely if i could assist the law in laying hold of one of its offenders  murray hurried back to the bench in the park he folded his arms and shrank within his clothes to his ghostlike presentment  ten minutes afterward the captain arrived at the rendezvous windy and thunderous as a dogday in kansas his collar had been torn away his straw hat had been twisted and battered his shirt with oxblood stripes split to the waist and from head to knee he was drenched with some vile and ignoble greasy fluid that loudly proclaimed to the nose its component leaven of garlic and kitchen stuff  for heavens sake captain sniffed murray i doubt that i would have waited for you if i had suspected you were so desperate as to resort to swill barrels i  cheese it said the captain harshly im not hogging it yet its all on the outside i went around on essex and proposed marriage to that catrina thats got the fruit shop there now that business could be built up shes a peach as far as a dago could be i thought i had that senoreena mashed sure last week but look what she done to me i guess i got too fresh well theres another scheme queered  you dont mean to say said murray with infinite contempt that you would have married that woman to help yourself out of your disgraceful troubles  me said the captain id marry the empress of china for one bowl of chop suey id commit murder for a plate of beef stew id steal a wafer from a waif id be a mormon for a bowl of chowder  i think said murray resting his head on his hands that i would play judas for the price of one drink of whiskey for thirty pieces of silver i would  oh come now exclaimed the captain in dismay you wouldnt do that murray i always thought that kikes squeal on his boss was about the lowestdown play that ever happened a man that gives his friend away is worse than a pirate  through the park stepped a large man scanning the benches where the electric light fell  is that you mac he said halting before the derelicts his diamond stickpin dazzled his diamondstudded fob chain assisted he was big and smooth and well fed yes i see its you he continued they told me at mikes that i might find you over here let me see you a few minutes mac  the captain lifted himself with a grunt of alacrity if charlie finnegan had come down in the bottomless pit to seek him there must be something doing charlie guided him by an arm into a patch of shadow  you know mac he said theyre trying inspector pickering on graft charges  he was my inspector said the captain  oshea wants the job went on finnegan he must have it its for the good of the organization pickering must go under your testimony will do it he was your man higher up when you were on the force his share of the boodle passed through your hands you must go on the stand and testify against him  he wasbegan the captain  wait a minute said finnegan a bundle of yellowish stuff came out of his inside pocket five hundred dollars in it for you twofifty on the spot and the rest  he was my friend i say finished the captain ill see you and the gang and the city and the party in the flames of hades before ill take the stand against dan pickering im down and out but im no traitor to a man thats been my friend the captains voice rose and boomed like a split trombone get out of this park charlie finnegan where us thieves and tramps and boozers are your betters and take your dirty money with you  finnegan drifted out by another walk the captain returned to his seat  i couldnt avoid hearing said murray drearily i think you are the biggest fool i ever saw  what would you have done asked the captain  nailed pickering to the cross said murray  sonny said the captain huskily and without heat you and me are different new york is divided into two partsabove fortysecond street and below fourteenth you come from the other part we both act according to our lights  an illuminated clock above the trees retailed the information that it lacked the half hour of twelve both men rose from the bench and moved away together as if seized by the same idea they left the park struck through a narrow cross street and came into broadway at this hour as dark echoing and depeopled as a byway in pompeii  northward they turned and a policeman who glanced at their unkempt and slinking figures withheld the attention and suspicion that he would have granted them at any other hour and place for on every street in that part of the city other unkempt and slinking figures were shuffling and hurrying toward a converging pointa point that is marked by no monument save that groove on the pavement worn by tens of thousands of waiting feet  at ninth street a tall man wearing an opera hat alighted from a broadway car and turned his face westward but he saw murray pounced upon him and dragged him under a street light the captain lumbered slowly to the corner like a wounded bear and waited growling  jerry cried the hatted one how fortunate i was to begin a search for you tomorrow the old gentleman has capitulated youre to be restored to favor congratulate you come to the office in the morning and get all the money you want ive liberal instructions in that respect  and the little matrimonial arrangement said murray with his head turned sidewise  whyerwell of course your uncle understandsexpects that the engagement between you and miss vanderhurst shall be  good night said murray moving away  you madman cried the other catching his arm would you give up two millions on account of  did you ever see her nose old man asked murray solemnly  but listen to reason jerry miss vanderhurst is an heiress and  did you ever see it  yes i admit that her nose isnt  good night said murray my friend is waiting for me i am quoting him when i authorize you to report that there is nothing doing good night  a wriggling line of waiting men extended from a door in tenth street far up broadway on the outer edge of the pavement the captain and murray fell in at the tail of the quivering millipede  twenty feet longer than it was last night said murray looking up at his measuring angle of grace church  half an hour growled the captain before we get our punk  the city clocks began to strike 12 the bread line moved forward slowly its leathern feet sliding on the stones with the sound of a hissing serpent as they who had lived according to their lights closed up in the rear     a midsummer knights dream       the knights are dead      their swords are rust      except a few who have to hust      le all the time      to raise the dust   dear reader it was summertime the sun glared down upon the city with pitiless ferocity it is difficult for the sun to be ferocious and exhibit compunction simultaneously the heat wasoh bother thermometerswho cares for standard measures anyhow it was so hot that  the roof gardens put on so many extra waiters that you could hope to get your gin fizz nowas soon as all the other people got theirs the hospitals were putting in extra cots for bystanders for when little woolly dogs loll their tongues out and say woof woof at the fleas that bite em and nervous old black bombazine ladies screech mad dog and policemen begin to shoot somebody is going to get hurt the man from pompton nj who always wears an overcoat in july had turned up in a broadway hotel drinking hot scotches and enjoying his annual ray from the calcium philanthropists were petitioning the legislature to pass a bill requiring builders to make tenement fireescapes more commodious so that families might die all together of the heat instead of one or two at a time so many men were telling you about the number of baths they took each day that you wondered how they got along after the real lessee of the apartment came back to town and thanked em for taking such good care of it the young man who called loudly for cold beef and beer in the restaurant protesting that roast pullet and burgundy was really too heavy for such weather blushed when he met your eye for you had heard him all winter calling in modest tones for the same ascetic viands soup pocketbooks shirt waists actors and baseball excuses grew thinner yes it was summertime  a man stood at thirtyfourth street waiting for a downtown car a man of forty grayhaired pinkfaced keen nervous plainly dressed with a harassed look around the eyes he wiped his forehead and laughed loudly when a fat man with an outing look stopped and spoke with him  no siree he shouted with defiance and scorn none of your old mosquitohaunted swamps and skyscraper mountains without elevators for me when i want to get away from hot weather i know how to do it new york sir is the finest summer resort in the country keep in the shade and watch your diet and dont get too far away from an electric fan talk about your adirondacks and your catskills theres more solid comfort in the borough of manhattan than in all the rest of the country together no siree no tramping up perpendicular cliffs and being waked up at 4 in the morning by a million flies and eating canned goods straight from the city for me little old new york will take a few select summer boarders comforts and conveniences of homesthats the ad that i answer every time  you need a vacation said the fat man looking closely at the other you havent been away from town in years better come with me for two weeks anyhow the trout in the beaverkill are jumping at anything now that looks like a fly harding writes me that he landed a threepound brown last week  nonsense cried the other man go ahead if you like and boggle around in rubber boots wearing yourself out trying to catch fish when i want one i go to a cool restaurant and order it i laugh at you fellows whenever i think of you hustling around in the heat in the country thinking you are having a good time for me father knickerbockers little improved farm with the big shady lane running through the middle of it  the fat man sighed over his friend and went his way the man who thought new york was the greatest summer resort in the country boarded a car and went buzzing down to his office on the way he threw away his newspaper and looked up at a ragged patch of sky above the housetops  three pounds he muttered absently and harding isnt a liar i believe if i couldbut its impossibletheyve got to have another monthanother month at least  in his office the upholder of urban midsummer joys dived headforemost into the swimming pool of business adkins his clerk came and added a spray of letters memoranda and telegrams  at 5 oclock in the afternoon the busy man leaned back in his office chair put his feet on the desk and mused aloud  i wonder what kind of bait harding used                                                     she was all in white that day and thereby compton lost a bet to gaines compton had wagered she would wear light blue for she knew that was his favorite color and compton was a millionaires son and that almost laid him open to the charge of betting on a sure thing but white was her choice and gaines held up his head with twentyfives lordly air  the little summer hotel in the mountains had a lively crowd that year there were two or three young college men and a couple of artists and a young naval officer on one side on the other there were enough beauties among the young ladies for the correspondent of a society paper to refer to them as a bevy but the moon among the stars was mary sewell each one of the young men greatly desired to arrange matters so that he could pay her millinery bills and fix the furnace and have her do away with the sewell part of her name forever those who could stay only a week or two went away hinting at pistols and blighted hearts but compton stayed like the mountains themselves for he could afford it and gaines stayed because he was a fighter and wasnt afraid of millionaires sons andwell he adored the country  what do you think miss mary he said once i knew a duffer in new york who claimed to like it in the summer time said you could keep cooler there than you could in the woods wasnt he an awful silly i dont think i could breathe on broadway after the 1st of june  mamma was thinking of going back week after next said miss mary with a lovely frown  but when you think of it said gaines there are lots of jolly places in town in the summer the roof gardens you know and theerthe roof gardens  deepest blue was the lake that daythe day when they had the mock tournament and the men rode clumsy farm horses around in a glade in the woods and caught curtain rings on the end of a lance such fun  cool and dry as the finest wine came the breath of the shadowed forest the valley below was a vision seen through an opal haze a white mist from hidden falls blurred the green of a hands breadth of tree tops halfway down the gorge youth made merry handinhand with young summer nothing on broadway like that  the villagers gathered to see the city folks pursue their mad drollery the woods rang with the laughter of pixies and naiads and sprites gaines caught most of the rings his was the privilege to crown the queen of the tournament he was the conquering knightas far as the rings went on his arm he wore a white scarf compton wore light blue she had declared her preference for blue but she wore white that day  gaines looked about for the queen to crown her he heard her merry laugh as if from the clouds she had slipped away and climbed chimney rock a little granite bluff and stood there a white fairy among the laurels fifty feet above their heads  instantly he and compton accepted the implied challenge the bluff was easily mounted at the rear but the front offered small hold to hand or foot each man quickly selected his route and began to climb a crevice a bush a slight projection a vine or tree branchall of these were aids that counted in the race it was all foolerythere was no stake but there was youth in it cross reader and light hearts and something else that miss clay writes so charmingly about  gaines gave a great tug at the root of a laurel and pulled himself to miss marys feet on his arm he carried the wreath of roses and while the villagers and summer boarders screamed and applauded below he placed it on the queens brow  you are a gallant knight said miss mary  if i could be your true knight always began gaines but miss mary laughed him dumb for compton scrambled over the edge of the rock one minute behind time  what a twilight that was when they drove back to the hotel the opal of the valley turned slowly to purple the dark woods framed the lake as a mirror the tonic air stirred the very soul in one the first pale stars came out over the mountain tops where yet a faint glow of                                                     i beg your pardon mr gaines said adkins  the man who believed new york to be the finest summer resort in the world opened his eyes and kicked over the mucilage bottle on his desk  ii believe i was asleep he said  its the heat said adkins its something awful in the city these  nonsense said the other the city beats the country ten to one in summer fools go out tramping in muddy brooks and wear themselves out trying to catch little fish as long as your finger stay in town and keep comfortablethats my idea  some letters just came said adkins i thought you might like to glance at them before you go  let us look over his shoulder and read just a few lines of one of them      my dear dear husband just received your letter ordering us to    stay another month    ritas cough is almost gone    johnny    has simply gone wild like a little indian    will be the    making of both children    work so hard and i know that your    business can hardly afford to keep us here so long    best man    that ever    you always pretend that you like the city in    summer    trout fishing that you used to be so fond of       and all to keep us well and happy    come to you if it were    not doing the babies so much good    i stood last evening on    chimney rock in exactly the same spot where i was when you put    the wreath of roses on my head    through all the world       when you said you would be my true knight    fifteen years    ago dear just think    have always been that to me       ever and ever     mary   the man who said he thought new york the finest summer resort in the country dropped into a café on his way home and had a glass of beer under an electric fan  wonder what kind of a fly old harding used he said to himself     the last leaf   in a little district west of washington square the streets have run crazy and broken themselves into small strips called places these places make strange angles and curves one street crosses itself a time or two an artist once discovered a valuable possibility in this street suppose a collector with a bill for paints paper and canvas should in traversing this route suddenly meet himself coming back without a cent having been paid on account  so to quaint old greenwich village the art people soon came prowling hunting for north windows and eighteenthcentury gables and dutch attics and low rents then they imported some pewter mugs and a chafing dish or two from sixth avenue and became a colony  at the top of a squatty threestory brick sue and johnsy had their studio johnsy was familiar for joanna one was from maine the other from california they had met at the table dhote of an eighth street delmonicos and found their tastes in art chicory salad and bishop sleeves so congenial that the joint studio resulted  that was in may in november a cold unseen stranger whom the doctors called pneumonia stalked about the colony touching one here and there with his icy fingers over on the east side this ravager strode boldly smiting his victims by scores but his feet trod slowly through the maze of the narrow and mossgrown places  mr pneumonia was not what you would call a chivalric old gentleman a mite of a little woman with blood thinned by california zephyrs was hardly fair game for the redfisted shortbreathed old duffer but johnsy he smote and she lay scarcely moving on her painted iron bedstead looking through the small dutch windowpanes at the blank side of the next brick house  one morning the busy doctor invited sue into the hallway with a shaggy gray eyebrow  she has one chance inlet us say ten he said as he shook down the mercury in his clinical thermometer and that chance is for her to want to live this way people have of liningup on the side of the undertaker makes the entire pharmacopeia look silly your little lady has made up her mind that shes not going to get well has she anything on her mind  sheshe wanted to paint the bay of naples some day said sue  paintbosh has she anything on her mind worth thinking about twicea man for instance  a man said sue with a jewsharp twang in her voice is a man worthbut no doctor there is nothing of the kind  well it is the weakness then said the doctor i will do all that science so far as it may filter through my efforts can accomplish but whenever my patient begins to count the carriages in her funeral procession i subtract 50 per cent from the curative power of medicines if you will get her to ask one question about the new winter styles in cloak sleeves i will promise you a oneinfive chance for her instead of one in ten  after the doctor had gone sue went into the workroom and cried a japanese napkin to a pulp then she swaggered into johnsys room with her drawing board whistling ragtime  johnsy lay scarcely making a ripple under the bedclothes with her face toward the window sue stopped whistling thinking she was asleep  she arranged her board and began a penandink drawing to illustrate a magazine story young artists must pave their way to art by drawing pictures for magazine stories that young authors write to pave their way to literature  as sue was sketching a pair of elegant horseshow riding trousers and a monocle on the figure of the hero an idaho cowboy she heard a low sound several times repeated she went quickly to the bedside  johnsys eyes were open wide she was looking out the window and countingcounting backward  twelve she said and a little later eleven and then ten and nine and then eight and seven almost together  sue looked solicitously out the window what was there to count there was only a bare dreary yard to be seen and the blank side of the brick house twenty feet away an old old ivy vine gnarled and decayed at the roots climbed half way up the brick wall the cold breath of autumn had stricken its leaves from the vine until its skeleton branches clung almost bare to the crumbling bricks  what is it dear asked sue  six said johnsy in almost a whisper theyre falling faster now three days ago there were almost a hundred it made my head ache to count them but now its easy there goes another one there are only five left now  five what dear tell your sudie  leaves on the ivy vine when the last one falls i must go too ive known that for three days didnt the doctor tell you  oh i never heard of such nonsense complained sue with magnificent scorn what have old ivy leaves to do with your getting well and you used to love that vine so you naughty girl dont be a goosey why the doctor told me this morning that your chances for getting well real soon werelets see exactly what he saidhe said the chances were ten to one why thats almost as good a chance as we have in new york when we ride on the street cars or walk past a new building try to take some broth now and let sudie go back to her drawing so she can sell the editor man with it and buy port wine for her sick child and pork chops for her greedy self  you neednt get any more wine said johnsy keeping her eyes fixed out the window there goes another no i dont want any broth that leaves just four i want to see the last one fall before it gets dark then ill go too  johnsy dear said sue bending over her will you promise me to keep your eyes closed and not look out the window until i am done working i must hand those drawings in by tomorrow i need the light or i would draw the shade down  couldnt you draw in the other room asked johnsy coldly  id rather be here by you said sue besides i dont want you to keep looking at those silly ivy leaves  tell me as soon as you have finished said johnsy closing her eyes and lying white and still as a fallen statue because i want to see the last one fall im tired of waiting im tired of thinking i want to turn loose my hold on everything and go sailing down down just like one of those poor tired leaves  try to sleep said sue i must call behrman up to be my model for the old hermit miner ill not be gone a minute dont try to move till i come back  old behrman was a painter who lived on the ground floor beneath them he was past sixty and had a michael angelos moses beard curling down from the head of a satyr along the body of an imp behrman was a failure in art forty years he had wielded the brush without getting near enough to touch the hem of his mistresss robe he had been always about to paint a masterpiece but had never yet begun it for several years he had painted nothing except now and then a daub in the line of commerce or advertising he earned a little by serving as a model to those young artists in the colony who could not pay the price of a professional he drank gin to excess and still talked of his coming masterpiece for the rest he was a fierce little old man who scoffed terribly at softness in any one and who regarded himself as especial mastiffinwaiting to protect the two young artists in the studio above  sue found behrman smelling strongly of juniper berries in his dimly lighted den below in one corner was a blank canvas on an easel that had been waiting there for twentyfive years to receive the first line of the masterpiece she told him of johnsys fancy and how she feared she would indeed light and fragile as a leaf herself float away when her slight hold upon the world grew weaker  old behrman with his red eyes plainly streaming shouted his contempt and derision for such idiotic imaginings  vass he cried is dere people in de world mit der foolishness to die because leafs dey drop off from a confounded vine i haf not heard of such a thing no i will not bose as a model for your fool hermitdunderhead vy do you allow dot silly pusiness to come in der prain of her ach dot poor lettle miss johnsy  she is very ill and weak said sue and the fever has left her mind morbid and full of strange fancies very well mr behrman if you do not care to pose for me you neednt but i think you are a horrid oldold flibbertigibbet  you are just like a woman yelled behrman who said i will not bose go on i come mit you for half an hour i haf peen trying to say dot i am ready to bose gott dis is not any blace in which one so goot as miss yohnsy shall lie sick some day i vill baint a masterpiece and ve shall all go away gott yes  johnsy was sleeping when they went upstairs sue pulled the shade down to the windowsill and motioned behrman into the other room in there they peered out the window fearfully at the ivy vine then they looked at each other for a moment without speaking a persistent cold rain was falling mingled with snow behrman in his old blue shirt took his seat as the hermitminer on an upturned kettle for a rock  when sue awoke from an hours sleep the next morning she found johnsy with dull wideopen eyes staring at the drawn green shade  pull it up i want to see she ordered in a whisper  wearily sue obeyed  but lo after the beating rain and fierce gusts of wind that had endured through the livelong night there yet stood out against the brick wall one ivy leaf it was the last on the vine still dark green near its stem but with its serrated edges tinted with the yellow of dissolution and decay it hung bravely from a branch some twenty feet above the ground  it is the last one said johnsy i thought it would surely fall during the night i heard the wind it will fall today and i shall die at the same time  dear dear said sue leaning her worn face down to the pillow think of me if you wont think of yourself what would i do  but johnsy did not answer the lonesomest thing in all the world is a soul when it is making ready to go on its mysterious far journey the fancy seemed to possess her more strongly as one by one the ties that bound her to friendship and to earth were loosed  the day wore away and even through the twilight they could see the lone ivy leaf clinging to its stem against the wall and then with the coming of the night the north wind was again loosed while the rain still beat against the windows and pattered down from the low dutch eaves  when it was light enough johnsy the merciless commanded that the shade be raised  the ivy leaf was still there  johnsy lay for a long time looking at it and then she called to sue who was stirring her chicken broth over the gas stove  ive been a bad girl sudie said johnsy something has made that last leaf stay there to show me how wicked i was it is a sin to want to die you may bring me a little broth now and some milk with a little port in it andno bring me a handmirror first and then pack some pillows about me and i will sit up and watch you cook  an hour later she said  sudie some day i hope to paint the bay of naples  the doctor came in the afternoon and sue had an excuse to go into the hallway as he left  even chances said the doctor taking sues thin shaking hand in his with good nursing youll win and now i must see another case i have downstairs behrman his name issome kind of an artist i believe pneumonia too he is an old weak man and the attack is acute there is no hope for him but he goes to the hospital today to be made more comfortable  the next day the doctor said to sue shes out of danger youve won nutrition and care nowthats all  and that afternoon sue came to the bed where johnsy lay contentedly knitting a very blue and very useless woolen shoulder scarf and put one arm around her pillows and all  i have something to tell you white mouse she said mr behrman died of pneumonia today in the hospital he was ill only two days the janitor found him on the morning of the first day in his room downstairs helpless with pain his shoes and clothing were wet through and icy cold they couldnt imagine where he had been on such a dreadful night and then they found a lantern still lighted and a ladder that had been dragged from its place and some scattered brushes and a palette with green and yellow colors mixed on it andlook out the window dear at the last ivy leaf on the wall didnt you wonder why it never fluttered or moved when the wind blew ah darling its behrmans masterpiecehe painted it there the night that the last leaf fell     the count and the wedding guest   one evening when andy donovan went to dinner at his second avenue boardinghouse mrs scott introduced him to a new boarder a young lady miss conway miss conway was small and unobtrusive she wore a plain snuffybrown dress and bestowed her interest which seemed languid upon her plate she lifted her diffident eyelids and shot one perspicuous judicial glance at mr donovan politely murmured his name and returned to her mutton mr donovan bowed with the grace and beaming smile that were rapidly winning for him social business and political advancement and erased the snuffybrown one from the tablets of his consideration  two weeks later andy was sitting on the front steps enjoying his cigar there was a soft rustle behind and above him and andy turned his headand had his head turned  just coming out the door was miss conway she wore a nightblack dress of crêpe decrêpe deoh this thin black goods her hat was black and from it drooped and fluttered an ebon veil filmy as a spiders web she stood on the top step and drew on black silk gloves not a speck of white or a spot of color about her dress anywhere her rich golden hair was drawn with scarcely a ripple into a shining smooth knot low on her neck her face was plain rather than pretty but it was now illuminated and made almost beautiful by her large gray eyes that gazed above the houses across the street into the sky with an expression of the most appealing sadness and melancholy  gather the idea girlsall black you know with the preference for crêpe deoh crêpe de chinethats it all black and that sad faraway look and the hair shining under the black veil you have to be a blonde of course and try to look as if although your young life had been blighted just as it was about to give a hopskipandajump over the threshold of life a walk in the park might do you good and be sure to happen out the door at the right moment andoh itll fetch em every time but its fierce now how cynical i am aint itto talk about mourning costumes this way  mr donovan suddenly reinscribed miss conway upon the tablets of his consideration he threw away the remaining inchandaquarter of his cigar that would have been good for eight minutes yet and quickly shifted his center of gravity to his low cut patent leathers  its a fine clear evening miss conway he said and if the weather bureau could have heard the confident emphasis of his tones it would have hoisted the square white signal and nailed it to the mast  to them that has the heart to enjoy it it is mr donovan said miss conway with a sigh  mr donovan in his heart cursed fair weather heartless weather it should hail and blow and snow to be consonant with the mood of miss conway  i hope none of your relativesi hope you havent sustained a loss ventured mr donovan  death has claimed said miss conway hesitatingnot a relative but one whobut i will not intrude my grief upon you mr donovan  intrude protested mr donovan why say miss conway id be delighted that is id be sorryi mean im sure nobody could sympathize with you truer than i would  miss conway smiled a little smile and oh it was sadder than her expression in repose  laugh and the world laughs with you weep and they give you the laugh she quoted i have learned that mr donovan i have no friends or acquaintances in this city but you have been kind to me i appreciate it highly  he had passed her the pepper twice at the table  its tough to be alone in new yorkthats a cinch said mr donovan but saywhenever this little old town does loosen up and get friendly it goes the limit say you took a little stroll in the park miss conwaydont you think it might chase away some of your mullygrubs and if youd allow me  thanks mr donovan id be pleased to accept of your escort if you think the company of one whose heart is filled with gloom could be anyways agreeable to you  through the open gates of the ironrailed old downtown park where the elect once took the air they strolled and found a quiet bench  there is this difference between the grief of youth and that of old age youths burden is lightened by as much of it as another shares old age may give and give but the sorrow remains the same  he was my fiance confided miss conway at the end of an hour we were going to be married next spring i dont want you to think that i am stringing you mr donovan but he was a real count he had an estate and a castle in italy count fernando mazzini was his name i never saw the beat of him for elegance papa objected of course and once we eloped but papa overtook us and took us back i thought sure papa and fernando would fight a duel papa has a livery businessin pkipsee you know  finally papa came round all right and said we might be married next spring fernando showed him proofs of his title and wealth and then went over to italy to get the castle fixed up for us papas very proud and when fernando wanted to give me several thousand dollars for my trousseau he called him down something awful he wouldnt even let me take a ring or any presents from him and when fernando sailed i came to the city and got a position as cashier in a candy store  three days ago i got a letter from italy forwarded from pkipsee saying that fernando had been killed in a gondola accident  that is why i am in mourning my heart mr donovan will remain forever in his grave i guess i am poor company mr donovan but i cannot take any interest in no one i should not care to keep you from gayety and your friends who can smile and entertain you perhaps you would prefer to walk back to the house  now girls if you want to observe a young man hustle out after a pick and shovel just tell him that your heart is in some other fellows grave young men are graverobbers by nature ask any widow something must be done to restore that missing organ to weeping angels in crêpe de chine dead men certainly get the worst of it from all sides  im awfully sorry said mr donovan gently no we wont walk back to the house just yet and dont say you havent no friends in this city miss conway im awful sorry and i want you to believe im your friend and that im awful sorry  ive got his picture here in my locket said miss conway after wiping her eyes with her handkerchief i never showed it to anybody but i will to you mr donovan because i believe you to be a true friend  mr donovan gazed long and with much interest at the photograph in the locket that miss conway opened for him the face of count mazzini was one to command interest it was a smooth intelligent bright almost a handsome facethe face of a strong cheerful man who might well be a leader among his fellows  i have a larger one framed in my room said miss conway when we return i will show you that they are all i have to remind me of fernando but he ever will be present in my heart thats a sure thing  a subtle task confronted mr donovanthat of supplanting the unfortunate count in the heart of miss conway this his admiration for her determined him to do but the magnitude of the undertaking did not seem to weigh upon his spirits the sympathetic but cheerful friend was the rôle he essayed and he played it so successfully that the next halfhour found them conversing pensively across two plates of icecream though yet there was no diminution of the sadness in miss conways large gray eyes  before they parted in the hall that evening she ran upstairs and brought down the framed photograph wrapped lovingly in a white silk scarf mr donovan surveyed it with inscrutable eyes  he gave me this the night he left for italy said miss conway i had the one for the locket made from this  a finelooking man said mr donovan heartily how would it suit you miss conway to give me the pleasure of your company to coney next sunday afternoon  a month later they announced their engagement to mrs scott and the other boarders miss conway continued to wear black  a week after the announcement the two sat on the same bench in the downtown park while the fluttering leaves of the trees made a dim kinetoscopic picture of them in the moonlight but donovan had worn a look of abstracted gloom all day he was so silent tonight that loves lips could not keep back any longer the questions that loves heart propounded  whats the matter andy you are so solemn and grouchy tonight  nothing maggie  i know better cant i tell you never acted this way before what is it  its nothing much maggie  yes it is and i want to know ill bet its some other girl you are thinking about all right why dont you go get her if you want her take your arm away if you please  ill tell you then said andy wisely but i guess you wont understand it exactly youve heard of mike sullivan havent you big mike sullivan everybody calls him  no i havent said maggie and i dont want to if he makes you act like this who is he  hes the biggest man in new york said andy almost reverently he can about do anything he wants to with tammany or any other old thing in the political line hes a mile high and as broad as east river you say anything against big mike and youll have a million men on your collarbone in about two seconds why he made a visit over to the old country awhile back and the kings took to their holes like rabbits  well big mikes a friend of mine i aint more than deucehigh in the district as far as influence goes but mikes as good a friend to a little man or a poor man as he is to a big one i met him today on the bowery and what do you think he does comes up and shakes hands andy says he ive been keeping cases on you youve been putting in some good licks over on your side of the street and im proud of you whatll you take to drink he takes a cigar and i take a highball i told him i was going to get married in two weeks andy says he send me an invitation so ill keep in mind of it and ill come to the wedding thats what big mike says to me and he always does what he says  you dont understand it maggie but id have one of my hands cut off to have big mike sullivan at our wedding it would be the proudest day of my life when he goes to a mans wedding theres a guy being married thats made for life now thats why im maybe looking sore tonight  why dont you invite him then if hes so much to the mustard said maggie lightly  theres a reason why i cant said andy sadly theres a reason why he mustnt be there dont ask me what it is for i cant tell you  oh i dont care said maggie its something about politics of course but its no reason why you cant smile at me  maggie said andy presently do you think as much of me as you did of youras you did of the count mazzini  he waited a long time but maggie did not reply and then suddenly she leaned against his shoulder and began to cryto cry and shake with sobs holding his arm tightly and wetting the crêpe de chine with tears  there there there soothed andy putting aside his own trouble and what is it now  andy sobbed maggie ive lied to you and youll never marry me or love me any more but i feel that ive got to tell andy there never was so much as the little finger of a count i never had a beau in my life but all the other girls had and they talked about em and that seemed to make the fellows like em more and andy i look swell in blackyou know i do so i went out to a photograph store and bought that picture and had a little one made for my locket and made up all that story about the count and about his being killed so i could wear black and nobody can love a liar and youll shake me andy and ill die for shame oh there never was anybody i liked but youand thats all  but instead of being pushed away she found andys arm folding her closer she looked up and saw his face cleared and smiling  could youcould you forgive me andy  sure said andy its all right about that back to the cemetery for the count youve straightened everything out maggie i was in hopes you would before the weddingday bully girl  andy said maggie with a somewhat shy smile after she had been thoroughly assured of forgiveness did you believe all that story about the count  well not to any large extent said andy reaching for his cigar case because its big mike sullivans picture youve got in that locket of yours     the country of elusion   the cunning writer will choose an indefinable subject for he can then set down his theory of what it is and next at length his conception of what it is notand lo his paper is covered therefore let us follow the prolix and unmapable trail into that mooted country bohemia  grainger subeditor of docs magazine closed his rolltop desk put on his hat walked into the hall punched the down button and waited for the elevator  graingers day had been trying the chief had tried to ruin the magazine a dozen times by going against graingers ideas for running it a lady whose grandfather had fought with mcclellan had brought a portfolio of poems in person  grainger was curator of the lions house of the magazine that day he had lunched an arctic explorer a shortstory writer and the famous conductor of a slaughterhouse expose consequently his mind was in a whirl of icebergs maupassant and trichinosis  but there was a surcease and a recourse there was bohemia he would seek distraction there and lets seehe would call by for mary adrian  half an hour later he threaded his way like a brazilian orchidhunter through the palm forest in the tiled entrance hall of the idealia apartmenthouse one day the christeners of apartmenthouses and the cognominators of sleepingcars will meet and there will be some jealous and sanguinary knifing  the clerk breathed graingers name so languidly into the house telephone that it seemed it must surely drop from sheer inertia down to the janitors regions but at length it soared dilatorily up to miss adrians ear certainly mr grainger was to come up immediately  a colored maid with an elizacrossingtheice expression opened the door of the apartment for him grainger walked sideways down the narrow hall a bunch of burnt umber hair and a seagreen eye appeared in the crack of a door a long white undraped arm came out barring the way  so glad you came ricky instead of any of the others said the eye light a cigarette and give it to me going to take me to dinner fine go into the front room till i finish dressing but dont sit in your usual chair theres pie in itmeringue kappelman threw it at reeves last evening while he was reciting sophy has just come to straighten up is it lit thanks theres scotch on the manteloh no it isntthats chartreuse ask sophy to find you some i wont be long  grainger escaped the meringue as he waited his spirits sank still lower the atmosphere of the room was as vapid as a zephyr wandering over a vesuvian lavabed relics of some feast lay about the room scattered in places where even a prowling cat would have been surprised to find them a straggling cluster of deep red roses in a marmalade jar bowed their heads over tobacco ashes and unwashed goblets a chafingdish stood on the piano a leaf of sheet music supported a stack of sandwiches in a chair  mary came in dressed and radiant her gown was of that thin black fabric whose name through the change of a single vowel seems to summon visions ranging between the extremes of mans experience spelled with an ê it belongs to gallic witchery and diaphanous dreams with an a it drapes lamentation and woe  that evening they went to the café andré and as people would confide to you in a whisper that andrés was the only truly bohemian restaurant in town it may be well to follow them  andré began his professional career as a waiter in a bowery tencent eatinghouse had you seen him there you would have called him toughto yourself not aloud for he would have soaked you as quickly as he would have soaked his thumb in your coffee he saved money and started a basement table dhote in eighth or ninth street one afternoon andré drank too much absinthe he announced to his startled family that he was the grand llama of thibet therefore requiring an empty audience hall in which to be worshiped he moved all the tables and chairs from the restaurant into the back yard wrapped a red tablecloth around himself and sat on a stepladder for a throne when the diners began to arrive madame in a flurry of despair laid cloths and ushered them trembling outside between the tables clotheslines were stretched bearing the family wash a party of bohemia hunters greeted the artistic innovation with shrieks and acclamations of delight that weeks washing was not taken in for two years when andré came to his senses he had the menu printed on stiffly starched cuffs and served the ices in little wooden tubs next he took down his sign and darkened the front of the house when you went there to dine you fumbled for an electric button and pressed it a lookout slid open a panel in the door looked at you suspiciously and asked if you were acquainted with senator herodotus q mcmilligan of the chickasaw nation if you were you were admitted and allowed to dine if you were not you were admitted and allowed to dine there you have one of the abiding principles of bohemia when andré had accumulated 20000 he moved uptown near broadway in the fierce light that beats upon the throwndown there we find him and leave him with customers in pearls and automobile veils striving to catch his excellently graduated nod of recognition  there is a large round table in the northeast corner of andrés at which six can sit to this table grainger and mary adrian made their way kappelman and reeves were already there and miss tooker who designed the may cover for the ladies notathome magazine and mrs pothunter who never drank anything but black and white highballs being in mourning for her husband whooh ive forgotten what he diddied like as not  spaghettiweary reader wouldst take one pennyintheslot peep into the fair land of bohemia then look and when you think you have seen it you have not and it is neither thimbleriggery nor astigmatism  the walls of the café andré were covered with original sketches by the artists who furnished much of the color and sound of the place fair woman furnished the theme for the bulk of the drawings when you say sirens and siphons you come near to estimating the alliterative atmosphere of andrés  first i want you to meet my friend miss adrian miss tooker and mrs pothunter you already know while she tucks in the fingers of her elbow gloves you shall have her daguerreotype so faint and uncertain shall the portrait be  age somewhere between twentyseven and highneck evening dresses camaraderie in large buncheswhatever the fearful word may mean habitatanywhere from seattle to terra del fuego temperament unchartedshe let reeves squeeze her hand after he recited one of his poems but she counted the change after sending him out with a dollar to buy some pickled pigs feet deportment 75 out of a possible 100 morals 100  mary was one of the princesses of bohemia in the first place it was a royal and a daring thing to have been named mary there are twenty fifines and heloises to one mary in the country of elusion  now her gloves are tucked in miss tooker has assumed a june poster pose mrs pothunter has bitten her lips to make the red show reeves has several times felt his coat to make sure that his latest poem is in the pocket it had been neatly typewritten but he has copied it on the backs of letters with a pencil kappelman is underhandedly watching the clock it is ten minutes to nine when the hour comes it is to remind him of a story synopsis a french girl says to her suitor did you ask my father for my hand at nine oclock this morning as you said you would i did not he replies at nine oclock i was fighting a duel with swords in the bois de boulogne coward she hisses  the dinner was ordered you know how the bohemian feast of reason keeps up with the courses humor with the oysters wit with the soup repartee with the entrée brag with the roast knocks for whistler and kipling with the salad songs with the coffee the slapsticks with the cordials  between miss adrians eyebrows was the pucker that shows the intense strain it requires to be at ease in bohemia pat must come each sally mot and epigram every second of deliberation upon a reply costs you a bay leaf fine as a hair a line began to curve from her nostrils to her mouth to hold her own not a chance must be missed a sentence addressed to her must be as a piccolo each word of it a stop which she must be prepared to seize upon and play and she must always be quicker than a micmac indian to paddle the light canoe of conversation away from the rocks in the rapids that flow from the pierian spring for plodding reader the handwriting on the wall in the banquet hall of bohemia is laisser faire the gray ghost that sometimes peeps through the rings of smoke is that of slain old king convention freedom is the tyrant that holds them in slavery  as the dinner waned hands reached for the pepper cruet rather than for the shaker of attic salt miss tooker with an elbow to business leaned across the table toward grainger upsetting her glass of wine  now while you are fed and in good humor she said i want to make a suggestion to you about a new cover  a good idea said grainger mopping the tablecloth with his napkin ill speak to the waiter about it  kappelman the painter was the cutup as a piece of delicate athenian wit he got up from his chair and waltzed down the room with a waiter that dependent no doubt an honest pachydermatous worthy taxpaying artdespising biped released himself from the unequal encounter carried his professional smile back to the dumbwaiter and dropped it down the shaft to eternal oblivion reeves began to make keats turn in his grave mrs pothunter told the story of the man who met the widow on the train miss adrian hummed what is still called a chanson in the cafés of bridgeport grainger edited each individual effort with his assistant editors smile which meant great but youll have to send them in through the regular channels if i were the chief nowbut you know how it is  and soon the head waiter bowed before them desolated to relate that the closing hour had already become chronologically historical so out all trooped into the starry midnight filling the street with gay laughter to be barked at by hopeful cabmen and enviously eyed by the dull inhabitants of an uninspired world  grainger left mary at the elevator in the trackless palm forest of the idealia after he had gone she came down again carrying a small handbag phoned for a cab drove to the grand central station boarded a 1255 commuters train rode four hours with her burntumber head bobbing against the redplush back of the seat and landed during a fresh stinging glorious sunrise at a deserted station the size of a peach crate called crocusville  she walked a mile and clicked the latch of a gate a bare brown cottage stood twenty yards back an old man with a pearlwhite calvinistic face and clothes dyed blacker than a raven in a coalmine was washing his hands in a tin basin on the front porch  how are you father said mary timidly  i am as well as providence permits mary ann you will find your mother in the kitchen  in the kitchen a cryptic gray woman kissed her glacially on the forehead and pointed out the potatoes which were not yet peeled for breakfast mary sat in a wooden chair and decorticated spuds with a thrill in her heart  for breakfast there were grace cold bread potatoes bacon and tea  you are pursuing the same avocation in the city concerning which you have advised us from time to time by letter i trust said her father  yes said mary i am still reviewing books for the same publication  after breakfast she helped wash the dishes and then all three sat in straightback chairs in the barefloored parlor  it is my custom said the old man on the sabbath day to read aloud from the great work entitled the apology for authorized and set forms of liturgy by the ecclesiastical philosopher and revered theologian jeremy taylor  i know it said mary blissfully folding her hands  for two hours the numbers of the great jeremy rolled forth like the notes of an oratorio played on the violoncello mary sat gloating in the new sensation of racking physical discomfort that the wooden chair brought her perhaps there is no happiness in life so perfect as the martyrs jeremys minor chords soothed her like the music of a tomtom why oh why she said to herself does some one not write words to it  at eleven they went to church in crocusville the back of the pine bench on which she sat had a penitential forward tilt that would have brought st simeon down in jealousy from his pillar the preacher singled her out and thundered upon her vicarious head the damnation of the world at each side of her an adamant parent held her rigidly to the bar of judgment an ant crawled upon her neck but she dared not move she lowered her eyes before the congregationa hundredeyed cerberus that watched the gates through which her sins were fast thrusting her her soul was filled with a delirious almost a fanatic joy for she was out of the clutch of the tyrant freedom dogma and creed pinioned her with beneficent cruelty as steel braces bind the feet of a crippled child she was hedged adjured shackled shored up straitjacketed silenced ordered when they came out the minister stopped to greet them mary could only hang her head and answer yes sir and no sir to his questions when she saw that the other women carried their hymnbooks at their waists with their left hands she blushed and moved hers there too from her right  she took the threeoclock train back to the city at nine she sat at the round table for dinner in the café andré nearly the same crowd was there  where have you been today asked mrs pothunter i phoned to you at twelve  i have been away in bohemia answered mary with a mystic smile  there mary has given it away she has spoiled my climax for i was to have told you that bohemia is nothing more than the little country in which you do not live if you try to obtain citizenship in it at once the court and retinue pack the royal archives and treasure and move away beyond the hills it is a hillside that you turn your head to peer at from the windows of the through express  at exactly half past eleven kappelman deceived by a new softness and slowness of riposte and parry in mary adrian tried to kiss her instantly she slapped his face with such strength and cold fury that he shrank down sobered with the flaming red print of a hand across his leering features and all sounds ceased as when the shadows of great wings come upon a flock of chattering sparrows one had broken the paramount law of shambohemiathe law of laisser faire the shock came not from the blow delivered but from the blow received with the effect of a schoolmaster entering the playroom of his pupils was that blow administered women pulled down their sleeves and laid prim hands against their ruffled side locks men looked at their watches there was nothing of the effect of a brawl about it it was purely the still panic produced by the sound of the ax of the fly cop conscience hammering at the gamblinghouse doors of the heart  with their punctilious putting on of cloaks with their exaggerated pretense of not having seen or heard with their stammering exchange of unaccustomed formalities with their false show of a lighthearted exit i must take leave of my bohemian party mary has robbed me of my climax and she may go  but i am not defeated somewhere there exists a great vault miles broad and miles longmore capacious than the champagne caves of france in that vault are stored the anticlimaxes that should have been tagged to all the stories that have been told in the world i shall cheat that vault of one deposit  minnie brown with her aunt came from crocusville down to the city to see the sights and because she had escorted me to fishless trout streams and exhibited to me openplumbed waterfalls and broken my camera while i julyed in her village i must escort her to the hives containing the synthetic clover honey of town  especially did the custommade bohemia charm her the spaghetti wound its tendrils about her heart the free red wine drowned her belief in the existence of commercialism in the world she was dared and enchanted by the rugose wit that can be churned out of california claret  but one evening i got her away from the smell of halibut and linoleum long enough to read to her the manuscript of this story which then ended before her entrance into it i read it to her because i knew that all the printingpresses in the world were running to try to please her and some others and i asked her about it  i didnt quite catch the trains said she how long was mary in crocusville  ten hours and five minutes i replied  well then the story may do said minnie but if she had stayed there a week kappelman would have got his kiss     the ferry of unfulfilment   at the street corner as solid as granite in the rushhour tide of humanity stood the man from nome the arctic winds and sun had stained him berrybrown his eye still held the azure glint of the glaciers  he was as alert as a fox as tough as a caribou cutlet and as broadgauged as the aurora borealis he stood sprayed by a niagara of soundthe crash of the elevated trains clanging cars pounding of rubberless tires and the antiphony of the cab and truckdrivers indulging in scarifying repartee and so with his gold dust cashed in to the merry air of a hundred thousand and with the cakes and ale of one week in gotham turning bitter on his tongue the man from nome sighed to set foot again in chilkoot the exit from the land of street noises and dead sea apple pies  up sixth avenue with the tripping scurrying chattering brighteyed homing tide came the girl from siebermasons the man from nome looked and saw first that she was supremely beautiful after his own conception of beauty and next that she moved with exactly the steady grace of a dog sled on a level crust of snow his third sensation was an instantaneous conviction that he desired her greatly for his own this quickly do men from nome make up their minds besides he was going back to the north in a short time and to act quickly was no less necessary  a thousand girls from the great department store of siebermason flowed along the sidewalk making navigation dangerous to men whose feminine field of vision for three years has been chiefly limited to siwash and chilkat squaws but the man from nome loyal to her who had resurrected his long cached heart plunged into the stream of pulchritude and followed her  down twentythird street she glided swiftly looking to neither side no more flirtatious than the bronze diana above the garden her fine brown hair was neatly braided her neat waist and unwrinkled black skirt were eloquent of the double virtuestaste and economy ten yards behind followed the smitten man from nome  miss claribel colby the girl from siebermasons belonged to that sad company of mariners known as jersey commuters she walked into the waitingroom of the ferry and up the stairs and by a marvellous swift little run caught the ferryboat that was just going out the man from nome closed up his ten yards in three jumps and gained the deck close beside her  miss colby chose a rather lonely seat on the outside of the uppercabin the night was not cold and she desired to be away from the curious eyes and tedious voices of the passengers besides she was extremely weary and drooping from lack of sleep on the previous night she had graced the annual ball and oyster fry of the west side wholesale fish dealers assistants social club no 2 thus reducing her usual time of sleep to only three hours  and the day had been uncommonly troublous customers had been inordinately trying the buyer in her department had scolded her roundly for letting her stock run down her best friend mamie tuthill had snubbed her by going to lunch with that dockery girl  the girl from siebermasons was in that relaxed softened mood that often comes to the independent feminine wageearner it is a mood most propitious for the man who would woo her then she has yearnings to be set in some home and heart to be comforted and to hide behind some strong arm and rest rest but miss claribel colby was also very sleepy  there came to her side a strong man browned and dressed carelessly in the best of clothes with his hat in his hand  lady said the man from nome respectfully excuse me for speaking to you but iii saw you on the street andand  oh gee remarked the girl from siebermasons glancing up with the most capable coolness aint there any way to ever get rid of you mashers ive tried everything from eating onions to using hatpins be on your way freddie  im not one of that kind lady said the man from nomehonest im not as i say i saw you on the street and i wanted to know you so bad i couldnt help followin after you i was afraid i wouldnt ever see you again in this big town unless i spoke and thats why i done so  miss colby looked once shrewdly at him in the dim light on the ferryboat no he did not have the perfidious smirk or the brazen swagger of the ladykiller sincerity and modesty shone through his boreal tan it seemed to her that it might be good to hear a little of what he had to say  you may sit down she said laying her hand over a yawn with ostentatious politness andminddont get fresh or ill call the steward  the man from nome sat by her side he admired her greatly he more than admired her she had exactly the looks he had tried so long in vain to find in a woman could she ever come to like him well that was to be seen he must do all in his power to stake his claim anyhow  my names blayden said hehenry blayden  are you real sure it aint jones asked the girl leaning toward him with delicious knowing raillery  im down from nome he went on with anxious seriousness i scraped together a pretty good lot of dust up there and brought it down with me  oh say she rippled pursuing persiflage with engaging lightness then you must be on the white wings force i thought id seen you somewhere  you didnt see me on the street today when i saw you  i never look at fellows on the street  well i looked at you and i never looked at anything before that i thought was half as pretty  shall i keep the change  yes i reckon so i reckon you could keep anything ive got i reckon im what you would call a rough man but i could be awful good to anybody i liked ive had a rough time of it up yonder but i beat the game nearly 5000 ounces of dust was what i cleaned up while i was there  goodness exclaimed miss colby obligingly sympathetic it must be an awful dirty place wherever it is  and then her eyes closed the voice of the man from nome had a monotony in its very earnestness besides what dull talk was this of brooms and sweeping and dust she leaned her head back against the wall  miss said the man from nome with deeper earnestness and monotony i never saw anybody i liked as well as i do you i know you cant think that way of me right yet but cant you give me a chance wont you let me know you and see if i cant make you like me  the head of the girl from siebermasons slid over gently and rested upon his shoulder sweet sleep had won her and she was dreaming rapturously of the wholesale fish dealers assistants ball  the gentleman from nome kept his arms to himself he did not suspect sleep and yet he was too wise to attribute the movement to surrender he was greatly and blissfully thrilled but he ended by regarding the head upon his shoulder as an encouraging preliminary merely advanced as a harbinger of his success and not to be taken advantage of  one small speck of alloy discounted the gold of his satisfaction had he spoken too freely of his wealth he wanted to be liked for himself  i want to say miss he said that you can count on me they know me in the klondike from juneau to circle city and down the whole length of the yukon many a night ive laid in the snow up there where i worked like a slave for three years and wondered if id ever have anybody to like me i didnt want all that dust just myself i thought id meet just the right one some time and i done it today moneys a mighty good thing to have but to have the love of the one you like best is better still if you was ever to marry a man miss which would you rather hed have  cash  the word came sharply and loudly from miss colbys lips giving evidence that in her dreams she was now behind her counter in the great department store of siebermason  her head suddenly bobbed over sideways she awoke sat straight and rubbed her eyes the man from nome was gone  gee i believe ive been asleep said miss colby wonder what became of the white wings     the tale of a tainted tenner   money talks but you may think that the conversation of a little old tendollar bill in new york would be nothing more than a whisper oh very well pass up this sotto voce autobiography of an x if you like if you are one of the kind that prefers to listen to john ds checkbook roar at you through a megaphone as it passes by all right but dont forget that small change can say a word to the point now and then the next time you tip your grocers clerk a silver quarter to give you extra weight of his bosss goods read the four words above the ladys head how are they for repartee  i am a tendollar treasury note series of 1901 you may have seen one in a friends hand on my face in the centre is a picture of the bison americanus miscalled a buffalo by fifty or sixty millions of americans the heads of capt lewis and capt clark adorn the ends on my back is the graceful figure of liberty or ceres or maxine elliot standing in the centre of the stage on a conservatory plant my references isor aresection 3588 revised statutes ten cold hard dollarsi dont say whether silver gold lead or ironuncle sam will hand you over his counter if you want to cash me in  i beg you will excuse any conversational breaks that i makethanks i knew you wouldgot that sneaking little respect and agreeable feeling toward even an x havent you you see a tainted bill doesnt have much chance to acquire a correct form of expression i never knew a really cultured and educated person that could afford to hold a tenspot any longer than it would take to do an arthur duffy to the nearest thats all sign or delicatessen store  for a sixyearold ive had a lively and gorgeous circulation i guess ive paid as many debts as the man who dies ive been owned by a good many kinds of people but a little old ragged damp dingy fivedollar silver certificate gave me a jar one day i was next to it in the fat and badsmelling purse of a butcher  hey you sitting bull says i dont scrouge so anyhow dont you think its about time you went in on a customs payment and got reissued for a series of 1899 youre a sight  oh dont get crackly just because youre a buffalo bill says the fiver youd be limp too if youd been stuffed down in a thick cottonandlislethread under an elastic all day and the thermometer not a degree under 85 in the store  i never heard of a pocketbook like that says i who carried you  a shopgirl says the fivespot  whats that i had to ask  youll never know till their millennium comes says the fiver  just then a twodollar bill behind me with a george washington head spoke up to the fiver  aw cut out yer kicks aint lisle thread good enough for yer if you was under all cotton like ive been today and choked up with factory dust till the lady with the cornucopia on me sneezed half a dozen times youd have some reason to complain  that was the next day after i arrived in new york i came in a 500 package of tens to a brooklyn bank from one of its pennsylvania correspondentsand i havent made the acquaintance of any of the five and two spots friends pocketbooks yet silk for mine every time  i was lucky money i kept on the move sometimes i changed hands twenty times a day i saw the inside of every business i fought for my owners every pleasure it seemed that on saturday nights i never missed being slapped down on a bar tens were always slapped down while ones and twos were slid over to the bartenders folded i got in the habit of looking for mine and i managed to soak in a little straight or some spilled martini or manhattan whenever i could once i got tied up in a great greasy roll of bills in a pushcart peddlers jeans i thought i never would get in circulation again for the future department store owner lived on eight cents worth of dog meat and onions a day but this peddler got into trouble one day on account of having his cart too near a crossing and i was rescued i always will feel grateful to the cop that got me he changed me at a cigar store near the bowery that was running a crap game in the back room so it was the captain of the precinct after all that did me the best turn when he got his he blew me for wine the next evening in a broadway restaurant and i really felt as glad to get back again as an astor does when he sees the lights of charing cross  a tainted ten certainly does get action on broadway i was alimony once and got folded in a little dogskin purse among a lot of dimes they were bragging about the busy times there were in ossining whenever three girls got hold of one of them during the ice cream season but its slow moving vehicles keep to the right for the little bok tips when you think of the way we bison plasters refuse to stick to anything during the rush lobster hour  the first i ever heard of tainted money was one night when a good thing with a van to his name threw me over with some other bills to buy a stack of blues  about midnight a big easygoing man with a fat face like a monks and the eye of a janitor with his wages raised took me and a lot of other notes and rolled us into what is termed a wad among the money tainters  ticket me for five hundred said he to the banker and look out for everything charlie im going out for a stroll in the glen before the moonlight fades from the brow of the cliff if anybody finds the roof in their way theres 60000 wrapped in a comic supplement in the upper lefthand corner of the safe be bold everywhere be bold but be not bowled over night  i found myself between two 20 gold certificates one of em says to me  well old shorthorn youre in luck tonight youll see something of life old jacks going to make the tenderloin look like a hamburg steak  explain says i im used to joints but i dont care for filet mignon with the kind of sauce you serve  xcuse me said the twenty old jack is the proprietor of this gambling house hes going on a whiz tonight because he offered 50000 to a church and it refused to accept it because they said his money was tainted  what is a church i asked  oh i forgot says the twenty that i was talking to a tenner of course you dont know youre too much to put into the contribution basket and not enough to buy anything at a bazaar a church isa large building in which penwipers and tidies are sold at 20 each  i dont care much about chinning with gold certificates theres a streak of yellow in em all is not gold thats quitters  old jack certainly was a gildedged sport when it came his time to loosen up he never referred the waiter to an actuary  by and by it got around that he was smiting the rock in the wilderness and all along broadway things with cold noses and hot gullets fell in on our trail the third jungle book was there waiting for somebody to put covers on it old jacks money may have had a taint to it but all the same he had orders for his camembert piling up on him every minute first his friends rallied round him and then the fellows that his friends knew by sight and then a few of his enemies buried the hatchet and finally he was buying souvenirs for so many neapolitan fisher maidens and butterfly octettes that the head waiters were phoning all over town for julian mitchell to please come around and get them into some kind of order  at last we floated into an uptown café that i knew by heart when the hodcarriers union in jackets and aprons saw us coming the chief goal kicker called out sixelevenfortytwonineteentwelve to his men and they put on nose guards till it was clear whether we meant port arthur or portsmouth but old jack wasnt working for the furniture and glass factories that night he sat down quiet and sang ramble in a halfhearted way his feelings had been hurt so the twenty told me because his offer to the church had been refused  but the wassail went on and brady himself couldnt have hammered the thirst mob into a better imitation of the real penchant for the stuff that you screw out of a bottle with a napkin  old jack paid the twenty above me for a round leaving me on the outside of his roll he laid the roll on the table and sent for the proprietor  mike says he heres money that the good people have refused will it buy of your wares in the name of the devil they say its tainted  i will says mike and ill put it in the drawer next to the bills that was paid to the parsons daughter for kisses at the church fair to build a new parsonage for the parsons daughter to live in  at 1 oclock when the hodcarriers were making ready to close up the front and keep the inside open a woman slips in the door of the restaurant and comes up to old jacks table youve seen the kindblack shawl creepy hair ragged skirt white face eyes a cross between gabriels and a sick kittensthe kind of woman thats always on the lookout for an automobile or the mendicancy squadand she stands there without a word and looks at the money  old jack gets up peels me off the roll and hands me to her with a bow  madam says he just like actors ive heard here is a tainted bill i am a gambler this bill came to me tonight from a gentlemans son where he got it i do not know if you will do me the favor to accept it it is yours  the woman took me with a trembling hand  sir said she i counted thousands of this issue of bills into packages when they were virgin from the presses i was a clerk in the treasury department there was an official to whom i owed my position you say they are tainted now if you only knewbut i wont say any more thank you with all my heart sirthank youthank you  where do you suppose that woman carried me almost at a run to a bakery away from old jack and a sizzling good time to a bakery and i get changed and she does a sheridantwentymilesaway with a dozen rolls and a section of jelly cake as big as a turbine waterwheel of course i lost sight of her then for i was snowed up in the bakery wondering whether id get changed at the drug store the next day in an alum deal or paid over to the cement works  a week afterward i butted up against one of the onedollar bills the baker had given the woman for change  hallo e35039669 says i werent you in the change for me in a bakery last saturday night  yep says the solitaire in his free and easy style  how did the deal turn out i asked  she blew e17051431 for mills and round steak says the onespot she kept me till the rent man came it was a bum room with a sick kid in it but you ought to have seen him go for the bread and tincture of formaldehyde halfstarved i guess then she prayed some dont get stuck up tenner we onespots hear ten prayers where you hear one she said something about who giveth to the poor oh lets cut out the slum talk im certainly tired of the company that keeps me i wish i was big enough to move in society with you tainted bills  shut up says i theres no such thing i know the rest of it theres a lendeth to the lord somewhere in it now look on my back and read what you see there  this note is a legal tender at its face value for all debts public and private  this talk about tainted money makes me tired says i     elsie in new york   no bumptious reader this story is not a continuation of the elsie series but if your elsie had lived over here in our big city there might have been a chapter in her books not very different from this  especially for the vagrant feet of youth are the roads of manhattan beset with pitfall and with gin but the civic guardians of the young have made themselves acquainted with the snares of the wicked and most of the dangerous paths are patrolled by their agents who seek to turn straying ones away from the peril that menaces them and this will tell you how they guided my elsie safely through all peril to the goal that she was seeking  elsies father had been a cutter for fox  otter cloaks and furs on lower broadway he was an old man with a slow and limping gait so a pothunter of a newly licensed chauffeur ran him down one day when livelier game was scarce they took the old man home where he lay on his bed for a year and then died leaving 250 in cash and a letter from mr otter offering to do anything he could to help his faithful old employee the old cutter regarded this letter as a valuable legacy to his daughter and he put it into her hands with pride as the shears of the dread cleaner and repairer snipped off his thread of life  that was the landlords cue and forth he came and did his part in the great eviction scene there was no snowstorm ready for elsie to steal out into drawing her little red woollen shawl about her shoulders but she went out regardless of the unities and as for the red shawlback to blaney with it elsies fall tan coat was cheap but it had the style and fit of the best at fox  otters and her lucky stars had given her good looks and eyes as blue and innocent as the new shade of note paper and she had 1 left of the 250 and the letter from mr otter keep your eye on the letter from mr otter that is the clue i desire that everything be made plain as we go detective stories are so plentiful now that they do not sell  and so we find elsie thus equipped starting out in the world to seek her fortune one trouble about the letter from mr otter was that it did not bear the new address of the firm which had moved about a month before but elsie thought she could find it she had heard that policemen when politely addressed or thumbscrewed by an investigation committee will give up information and addresses so she boarded a downtown car at one hundred and seventyseventh street and rode south to fortysecond which she thought must surely be the end of the island there she stood against the wall undecided for the citys roar and dash was new to her up where she had lived was rural new york so far out that the milkmen awaken you in the morning by the squeaking of pumps instead of the rattling of cans  a kindfaced sunburned young man in a softbrimmed hat went past elsie into the grand central depot that was hank ross of the sunflower ranch in idaho on his way home from a visit to the east hanks heart was heavy for the sunflower ranch was a lonesome place lacking the presence of a woman he had hoped to find one during his visit who would congenially share his prosperity and home but the girls of gotham had not pleased his fancy but as he passed in he noted with a jumping of his pulses the sweet ingenuous face of elsie and her pose of doubt and loneliness with true and honest western impulse he said to himself that here was his mate he could love her he knew and he would surround her with so much comfort and cherish her so carefully that she would be happy and make two sunflowers grow on the ranch where there grew but one before  hank turned and went back to her backed by his never before questioned honesty of purpose he approached the girl and removed his softbrimmed hat elsie had but time to sum up his handsome frank face with one shy look of modest admiration when a burly cop hurled himself upon the ranchman seized him by the collar and backed him against the wall two blocks away a burglar was coming out of an apartmenthouse with a bag of silverware on his shoulder but that is neither here nor there  carry on yez mashin tricks right before me eyes will yez shouted the cop ill teach yez to speak to ladies on me beat that yere not acquainted with come along  elsie turned away with a sigh as the ranchman was dragged away she had liked the effect of his light blue eyes against his tanned complexion she walked southward thinking herself already in the district where her father used to work and hoping to find some one who could direct her to the firm of fox  otter  but did she want to find mr otter she had inherited much of the old cutters independence how much better it would be if she could find work and support herself without calling on him for aid  elsie saw a sign employment agency and went in many girls were sitting against the wall in chairs several welldressed ladies were looking them over one whitehaired kindfaced old lady in rustling black silk hurried up to elsie  my dear she said in a sweet gentle voice are you looking for a position i like your face and appearance so much i want a young woman who will be half maid and half companion to me you will have a good home and i will pay you 30 a month  before elsie could stammer forth her gratified acceptance a young woman with gold glasses on her bony nose and her hands in her jacket pockets seized her arm and drew her aside  i am miss ticklebaum said she of the association for the prevention of jobs being put up on working girls looking for jobs we prevented fortyseven girls from securing positions last week i am here to protect you beware of any one who offers you a job how do you know that this woman does not want to make you work as a breakerboy in a coal mine or murder you to get your teeth if you accept work of any kind without permission of our association you will be arrested by one of our agents  but what am i to do asked elsie i have no home or money i must do something why am i not allowed to accept this kind ladys offer  i do not know said miss ticklebaum that is the affair of our committee on the abolishment of employers it is my duty simply to see that

occur on our roll of qualified employers which now comprises twentyseven names there is prayer music and lemonade in our chapel the third sunday of every month  elsie hurried away after thanking miss ticklebaum for her timely warning and advice after all it seemed that she must try to find mr otter  but after walking a few blocks she saw a sign cashier wanted in the window of a confectionery store in she went and applied for the place after casting a quick glance over her shoulder to assure herself that the jobpreventer was not on her trail  the proprietor of the confectionery was a benevolent old man with a peppermint flavor who decided after questioning elsie pretty closely that she was the very girl he wanted her services were needed at once so elsie with a thankful heart drew off her tan coat and prepared to mount the cashiers stool  but before she could do so a gaunt lady wearing steel spectacles and black mittens stood before her with a long finger pointing and exclaimed young woman hesitate  elsie hesitated  do you know said the blackandsteel lady that in accepting this position you may this day cause the loss of a hundred lives in agonizing physical torture and the sending as many souls to perdition  why no said elsie in frightened tones how could i do that  rum said the ladythe demon rum do you know why so many lives are lost when a theatre catches fire brandy balls the demon rum lurking in brandy balls our society women while in theatres sit grossly intoxicated from eating these candies filled with brandy when the fire fiend sweeps down upon them they are unable to escape the candy stores are the devils distilleries if you assist in the distribution of these insidious confections you assist in the destruction of the bodies and souls of your fellowbeings and in the filling of our jails asylums and almshouses think girl ere you touch the money for which brandy balls are sold  dear me said elsie bewildered i didnt know there was rum in brandy balls but i must live by some means what shall i do  decline the position said the lady and come with me i will tell you what to do  after elsie had told the confectioner that she had changed her mind about the cashiership she put on her coat and followed the lady to the sidewalk where awaited an elegant victoria  seek some other work said the blackandsteel lady and assist in crushing the hydraheaded demon rum and she got into the victoria and drove away  i guess that puts it up to mr otter again said elsie ruefully turning down the street and im sorry too for id much rather make my way without help  near fourteenth street elsie saw a placard tacked on the side of a doorway that read fifty girls neat sewers wanted immediately on theatrical costumes good pay  she was about to enter when a solemn man dressed all in black laid his hand on her arm  my dear girl he said i entreat you not to enter that dressingroom of the devil  goodness me exclaimed elsie with some impatience the devil seems to have a cinch on all the business in new york whats wrong about the place  it is here said the solemn man that the regalia of satanin other words the costumes worn on the stageare manufactured the stage is the road to ruin and destruction would you imperil your soul by lending the work of your hands to its support do you know my dear girl what the theatre leads to do you know where actors and actresses go after the curtain of the playhouse has fallen upon them for the last time  sure said elsie into vaudeville but do you think it would be wicked for me to make a little money to live on by sewing i must get something to do pretty soon  the fleshpots of egypt exclaimed the reverend gentleman uplifting his hands i beseech you my child to turn away from this place of sin and iniquity  but what will i do for a living asked elsie i dont care to sew for this musical comedy if its as rank as you say it is but ive got to have a job  the lord will provide said the solemn man there is a free bible class every sunday afternoon in the basement of the cigar store next to the church peace be with you amen farewell  elsie went on her way she was soon in the downtown district where factories abound on a large brick building was a gilt sign posey  trimmer artificial flowers below it was hung a newly stretched canvas bearing the words five hundred girls wanted to learn trade good wages from the start apply one flight up  elsie started toward the door near which were gathered in groups some twenty or thirty girls one big girl with a black straw hat tipped down over her eyes stepped in front of her  say youse said the girl are youse goin in there after a job  yes said elsie i must have work  now dont do it said the girl im chairman of our scab committee theres 400 of us girls locked out just because we demanded 50 cents a week raise in wages and ice water and for the foreman to shave off his mustache youre too nice a looking girl to be a scab wouldnt you please help us along by trying to find a job somewhere else or would youse rather have your face pushed in  ill try somewhere else said elsie  she walked aimlessly eastward on broadway and there her heart leaped to see the sign fox  otter stretching entirely across the front of a tall building it was as though an unseen guide had led her to it through the byways of her fruitless search for work  she hurried into the store and sent in to mr otter by a clerk her name and the letter he had written her father she was shown directly into his private office  mr otter arose from his desk as elsie entered and took both hands with a hearty smile of welcome he was a slightly corpulent man of nearly middle age a little bald gold spectacled polite well dressed radiating  well well and so this is beattys little daughter your father was one of our most efficient and valued employees he left nothing well well i hope we have not forgotten his faithful services i am sure there is a vacancy now among our models oh it is easy worknothing easier  mr otter struck a bell a longnosed clerk thrust a portion of himself inside the door  send miss hawkins in said mr otter miss hawkins came  miss hawkins said mr otter bring for miss beatty to try on one of those russian sable coats andlets seeone of those latest model black tulle hats with white tips  elsie stood before the fulllength mirror with pink cheeks and quick breath her eyes shone like faint stars she was beautiful alas she was beautiful  i wish i could stop this story here confound it i will no its got to run it out i didnt make it up im just repeating it  id like to throw bouquets at the wise cop and the lady who rescues girls from jobs and the prohibitionist who is trying to crush brandy balls and the sky pilot who objects to costumes for stage people there are others and all the thousands of good people who are at work protecting young people from the pitfalls of a great city and then wind up by pointing out how they were the means of elsie reaching her fathers benefactor and her kind friend and rescuer from poverty this would make a fine elsie story of the old sort id like to do this but theres just a word or two to follow  while elsie was admiring herself in the mirror mr otter went to the telephone booth and called up some number dont ask me what it was  oscar said he i want you to reserve the same table for me this evening     what why the one in the moorish room to the left of the shrubbery     yes two     yes the usual brand and the 85 johannisburger with the roast if it isnt the right temperature ill

were written by himby him of gads hill before whom if you doff not your hat you shall stand with a covered pumpkinaye sir a pumpkin  lost your excellency lost associations and societies lost right reverends and wrong reverends of every order lost reformers and lawmakers born with heavenly compassion in your hearts but with the reverence of money in your souls and lost thus around us every day
