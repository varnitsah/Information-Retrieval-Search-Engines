fenn   when we get licked tomorrow by halfadozen wickets said jimmy silver tilting his chair until the back touched the wall dont say i didnt warn you if you fellows take down what i say from time to time in notebooks as you ought to do youll remember that i offered to give anyone odds that kays would out us in the final i always said that a really hot man like fenn was more good to a side than halfadozen ordinary men he can do all the bowling and all the batting all the fielding too in the slips  tea was just over at blackburns and the bulk of the house had gone across to preparation in the school buildings the prefects as was their custom lingered on to finish the meal at their leisure these aftertea conversations were quite an institution at blackburns the labours of the day were over and the time for preparation for the morrow had not yet come it would be time to be thinking of that in another hour meanwhile a little relaxation might be enjoyed especially so as this was the last day but two of the summer term and all necessity for working after tea had ceased with the arrival of the last lap of the examinations  silver was head of the house and captain of its cricket team which was nearing the end of its last match the final for the interhouse cup andon papergetting decidedly the worst of it after riding in triumph over the school house bedells and mulhollands blackburns had met its next door neighbour kays in the final and to the surprise of the great majority of the school was showing up badly the match was affording one more example of how a team of average merit all through may sometimes fall before a oneman side blackburns had the three last men on the list of the first eleven silver kennedy and challis and at least nine of its representatives had the reputation of being able to knock up a useful twenty or thirty at any time kays on the other hand had one man fenn after him the tail started but fenn was such an exceptional allround man that as silver had said he was as good as halfadozen of the blackburns team equally formidable whether batting or bowlinghe headed the school averages at both he was one of those batsmen who seem to know exactly what sort of ball you are going to bowl before it leaves your hand and he could hit like another jessop as for his bowling he bowled left handalways a puzzling eccentricity to an undeveloped batsmanand could send them down very fast or very slow as he thought best and it was hard to see which particular brand he was going to serve up before it was actually in midair  but it is not necessary to enlarge on his abilities the figures against his name in wisden prove a good deal the fact that he had steered kays through into the last round of the housematches proves still more it was perfectly obvious to everyone that if only you could get fenn out for under ten kays total for that innings would be nearer twenty than forty they were an appalling side but then no house bowler had as yet succeeded in getting fenn out for under ten in the six innings he had played in the competition up to date he had made four centuries an eighty and a seventy  kennedy the second prefect at blackburns paused in the act of grappling with the remnant of a pot of jam belonging to some person unknown to reply to silvers remarks  we arent beaten yet he said in his solid way kennedys chief characteristics were solidity and an infinite capacity for taking pains nothing seemed to tire or discourage him he kept pegging away till he arrived the ordinary person for instance would have considered the jampot on which he was then engaged an empty jampot kennedy saw that there was still a strawberry or it may have been a section of a strawberry at the extreme end and he meant to have that coy vegetable if he had to squeeze the pot to get at it to take another instance all the afternoon of the previous day he had bowled patiently at fenn while the latter lifted every other ball into space he had been taken off three times and at every fresh attack he had plodded on doggedly until at last as he had expected the batsman had misjudged a straight one and he had bowled him all over his wicket kennedy generally managed to get there sooner or later  its no good chucking the game up simply because were in a tight place he said bringing the spoon to the surface at last with the section of strawberry adhering to the end of it that sort of things awfully feeble  he calls me feeble shouted jimmy silver by james ive put a man to sleep for less  it was one of his amusements to express himself from time to time in a melodramatic fashion sometimes accompanying his words with suitable gestures it was on one of these occasionswhen he had assumed at a moments notice the role of the baffled despot in an argument with kennedy in his study on the subject of the house football teamthat he broke what mr blackburn considered a valuable door with a poker since then he had moderated his transports  theyve got to make seventynine said kennedy  challis the other first eleven man was reading a green scoringbook  i dont think kays ought to have the face to stick the cup up in their diningroom he said considering the little theyve done to win it if they do win it that is still as they made two hundred first innings they ought to be able to knock off seventynine but i was saying that the pot ought to go to fenn lot the rest of the team had to do with it blackburns first innings hundred and fiftyone fenn eight for fortynine kays two hundred and one fenn a hundred and sixtyfour not out second innings blackburns hundred and twentyeight fenn ten for eighty bit thick isnt it i suppose thats what youd call a oneman team  williams one of the other prefects who had just sat down at the piano for the purpose of playing his one tunea cakewalk of which through constant practice he had mastered the rudimentsspoke over his shoulder to silver  i tell you what jimmy he said youve probably lost us the pot by getting your people to send brother billy to kays if he hadnt kept up his wicket yesterday fenn wouldnt have made half as many  when his young brother had been sent to eckleton two terms before jimmy silver had strongly urged upon his father the necessity of placing him in some house other than blackburns he felt that a head of a house even of so orderly and perfect a house as blackburns has enough worries without being saddled with a small brother and on the previous afternoon young billy silver going in eighth wicket for kays had put a solid bat in front of everything for the space of one hour in the course of which he made ten runs and fenn sixty by scoring odd numbers off the last ball of each over fenn had managed to secure the majority of the bowling in the most masterly way  these things will happen said silver resignedly we silvers you know cant help making runs come on williams lets have that tune and get it over  williams obliged it was a classic piece called the coon band contest remarkable partly for a taking melody partly for the vast possibilities of noise which it afforded williams made up for his failure to do justice to the former by a keen appreciation of the latter he played the piece through again in order to correct the mistakes he had made at his first rendering of it then he played it for the third time to correct a new batch of errors  i should like to hear fenn play that said challis youre awfully good you know williams but he might do it better still  get him to play it as an encore at the concert said williams starting for the fourth time  the talented fenn was also a musiciannot a genius at the piano as he was at cricket but a sufficiently sound performer for his age considering that he had not made a special study of it he was to play at the school concert on the following day  i believe fenn has an awful time at kays said jimmy silver it must be a fair sort of hole judging from the specimens you see crawling about in kay caps i wish id known my people were sending young billy there id have warned them i only told them not to sling him in here i had no idea theyd have picked kays  fenn was telling me the other day said kennedy that being in kays had spoiled his whole time at the school he always wanted to come to blackburns only there wasnt room that particular term bad luck wasnt it i dont think he found it so bad before he became head of the house he didnt come into contact with kay so much but now he finds that he cant do a thing without kay buzzing round and interfering  i wonder said jimmy silver thoughtfully if thats why he bowls so fast to work it off you know  in the course of a beautiful innings of fiftythree that afternoon the captain of blackburns had received two of fenns speediest on the same spot just above the pad in rapid succession and he now hobbled painfully when he moved about  the conversation that evening had dealt so largely with fennthe whole school indeed was talking of nothing but his great attempt to win the cricket cup singlehandedthat kennedy going out into the road for a breather before the rest of the boarders returned from preparation made his way to kays to see if fenn was imitating his example and taking the air too  he found him at kays gate and they strolled towards the school buildings together fenn was unusually silent  well said kennedy after a minute had passed without a remark  well what  whats up  fenn laughed what novelists are fond of calling a mirthless laugh  oh i dont know he said im sick of this place  kennedy inspected his friends face anxiously by the light of the lamp over the school gate there was no mistake about it fenn certainly did look bad his face always looked lean and craggy but tonight there was a difference he looked used up  fagged asked kennedy  no sick  what about  everything i wish you could come into kays for a bit just to see what its like then youd understand at present i dont suppose youve an idea of it id like to write a book on kay day by day id have plenty to put in it  whats he been doing  oh nothing out of the ordinary run its the fact that hes always at it that does me you get a houseful ofwell you know the sort of chap the average kayite is theyd keep me busy even if i were allowed a free hand but im not whenever i try and keep order and stop things a bit out springs the man kay from nowhere and takes the job out of my hands makes a ghastly mess of everything and retires purring once in every three times or thereabouts he slangs me in front of the kids for not keeping order im glad this is the end of the term i couldnt stand it much longer hullo here come the chaps from prep wed better be getting back     ii  an evening at kays   they turned and began to walk towards the houses kennedy felt miserable he never allowed himself to be put out to any great extent by his own worries which indeed had not been very numerous up to the present but the misfortunes of his friends always troubled him exceedingly when anything happened to him personally he found the discomfort of being in a tight place largely counterbalanced by the excitement of trying to find a way out but the impossibility of helping fenn in any way depressed him  it must be awful he said breaking the silence  it is said fenn briefly  but havent the housematches made any difference blackburns always frightfully bucked when the house does anything you can do anything you like with him if you lift a cup i should have thought kay would have been all right when he saw you knocking up centuries and getting into the final and all that sort of thing  fenn laughed  kay he said my dear man he doesnt know i dont suppose hes got the remotest idea that we are in the final at all or if he has he doesnt understand what being in the final means  but surely hell be glad if you lick us tomorrow asked kennedy such indifference on the part of a housemaster respecting the fortunes of his house seemed to him having before him the bright example of mr blackburn almost incredible  i dont suppose so said fenn or if he is ill bet he doesnt show it hes not like blackburn i wish he was here he comes so perhaps wed better talk about something else  the vanguard of the boys returning from preparation had passed them and they were now standing at the gate of the house as fenn spoke a little restlesslooking man in cap and gown came up his cleanshaven face wore an expression of extreme alertnessthe sort of look a ferret wears as he slips in at the mouth of a rabbithole a doctor called upon to sum up mr kay at a glance would probably have said that he suffered from nerves which would have been a perfectly correct diagnosis though none of the members of his house put his manners and customs down to that cause they considered that the methods he pursued in the management of the house were the outcome of a naturally malignant disposition this was however not the case there is no reason to suppose that mr kay did not mean well but there is no doubt that he was extremely fussy and fussinesswith the possible exceptions of homicidal mania and a taste for arsonis quite the worst characteristic it is possible for a housemaster to possess  he caught sight of fenn and kennedy at the gate and stopped in his stride  what are you doing here fenn he asked with an abruptness which brought a flush to the latters face why are you outside the house  kennedy began to understand why it was that his friend felt so strongly on the subject of his housemaster if this was the sort of thing that happened every day no wonder that there was dissension in the house of kay he tried to imagine blackburn speaking in that way to jimmy silver or himself but his imagination was unequal to the task between mr blackburn and his prefects there existed a perfect understanding he relied on them to see that order was kept and they acted accordingly fenn by the exercise of considerable selfcontrol had always been scrupulously polite to mr kay  i came out to get some fresh air before lockup sir he replied  well go in go in at once i cannot allow you to be outside the house at this hour go indoors directly  kennedy expected a scene but fenn took it quite quietly  good night kennedy he said  so long said kennedy  fenn caught his eye and smiled painfully then he turned and went into the house  mr kays zeal for reform was apparently still unsatisfied he directed his batteries towards kennedy  go to your house at once kennedy you have no business out here at this time  this thought kennedy was getting a bit too warm mr kay might do as he pleased with his own house but he was hanged if he was going to trample on him  mr blackburn is my housemaster sir he said with great respect  mr kay stared  my housemaster continued kennedy with gusto slightly emphasising the first word knows that i always go out just before lockup and he has no objection  and to emphasise this point he walked towards the school buildings again for a moment it seemed as if mr kay intended to call him back but he thought better of it mr blackburn in normal circumstances a pacific man had one touchy pointhis house he resented any interference with its management and was in the habit of saying so mr kay remembered one painful scene in the masters common room when he had ventured to let fall a few wellmeant hints as to how a house should be ruled really he had thought blackburn would have choked better perhaps to leave him to look after his own affairs  so mr kay followed fenn indoors and kennedy having watched him vanish made his way to blackburns  quietly as fenn had taken the incident at the gate it nevertheless rankled he read prayers that night in a distinctly unprayerful mood it seemed to him that it would be lucky if he could get through to the end of the term before mr kay applied that last straw which does not break the backs of camels only eight weeks holiday with plenty of cricket would brace him up for another term and he had been invited to play for the county against middlesex four days after the holidays began that should have been a soothing thought but it really seemed to make matters worse it was hard that a man who on monday would be bowling against warner and beldam or standing up to trott and hearne should on the preceding tuesday be sent indoors like a naughty child by a man who stood fivefeetone in his boots and was devoid of any sort of merit whatever  it seemed to him that it would help him to sleep peacefully that night if he worked off a little of his just indignation upon somebody there was a noise going on in the fags room there always was at kays it was not a particularly noisy noiseconsidering but it had better be stopped badly as kay had treated him he remembered that he was head of the house and as such it behoved him to keep order in the house  he went downstairs and on arriving on the scene of action found that the fags were engaged upon spirited festivities partly in honour of the near approach of the summer holidays partly becausemiracles barredthe house was going on the morrow to lift the cricketcup there were a good many books flying about and not a few slippers there was a confused mass rolling in combat on the floor and the table was occupied by a scarletfaced individual who passed the time by kicking violently at certain hands which were endeavouring to drag him from his post and shrieking frenzied abuse at the owners of the said hands it was an animated scene and to a deaf man might have been most enjoyable  fenns appearance was the signal for a temporary suspension of hostilities  what the dickens is all this row about he inquired  no one seemed ready at the moment with a concise explanation there was an awkward silence one or two of the weaker spirits even went so far as to sit down and begin to read all would have been well but for a bright idea which struck some undiscovered youth at the back of the room  three cheers for fenn observed this genial spirit in no uncertain voice  the idea caught on it was just what was wanted to give a finish to the evenings festivities fenn had done well by the house he had scored four centuries and an eighty and was going to knock off the runs against blackburns tomorrow off his own bat also he had taken eighteen wickets in the final housematch obviously fenn was a person deserving of all encouragement it would be a pity to let him think that his effort had passed unnoticed by the fags room happy thought three cheers and one more and then hes a jolly good fellow to wind up with  it was while those familiar words its a way we have in the public schooools were echoing through the room in various keys that a small and energetic form brushed past fenn as he stood in the doorway vainly trying to stop the fags choral efforts  it was mr kay  the singing ceased gradually very gradually it was some time before mr kay could make himself heard but after a couple of minutes there was a lull and the housemasters address began to be audible   unendurable noise what is the meaning of it i will not have it do you hear it is disgraceful every boy in this room will write me two hundred lines by tomorrow evening it is abominable fenn he wheeled round towards the head of the house fenn i am surprised at you standing here and allowing such a disgraceful disturbance to go on really if you cannot keep order betterit is disgraceful disgraceful  mr kay shot out of the room fenn followed in his wake and the procession made its way to the housemasters study it had been a near thing but the last straw had arrived before the holidays  mr kay wheeled round as he reached his study door  well fenn  fenn said nothing  have you anything you wish to say fenn  i thought you might have something to say to me sir  i do not understand you fenn  i thought you might wish to apologise for slanging me in front of the fags  it is wonderful what a difference the last straw will make in ones demeanour to a person  apologise i think you forget whom it is you are speaking to  when a master makes this wellworn remark the wise youth realises that the time has come to close the conversation all fenns prudence however had gone to the four winds  if you wanted to tell me i was not fit to be head of the house you neednt have done it before a roomful of fags how do you think i can keep order in the house if you do that sort of thing  mr kay overcame his impulse to end the interview abruptly in order to put in a thrust  you do not keep order in the house fenn he said acidly  i do when i am not interfered with  you will be good enough to say sir when you speak to me fenn said mr kay thereby scoring another point in the stress of the moment fenn had not noticed the omission  he was silenced and before he could recover himself mr kay was in his study and there was a closed forbidding door between them  and as he stared at it it began slowly to dawn upon fenn that he had not shown up to advantage in the recent interview in a word he had made a fool of himself     iii  the final housematch   blackburns took the field at three punctually on the following afternoon to play out the last act of the final housematch they were not without some small hope of victory for curious things happen at cricket especially in the fourth innings of a match and runs are admitted to be easier saved than made yet seventynine seemed an absurdly small score to try and dismiss a team for and in view of the fact that that team contained a batsman like fenn it seemed smaller still but jimmy silver resolutely as he had declared victory impossible to his intimate friends was not the man to depress his team by letting it become generally known that he considered blackburns chances small  you must work like niggers in the field he said dont give away a run seventynine isnt much to make but if we get fenn out for a few they wont come near it  he did not add that in his opinion fenn would take very good care that he did not get out for a few it was far more likely that he would make that seventynine off his own bat in a dozen overs  youd better begin kennedy he continued from the top end place your men where you want em i should have an extra man in the deep if i were you thats where fenn kept putting them last innings and youll want a short leg only for goodness sake keep them off the legside if you can its a safe four to fenn every time if you dont look out you chaps man in  kays first pair were coming down the pavilion steps  challis going to his place at short slip called silvers attention to a remarkable fact  hullo he said why isnt fenn coming in first  what by jove nor he is thats queer all the better for us you might get a bit finer challis in case they snick em  wayburn who had accompanied fenn to the wicket at the beginning of kays first innings had now for his partner one walton a large unpleasantlooking youth said to be a bit of a bruiser and known to be a black sheep he was one of those who made life at kays so close an imitation of an inferno his cricket was of a rustic order he hit hard and high when allowed to do so he hit often but as a rule he left early a prey to the slips or deep fields today was no exception to that rule  kennedys first ball was straight and mediumpaced it was a little too short however and walton letting go at it with a semicircular sweep like the drive of a golfer sent it soaring over midons head and over the boundary cheers from the pavilion  kennedy bowled his second ball with the same purposeful air and walton swept at it as before there was a click and jimmy silver who was keeping wicket took the ball comfortably on a level with his chin  hows that  the umpires hand went up and walton went outreluctantly murmuring legends of how he had not gone within a yard of the thing  it was only when the next batsman who emerged from the pavilion turned out to be his young brother and not fenn that silver began to see that something was wrong it was conceivable that fenn might have chosen to go in first wicket down instead of opening the batting but not that he should go in second wicket if kays were to win it was essential that he should begin to bat as soon as possible otherwise there might be no time for him to knock off the runs however good a batsman is he can do little if no one can stay with him  there was no time to question the newcomer he must control his curiosity until the fall of the next wicket  man in he said  billy silver was in many ways a miniature edition of his brother and he carried the resemblance into his batting the head of blackburns was stylish and took no risks his brother had not yet developed a style but he was very settled in his mind on the subject of risks there was no tempting him with halfvolleys and longhops his motto was defence not defiance he placed a straight bat in the path of every ball and seemed to consider his duty done if he stopped it  the remainder of the over was therefore quiet billy played kennedys fastest like a book and left the more tempting ones alone  challiss first over realised a single wayburn snicking him to leg the first ball of kennedys second over saw him caught at the wicket as walton had been  every time a coconut said jimmy silver complacently as he walked to the other end were a powerful combination kennedy wheres fenn does anybody know why doesnt he come in  billy silver seated on the grass by the side of the crease fastening the top strap of one of his pads gave tongue with the eagerness of the wellinformed man  what dont you know he said why theres been an awful row fenn wont be able to play till four oclock i believe he and kay had a row last night and he cheeked kay and the old mans given him a sort of extra i saw him going over to the school house and i heard him tell wayburn that he wouldnt be able to play till four  the effect produced by this communication would be most fittingly expressed by the word sensation in brackets it came as a complete surprise to everyone it seemed to knock the bottom out of the whole match without fenn the thing would be a farce kays would have no chance  what a worm that man is said kennedy do you know i had a sort of idea fenn wouldnt last out much longer kays been ragging him all the term i went round to see him last night and kay behaved like a bounder then i expect fenn had it out with him when they got indoors what a beastly shame though  beastly agreed jimmy silver still it cant be helped the sins of the housemaster are visited on the house im afraid it will be our painful duty to wipe the floor with kays this day speaking at a venture i should say that we have got them where the hairs short yea even on toast if i may be allowed to use the expression who is this coming forth now curtis or me old eyes deceive me and is not curtiss record score three marred by ten chances indeed yes a fastish yorker should settle curtiss young hash try one  kennedy followed the recipe a ball later the middle and leg stumps were lying in picturesque attitudes some yards behind the crease and curtis was beginning that sad unending walk to the pavilion thinking with the poet      thou wast not made to play infernal ball  blackburns noncombatants dotted round the boundary shrieked their applause three wickets had fallen for five runs and life was worth living kays were silent and gloomy  billy silver continued to occupy one end in an immovable manner but at the other there was no monotony man after man came in padded and gloved and looking capable of mighty things they took guard patted the ground lustily as if to make it plain that they were going to stand no nonsense settled their caps over their eyes and prepared to receive the ball when it came it usually took a stump or two with it before it stopped it was a procession such as the school grounds had not often seen as the tenth man walked from the pavilion four sounded from the clock over the great hall and five minutes later the weary eyes of the supporters of kays were refreshed by the sight of fenn making his way to the arena from the direction of the school house  just as he arrived on the scene billy silvers defence broke down one of challiss slows which he had left alone with the idea that it was going to break away to the off came in quickly instead and removed a bail billy silver had only made eight but as the full score including one bye was only eighteen this was above the average and deserved the applause it received  fenn came in in the unusual position of eleventh man with an expression on his face that seemed to suggest that he meant business he was curiously garbed owing to the shortness of the interval allowed him for changing he had only managed to extend his cricket costume as far as white buckskin boots he wore no pads or gloves but even in the face of these sartorial deficiencies he looked like a cricketer the field spread out respectfully and jimmy silver moved a man from the slips into the country  there were three more balls of challiss over for billy silvers collapse had occurred at the third delivery fenn mistimed the first two hours writing indoors does not improve the eye the ball missed the leg stump by an inch  about the fifth ball he made no mistake he got the full face of the bat to it and it hummed past coverpoint to the boundary the last of the over he put to leg for three  a remarkable lastwicket partnership now took place remarkable not so much for tall scoring as for the fact that one of the partners did not receive a single ball from beginning to end of it with the exception of the one that bowled him fenn seemed to be able to do what he pleased with the bowling kennedy he played with a shade more respect than the others but he never failed to score a three or a single off the last ball of each of his overs the figures on the telegraphboard rose from twenty to thirty from thirty to forty from forty to fifty williams went on at the lower end instead of challis and fenn made twelve off his first over the pavilion was filled with howling enthusiasts who cheered every hit in a frenzy  jimmy silver began to look worried he held a hasty consultation with kennedy the telegraphboard now showed the figures 6098  this wont do said silver it would be too foul to get licked after having nine of them out for eighteen cant you manage to keep fenn from scoring odd figures off the last ball of your over if only that kid at the other end would get some of the bowling we should do it  ill try said kennedy and walked back to begin his over  fenn reached his fifty off the third ball seventy went up on the board ten more and kays would have the cup the fourth ball was too good to hit fenn let it pass the fifth he drove to the on it was a big hit but there was a fieldsman in the neighbourhood still it was an easy two but to kennedys surprise fenn sent his partner back after they had run a single even the umpire was surprised fenns policy was so obvious that it was strange to see him thus deliberately allow his partner to take a ball  thats not over you know fenn said the umpirelang of the school house a member of the first eleven  fenn looked annoyed he had miscounted the balls and now his partner who had no pretensions to be considered a bat would have to face kennedy  that mistake lost kays the match  impossible as he had found it to defeat fenn kennedy had never lost his head or his length he was bowling fully as well as he had done at the beginning of the innings  the last ball of the over beat the batsman all the way he scooped blindly forward missed it by a foot and the next moment the off stump lay flat blackburns had won by seven runs     iv  harmony and discord   what might be described as a mixed reception awaited the players as they left the field the pavilion and the parts about the pavilion rails were always packed on the last day of a final housematch and even in normal circumstances there was apt to be a little sparring between the juniors of the two houses which had been playing for the cup in the present case therefore it was not surprising that kays fags took the defeat badly the thought that fenns presence at the beginning of the innings instead of at the end would have made all the difference between a loss and a victory maddened them the crowd that seethed in front of the pavilion was a turbulent one  for a time the operation of chairing fenn up the steps occupied the active minds of the kayites when he had disappeared into the first eleven room they turned their attention in other directions caustic and uncomplimentary remarks began to fly to and fro between the representatives of kays and blackburns it is not known who actually administered the first blow but when fenn came out of the pavilion with kennedy and silver he found a stirring battle in progress the members of the other houses who had come to look on at the match stood in knots and gazed with approval at the efforts of kays and blackburns juniors to wipe each other off the face of the earth the air was full of shrill battlecries varied now and then by a smack or a thud as some young but strenuous fist found a billet the fortune of war seemed to be distributed equally so far and the combatants were just warming to their work  look here said kennedy we ought to stop this  whats the good said fenn without interest it pleases them and doesnt hurt anybody else  all the same observed jimmy silver moving towards the nearest group of combatants free fights arent quite the thing somehow for children you should never let your angry passions rise your little hands were never made to tear each others eyes dr watts advice to young pugilists drop it you little beasts  he separated two heated youths who were just beginning a fourth round the rest of the warriors seeing silver and the others called a truce and silver having read a sort of riot act moved on the juniors of the beaten house deciding that it would be better not to resume hostilities consoled themselves by giving three groans for mr kay  what happened after i left you last night fenn asked kennedy  oh i had one of my usual rows with kay only rather worse than usual i said one or two things he didnt like and today the old man sent for me and told me to come to his room from two till four kay had run me in for being grossly rude listen to those kids what a row theyre making  its a beastly shame said kennedy despondently  at the school shop morrell of mulhollands met them he had been spending the afternoon with a rug and a novel on the hills at the back of the school and he wanted to know how the final housematch had gone blackburns had beaten mulhollands in one of the early rounds kennedy explained what had happened  we should have lost if fenn had turned up earlier he said he had a row with kay and kay gave him a sort of extra between two and four  fenn busily occupied with an ice added no comment of his own to this plain tale  rough luck said morrell whats all that row out in the field  thats kays kids giving three groans for kay explained silver at least they started with the idea of giving three groans theyve got up to about three hundred by this time it seems to have fascinated them they wont leave off theres no school rule against groaning in the grounds and they mean to groan till the end of the term personally i like the sound but then im fond of music  morrells face beamed with sudden pleasure i knew there was something i wanted to tell you he said only i couldnt remember what your saying youre fond of music reminds me mulhollands crocked himself and wont be able to turn out for the concert  what cried kennedy how did it happen whats he done  mr mulholland was the master who looked after the music of the school a fine cricketer and keen sportsman had nothing gone wrong he would have conducted at the concert that night  i heard it from the matron at our place said morrell shes full of it mulholland was batting at the middle net and somebody elsei forget whowas at the one next to it on the right the bowler sent down a longhop to leg and this johnny had a smack at it and sent it slap through the net and it got mulholland on the side of the head he was stunned for a bit but hes getting all right again now but he wont be able to conduct tonight rather bad luck on the man especially as hes so keen on the concert  whos going to sub for him asked silver perhaps theyll scratch the show suggested kennedy  oh no said morrell its all right kay is going to conduct hes often done it at choir practices when mulholland couldnt turn up  fenn put down his empty saucer with an emphatic crack on the counter  if kays going to run the show im hanged if i turn up he said  my dear chap you cant get out of it now said kennedy anxiously he did not want to see fenn plunging into any more strife with the authorities this term  think of the crowned heads who are coming to hear you pleaded jimmy silver think of the nobility and gentry think of me you must play  ah there you are fenn  mr kay had bustled in in his energetic way  fenn said nothing he was there it was idle to deny it  i thought i should find you here yes i wanted to see you about the concert tonight mr mulholland has met with an unfortunate accident and i am looking after the entertainment in his place come with me and play over your piece i should like to see that you are perfect in it dear me dear me what a noise those boys are making why are they behaving in that extraordinary way i wonder  kays juniors had left the pavilion and were trooping back to their house at the present moment they were passing the school shop and their tuneful voices floated in through the open window  this is very unusual why they seem to be boys in my house they are groaning  i think they are a little upset at the result of the match sir said jimmy silver suavely fenn did not arrive for some reason till the end of the innings so mr blackburns won the wicket was good but a little fiery  thank you silver replied mr kay with asperity when i require explanations i will ask for them  he darted out of the shop and a moment later they heard him pouring out a flood of recriminations on the groaning fags  there was once a man who snubbed me said jimmy silver they buried him at brookwood well what are you going to do fenn going to play tonight harkee boy say but the word and i will beard this tyrant to his face  fenn rose  yes he said briefly i shall play youd better turn up i think youll enjoy it  silver said that no human power should keep him away                                       the school concert was always one of the events of the summer term there was a concert at the end of the winter term too but it was not so important to a great many of those present the summer concert marked as it were the last flutter of their school life on the morrow they would be old boys and it behoved them to extract as much enjoyment from the function as they could under mr mullhollands rule the concert had become a very flourishing institution he aimed at a high standard and reached it there was more than a touch of the austere about the music a glance at the programme was enough to show the lover of airs of the trashy clashy order that this was no place for him most of the items were serious when it was thought necessary to introduce a lighter touch some staidly rollicking number was inserted some song that was savedin spite of a catchy tuneby a halo of antiquity anything modern was taboo unless it were the work of gotsuchakoff thingummyowsky or some other eminent foreigner foreign origin made it just possible  the school prefects lurked during the performance at the doors and at the foot of the broad stone steps that led to the great hall it was their duty to supply visitors with programmes  jimmy silver had foregathered with kennedy challis and williams at the junior door the hall was full now and their labours consequently at an end  pretty good gate said silver looking in through the open door it must be warm up in the gallery  across the further end of the hall a dais had been erected on this the bulk of the school sat leaving the body of the hall to the crowned heads nobility and gentry to whom silver had referred in his conversation with fenn  it always is warm in the gallery said challis i lost about two stone there every concert when i was a kid we simply used to sit and melt  and i tell you what broke in silver its going to get warmer before the end of the show do you notice that all kays house are sitting in a lump at the back i bet theyre simply spoiling for a row especially now kays running the concert theres going to be a hot time in the old town tonightyou see if there isnt hark at em  the choir had just come to the end of a little thing of handels there was no reason to suppose that the gallery appreciated handel nevertheless they were making a deafening noise clouds of dust rose from the rhythmical stamping of many feet the noise was loudest and the dust thickest by the big window beneath which sat the men from kays things were warming up  the gallery with one last stamp which nearly caused the dais to collapse quieted down the masters in the audience looked serious one or two of the visitors glanced over their shoulders with a smile how excited the dear boys were at the prospect of holidays young blood young blood boys would be boys  the concert continued halfway through the programme there was a ten minutes interval fenns pianoforte solo was the second item of the second half  he mounted the platform amidst howls of delight from the gallery applause at the eckleton concerts was granted more for services in the playingfields than merit as a musician kubelik or paderewski would have been welcomed with a few polite handclaps a man in the eleven or fifteen was certain of two minutes unceasing cheers  evidently one of their heroes my dear said paterfamilias to materfamilias i suppose he has won a scholarship at the university  paterfamilias mind was accustomed to run somewhat upon scholarships at the university what the school wanted was a batting average of forty odd or a bowling analysis in single figures  fenn played the moonlight sonata a trained musical critic would probably have found much to cavil at in his rendering of the piece but it was undoubtedly good for a public school player of course he was encored the gallery would have encored him if he had played with one finger three mistakes to every bar  i told fenn said jimmy silver if he got an encore that he ought to play themy aunt he is  three runs and halfadozen crashes and there was no further room for doubt fenn was playing the coon band contest  hes gone mad gasped kennedy  whether he had or not it is certain that the gallery had all the evening they had been stewing in an atmosphere like that of the inner room of a turkish bath and they were ready for anything it needed but a trifle to set them off the lilt of that unspeakable yankee melody supplied that trifle kays malcontents huddled in their seats by the window were the first to break out feet began to stamp in time to the musicsoftly at first then more loudly the wooden dais gave out the sound like a drum  other rioters joined in from the right the noise spread through the gallery as a fire spreads through gorse soon three hundred pairs of wellshod feet were rising and falling somebody began to whistle everybody whistled mr kay was on his feet gesticulating wildly his words were lost in the uproar  for five minutes the din prevailed then with a final crash fenn finished he got up from the musicstool bowed and walked back to his place by the senior door the musical efforts of the gallery changed to a storm of cheering and clapping  the choir rose to begin the next piece  still the noise continued  people began to leave the hallin ones and twos first then in a steady stream which blocked the doorways it was plain to the dullest intelligence that if there was going to be any more concert it would have to be performed in dumb show mr kay flung down his baton  the visitors had left by now and the gallery was beginning to follow their example howling as it went  well said jimmy silver cheerfully as he went with kennedy down the steps i think we may call that a record by my halidom therell be a row about this later on     v  camp   with the best intentions in the world however a headmaster cannot make a row about a thing unless he is given a reasonable amount of time to make it in the concert being on the last evening of term there was only a single morning before the summer holidays and that morning was occupied with the prizegiving the school assembled at ten oclock with a shadowy hope that this prizeday would be more exciting than the general run of prizedays but they were disappointed the function passed off without sensation the headmaster did not denounce the school in an impassioned speech from the dais he did not refer to the events of the previous evening at the same time his demeanour was far from jovial it lacked that rollicking bonhomie which we like to see in headmasters on prizeday it was evident to the most casual observer that the affair was not closed the school would have to pay the bill sooner or later but eight weeks would elapse before the day of reckoning which was a comforting thought  the last prize was handed over to its rightful owner the last and dullest vote of thanks had been proposed by the last and dullest member of the board of governors the bishop of rumtifoo who had been selected this year to distribute the prizes had worked off his seventy minutes speech inaudible of course as usual and was feeling much easier the term had been formally declared at an end and those members of the school corps who were going to camp were beginning to assemble in front of the buildings  i wonder why it always takes about three hours to get us off to the station said jimmy silver ive been to camp two years now and theres always been this rotting about in the grounds before we start nobodys likely to turn up to inspect us for the next hour or so if any gent cares to put in a modest gingerbeer at the shop im with him  i dont see why we shouldnt said kennedy he had seen fenn go into the shop and wished to talk to him he had not seen him after the concert and he thought it would be interesting to know how kay had taken it and what his comments had been on meeting fenn in the house that night  fenn had not much to say  he was rather worried he said grinning as if the recollection of the interview amused him but he couldnt do anything of course therell be a row next term but it cant be helped  if i were you said silver i should point out to them that youd a perfect right to play what you liked for an encore how were you to know the gallery would go off like that you arent responsible for them hullo theres that bugle things seem to be on the move we must go  so long said fenn  goodbye mind you come off against middlesex  kennedy stayed for a moment  has the old man said anything to you yet he asked  not yet hell do that next term itll be something to look forward to  kennedy hurried off to take his place in the ranks  getting to camp at the end of the summer term is always a nuisance aldershot seems a long way from everywhere and the trains take their time over the journey then again the heat always happens to be particularly oppressive on that day snow may have fallen on the day before but directly one sets out for camp the thermometer goes up into three figures the eckleton contingent marched into the lines damp and very thirsty  most of the other schools were already on the spot and looked as if they had been spending the last few years there there was nothing particular going on when the eckleton warriors arrived and everybody was lounging about in khaki and shirtsleeves looking exasperatingly cool the only consolation which buoyed up the spirits of eckleton was the reflection that in a short space of time when the importantlooking gentleman in uniform who had come to meet them had said all he wanted to say on the subject of rules and regulations they would be like that too happy thought if the man bucked up and cut short the peroration there would be time for a bathe in cove reservoir those of the corps who had been to camp in previous years felt quite limp with the joy of the thought why couldnt he get through with it and give a fellow a chance of getting cool again  the gist of the oration was apparently that the eckleton cadets were to consider themselves not only as soldiersand as such subject to military discipline and the rules for the conduct of troops quartered in the aldershot districtbut also as members of a public school in short that if they misbehaved themselves they would get cells and a hundred lines in the same breath as it were  the corps knew all this ages ago the man seemed to think he was telling them something fresh they began positively to dislike him after a while  he finished at last eckleton marched off wearily but in style to its lines  dismiss  they did  and about time too said jimmy silver i wish they would tie that man up or something hes one of the worst bores i know he may be full of bright conversation in private life but in public he will talk about his beastly military regulations you cant stop him its a perfect mania with him now i believethats to say i have a sort of dim ideathat theres a place round about here called a canteen i seem to remember such a thing vaguely we might go and look for it  kennedy made no objection  this was his first appearance at camp jimmy silver on the other hand was a veteran he had been there twice before and meant to go again he had a peculiar and extensive knowledge of the ins and outs of the place kennedy was quite willing to take him as his guide he was full of information kennedy was surprised to see what a number of men from the other schools he seemed to know in the canteen there were amongst others a carthusian two tonbridge men and a haileyburian they all greeted silver with the warmth of old friends  you get to know a lot of fellows in camp explained jimmy as they strolled back to the eckleton lines thats the best of the place camps the best place on earth if only you have decent weather see that chap over there he came here last year hed never been before and one of the things he didnt know was that cove reservoirs only about three feet deep round the sides he took a running dive and almost buried himself in the mud its about two feet deep he told me afterwards he swallowed pounds of it rather bad luck somebody ought to have told him you cant do much diving here  glad you mentioned it said kennedy i should have dived myself if you hadnt  many other curious and diverting facts did the expert drag from the bonded warehouse of his knowledge nothing changes at camp once get to know the ropes and you know them for all time  the one thing i bar he said is having to get up at halfpast five and one day in the week when theres a divisional fieldday its halfpast four its hardly worth while going to sleep at all still it isnt so bad as it used to be the first year i came to camp we used to have to do a three hours fieldday before brekker we used to have coffee before it and nothing else till it was over by jove you felt youd had enough of it before you got back this is laffans plain the worst of laffans plain is that you get to know it too well you get jolly sick of always starting on fielddays from the same place and marching across the same bit of ground still i suppose they cant alter the scenery for our benefit see that man there he won the sabres at aldershot last year that chap with him is in the clifton footer team  when a school corps goes to camp it lives in a number of tents and as a rule each house collects in a tent of its own blackburns had a tent and further down the line kays had assembled the kay contingent were under wayburn a good sort as far as he himself was concerned but too weak to handle a mob like kays wayburn was not coming back after the holidays a fact which perhaps still further weakened his hold on the kayites they had nothing to fear from him next term  kays was represented at camp by a dozen or so of its members of whom young billy silver alone had any pretensions to the esteem of his fellow man kays was the rowdiest house in the school and the cream of its rowdy members had come to camp there was walton for one a perfect specimen of the public school man at his worst there was mortimer another of kays gems perry again and callingham and the rest a pleasant gang fit for anything if it could be done in safety  kennedy observed them andthe spectacle starting a train of thoughtasked jimmy silver as they went into their tent just before lightsout if there was much ragging in camp  not very much said the expert chaps are generally too done up at the end of the day to want to do anything except sleep still ive known cases you sometimes get one tent mobbing another they loose the ropes you know low trick i think it isnt often done and it gets dropped on like bricks when its found out but why do you feel as if you wanted to do it  it only occurred to me that weve got a lively gang from kays here i was wondering if theyd get any chances of ragging or if theyd have to lie low  id forgotten kays for the moment now you mention it they are rather a crew but i shouldnt think theyd find it worth while to rot about here it isnt as if they were on their native heath people have a prejudice against having their tentropes loosed and theyd get beans if they did anything in that line i remember once there was a tent which made itself objectionable and it got raided in the night by a sort of vigilance committee from the other schools and the chaps in it got the dickens of a time none of them ever came to camp again i hope kaysll try and behave decently itll be an effort for them but i hope theyll make it it would be an awful nuisance if young billy made an ass of himself in any way he loves making an ass of himself its a sort of hobby of his  as if to support the statement a sudden volley of subdued shouts came from the other end of the eckleton lines  go it wren  stick to it silver  wren  silver  ssh  silence followed almost immediately by a gruff voice inquiring with simple directness what the dickens all this noise was about  hullo said kennedy did you hear that i wonder whats been up your brother was in it whatever it was  of course said jimmy silver he would be we cant find out about it now though ill ask him tomorrow if i remember i shant remember of course good night  good night  half an hour later kennedy who had been ruminating over the incident in his usual painstaking way reopened the debate  whos wren he asked  wha murmured silver sleepily  whos wren repeated kennedy  i dknow oh lil beast kays red hair gni  and sleep reigned in blackburns tent     vi  the raid on the guardtent   wren and billy silver had fallen out over a question of space it was silvers opinion that wrens nest ought to have been built a foot or two further to the left he stated baldly that he had not room to breathe and requested the redheaded one to ease off a point or so in the direction of his nextdoor neighbour wren had refused and after a few moments chatty conversation smote william earnestly in the wind trouble had begun upon the instant it had ceased almost as rapidly owing to interruptions from without but the truce had been merely temporary they continued the argument outside the tent at fivethirty the next morning after the reveille had sounded amidst shouts of approval from various shivering mortals who were tubbing preparatory to embarking on the labours of the day  a brisk first round had just come to a conclusion when walton lounged out of the tent yawning  walton proceeded to separate the combatants after which he rebuked billy silver with a swaggerstick wrens share in the business he overlooked he was by way of being a patron of wrens and he disliked billy silver partly for his own sake and partly because he hated his brother with whom he had come into contact once or twice during his career at eckleton always with unsatisfactory results  so walton dropped on to billy silver and wren continued his toilet rejoicing  camp was beginning the strenuous life now tent after tent emptied itself of its occupants who stretched themselves vigorously and proceeded towards the tubbingground where there were tin baths for those who cared to wait until the same were vacant and a good honest pump for those who did not then there was that unpopular job the piling of ones bedding outside the tent and the rolling up of the tent curtains but these unpleasant duties came to an end at last and signs of breakfast began to appear  breakfast gave kennedy his first insight into life in camp he happened to be tentorderly that day and it therefore fell to his lot to join the orderlies from the other tents in their search for the eckleton rations he returned with a cargo of bread obtained from the quartermaster and later with a great tin of meat which the cookhouse had supplied and felt that this was life hitherto breakfast had been to him a thing of white cloths tables and food that appeared from nowhere this was the first time he had ever tracked his food to its source so to speak and brought it back with him after breakfast when he was informed that as tentorderly for the day it was his business to wash up he began to feel as if he were on a desert island he had never quite realised before what washingup implied and he was conscious of a feeling of respect for the servants at blackburns who did it every day as a matter of course without complaint he had had no idea before this of the intense stickiness of a jammy plate  one day at camp is much like another the schools opened the day with parade drill at about eight oclock and after an instruction series of changing direction halfleft in column of double companies and other pleasant movements of a similar nature adjourned for lunch lunch was much like breakfast except that the supply of jam was cut off the people who arrange these thingsprobably the war office or mr brodrick or someonehave come to the conclusion that two pots of jam per tent are sufficient for breakfast and lunch the unwary devour theirs recklessly at the earlier meal and have to go jamless until tea at six oclock when another pot is served out  the afternoon at camp is perfect or otherwise according to whether there is a four oclock fieldday or not if there is there are more manoeuvrings until teatime and the time is spent profitably but not so pleasantly as it might be if there is no fieldday you can take your time about your bathe in cove reservoir and a really satisfactory bathe on a hot day should last at least three hours kennedy and jimmy silver strolled off in the direction of the reservoir as soon as they felt that they had got over the effects of the beef potatoes and gingerbeer which a generous commissariat had doled out to them for lunch it was a glorious day and bathing was the only thing to do for the next hour or so stumpcricket that fascinating sport much indulged in in camp would not be at its best until the sun had cooled off a little  after a pleasant half hour in the mud and water of the reservoir they lay on the bank and watched the rest of the schools take their afternoon dip kennedy had laid in a supply of provisions from the stall which stood at the camp end of the water neither of them felt inclined to move  this is decent said kennedy wriggling into a more comfortable position in the long grass hullo  whats up inquired jimmy silver lazily  he was almost asleep  look at those idiots theyre certain to get spotted  jimmy silver tilted his hat off his face and sat up  whats the matter which idiot  kennedy pointed to a bush on their right walton and perry were seated beside it both were smoking  oh thats all right said silver masters never come to cove reservoir its a sort of unwritten law theyre rotters to smoke all the same certain to get spotted some day not worth it spoils lungs beastly bad  training  he dozed off the sun was warm and the grass very soft and comfortable kennedy turned his gaze to the reservoir again it was no business of his what walton and perry did  walton and perry were discussing ways and means the conversation changed as they saw kennedy glance at them they were the sort of persons who feel a vague sense of injury when anybody looks at them perhaps because they feel that those whose attention is attracted to them must say something to their discredit when they begin to talk about them  theres that beast kennedy said walton i cant stick that man hes always hanging round the house what he comes for i cant make out  pal of fenns suggested perry  he hangs on to fenn i bet fenn bars him really  perry doubted this in his innermost thoughts but it was not worth while to say so  those blackburn chaps continued walton reverting to another grievance will stick on no end of side next term about that cup they wouldnt have had a look in if kay hadnt given fenn that extra kay ought to be kicked im hanged if im going to care what i do next term somebody ought to do something to take it out of kay for getting his own house licked like that  walton spoke as if the line of conduct he had mapped out for himself would be a complete reversal of his customary mode of life as a matter of fact he had never been in the habit of caring very much what he did  waltons last remarks brought the conversation back to where it had been before the mention of kennedy switched it off on to new lines perry had been complaining that he thought camp a fraud that it was all drilling and getting up at unearthly hours he reminded walton that he had only come on the strength of the latters statement that it would be a rag where did the rag come in that was what perry wanted to know  when its not a ghastly sweat he concluded its slow like it is now cant we do something for a change  as a matter of fact said walton nearly all the best rags are played out a chap at a crammers told me last holidays that when he was at camp he and some other fellows loosed the ropes of the guardtent he said it was grand sport  perry sat up  thats the thing he said excitedly lets do that why not  its beastly risky objected walton  whats that matter they cant do anything even if they spot us  thats all you know we should get beans  still its worth risking it would be the biggest rag going did the chap tell you how they did it  yes said walton becoming animated as he recalled the stirring tale they bagged the sentry chucked a cloth or something over his head you know then they shoved him into the ditch and one of them sat on him while the others loosed the ropes it took the chaps inside no end of a time getting out  thats the thing well do it we only need one other chap leveson would come if we asked him lets get back to the lines its almost teatime tell him after tea  leveson proved agreeable indeed he jumped at it his life his attitude suggested had been a hollow mockery until he heard the plan but now he could begin to enjoy himself once more  the lightsout bugle sounded at ten oclock the last post at tenthirty at a quarter to twelve the three adventurers who had been keeping themselves awake by the exercise of great pains satisfied themselves that the other occupants of the tent were asleep and stole out  it was an excellent night for their purpose there was no moon and the stars were hidden by clouds  they crept silently towards the guardtent a dim figure loomed out of the blackness they noted with satisfaction as it approached that it was small sentries at the publicschool camp vary in physique they felt that it was lucky that the task of sentrygo had not fallen that night to some muscular forward from one of the school fifteens or worse still to a boxing expert who had figured in the aldershot competition at easter the present sentry would be an easy victim  they waited for him to arrive  a moment later private jones of st asterisksfor it was heturning to resume his beat found himself tackled from behind two moments later he was reclining in the ditch he would have challenged his adversary but unfortunately that individual happened to be seated on his face  he struggled but to no purpose  he was still struggling when a muffled roar of indignation from the direction of the guardtent broke the stillness of the summer night the roar swelled into a crescendo what seemed like echoes came from other quarters out of the darkness the camp was waking  the noise from the guardtent waxed louder  the unknown marauder rose from his seat on private jones and vanished  private jones also rose he climbed out of the ditch shook himself looked round for his assailant and not finding him hurried to the guardtent to see what was happening     vii  a clue   the guardtent had disappeared  private jones bewildered eye rolling in a fine frenzy from heaven to earth and from earth to heaven in search of the missing edifice found it at last in a tangled heap upon the ground it was too dark to see anything distinctly but he perceived that the canvas was rising and falling spasmodically like a stage sea and for a similar reasonbecause there were human beings imprisoned beneath it  by this time the whole camp was up and doing figures in deshabille dashing the last vestiges of sleep away with their knuckles trooped on to the scene in twos and threes full of inquiry and trenchant sarcasm  what are you men playing at whats all the row about cant you finish that game of footer some other time when we arent trying to get to sleep what on earths up  then the voice of one having authority  whats the matter what are you doing  it was perfectly obvious what the guard was doing it was trying to get out from underneath the fallen tent private jones explained this with some warmth  somebody jumped at me and sat on my head in the ditch i couldnt get up and then some blackguard cut the ropes of the guardtent i couldnt see who it was he cut off directly the tent went down  private jones further expressed a wish that he could find the chap when he did there would he hinted be trouble in the old homestead  the tent was beginning to disgorge its prisoners  guard turn out said a facetious voice from the darkness  the camp was divided into two schools of thought those who were watching the guard struggle out thought the episode funny the guard did not it was pathetic to hear them on the subject of their mysterious assailants matters quieted down rapidly after the tent had been set up again the spectators were driven back to their lines by their officers the guard turned in again to try and restore their shattered nerves with sleep until their time for sentrygo came round private jones picked up his rifle and resumed his beat the affair was at an end as far as that night was concerned  next morning as might be expected nothing else was talked about conversation at breakfast was confined to the topic no halfpenny paper however many times its circulation might exceed that of any penny morning paper ever propounded so fascinating and puzzling a breakfasttable problem it was the utter impossibility of detecting the culprits that appealed to the schools they had swooped down like hawks out of the night and disappeared like eels into mud leaving no traces  jimmy silver of course had no doubts  it was those kays men he said what does it matter about evidence youve only got to look at em thats all the evidence you want the only thing that makes it at all puzzling is that they did nothing worse youd naturally expect them to slay the sentry at any rate  but the rest of the camp lacking that intimate knowledge of the kayite which he possessed did not turn the eye of suspicion towards the eckleton lines the affair remained a mystery kennedy who never gave up a problem when everybody else did continued to revolve the mystery in his mind  i shouldnt wonder he said to silver two days later if you were right  silver who had not made any remark for the last five minutes with the exception of abusive comments on the toughness of the meat which he was trying to carve with a blunt knife for the tent asked for an explanation i mean about that row the other night  what row  that guardtent business  oh that id forgotten why dont you move with the times youre always thinking of something thats been dead and buried for years  you remember you said you thought it was those kays chaps who did it ive been thinking it over and i believe youre right you see it was probably somebody whod been to camp before or he wouldnt have known that dodge of loosing the ropes  i dont see why seems to me its the sort of idea that might have occurred to anybody you dont want to study the thing particularly deeply to know that the best way of making a tent collapse is to loose the ropes of course it was kays lot who did it but i dont see how youre going to have them simply because one or two of them have been here before  no i suppose not said kennedy  after tea the other occupants of the tent went out of the lines to play stumpcricket silver was in the middle of a story in one of the magazines so did not accompany them kennedy cried off on the plea of slackness  i say he said when they were alone  hullo said silver finishing his story and putting down the magazine what do you say to going after those chaps i thought that story was going to be a long one that would take half an hour to get through but it collapsed like that guardtent  about that tent business said kennedy of course that was all rot what i was saying just now i suddenly remembered that i didnt particularly want anybody but you to hear what i was going to say so i had to invent any rot that i could think of  but now said jimmy silver sinking his voice to a melodramatic whisper the villagers have left us to continue their revels on the green our wicked uncle has gone to london his sinister retainer jasper murgleshaw is washing his hands in the scullery sink andwe are alone  dont be an ass pleaded kennedy  tell me your dreadful tale conceal nothing spare me not in fact say on  ive had a talk with the chap who was sentry that night began kennedy  astounding revelations by our special correspondent murmured silver  you might listen  i am listening why dont you begin all this hesitation strikes me as suspicious get on with your shady story  you remember the sentry was upset  very upset  somebody collared him from behind and upset him into the ditch they went in together and the other man sat on his head  a touching picture proceed friend  they rolled about a bit and this sentry chap swears he scratched the man it was just after that that the man sat on his head jones says he was a big chap strong and heavy  he was in a position to judge anyhow  of course he didnt mean to scratch him he was rather keen on having that understood but his fingers came up against the fellows cheek as he was falling so you see weve only got to look for a man with a scratch on his cheek it was the right cheek jones was almost certain i dont see what youre laughing at  i wish you wouldnt spring these good things of yours on me suddenly gurgled jimmy silver rolling about the wooden floor of the tent you ought to give a chap some warning look here he added imperatively swear youll take me with you when you go on your tour through camp examining everybodys right cheek to see if its got a scratch on it  kennedy began to feel the glow and pride of the successful sleuthhound leaking out of him this aspect of the case had not occurred to him the fact that the sentry had scratched his assailants right cheek added to the other indubitable fact that walton of kays was even now walking abroad with a scratch on his right cheek had seemed to him conclusive he had forgotten that there might be others still it was worth while just to question him he questioned him at cove reservoir next day  hullo walton he said with a friendly carelessness which would not have deceived a prattling infant nasty scratch youve got on your cheek how did you get it  perry did it when we were ragging a few days ago replied walton eyeing him distrustfully  oh said kennedy  silly fool said walton  talking about me inquired kennedy politely  no replied walton with the suavity of a chesterfield perry  they parted kennedy with the idea that walton was his man still more deeply rooted walton with an uncomfortable feeling that kennedy knew too much and that though he had undoubtedly scored off him for the moment a time as jimmy silver was fond of observing with a satanic laugh would come and then  he felt that it behoved him to be wary     viii  a night adventurethe dethronement of fenn   one of the things which make life on this planet more or less agreeable is the speed with which alarums excursions excitement and rows generally blow over a ninedays wonder has to be a big business to last out its full time nowadays as a rule the third day sees the end of it and the public rushes whooping after some other hare that has been started for its benefit the guardtent row as far as the bulk of camp was concerned lasted exactly two days at the end of which period it was generally agreed that all that could be said on the subject had been said and that it was now a back number nobody except possibly the authorities wanted to find out the authors of the raid and even private jones had ceased to talk about itthis owing to the unsympathetic attitude of his tent  jones the corporal had observed as the exsentrys narrative of his misfortunes reached a finish for the third time since reveille that morning if you cant manage to switch off that infernal chestnut of yours ill make you wash up all day and sit on your head all night  so jones had withdrawn his yarn from circulation kennedys interest in detective work waned after his interview with walton he was quite sure that walton had been one of the band but it was not his business to find out even had he found out he would have done nothing it was more for his own private satisfaction than for the furtherance of justice that he wished to track the offenders down but he did not look on the affair as jimmy silver did as rather sporting he had a tender feeling for the good name of the school and he felt that it was not likely to make eckleton popular with the other schools that went to camp if they got the reputation of practical jokers practical jokers are seldom popular until they have been dead a hundred years or so  as for walton and his colleagues to complete the list of those who were interested in this matter of the midnight raid they lay remarkably low after their successful foray they imagined that kennedy was spying on their every movement in which they were quite wrong for kennedy was doing nothing of the kind camp does not allow a great deal of leisure for the minding of other peoples businesses but this reflection did not occur to walton and he regarded kennedy whenever chance or his duties brought him into the neighbourhood of that worthys tent with a suspicion which increased whenever the latter looked at him  on the night before camp broke up a second incident of a sensational kind occurred which but for the fact that they never heard of it would have given the schools a good deal to talk about it happened that kennedy was on sentrygo that night the manner of sentrygo is thus at seven in the evening the guard falls in and patrols the fringe of the camp in relays till seven in the morning a guard consists of a sergeant a corporal and ten men they are on duty for two hours at a time with intervals of four hours between each spell in which intervals they sleep the sleep of tired men in the guardtent unless as happened on the occasion previously described some miscreant takes it upon himself to loose the ropes the ground to be patrolled by the sentries is divided into three parts each of which is entrusted to one man  kennedy was one of the ten privates and his first spell of sentrygo began at eleven oclock  on this night there was no moon it was as black as pitch it is always unpleasant to be on sentrygo on such a night the mind wanders in spite of all effort to check it through a long series of all the ghastly stories one has ever read there is one in particular of conan doyles about a mummy that came to life and chased people on lonely roadsbut enough however courageous one may be it is difficult not to speculate on the possible horrors which may spring out on one from the darkness that feeling that there is somebodyor somethingjust behind one can only be experienced in all its force by a sentry on an inky night at camp and the thought that of all the hundreds there he and two others are the only ones awake puts a sort of finishing touch to the unpleasantness of the situation  kennedy was not a particularly imaginative youth but he looked forward with no little eagerness to the time when he should be relieved it would be a relief in two senses of the word his beat included that side of the camp which faces the road to aldershot between camp and this road is a ditch and a wood after he had been on duty for an hour this wood began to suggest a variety of possibilities all grim the ditch too was not without associations it was into this that private jones had been hurled on a certain memorable occasion such a thing was not likely to happen again in the same week and even if it did kennedy flattered himself that he would have more to say in the matter than private jones had had but nevertheless he kept a careful eye in that direction whenever his beat took him along the ditch  it was about halfpast twelve and he had entered upon the last section of his two hours when kennedy distinctly heard footsteps in the wood he had heard so many mysterious sounds since his patrol began at eleven oclock that at first he was inclined to attribute this to imagination but a crackle of dead branches and the sound of soft breathing convinced him that this was the real thing for once and that as a sentry of the public schools camp on duty it behoved him to challenge the unknown  he stopped and waited peering into the darkness in a futile endeavour to catch a glimpse of his man but the night was too black for the keenest eye to penetrate it a slight thud put him on the right track it showed him two things first that the unknown had dropped into the ditch and secondly that he was a camp man returning to his tent after an illegal prowl about the town at lightsout nobody save one belonging to the camp would have cause to cross the ditch  besides the man walked warily as one not ignorant of the danger of sentries the unknown had crawled out of the ditch now as luck would have it he had chosen a spot immediately opposite to where kennedy stood now that he was nearer kennedy could see the vague outline of him  who goes there he said  from an instinctive regard for the others feelings he did not shout the question in the regulation manner he knew how he would feel himself if he were out of camp at halfpast twelve and the voice of the sentry were to rip suddenly through the silence fortissimo  as it was his question was quite loud enough to electrify the person to whom it was addressed the unknown started so violently that he nearly leapt into the air kennedy was barely two yards from him when he spoke  the next moment this fact was brought home to him in a very practical manner the unknown sighting the sentry perhaps more clearly against the dim whiteness of the tents than kennedy could sight him against the dark wood dashed in with a rapidity which showed that he knew something of the art of boxing kennedy dropped his rifle and flung up his arm he was altogether too late a sudden blaze of light and he was on the ground sick and dizzy a feeling he had often experienced before in a slighter degree when sparring in the eckleton gymnasium with the boxing instructor  the immediate effect of a flush hit in the regions about the jaw is to make the victim lose for the moment all interest in life kennedy lay where he had fallen for nearly half a minute before he fully realised what it was that had happened to him when he did realise the situation he leapt to his feet feeling sick and shaky and staggered about in all directions in a manner which suggested that he fancied his assailant would be waiting politely until he had recovered as was only natural that wily person had vanished and was by this time doing a quick change into garments of the night kennedy had the satisfaction of knowingfor what it was worththat his adversary was in one of those tents but to place him with any greater accuracy was impossible  so he gave up the search found his rifle and resumed his patrol and at one oclock his successor relieved him  on the following day camp broke up                                       kennedy always enjoyed going home but as he travelled back to eckleton on the last day of these summer holidays he could not help feeling that there was a great deal to be said for term he felt particularly cheerful he had the carriage to himself and he had also plenty to read and eat the train was travelling at forty miles an hour and there were all the pleasures of a first night after the holidays to look forward to when you dashed from one friends study to anothers comparing notes and explainingfive or six of you at a timewhat a good time you had had in the holidays this was always a pleasant ceremony at blackburns where all the prefects were intimate friends and all good sorts without that liberal admixture of weeds worms and outsiders which marred the list of prefects in most of the other houses such as kays kennedy could not restrain a momentary gloating as he contrasted the state of affairs in blackburns with what existed at kays then this feeling was merged in one of pity for fenns hard case how he must hate the beginning of term thought kennedy  all the wellknown stations were flashing by now in a few minutes he would be at the junction and in another halfhour back at blackburns he began to collect his baggage from the rack  nobody he knew was at the junction this was the late train that he had come down by most of the school had returned earlier in the afternoon  he reached blackburns at eight oclock and went up to his study to unpack this was always his first act on coming back to school he liked to start the term with all his books in their shelves and all his pictures and photographs in their proper places on the first day some of the studies looked like lumberrooms till near the end of the first week  he had filled the shelves and was arranging the artistic decorations when jimmy silver came in kennedy had been surprised that he had not met him downstairs but the matron had answered his inquiry with the statement that he was talking to mr blackburn in the other part of the house  when did you arrive asked silver after the conclusion of the first outbreak of holiday talk  ive only just come  seen blackburn yet  no i was thinking of going up after i had got this place done properly  jimmy silver ran his eye over the room  i havent started mine yet he said youre such an energetic man now are all those books in their proper places  yes said kennedy  sure  yes  how about the pictures got them up  all but this lot here shant be a second there you are hows that for effect  not bad got all your photographs in their places  yes  then said jimmy silver calmly youd better start now to pack them all up again and why my son because you are no longer a blackburnite thats what  kennedy stared  ive just had the whole yarn from blackburn continued jimmy silver our dear old pal mr kay wanting somebody in his house capable of keeping order by way of a change has gone to the old man and borrowed you so youre head of kays now theres an honour for you     ix  the sensations of an exile   what shouted kennedy  he sprang to his feet as if he had had an electric shock  jimmy silver having satisfied his passion for the dramatic by the abruptness with which he had exploded his mine now felt himself at liberty to be sympathetic  its quite true he said and thats just how i felt when blackburn told me blackburns as sick as anything naturally he doesnt see the point of handing you over to kay but the old man insisted so he caved in he wanted to see you as soon as you arrived youd better go now ill finish your packing  this was noble of jimmy for of all the duties of life he loathed packing most  thanks awfully said kennedy but dont you bother ill do it when i get back but whats it all about what made kay want a man why wont fenn do and why me  well its easy to see why they chose you they reflected that youd had the advantage of being in blackburns with me and seeing how a house really should be run kay wants a head for his house off he goes to the old man look here he says i want somebody shunted into my happy home or itll bust up and its no good trying to put me off with an inferior article because i wont have it it must be somebody whos been trained from youth up by silver then says the old man reflectively you cant do better than take kennedy i happen to know that silver has spent years in showing him the straight and narrow path you take kennedy all right says kay i always thought kennedy a bit of an ass myself but if hes studied under silver he ought to know how to manage a house ill take him advise our mr blackburn to that effect and ask him to deliver the goods at his earliest convenience adoo messmate adoo and there you arethats how it was  but whats wrong with fenn  my dear chap remember last term didnt fenn have a regular scrap with kay and get shoved into extra for it and didnt he wreck the concert in the most sportsmanlike way with that encore of his think the old man is going to take that grinning not much fenn made a ripping fifty against kent in the holidaysi saw him do itbut they dont count that its a wonder they didnt ask him to leave of course i think its jolly rough on fenn but i dont see that you can blame them not the old man at any rate he couldnt do anything else its all kays fault that all this has happened of course im awfully sorry for you having to go into that beastly hole but from kays point of view its a jolly sound move you may reform the place  i doubt it  so do ivery much i didnt say you wouldi said you might i wonder if kay means to give you a free hand it all depends on that  yes if hes going to interfere with me as he used to with fenn hell want to bring in another head to improve on me  rather a good idea that said jimmy silver laughing as he always did when any humorous possibilities suggested themselves to him if he brings in somebody to improve on you and then somebody else to improve on him and then another chap to improve on him he ought to have a decent house in halfadozen years or so  the worst of it is said kennedy that ive got to go to kays as a sort of rival to fenn i shouldnt mind so much if it wasnt for that i wonder how hell take it do you think he knows about it yet he didnt enjoy being head but thats no reason why he shouldnt cut up rough at being shoved back to second prefect its a beastly situation  beastly agreed jimmy silver look here he added after a pause theres no reason you know why this should make any difference to us i mean what i mean to say is i dont see why we shouldnt see each other just as often and so on simply because you are in another house and all that sort of thing you know what i mean  he spoke shamefacedly as was his habit whenever he was serious he liked kennedy better than anyone he knew and hated to show his feelings anything remotely connected with sentiment made him uncomfortable  of course said kennedy awkwardly  youll want a refuge said silver in his normal manner now that youre going to see wild life in kays dont forget that im always at home in my study in the afternoonsadmission on presentation of a visitingcard  all right said kennedy ill remember i suppose id better go and see blackburn now  mr blackburn was in his study he was obviously disgusted and irritated by what had happened loyalty to the headmaster and an appreciation of his position as a member of the staff led him to try and conceal his feelings as much as possible in his interview with kennedy but the latter understood as plainly as if his housemaster had burst into a flow of abuse and complaint there had always been an excellent understandingindeed a friendshipbetween kennedy and mr blackburn and the master was just as sorry to lose his second prefect as the latter was to go  well kennedy he said pleasantly i hope you had a good time in the holidays i suppose silver has told you the melancholy newsthat you are to desert us this term it is a great pity we shall all be very sorry to lose you i dont look forward to seeing you bowl us all out in the housematches next summer he added with a smile though we shall expect a few fullpitches to leg for the sake of old times  he meant well but the picture he conjured up almost made kennedy break down nothing up to the present had made him realise the completeness of his exile so keenly as this remark of mr blackburns about his bowling against the side for which he had taken so many wickets in the past it was a painful thought  i am afraid you wont have quite such a pleasant time in mr kays as you have had here resumed the housemaster of course i know that strictly speaking i ought not to talk like this about another masters house but you can scarcely be unaware of the reasons that have led to this change you must know that you are being sent to pull mr kays house together this is strictly between ourselves of course i think you have a difficult task before you but i dont fancy that you will find it too much for you and mind you come here as often as you please i am sure silver and the others will be glad to see you goodbye kennedy i think you ought to be getting across now to mr kays i told him that you would be there before halfpast nine good night  good night sir said kennedy  he wandered out into the house diningroom somehow though kays was only next door he could not get rid of the feeling that he was about to start on a long journey and would never see his old house again and in a sense this was so he would probably visit blackburns tomorrow afternoon but it would not be the same jimmy silver would greet him like a brother and he would brew in the same study in which he had always brewed and sit in the same chair but it would not be the same he would be an outsider a visitor a stranger within the gates andworst of alla kayite nothing could alter that  the walk of the diningroom were covered with photographs of the house cricket and football teams for the last fifteen years looking at them he felt more than ever how entirely his school life had been bound up in his house from his first day at eckleton he had been taught the simple creed of the blackburnite that eckleton was the finest school in the three kingdoms and that blackburns was the finest house in the finest school  under the gasbracket by the door hung the first photograph in which he appeared the cricket team of four years ago he had just got the last place in front of challis on the strength of a tremendous catch for the house second in a scratch game two days before the housematches began it had been a glaring fluke but it had impressed denny the head of the house who happened to see it and had won him his place  he walked round the room looking at each photograph in turn it seemed incredible that he had no longer any right to an interest in the success of blackburns he could have endured leaving all this when his time at school was up for that would have been the natural result of the passing of years but to be transplanted abruptly and with a wrench from his native soil was too much he went upstairs to pack suffering from as severe an attack of the blues as any youth of eighteen had experienced since blues were first invented  jimmy silver hovered round while he packed with expressions of sympathy and bitter remarks concerning mr kay and his wicked works and when the operation was concluded helped kennedy carry his box over to his new house with the air of one seeing a friend off to the parts beyond the equator  it was ten oclock by the time the front door of kays closed upon its new head kennedy went to the matrons sanctum to be instructed in the geography of the house the matron a severe lady whose faith in human nature had been terribly shaken by five years of office in kays showed him his dormitory and study with a lack of geniality which added a deeper tinge of azure to kennedys blues so youve come to live here have you her manner seemed to say well i pity you thats all a nice time youre going to have  kennedy spent the halfhour before going to bed in unpacking his box for the second time and arranging his books and photographs in the study which had been wayburns he had nothing to find fault with in the study it was as large as the one he had owned at blackburns and like it looked out over the school grounds  at halfpast ten the gas gave a flicker and went out turned off at the main kennedy lit a candle and made his way to his dormitory there now faced him the more than unpleasant task of introducing himself to its inmates he knew from experience the disconcerting way in which a dormitory greets an intruder it was difficult to know how to begin matters it would take a long time he thought to explain his presence to their satisfaction  fortunately however the dormitory was not unprepared things get about very quickly in a house the matron had told the housemaids the housemaids had handed it on to their ally the boot boy the boot boy had told wren whom he happened to meet in the passage and wren had told everybody else  there was an uproar going on when kennedy opened the door but it died away as he appeared and the dormitory gazed at the newcomer in absolute and embarrassing silence kennedy had not felt so conscious of the public eye being upon him since he had gone out to bat against the mcc on his first appearance in the ranks of the eckleton eleven he went to his bed and began to undress without a word feeling rather than seeing the eyes that were peering at him when he had completed the performance of disrobing he blew out the candle and got into bed the silence was broken by numerous coughs of that short suggestive type with which the public schoolboy loves to embarrass his fellow man from some unidentified corner of the room came a subdued giggle then a whispered shut up you fool to which a low voice replied all right im not doing anything  more coughs and another outbreak of giggling from a fresh quarter  good night said kennedy to the room in general  there was no reply the giggler appeared to be rapidly approaching hysterics  shut up that row said kennedy  the giggling ceased  the atmosphere was charged with suspicion kennedy fell asleep fearing that he was going to have trouble with his dormitory before many nights had passed     x  further experiences of an exile   breakfast on the following morning was a repetition of the dormitory ordeal kennedy walked to his place on mr kays right feeling that everyone was looking at him as indeed they were he understood for the first time the meaning of the expression the cynosure of all eyes he was modest by nature and felt his position a distinct trial  he did not quite know what to say or do with regard to his new housemaster at this their first meeting in the latters territory come aboard sir occurred to him for a moment as a happy phrase but he discarded it to make the situation more awkward mr kay did not observe him at first being occupied in assailing a riotous fag at the other end of the table that youth having succeeded by a dexterous drive in the ribs in making a friend of his spill half a cup of coffee kennedy did not know whether to sit down without a word or to remain standing until mr kay had time to attend to him he would have done better to have sat down mr kays greeting when it came was not worth waiting for  sit down kennedy he said irritablyrebuking people on an empty stomach always ruffled him sit down sit down  kennedy sat down and began to toy diffidently with a sausage remembering as he did so certain diatribes of fenns against the food at kays as he became more intimate with the sausage he admitted to himself that fenn had had reason mr kay meanwhile pounded away in moody silence at a plate of kidneys and bacon it was one of the many grievances which gave the kayite material for conversation that mr kay had not the courage of his opinions in the matter of food he insisted that he fed his house luxuriously but he refused to brave the mysteries of its bill of fare himself  fenn had not come down when kennedy went in to breakfast he arrived some ten minutes later when kennedy had vanquished the sausage and was keeping body and soul together with bread and marmalade  i cannot have this fenn snapped mr kay you must come down in time  fenn took the rebuke in silence cast one glance at the sausage which confronted him and then pushed it away with such unhesitating rapidity that mr kay glared at him as if about to take up the cudgels for the rejected viand perhaps he remembered that it scarcely befitted the dignity of a housemaster to enter upon a wrangle with a member of his house on the subject of the merits and demerits of sausages for he refrained and fenn was allowed to go on with his meal in peace  kennedys chief anxiety had been with regard to fenn true the latter could hardly blame him for being made head of kays since he had not been consulted in the matter and if he had been would have refused the post with horror but nevertheless the situation might cause a coolness between them and if fenn the only person in the house with whom he was at all intimate refused to be on friendly terms his stay in kays would be rendered worse than even he had looked for  fenn had not spoken to him at breakfast but then there was little table talk at kays perhaps the quality of the food suggested such gloomy reflections that nobody liked to put them into words  after the meal fenn ran upstairs to his study kennedy followed him and opened conversation in his direct way with the subject which he had come to discuss  i say he said i hope you arent sick about this you know i didnt want to bag your place as head of the house  my dear chap said fenn dont apologise youre welcome to it being head of kays isnt such a soft job that one is keen on sticking to it  all the same began kennedy  i knew kay would get at me somehow of course ive been wondering how all the holidays i didnt think of this still im jolly glad its happened i now retire into private life and look on ive taken years off my life sweating to make this house decent and now im going to take a rest and watch you tearing your hair out over the job im awfully sorry for you i wish theyd roped in some other victim  but youre still a house prefect i suppose  i believe so kay couldnt very well make me a fag again  then youll help manage things  fenn laughed  will i by jove id like to see myself i dont want to do the heavy martyr business and that sort of thing but im hanged if im going to take any more trouble over the house havent you any respect for mr kays feelings he thinks i cant keep order surely you dont want me to go and shatter his pet beliefs anyhow im not going to do it im going to play villagers and retainers to your hero if you do anything wonderful with the house i shall be standing by ready to cheer but you dont catch me shoving myself forward thank heaven i knows me place as the butler in the play says  kennedy kicked moodily at the leg of the chair which he was holding the feeling that his whole world had fallen about his ears was increasing with every hour he spent in kays last term he and fenn had been as close friends as you could wish to see if he had asked fenn to help him in a tight place then he knew he could have relied on him now his chief desire seemed to be to score off the human race in general his best friend included it was a depressing beginning  do you know what the sherry said to the man when he was just going to drink it inquired fenn it said nemo me impune lacessit thats how i feel kay went out of his way to give me a bad time when i was doing my best to run his house properly so i dont see that im called upon to go out of my way to work for him  its rather rough on me kennedy began then a sudden indignation rushed through him why should he grovel to fenn if fenn chose to stand out let him he was capable of running the house by himself  i dont care he said savagely if you cant see what a cad youre making of yourself im not going to try to show you you can do what you jolly well please im not dependent on you ill make this a decent house off my own bat without your help if you like looking on youd better look on ill give you something to look at soon  he went out leaving fenn with mixed feelings he would have liked to have followed him taken back what he had said and formed an offensive alliance against the black sheep of the houseand also which was just as important against the slack sheep who were good for nothing either at work or play but his bitterness against the housemaster prevented him he was not going to take his removal from the leadership of kays as if nothing had happened  meanwhile in the dayrooms and studies the house had been holding indignation meetings and at each it had been unanimously resolved that kays had been abominably treated and that the deposition of fenn must not be tolerated unfortunately a house cannot do very much when it revolts it can only show its displeasure in little things and by an increase of rowdiness this was the line that kays took fenn became a popular hero fags until he kicked them for it showed a tendency to cheer him whenever they saw him nothing could paint mr kay blacker in the eyes of his house so that kennedy came in for all the odium the same fags who had cheered fenn hooted him on one occasion as he passed the junior dayroom kennedy stopped short went in and presented each inmate of the room with six cuts with a swaggerstick this summary and captain kettlelike move had its effect there was no more hooting the fags bethought themselves of other ways of showing their disapproval of their new head  one genius suggested that they might kill two birds with one stonesnub kennedy and pay a stately compliment to fenn by applying to the latter for leave to go out of bounds instead of to the former as the giving of leave down town was the prerogative of the head of the house and of no other there was a suggestiveness about this mode of procedure which appealed to the junior dayroom  but the star of the junior dayroom was not in the ascendant fenn might have quarrelled with kennedy and be extremely indignant at his removal from the headship of the house but he was not the man to forget to play the game his policy of noninterference did not include underhand attempts to sap kennedys authority when gorrick of the lower fourth the first of the fags to put the ingenious scheme into practice came to him still smarting from kennedys castigation fenn promptly gave him six more cuts worse than the first and kicked him out into the passage gorrick naturally did not want to spoil a good thing by giving fenns game away so he lay low and said nothing with the result that wren and three others met with the same fate only more so because fenns wrath increased with each visit  kennedy of course heard nothing of this or he might perhaps have thought better of fenn as for the junior dayroom it was obliged to work off its emotion by jeering jimmy silver from the safety of the touchline when the head of blackburns was refereeing in a match between the juniors of his house and those of kays blackburns happened to win by four goals and eight tries a result which the patriotic kay fag attributed solely to favouritism on the part of the referee  i like the kids in your house said jimmy to kennedy after the match when telling the latter of the incident theres no false idea of politeness about them if they dont like your decisions they say so in a shrill treble  little beasts said kennedy i wish i knew who they were its hopeless to try and spot them of course     xi  the senior dayroom opens fire   curiously enough it was shortly after this that the junior dayroom ceased almost entirely to trouble the head of the house not that they turned over new leaves and modelled their conduct on that of the hero of the sundayschool story they were still disorderly but in a lesser degree and ragging became a matter of private enterprise among the fags instead of being as it had threatened to be an organised revolt against the new head when a kays fag rioted now he did so with the air of one endeavouring to amuse himself not as if he were carrying on a holy war against the oppressor  kennedys difficulties were considerably diminished by this change a head of a house expects the juniors of his house to rag it is what they are put into the world to do and there is no difficulty in keeping the thing within decent limits a revolution is another case altogether kennedy was grateful for the change for it gave him more time to keep an eye on the other members of the house but he had no idea what had brought it about as a matter of fact he had billy silver to thank for it the chief organiser of the movement against kennedy in the junior dayroom had been the redhaired wren who preached war to his fellow fags partly because he loved to create a disturbance and partly because walton who hated kennedy had told him to between wren and billy silver a feud had existed since their first meeting the unsatisfactory conclusion to their encounter in camp had given another lease of life to the feud and billy had come back to kays with the fixed intention of smiting his auburnhaired foe hip and thigh at the earliest opportunity wrens attitude with respect to kennedy gave him a decent excuse he had no particular regard for kennedy the fact that he was a friend of his brothers was no recommendation there existed between the two silvers that feeling which generally exists between an elder and a much younger brother at the same school each thought the other a bit of an idiot and though equal to tolerating him personally was hanged if he was going to do the same by his friends in billys circle of acquaintances jimmys friends were looked upon with cold suspicion as officious meddlers who would give them lines if they found them out of bounds the aristocrats with whom jimmy foregathered barely recognised the existence of billys companions kennedys claim to billys good offices rested on the fact that they both objected to wren  so that when wren lifted up his voice in the junior dayroom and exhorted the fags to go and make a row in the passage outside kennedys study andfrom a safe distance and having previously ensured a means of rapid escapeto fling boots at his door billy damped the popular enthusiasm which had been excited by the proposal by kicking wren with some violence and begging him not to be an ass whereupon they resumed their battle at the point at which it had been interrupted at camp and when some five minutes later billy from his seat on his adversarys chest offered to go through the same performance with anybody else who wished the junior dayroom came to the conclusion that his feelings with regard to the new head of the house however foolish and unpatriotic had better be respected and the revolution of the fags had fizzled out from that moment  in the senior dayroom however the flag of battle was still unfurled it was so obvious that kennedy had been put into the house as a reformer and the seniors of kays had such an objection to being reformed that trouble was only to be expected it was the custom in most houses for the head of the house by right of that position to be also captain of football the senior dayroom was aggrieved at kennedys taking this post from fenn fenn was in his second year in the school fifteen and he was the threequarter who scored most frequently for eckleton whereas kennedy though practically a certainty for one of the six vacant places in the school scrum was at present entitled to wear only a second fifteen cap the claims of fenn to be captain of kays football were strong kennedy had begged him to continue in that position more than once fenns persistent refusal had helped to increase the coolness between them and it had also made things more difficult for kennedy in the house  it was on the monday of the third week of term that kennedy at jimmy silvers request arranged a friendly between kays and blackburns there could be no doubt as to which was the better team for blackburns had been runners up for the cup the season before but the better ones opponents the better the practice kennedy wrote out the list and fixed it on the notice board the match was to be played on the following afternoon  a football team must generally be made up of the biggest men at the captains disposal so it happened that walton perry callingham and the other leaders of dissension in kays all figured on the list the consequence was that the list came in for a good deal of comment in the senior dayroom there were games every saturday and wednesday and it annoyed walton and friends that they should have to turn out on an afternoon that was not a half holiday it was trouble enough playing football on the days when it was compulsory as for patriotism no member of the house even pretended to care whether kays put a good team into the field or not the senior dayroom sat talking over the matter till lightsout when kennedy came down next morning he found his list scribbled over with blue pencil while across it in bold letters ran the single word      rot  he went to his study wrote out a fresh copy and pinned it up in place of the old one he had been early in coming down that morning and the majority of the kayites had not seen the defaced notice the match was fixed for halfpast four at four a thin rain was falling the weather had been bad for some days but on this particular afternoon it reached the limit in addition to being wet it was also cold and kennedy as he walked over to the grounds felt that he would be glad when the game was over he hoped that blackburns would be punctual and congratulated himself on his foresight in securing mr blackburn as referee some of the staff when they consented to hold the whistle in a scratch game invariably kept the teams waiting on the field for half an hour before turning up mr blackburn an the other hand was always punctual he came out of his house just as kennedy turned in at the school gates  well kennedy he said from the depths of his ulster the collar of which he had turned up over his ears with a prudence which kennedy having come out with only a blazer on over his football clothes distinctly envied i hope your men are not going to be late i dont think i ever saw a worse day for football how long were you thinking of playing two twentyfives would be enough for a day like this i think  kennedy consulted with jimmy silver who came up at this moment and they agreed without argument that twentyfive minutes each way would be the very thing  where are your men asked jimmy ive got all our chaps out here bar challis wholl be out in a few minutes i left him almost changed  challis appeared a little later and joined the rest of blackburns team who were putting in the time and trying to keep warm by running and passing and dropping desultory goals but with the exception of fenn who stood brooding by himself in the centre of the field wrapped to the eyes in a huge overcoat and two other house prefects of kays who strolled up and down looking as if they wished they were in their studies there was no sign of the missing team  i cant make it out said kennedy  youre sure you put up the right time asked jimmy silver  yes quite  it certainly could not be said that kays had had any room for doubt as to the time of the match for it had appeared in large figures on both notices  a quarter to five sounded from the college clock  we must begin soon said mr blackburn or there will not be light enough even for two twentyfives  kennedy felt wretched apart from the fact that he was frozen to an icicle and drenched by the rain he felt responsible for his team and he could see that blackburns men were growing irritated at the delay though they did their best to conceal it  cant we lend them some subs suggested challis hopefully  all rightif you can raise eleven subs said silver theyve only got four men on the field at present  challis subsided  look here said kennedy im going back to the house to see whats up ill be back as soon as i can they must have mistaken the time or something after all  he rushed back to the house and flung open the door of the senior dayroom it was empty  kennedy had expected to find his missing men huddled in a semicircle round the fire waiting for some one to come and tell them that blackburns had taken the field and that they could come out now without any fear of having to wait in the rain for the match to begin this he thought would have been the unselfish policy of kays senior dayroom  but to find nobody was extraordinary  the thought occurred to him that the team might be changing in their dormitories he ran upstairs but all the dormitories were locked as he might have known they would have been coming downstairs again he met his fag spencer  spencer replied to his inquiry that he had only just come in he did not know where the team had got to no he had not seen any of them  oh yes though he added as an afterthought i met walton just now he looked as if he was going down town  walton had once licked spencer and that vindictive youth thought that this might be a chance of getting back at him  oh said kennedy quietly walton did you thanks  spencer was disappointed at his lack of excitement his news did not seem to interest him  kennedy went back to the football field to inform jimmy silver of the result of his investigations     xii  kennedy interviews walton   im very sorry he said when he rejoined the shivering group but im afraid we shall have to call this match off there seems to have been a mistake none of my team are anywhere about im awfully sorry sir he added to mr blackburn to have given you all this trouble for nothing  not at all kennedy we must try another day  mr blackburn suspected that something untoward had happened in kays to cause this sudden defection of the first fifteen of the house he knew that kennedy was having a hard time in his new position and he did not wish to add to his discomfort by calling for an explanation before an audience it could not be pleasant for kennedy to feel that his enemies had scored off him it was best to preserve a discreet silence with regard to the whole affair and leave him to settle it for himself  jimmy silver was more curious he took kennedy off to tea in his study sat him down in the best chair in front of the fire and proceeded to urge him to confess everything  now then whats it all about he asked briskly spearing a muffin on the fork and beginning to toast  its no good asking me said kennedy i suppose its a putup job to make me look a fool i ought to have known something of this kind would happen when i saw what they did to my first notice  what was that  kennedy explained  this is getting thrilling said jimmy just pass that plate thanks what are you going to do about it  i dont know what would you do  my dear chap id first find out who was at the bottom of ittheres bound to be one man who started the whole thingand id make it my aim in life to give him the warmest ten minutes hed ever had  that sounds all right but how would you set about it  why touch him up of course what else would you do before the whole house too  supposing he wouldnt be touched up  wouldnt be hed have to  you dont know kays jimmy youre thinking what youd do if this had happened in blackburns the two things arent the same here the man would probably take it like a lamb the feeling of the house would be against him hed find nobody to back him up thats because blackburns is a decent house instead of being a sink like kays if i tried the touchingup before the whole house game with our chaps the man would probably reply by going for me assisted by the whole strength of the company  well dash it all then all youve got to do is to call a prefects meeting and hell get ten times worse beans from them than hed have got from you its simple  kennedy stared into the fire pensively  i dont know he said i bar that prefects meeting business it always seems rather feeble to me lugging in a lot of chaps to help settle some one you cant manage yourself i want to carry this job through on my own  then youd better scrap with the man  i think i will  silver stared  dont be an ass he said i was only rotting you cant go fighting all over the shop as if you were a fag youd lose your prefects cap if it came out  i could wear my topper said kennedy with a grin you see he added ive not much choice i must do something if i took no notice of this business thered be no holding the house i should be ragged to death its no good talking about it personally i should prefer touching the chap up to fighting him and i shall try it on but hes not likely to meet me halfway and if he doesnt therell be an interesting turnup and you shall hold the watch ill send a kid round to fetch you when things look like starting i must go now to interview my missing men so long mind you slip round directly i send for you  wait a second dont be in such a beastly hurry whos the chap youre going to fight  i dont know yet walton i should think but i dont know  walton by jove itll be worth seeing anyhow if we are both sacked for it when the old man finds out  kennedy returned to his study and changed his football boots for a pair of gymnasium shoes for the job he had in hand it was necessary that he should move quickly and football boots are a nuisance on a board floor when he had changed he called spencer  go down to the senior dayroom he said and tell macpherson i want to see him  macpherson was a long weaklooking youth he had been put down to play for the house that day and had not appeared  macpherson said the fag in a tone of astonishment not walton  he had been looking forward to the meeting between kennedy and his ancient foe and to have a miserable being like macpherson offered as a substitute disgusted him  if you have no objection said kennedy politely i may want you to fetch walton later on  spencer vanished hopeful once more  come in macpherson said kennedy on the arrival of the long one shut the door  macpherson did so feeling as if he were paying a visit to the dentist as long as there had been others with him in this affair he had looked on it as a splendid idea but to be singled out like this was quite a different thing  now said kennedy why werent you on the field this afternoon  ieri was kept in  how long  ohertill about five  what do you call about five  about twentyfive to he replied despondently  now look here said kennedy briskly im just going to explain to you exactly how i stand in this business so youd better attend i didnt ask to be made head of this sewage depot if i could have had any choice i wouldnt have touched a kayite with a bargepole but since i am head im going to be it and the sooner you and your senior dayroom crew realise it the better this sort of thing isnt going on i want to know now who it was put up this job you wouldnt have the cheek to start a thing like this yourself who was it  weller  youd better say and be quick too i cant wait whoever it was i shant tell him you told me and i shant tell kay so now you can go ahead who was it  wellerwalton  i thought so now you can get out if you see spencer send him here  spencer curiously enough was just outside the door so close to it indeed that he almost tumbled in when macpherson opened it  go and fetch walton said kennedy  spencer dashed off delightedly and in a couple of minutes walton appeared he walked in with an air of subdued defiance and slammed the door  dont bang the door like that said kennedy why didnt you turn out today  i was kept in  couldnt you get out in time to play  no  when did you get out  six  not before  i said six  then how did you manage to go down townwithout leave by the way but thats a detailat halfpast five  all right said walton better call me a liar  good suggestion said kennedy cheerfully i will  its all very well said walton you know jolly well you can say anything you like i cant do anything to you youd have me up before the prefects  not a bit of it this is a private affair between ourselves im not going to drag the prefects into it you seem to want to make this house worse than it is i want to make it more or less decent we cant both have what we want  there was a pause  when would it be convenient for you to be touched up before the whole house inquired kennedy pleasantly  what  well you see it seems the only thing i must take it out of some one for this housematch business and you started it will tonight suit you after supper  youll get it hot if you try to touch me  well see  youd funk taking me on in a scrap said walton  would i as a matter of fact a scrap would suit me just as well better are you ready now  quite thanks sneered walton ive knocked you out before and ill do it again  oh then it was you that night at camp i thought so i spotted your style hitting a chap when he wasnt ready you know and so on now if youll wait a minute ill send across to blackburns for silver i told him i should probably want him as a timekeeper tonight  what do you want with silver why wont perry do  thanks im afraid perrys timekeeping wouldnt be impartial enough silver i think if you dont mind  spencer was summoned once more and despatched to blackburns he returned with jimmy  come in jimmy said kennedy run away spencer walton and i are just going to settle a point of order which has arisen jimmy will you hold the watch we ought just to have time before tea  where asked silver  my dormitory would be the best place we can move the beds ill go and get the keys  kennedys dormitory was the largest in the house after the beds had been moved back there was a space in the middle of fifteen feet one way and twelve the othernot a large ring but large enough for two fighters who meant business  walton took off his coat waistcoat and shirt kennedy who was still in football clothes removed his blazer  half a second said jimmy silverwhat length rounds  two minutes said kennedy to walton  all right growled walton  two minutes then and half a minute in between  are you both ready asked jimmy from his seat on the chest of drawers  kennedy and walton advanced into the middle of the impromptu ring  there was dead silence for a moment  time said jimmy silver     xiii  the fight in the dormitory   stating it broadly fighters may be said to be divided into two classesthose who are content to take two blows if they can give three in return and those who prefer to receive as little punishment as possible even at the expense of scoring fewer points themselves kennedys position when jimmy silver called time was peculiar on all the other occasions on which he had foughtwith the gloves on in the annual competition and at the assaultatarmshe had gone in for the policy of taking all that the other man liked to give him and giving rather more in exchange now however he was obliged to alter his whole style for a variety of reasons it was necessary that he should come out of this fight with as few marks as possible to begin with he represented in a sense the majesty of the law he was tackling walton more by way of an objectlesson to the kayite mutineers than for his own personal satisfaction the objectlesson would lose in impressiveness if he were compelled to go about for a week or so with a pair of black eyes or other adornments of a similar kind againand this was even more importantif he was badly marked the affair must come to the knowledge of the headmaster being a prefect and in the sixth form he came into contact with the head every day and the disclosure of the fact that he had been engaged in a pitched battle with a member of his house who was in addition to other disadvantages very low down in the school would be likely to lead to unpleasantness a school prefect of eckleton was supposed to be hedged about with so much dignity that he could quell turbulent inferiors with a glance the idea of one of the august body lowering himself to the extent of emphasising his authority with the bare knuckle would scandalise the powers  so kennedy rising at the call of time from the bed on which he sat came up to the scratch warily  walton on the other hand having everything to gain and nothing to lose and happy in the knowledge that no amount of bruises could do him any harm except physically came on with the evident intention of making a hurricane fight of it he had very little science as a boxer heavy twohanded slogging was his forte and as the majority of his opponents up to the present had not had sufficient skill to discount his strength he had found this a very successful line of action kennedy and he had never had the gloves on together in the competition of the previous year both had entered in their respective classes kennedy as a lightweight walton in the middles and both after reaching the semifinal had been defeated by the narrowest of margins by men who had since left the school that had been in the previous easter term and while walton had remained much the same as regards weight and strength kennedy owing to a term of hard bowling and a summer holiday spent in the open had filled out they were now practically on an equality as far as weight was concerned as for condition that was all in favour of kennedy he played football in his spare time walton on the days when football was not compulsory smoked cigarettes  neither of the pair showed any desire to open the fight by shaking hands this was not a friendly spar it was business the first move was made by walton who feinted with his right and dashed in to fight at close quarters it was not a convincing feint at any rate it did not deceive kennedy he countered with his left and swung his right at the body with all the force he could put into the hit walton went back a pace sparred for a moment then came in again hitting heavily kennedys counter missed its mark this time he just stopped a round sweep of waltons right ducked to avoid a similar effort of his left and they came together in a clinch  in a properly regulated glovefight the referee on observing the principals clinch says break away there break away in a sad reproachful voice and the fighters separate without demur being very much alive to the fact that as far as that contest is concerned their destinies are in his hands and that any bad behaviour in the ring will lose them the victory but in an impromptu turnup like this one the combatants show a tendency to ignore the rules so carefully mapped out by the present marquess of queensberrys grandfather and revert to the conditions of warfare under which cribb and spring won their battles kennedy and walton having clinched proceeded to wrestle up and down the room while jimmy silver looked on from his eminence in pained surprise at the sight of two men who knew the rules of the ring so far forgetting themselves  to do kennedy justice it was not his fault he was only acting in selfdefence walton had started the hugging also he had got the undergrip which when neither man knows a great deal of the science of wrestling generally means victory kennedy was quite sure that he could not throw his antagonist but he hung on in the knowledge that the round must be over shortly when walton would have to loose him  time said jimmy silver  kennedy instantly relaxed his grip and in that instant walton swung him off his feet and they came down together with a crash that shook the room kennedy was underneath and as he fell his head came into violent contact with the iron support of a bed  jimmy silver sprang down from his seat  what are you playing at walton didnt you hear me call time it was a beastly foulthe worst i ever saw you ought to be sacked for a thing like that look here kennedy you neednt go on i disqualify walton for fouling  the usually genial james stammered with righteous indignation  kennedy sat down on a bed dizzily  no he said im going on  but he fouled you  i dont care ill look after myself is it time yet  ten seconds more if you really are going on  he climbed back on to the chest of drawers  time  kennedy came up feeling weak and sick the force with which he had hit his head on the iron had left him dazed  walton rushed in as before he had no chivalrous desire to spare his man by way of compensation for fouling him what monopolised his attention was the evident fact that kennedy was in a bad way and that a little strenuous infighting might end the affair in the desired manner  it was at this point that kennedy had reason to congratulate himself on donning gymnasium shoes they gave him that extra touch of lightness which enabled him to dodge blows which he was too weak to parry everything was vague and unreal to him he seemed to be looking on at a fight between walton and some stranger  then the effect of his fall began to wear off he could feel himself growing stronger little by little his head cleared and he began once more to take a personal interest in the battle it is astonishing what a power a boxer who has learnt the art carefully has of automatic fighting the expert gentleman who fights under the pseudonym of kid mcoy once informed the present writer that in one of his fights he was knocked down by such a severe hit that he remembered nothing further and it was only on reading the paper next morning that he found to his surprise that he had fought four more rounds after the blow and won the battle handsomely on points much the same thing happened to kennedy for the greater part of the second round he fought without knowing it when jimmy silver called time he was in as good case as ever and the only effects of the blow on his head were a vast lump underneath the hair and a settled determination to win or perish in a few minutes the bell would ring for tea and all his efforts would end in nothing it was no good fighting a draw with walton if he meant to impress the house he knew exactly what rumour assisted by walton would make of the affair in that case have you heard the latest a would ask of b why kennedy tried to touch walton up for not playing footer and walton went for him and would have given him frightful beans only they had to go down to tea there must be none of that sort of thing  time said jimmy silver breaking in on his meditations  it was probably the suddenness and unexpectedness of it that took walton aback up till now his antagonist had been fighting strictly on the defensive and was obviously desirous of escaping punishment as far as might be possible and then the fall at the end of round one had shaken him up so that he could hardly fight at all at their second meeting walton naturally expected that it would be left to him to do the leading in round three instead of this however kennedy opened the round with such a lightning attack that walton was all abroad in a moment in his most scientific mood he had never had the remotest notion of how to guard he was aggressive and nothing else attacked by a quick hitter he was useless three times kennedy got through his guard with his left the third hit staggered him before he could recover kennedy had got his right in and down went walton in a heap  he was up again as soon as he touched the boards and down again almost as soon as he was up kennedy was always a straight hitter and now a combination of good cause and bad temperfor the thought of the foul in the first round had stirred what was normally a more or less placid nature into extreme viciousnesslent a vigour to his left arm to which he had hitherto been a stranger he did not use his right again it was not needed  twice more walton went down he was still down when jimmy silver called time when the halfminute interval between the rounds was over he stated that he was not going on  kennedy looked across at him as he sat on a bed dabbing tenderly at his face with a handkerchief and was satisfied with the success of his objectlesson from his own face the most observant of headmasters could have detected no evidence that he had been engaged in a vulgar fight walton on the other hand looked as if he had been engaged in severalall violent kennedy went off to his study to change feeling that he had advanced a long step on the thorny path that led to the perfect house     xiv  fenn receives a letter   but the step was not such a very long one after all what it amounted to was simply this that open rebellion ceased in kays when kennedy put up the list on the noticeboard for the third time which he did on the morning following his encounter with walton and wrote on it that the match with blackburns would take place that afternoon his team turned out like lambs and were duly defeated by thirtyone points he had to play a substitute for walton who was rather too battered to be of any real use in the scrum but with that exception the team that entered the field was the same that should have entered it the day before  but his labours in the augean stables of kays were by no means over practically they had only begun the state of the house now was exactly what it had been under fenn when kennedy had taken over the reins kays had become on the instant twice as bad as it had been before by his summary treatment of the revolution he had so to speak wiped off this deficit what he had to do now was to begin to improve things kays was now in its normal stateslack rowdy in an underhand way and utterly useless to the school it was up to kennedy as they say in america to start in and make something presentable and useful out of these unpromising materials  what annoyed him more than anything else was the knowledge that if only fenn chose to do the square thing and help him in his work the combination would be irresistible it was impossible to make any leeway to speak of by himself if fenn would only forget his grievances and join forces with him they could electrify the house  fenn however showed no inclination to do anything of the kind he and kennedy never spoke to one another now except when it was absolutely unavoidable and then they behaved with that painful politeness in which the public schoolman always wraps himself as in a garment when dealing with a friend with whom he has quarrelled  on the walton episode fenn had made no comment though it is probable that he thought a good deal  it was while matters were in this strained condition that fenn received a letter from his elder brother this brother had been at eckleton in his timeschool houseand had left five years before to go to cambridge cambridge had not taught him a great deal possibly because he did not meet the wellmeant efforts of his tutor halfway the net result of his three years at kings wasimprimis a cricket blue including a rather lucky eightythree at lords secondly a very poor degree thirdly and lastly a taste for literature and the dramahe had been a prominent member of the footlights club when he came down he looked about him for some occupation which should combine in happy proportions a small amount of work and a large amount of salary and finding none drifted into journalism at which calling he had been doing very fairly ever since  dear bob the letter began fenns names were robert mowbray the second of which he had spent much of his time in concealing just a line  the elder fenn always began his letters with these words whether they ran to one sheet or eight in the present case the screed was not particularly long  do you remember my reading you a bit of an opera i was writing well i finished it and after going the round of most of the managers who chucked it with wonderful unanimity it found an admirer in higgs the man who took the part of the duke in the outsider luckily he happened to be thinking of starting on his own in opera instead of farce and theres a part in mine which fits him like a glove so hes going to bring it out at the imperial in the spring and by way of testing the piecetrying it on the dog as it werehe means to tour with it now heres the point of this letter we start at eckleton next wednesday we shall only be there one night for we go on to southampton on thursday i suppose you couldnt come and see it i remember peter brown who got the last place in the team the year i got my cricket colours cutting out of his house kays by the way and going down town to see a piece at the theatre im bound to admit he got sacked for it but still it shows that it can be done all the same i shouldnt try it on if i were you youll be able to read all about the striking success and unrestrained enthusiasm in the eckleton mirror on thursday mind you buy a copy  the rest of the letter was on other subjects it took fenn less than a minute to decide to patronise that opening performance he was never in the habit of paying very much attention to risks when he wished to do anything and now he felt as if he cared even less than usual what might be the outcome of the adventure since he had ceased to be on speaking terms with kennedy he had found life decidedly dull kennedy had been his only intimate friend he had plenty of acquaintances as a first eleven and first fifteen man usually has but none of them were very entertaining consequently he welcomed the idea of a break in the monotony of affairs the only thing that had broken it up to the present had been a burglary at the school house some enterprising marauder had broken in a week before and gone off with a few articles of value from the headmasters drawingroom but the members of the school house had talked about this episode to such an extent that the rest of the school had dropped off the subject exhausted and declined to discuss it further and things had become monotonous once more  having decided to go fenn began to consider how he should do it and here circumstances favoured him it happened that on the evening on which his brothers play was to be produced the headmaster was giving his onceaterm dinner to the houseprefects this simplified matters wonderfully the only time when his absence from the house was at all likely to be discovered would be at prayers which took place at halfpast nine the prefects dinner solved this difficulty for him kay would not expect him to be at prayers thinking he was over at the heads while the head if he noticed his absence at all would imagine that he was staying away from the dinner owing to a headache or some other malady it seemed tempting providence not to take advantage of such an excellent piece of luck for the rest detection was practically impossible kennedys advent to the house had ousted fenn from the dormitory in which he had slept hitherto and there being no bed available in any of the other dormitories he had been put into the spare room usually reserved for invalids whose invalidism was not of a sufficiently infectious kind to demand their removal to the infirmary as for getting back into the house he would leave the window of his study unfastened he could easily climb on to the windowledge and so to bed without let or hindrance  the distance from kays to the town was a mile and a half if he started at the hour when he should have been starting for the school house he would arrive just in time to see the curtain go up  having settled these facts definitely in his mind he got his books together and went over to school     xv  down town   fenn arrived at the theatre a quarter of an hour before the curtain rose going down a gloomy alley of the high street he found himself at the stage door where he made inquiries of a depressedlooking man with a bad cold in the head as to the whereabouts of his brother it seemed that he was with mr higgs if he would wait said the doorkeeper his name should be sent up fenn waited while the doorkeeper made polite conversation by describing his symptoms to him in a hoarse growl presently the minion who had been despatched to the upper regions with fenns message returned would he go upstairs third door on the left fenn followed the instructions and found himself in a small room a third of which was filled by a huge ironbound chest another third by a very stout man and a dressingtable while the rest of the space was comparatively empty being occupied by a wooden chair with three legs on this seat his brother was trying to balance himself giving what part of his attention was not required for this feat to listening to some story the fat man was telling him fenn had heard his deep voice booming as he went up the passage  his brother did the honours  glad to see you glad to see you said mr higgs for the fat man was none other than that celebrity take a seat  fenn sat down on the chest and promptly tore his trousers on a jagged piece of iron  these provincial dressingrooms said mr higgs by way of comment no room never any room no chairs nothing  he spoke in short quick sentences and gasped between each fenn said it really didnt matterhe was quite comfortable  havent they done anything about it asked fenns brother resuming the conversation which fenns entrance had interrupted weve been having a burglary here he explained somebody got into the theatre last night through a window i dont know what they expected to find  why said fenn weve had a burglar up our way too chap broke into the school house and went through the old mans drawingroom the school house men have been talking about nothing else ever since i wonder if its the same crew  mr higgs turned in his chair and waved a stick of grease paint impressively to emphasise his point  there he said there what ive been saying all along no doubt of it organised gang and what are the police doing nothing sir nothing making inquiries rot whats the good of inquiries  fenns brother suggested mildly that inquiries were a good beginning you must start somehow mr higgs scouted the idea  there ought not to be any doubt sir they ought to know to know he added with firmness  at this point there filtered through the closed doors the strains of the opening chorus  by jove its begun said fenns brother come on bob  where are we going to asked fenn as he followed the wings  but it seemed that the rules of mr higgs company prevented any outsider taking up his position in that desirable quarter the only place from which it was possible to watch the performance except by going to the front of the house was the flies situated near the roof of the building  fenn found all the pleasures of novelty in watching the players from this lofty position judged by the cold light of reason it was not the best place from which to see a play it was possible to gain only a very foreshortened view of the actors but it was a change after sitting in front  the piece was progressing merrily the gifted author at first silent and pale began now to show signs of gratification now and again he chuckled as some jeu de mots hit the mark and drew a quick gust of laughter from the unseen audience occasionally he would nudge fenn to draw his attention to some good bit of dialogue which was approaching he was obviously enjoying himself  the advent of mr higgs completed his satisfaction for the audience greeted the comedian with roars of applause as a rule eckleton took its drama through the medium of thirdrate touring companies which came down with plays that had not managed to attract london to any great extent and were trying to make up for failures in the metropolis by long tours in the provinces it was seldom that an actor of the higgs type paid the town a visit and in a play too which had positively never appeared before on any stage eckleton appreciated the compliment  listen said fenns brother isnt that just the part for him its just like he was in the dressingroom eh short sentences and everything the funny part of it is that i didnt know the man when i wrote the play it was all luck  mr higgs performance sealed the success of the piece the house laughed at everything he said he sang a song in his gasping way and they laughed still more fenns brother became incoherent with delight the verdict of eckleton was hardly likely to affect london theatregoers but it was very pleasant notwithstanding like every playwright with his first piece he had been haunted by the idea that his dialogue would not act that however humorous it might be to a reader it would fall flat when spoken there was no doubt now as to whether the lines sounded well  at the beginning of the second act the great higgs was not on the stage fenns brother knowing enough of the game not to bring on his big man too soon he had not to enter for ten minutes or so the author who had gone down to see him during the interval stayed in the dressingroom fenn however who wanted to see all of the piece that he could went up to the flies again  it occurred to him when he got there that he would see more if he took the seat which his brother had been occupying it would give him much the same view of the stage and a wider view of the audience he thought it would be amusing to see how the audience looked from the flies  mr w s gilbert once wrote a poem about a certain bishop who while fond of amusing himself objected to his clergy doing likewise and the consequence was that whenever he did so amuse himself he was always haunted by a phantom curate who joined him in his pleasures much to his dismay on one occasion he stopped to watch a punch and judy show      and heard as punch was being treated penally     that phantom curate laughing all hyaenally  the disgust and panic of this eminent cleric was as nothing compared with that of fenn when shifting to his brothers seat he got the first clear view he had had of the audience in a box to the left of the dresscircle sat laughing all hyaenally the following distinguished visitors      mr mulholland of no 7 college buildings     mr raynes of no 4 ditto       and     mr kay  fenn drew back like a flash knocking his chair over as he did so  giddy sir said a stage hand pleasantly bless you lots of gents is like that when they comes up here cant stand the eight they cant youll be all right in a jiffy  yes itit is rather high isnt it said fenn awful glare too  he picked up his chair and sat down well out of sight of the box had they seen him he wondered then common sense returned to him they could not possibly have seen him apart from any other reasons he had only been in his brothers seat for halfadozen seconds no he was all right so far but he would have to get back to the house and at once with three of the staff including his own housemaster ranging the town things were a trifle too warm for comfort he wondered it had not occurred to him that with a big attraction at the theatre some of the staff might feel an inclination to visit it  he did not stop to say goodbye to his brother descending from his perch he hurried to the stage door  its in the toobs that i feel it sir said the doorkeeper as he let him out resuming their conversation as if they had only just parted fenn hurried off without waiting to hear more  it was drizzling outside and there was a fog not a london particular but quite thick enough to make it difficult to see where one was going people and vehicles passed him vague phantoms in the darkness occasionally the former collided with him he began to wish he had not accepted his brothers invitation the unexpected sight of the three masters had shaken his nerve till then only the romantic adventurous side of the expedition had struck him now the risks began to loom larger in his mind it was all very well he felt to think as he had done that he would be expelled if found out but that all the same he would risk it detection then had seemed a remote contingency with three masters in the offing it became at least a possibility the melancholy case of peter brown seemed to him now to have a more personal significance for him  wrapped in these reflections he lost his way  he did not realise this for some time it was borne in upon him when the road he was taking suddenly came to an abrupt end in a blank wall instead of being as he had fancied in the high street he must have branched off into some miserable blind alley  more than ever he wished he had not come eckleton was not a town that took up a great deal of room on the map of england but it made up for small dimensions by the eccentricity with which it had been laid out on a dark and foggy night to one who knew little of its geography it was a perfect maze  fenn had wandered some way when the sound of someone whistling a popular musichall song came to him through the gloom he had never heard anything more agreeable  i say he shouted at a venture can you tell me the way to the high street  the whistler stopped in the middle of a bar and presently fenn saw a figure sidling towards him in what struck him as a particularly furtive manner  wots thet gavnor  can you tell me where the high street is ive lost my way  the vague figure came closer  igh street yus yer go  a hand shot out fenn felt a sharp wrench in the region of his waistcoat and a moment later the stranger had vanished into the fog with the prefects watch and chain  fenn forgot his desire to return to the high street he forgot everything except that he wished to catch the fugitive maltreat him and retrieve his property he tore in the direction whence came the patter of retreating footsteps  there were moments when he thought he had him when he could hear the sound of his breathing but the fog was against him just as he was almost on his mans heels the fugitive turned sharply into a street which was moderately well lighted fenn turned after him he had just time to recognise the street as his goal the high street when somebody walking unexpectedly out of the corner house stood directly in his path fenn could not stop himself he charged the man squarely clutched him to save himself and they fell in a heap on the pavement     xvi  what happened to fenn   fenn was up first many years experience of being tackled at full speed on the football field had taught him how to fall the stranger whose football days if he had ever had any were long past had gone down with a crash and remained on the pavement motionless fenn was conscious of an ignoble impulse to fly without stopping to chat about the matter then he was seized with a gruesome fear that he had injured the man seriously which vanished when the stranger sat up his first words were hardly of the sort that one would listen to from choice his first printable expression which did not escape him until he had been speaking some time was in the nature of an official bulletin  youve broken my neck said he  fenn renewed his apologies and explanations  your watch cried the man in a high cracked voice dont stand there talking about your watch but help me up what do i care about your watch why dont you look where you are going to now then now then dont hoist me as if i were a hod of bricks thats right now help me indoors and go away  fenn supported him while he walked lamely into the house he was relieved to find that there was nothing more the matter with him than a shaking and a few bruises  door on the left said the injured one  fenn led him down the passage and into a small sittingroom the gas was lit and as he turned it up he saw that the stranger was a man well advanced in years he had grey hair that was almost white his face was not a pleasant one it was a mass of lines and wrinkles from which a physiognomist would have deduced uncomplimentary conclusions as to his character fenn had little skill in that way but he felt that for some reason he disliked the man whose eyes which were small and extraordinarily bright gave rather an eerie look to his face  go away go away he kept repeating savagely from his post on the shabby sofa on which fenn had deposited him  but are you all right cant i get you something asked the eckletonian  go away go away repeated the man  conversation on these lines could never be really attractive fenn turned to go as he closed the door and began to feel his way along the dark passage he heard the key turn in the lock behind him the man could not he felt have been very badly hurt if he were able to get across the room so quickly the thought relieved him somewhat nobody likes to have the maiming even of the most complete stranger on his mind the sensation of relief lasted possibly three seconds then it flashed upon him that in the excitement of the late interview he had forgotten his cap that damaging piece of evidence lay on the table in the sittingroom and between him and it was a locked door  he groped his way back and knocked no sound came from the room  i say he cried you might let me have my cap i left it on the table  no reply  fenn half thought of making a violent assault on the door he refrained on reflecting that it would be useless if he could break it openwhich in all probability he could notthere would be trouble such as he had never come across in his life he was not sure it would not be an offence for which he would be rendered liable to fine or imprisonment at any rate it would mean the certain detection of his visit to the town so he gave the thing up resolving to return on the morrow and reopen negotiations for the present what he had to do was to get safely back to his house he had lost his watch his cap with his name in it was in the hands of an evil old man who evidently bore him a grudge and he had to run the gauntlet of three housemasters and get to bed via a studywindow few people even after the dullest of plays have returned from the theatre so disgusted with everything as did fenn reviewing the situation as he ran with long easy strides over the road that led to kays he found it devoid of any kind of comfort unless his mission in quest of the cap should prove successful he was in a tight place  it is just as well that the gift of second sight is accorded to but few if fenn could have known at this point that his adventures were only beginning that what had taken place already was but as the overture to a drama it is possible that he would have thrown up the sponge for good and all entered kays by way of the front doorafter knocking up the entire householdand remarked in answer to his housemasters excited questions enough enough i am a victim of fate a toad beneath the harrow sack me tomorrow if you like but for goodness sake let me get quietly to bed now  as it was not being able to peep with security into futurity he imagined that the worst was over  he began to revise this opinion immediately on turning in at kays gate he had hardly got halfway down the drive when the front door opened and two indistinct figures came down the steps as they did so his foot slipped off the grass border on which he was running to deaden the noise of his steps and grated sharply on the gravel  whats that said a voice the speaker was mr kay  whats what replied a second voice which he recognised as mr mulhollands  didnt you hear a noise  i heard the water lapping on the crag replied mr mulholland poetically  it was over there persisted mr kay i am certain i heard somethingpositively certain mulholland and after that burglary at the school house  he began to move towards the spot where fenn lay crouching behind a bush mr mulholland followed mildly amused they were a dozen yards away when fenn debating in his mind whether it would not be betteras it would certainly be more dignifiedfor him to rise and deliver himself up to justice instead of waiting to be discovered wallowing in the damp grass behind a laurel bush was aware of something soft and furry pressing against his knuckles a soft purring sound reached his ears  he knew at once who it wasthomas edward the matrons cat ever a staunch friend of his many a time had they taken tea together in his study in happier days the friendly animal had sought him out in his hidingplace and was evidently trying to intimate that the best thing they could do now would be to make a regular night of it  fenn as i have said liked and respected thomas in ordinary circumstances he would not have spoken an unfriendly word to him but things were desperate now and needed remedies to match  very softly he passed his hand down the delighted animals back until he reached his tail then stifling with an effort all the finer feelings which should have made such an act impossible he administered so vigorous a tweak to that appendage that thomas with one frenzied yowl sprang through the bush past the two masters and vanished at full speed into the opposite hedge  my goodness said mr kay starting back  it was a further shock to fenn to find how close he was to the laurel      goodness me       why what was that     silent be       it was the cat  chanted mr mulholland who was in poetical vein after the theatre  it was a cat gasped mr kay  so i am disposed to imagine what lungs we shall be having the rspca down on us if we arent careful they must have heard that noise at the headquarters of the society wherever they are well if your zeal for big game hunting is satisfied and you dont propose to follow the vocalist through that hedge i think i will be off good night good piece wasnt it  excellent good night mulholland  by the way i wonder if the man who wrote it is a relation of our fenn it may be his brotheri believe he writes you probably remember him when he was here he was before my time talking of fenn how do you find the new arrangement answer is kennedy an improvement  kennedy said mr kay is a wellmeaning boy i think quite wellmeaning but he lacks ability in my opinion i have had to speak to him on several occasions on account of disturbances amongst the juniors once i found two boys actually fighting in the junior dayroom i was very much annoyed about it  and where was kennedy while this was going on was he holding the watch  the watch said mr kay in a puzzled tone of voice kennedy was over at the gymnasium when it occurred  then it was hardly his fault that the fight took place  my dear mulholland if the head of a house is efficient fights should be impossible even when he is not present his influence his prestige so to speak should be sufficient to restrain the boys under him  mr mulholland whistled softly  so thats your idea of what the head of your house should be like is it well i know of one fellow who would have been just your man unfortunately he is never likely to come to school at eckleton  indeed said mr kay with interest who is that where did you meet him what school is he at  i never said i had met him i only go by what i have heard of him and as far as i know he is not at any school he was a gentleman of the name of napoleon bonaparte he might just have been equal to the arduous duties which devolve upon the head of your house goodnight  and fenn heard his footsteps crunch the gravel as he walked away a minute later the front door shut and there was a rattle mr kay had put the chain up and retired for the night  fenn lay where he was for a short while longer then he rose feeling very stiff and wet and crept into one of the summerhouses which stood in mr kays garden here he sat for an hour and a half at the end of which time thinking that mr kay must be asleep he started out to climb into the house  his study was on the first floor a high gardenseat stood directly beneath the window and acted as a convenient ladder it was easy to get from this on to the windowledge once there he could open the window and the rest would be plain sailing  unhappily there was one flaw in his scheme he had conceived that scheme in the expectation that the window would be as he had left it  but it was not  during his absence somebody had shot the bolt and try his hardest he could not move the sash an inch     xvii  fenn hunts for himself   nobody knows for certain the feelings of the camel when his proprietor placed that last straw on his back the incident happened so long ago if it had occurred in modern times he would probably have contributed a firsthand report to the daily mail but it is very likely that he felt on that occasion exactly as fenn felt when after a night of unparalleled misadventure he found that somebody had cut off his retreat by latching the window after a gruelling race fate had just beaten him on the tape  there was no doubt about its being latched the sash had not merely stuck he put all he knew into the effort to raise it but without a hint of success after three attempts he climbed down again and sitting on the gardenseat began to review his position  if one has an active mind and a fair degree of optimism the effect of the staggerers administered by fate passes off after a while fenn had both the consequence was that after ten minutes of grey despair he was relieved by a faint hope that there might be some other way into the house than through his study anyhow it would be worth while to investigate  his study was at the side of the house at the back were the kitchen the scullery and the diningroom and above these more studies and a couple of dormitories as a last resort he might fling rocks and other solids at the windows until he woke somebody up but he did not feel like trying this plan until every other had failed he had no desire to let a garrulous dormitory into the secret of his wanderings what he hoped was that he might find one of the lower windows open  and so he did  as he turned the corner of the house he saw what he had been looking for the very first window was wide open his spirits shot up and for the first time since he had left the theatre he was conscious of taking a pleasure in his adventurous career fate was with him after all he could not help smiling as he remembered how he had felt during that ten minutes on the gardenseat when the future seemed blank and devoid of any comfort whatsoever and all the time he could have got in without an effort if he had only thought of walking half a dozen yards  now that the way was open to him he wasted no time he climbed through into the dark room he was not certain which room it was in spite of his lengthy residence at kays  he let himself down softly till his foot touched the floor after a moments pause he moved forward a step then another at the third step his knee struck the leg of a table he must be in the diningroom if so he was all right he could find his way up to his room with his eyes shut it was easy to find out for certain the walls of the diningroom at kays as in the other houses were covered with photographs he walked gingerly in the direction in which he imagined the nearest wall to be reached it and passed his hand along it yes there were photographs then all he had to do was to find the table again make his way along it and when he got to the end the door would be a yard or so to his left the programme seemed simple and attractive but it was added to in a manner which he had not foreseen feeling his way back to the table he upset a chair if he had upset a cartload of coal on to a sheet of tin it could not so it seemed to him in the disordered state of his nerves have made more noise it went down with an appalling crash striking the table on its way this thought fenn savagely as he waited listening is where i get collared what a fool i am to barge about like this  he felt that the echoes of that crash must have penetrated to every corner of the house but no one came perhaps after all the noise had not been so great he proceeded on his journey down the table feeling every inch of the way the place seemed one bristling mass of chairs but by the exercise of consummate caution he upset no more and won through at last in safety to the door  it was at this point that the really lively and exciting part of his adventure began compared with what was to follow his evening had been up to the present dull and monotonous  as he opened the door there was a sudden stir and crash at the other end of the room fenn had upset one chair and the noise had nearly deafened him now chairs seemed to be falling in dozens bang bang crash two that time and then somebody shot through the window like a harlequin and dashed away across the lawn fenn could hear his footsteps thudding on the soft turf and at the same moment other footsteps made themselves heard  somebody was coming downstairs  who is that is anybody there  it was mr kays voice unmistakably nervous fenn darted from the door and across the passage at the other side was a bootcupboard it was his only refuge in that direction what he ought to have done was to leave the diningroom by the opposite door which led via a corridor to the junior dayroom but he lost his head and instead of bolting away from the enemy went towards him  the stairs down which mr kay was approaching were at the end of the passage to reach the diningroom one turned to the right beyond the stairs on the left the passage ended in a wall so that mr kay was bound to take the right direction in the search fenn wondered if he had a pistol not that he cared very much if the housemaster was going to find him it would be very little extra discomfort to be shot at and mr kays talents as a marksman were in all probability limited to picking off sitting haystacks the important point was that he had a candle a faint yellow glow preceded him down the stairs playing hideandseek with him in the dark fenn might have slipped past in safety but the candle made that impossible  he found the bootroom door and slipped through just as mr kay turned the corner with a thrill of pleasure he found that there was a key inside he turned it as quietly as he could but nevertheless it grated having done this and seeing nothing else that he could do except await developments he sat down on the floor among the boots it was not a dignified position for a man who had played for his county while still at school but just then he would not have exchanged it for a throneif the throne had been placed in the passage or the diningroom  the only question washad he been seen or heard he thought not but his heart began to beat furiously as the footsteps stopped outside the cupboard door and unseen fingers rattled the handle  twice mr kay tried the handle but finding the cupboard locked passed on into the diningroom the light of the candle ceased to shine under the door and fenn was once more in inky darkness  he listened intently a minute later he had made his second mistake instead of waiting as he should have done until mr kay had retired for good he unlocked the door directly he had passed and when a muffled crash told him that the housemaster was in the diningroom among the chairs out he came and fled softly upstairs towards his bedroom he thought that mr kay might possibly take it into his head to go round the dormitories to make certain that all the members of his house were in in which case all would be discovered  when he reached his room he began to fling off his clothes with feverish haste once in bed all would be well  he had got out of his boots his coat and his waistcoat and was beginning to feel that electric sensation of triumph which only conies to the man who just pulls through when he heard mr kay coming down the corridor towards his room the burglarhunter returning from the diningroom in the full belief that the miscreant had escaped through the open window had had all his ardour for the chase redoubled by the sight of the cupboard door which fenn in his hurry had not remembered to close mr kay had made certain by two separate trials that that door had been locked and now it was wide open ergo the apostle of the jemmy and the skeleton key must still be in the house mr kay secure in the recollection that burglars never show fight if they can possibly help it determined to search the house  fenn made up his mind swiftly there was no time to finish dressing mr kay peering round might note the absence of the rest of his clothes from their accustomed pegs if he got into bed as he was there was only one thing to be done he threw back the bedclothes ruffled the sheets till the bed looked as if it had been slept in and opened the door just as mr kay reached the threshold  anything the matter sir asked fenn promptly i heard a noise downstairs can i help you  mr kay looked carefully at the exhead of his house fenn was a finelydeveloped youth he stood six feet and all of him that was not bone was muscle a useful colleague to have by one in a hunt for a possibly ferocious burglar  so thought mr kay  so you heard the noise he said well perhaps you had better come with me there is no doubt that a burglar has entered the house tonight in spite of the fact that i locked all the windows myself your study window was unlocked fenn it was extremely careless of you to leave it in such a condition and i hope you will be more careful in future why somebody might have got in through it  fenn thought it was not at all unlikely  come along then i am sure the man is still in the house he was hiding in the cupboard by the diningroom i know it i am sure he is still in the house  but in spite of the fact that fenn was equally sure half an hours search failed to discover any lurking evildoer  you had better go to bed fenn said mr kay disgustedly at the end of that period he must have got back in some extraordinary manner  yes sir agreed fenn  he himself had certainly got back in a very extraordinary manner  however he had got back which was the main point     xviii  a vain quest   after all he had gone through that night it disturbed fenn very little to find on the following morning that the professional cracksman had gone off with one of the cups in his study certainly it was not as bad as it might have been for he had only abstracted one out of the half dozen that decorated the room fenn was a fine runner and had won the sprint events at the sports for two years now  the news of the burglary at kays soon spread about the school mr kay mentioned it to mr mulholland and mr mulholland discussed it at lunch with the prefects of his house the juniors of kays were among the last to hear of it but when they did they made the most of it to the disgust of the school house fags to whom the episode seemed in the nature of an infringement of copyright several spirited bybattles took place that day owing to this and at the lower end of the table of kays diningroom at tea that evening there could be seen many swollen countenances all however wore pleased smiles they had proved to the school house their right to have a burglary of their own if they liked it was the first occasion since kennedy had become head of the house that kays had united in a common and patriotic cause  directly afternoon school was over that day fenn started for the town the only thing that caused him any anxiety now was the fear lest the cap which he had left in the house in the high street might rise up as evidence against him later on except for that he was safe the headmaster had evidently not remembered his absence from the festive board or he would have spoken to him on the subject before now if he could but recover the lost cap all would be right with the world give him back that cap and he would turn over a new leaf with a rapidity and emphasis which would lower the worlds record for that performance he would be a reformed character he would even go to the extent of calling a truce with mr kay climbing down to kennedy and offering him his services in his attempt to lick the house into shape  as a matter of fact he had had this idea before jimmy silver who was in the positioncommon at schoolof being very friendly with two people who were not on speaking terms had been at him on the topic  its rot james had said with perfect truth to see two chaps like you making idiots of themselves over a house like kays and its all your fault too he had added frankly you know jolly well you arent playing the game you ought to be backing kennedy up all the time instead of which you go about trying to look like a christian martyr  i dont said fenn indignantly  well like a stuffed frog thenits all the same to me its perfect rot if im walking with kennedy you stalk past as if wed both got the plague or something and if im with you kennedy suddenly remembers an appointment and dashes off at a gallop in the opposite direction if i had to award the bronze medal for drivelling lunacy in this place you would get it by a narrow margin and kennedy would be proxime and honourably mentioned silly idiots  dont stop jimmy keep it up said fenn settling himself in his chair the dialogue was taking place in silvers study  my dear chap you didnt think id finished surely i was only trying to find some description that would suit you but its no good i cant look here take my advicethe advice he added in the melodramatic voice he was in the habit of using whenever he wished to conceal the fact that he was speaking seriously of an old man who wishes ye both well go to kennedy fling yourself on his chest and say we have done those things which we ought not to have done no as you were compny shun say j silver says that i am a rotter i am a worm i have made an ass of myself but i will be good shake pard thats what youve got to do come in  and in had come kennedy the attractions of kays were small and he usually looked in on jimmy silver in the afternoons  oh sorry he said as he saw fenn i thought you were alone jimmy  i was just going said fenn politely  oh dont let me disturb you protested kennedy with winning courtesy  not at all said fenn  oh if you really were  oh yes really  get out then growled jimmy who had been listening in speechless disgust to the beautifully polite conversation just recorded ill forward that bronze medal to you fenn  and as the door closed he had turned to rend kennedy as he had rent fenn while fenn walked back to kays feeling that there was a good deal in what jimmy had said  so that when he went down town that afternoon in search of his cap he pondered as he walked over the advisability of making a fresh start it would not be a bad idea but first he must concentrate his energies on recovering what he had lost  he found the house in the high street without a great deal of difficulty for he had marked the spot carefully as far as that had been possible in the fog  the door was opened to him not by the old man with whom he had exchanged amenities on the previous night but by a short thick fellow who looked exactly like a picture of a loafer from the pages of a comic journal he eyed fenn with what might have been meant for an inquiring look to fenn it seemed merely menacing  wodyer want he asked abruptly  eckleton was not a great distance from london and as a consequence many of londons choicest blackguards migrated there from time to time during the hopping season and while the local races were on one might meet with two cockney twangs for every country accent  i want to see the old gentleman who lives here said fenn  wot old gentleman  im afraid i dont know his name is this a home for old gentlemen if youll bring out all youve got ill find my one  wodyer want see the old gentleman for  to ask for my cap i left it here last night  oh yer left it ere last night well yer cawnt see im  not from here no agreed fenn being only eyes you see he quoted happily my wisions limited but if you wouldnt mind moving out of the way  yer cawnt see im blimey ow much more of it i should like to know gerroutovit cawnt yer you and yer caps  and he added a searching expletive by way of concluding the sentence fittingly after which he slipped back and slammed the door leaving fenn waiting outside like the peri at the gate of paradise  his resemblance to the peri ceased after the first quarter of a minute that lady we read took her expulsion lying down fenn was more vigorous he seized the knocker and banged lustily on the door he had given up all hope of getting back the cap all he wanted was to get the doorkeeper out into the open again when he would proceed to show him to the best of his ability what was what it would not be the first time he had taken on a gentleman of the same class and a similar type of conversation  but the man refused to be drawn for all the reply fenns knocking produced the house might have been empty at last having tired his wrist and collected a small crowd of young eckleton who looked as if they expected him to proceed to further efforts for their amusement he gave it up and retired down the high street with what dignity he could commandwhich as he was followed for the first fifty yards by the silent but obviously expectant youths was not a great deal  they left him disappointed near the town hall and fenn continued on his way alone the window of the grocers shop with its tins of preserved apricots and pots of jam recalled to his mind what he had forgotten that the food at kays though it might be wholesome which he doubted was undeniably plain and secondly that he had run out of jam now that he was here he might as well supply that deficiency  now it chanced that master wren of kays was down townwithout leave as was his habiton an errand of a very similar nature walton had found that he like fenn lacked those luxuries of life which are so much more necessary than necessities and being unable to go himself owing to the unfortunate accident of being kept in by his formmaster had asked wren to go for him wrens visit to the grocers was just ending when fenns began  they met in the doorway  wren looked embarrassed and nearly dropped a pot of honey which he secured low down after the manner of a catch in the slips fenn on the other hand took no notice of his fellowkayite but walked on into the shop and began to inspect the tins of biscuits which were stacked on the floor by the counter     xix  the guile of wren   wren did not quite know what to make of this why had not fenn said a word to him there were one or two prefects in the school whom he might have met even at such close quarters and yet have cherished a hope that they had not seen him once he had run right into drew of the school house and escaped unrecognised but with fenn it was different compared to fenn lynxes were astigmatic he must have spotted him  there was a vein of philosophy in wrens composition he felt that he might just as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb in other words having been caught down town without leave he might as well stay there and enjoy himself a little while longer before going back to be executed so he strolled off down the high street bought a few things at a stationers and wound up with an excellent tea at the confectioners by the postoffice  it was as he was going to this meal that kennedy caught sight of him kennedy had come down town to visit the local photographer to whom he had entrusted a fortnight before the pleasant task of taking his photograph as he had heard nothing from him since he was now coming to investigate he entered the high street as wren was turning into the confectioners saw him and made a note of it for future reference  when wren returned to the house just before lockup he sought counsel of walton  i say he said as he handed over the honey he had saved so neatly from destruction what would you do just as i was coming out of the shop i barged into fenn he must have twigged me  didnt he say anything  not a word i couldnt make it out because he must have seen me we werent a yard away from one another  its dark in the shop suggested walton  not at the door which is where we met  before walton could find anything to say in reply to this their conversation was interrupted by spencer  kennedy wants you wren said spencer youd better buck up hes in an awful wax  next to walton the vindictive spencer objected most to wren and he did not attempt to conceal the pleasure he felt in being the bearer of this ominous summons  the group broke up wren went disconsolately upstairs to kennedys study walton smacked spencers headmore as a matter of form than because he had done anything special to annoy himand retired to the senior dayroom while spencer muttering darkly to himself avoided a second smack and took cover in the junior room where he consoled himself by toasting a piece of indiarubber in the gas till it made the atmosphere painful to breathe in and recalling with pleasure the condition waltons face had been in for the day or two following his encounter with kennedy in the dormitory  kennedy was working when wren knocked at his door  he had not much time to spare on a boundsbreaking fag and his manner was curt  i saw you going into roses in the high street this afternoon wren he said looking up from his greek prose i didnt give you leave come up here after prayers tonight shut the door  wren went down to consult walton again his attitude with regard to a licking from the head of the house was much like that of the other fags custom had to a certain extent inured him to these painful interviews but still if it was possible he preferred to keep out of them under fenns rule he had often found a tolerably thin excuse serve his need fenn had so many other things to do that he was not unwilling to forego an occasional licking if the excuse was good enough and he never took the trouble to find out whether the ingenious stories wren was wont to serve up to him were true or not kennedy wren reflected uncomfortably had given signs that this easygoing method would not do for him still it might be possible to hunt up some story that would meet the case walton had a gift in that direction  he says im to go to his study after prayers reported wren cant you think of any excuse that would do  cant understand fenn running you in said walton i thought he never spoke to kennedy  wren explained  it wasnt fenn who ran me in kennedy was down town too and twigged me going into roses i went there and had tea after i got your things at the grocers  oh he spotted you himself did he said walton and he doesnt know fenn saw you  i dont think so  then ive got a ripping idea when he has you up tonight swear that you got leave from fenn to go down town  but hell ask him  the odds are that he wont he and fenn had a row at the beginning of term and never speak to one another if they can help it its ten to one that he will prefer taking your yarn to going and asking fenn if its true or not then hes bound to let you off  wren admitted that the scheme was sound  at the conclusion of prayers therefore he went up again to kennedys study with a more hopeful air than he had worn on his previous visit  come in said kennedy reaching for the swaggerstick which he was accustomed to use at these ceremonies  please kennedy said wren glibly i did get leave to go down town this afternoon  what  wren repeated the assertion  who gave you leave  fenn  the thing did not seem to be working properly when he said the word fenn wren expected to see kennedy retire baffled conscious that there was nothing more to be said or done instead of this the remark appeared to infuriate him  its just like your beastly cheek he said glaring at the redheaded delinquent to ask fenn for leave instead of me you know perfectly well that only the head of the house can give leave to go down town i dont know how often you and the rest of the junior dayroom have played this game but its going to stop now youd better remember another time when you want to go to roses that ive got to be consulted first  with which he proceeded to ensure to the best of his ability that the memory of master wren should not again prove treacherous in this respect  how did it work asked walton when wren returned  it didnt said wren briefly  walton expressed an opinion that kennedy was a cad which however sound in itself did little to improve the condition of wren  having disposed of wren kennedy sat down seriously to consider this new development of a difficult situation hitherto he had imagined fenn to be merely a sort of passive resister who confined himself to the achillesinhistent business and was only a nuisance because he refused to back him up to find him actually aiding and abetting the house in its opposition to its head was something of a shock and yet if he had given wren leave to go down town he had probably done the same kind office by others it irritated kennedy more than the most overt act of enmity would have done it was not good form it was hitting below the belt there was of course the chance that wrens story had not been true but he did not build much on that he did not yet know his wren well and believed that such an audacious lie would be beyond the daring of a fag but it would be worth while to make inquiries he went down the passage to fenns study fenn however had gone to bed so he resolved to approach him on the subject next day there was no hurry  he went to his dormitory feeling very bitter towards fenn and rehearsing home truths with which to confound him on the morrow     xx  jimmy the peacemaker   in these hustling times it is not always easy to get ten minutes conversation with an acquaintance in private there was drill in the dinner hour next day for the corps to which kennedy had to go directly after lunch it did not end till afternoon school began when afternoon school was over he had to turn out and practise scrummaging with the first fifteen in view of an important school match which was coming off on the following saturday kennedy had not yet received his cap but he was playing regularly for the first fifteen and was generally looked upon as a certainty for one of the last places in the team fenn being a threequarter had not to participate in this practice while the forwards were scrummaging on the second fifteen ground the outsides ran and passed on the first fifteen ground over at the other end of the field fenns training for the day finished earlier than kennedys the captain of the eckleton fifteen who led the scrum not being satisfied with the way in which the forwards wheeled he kept them for a quarter of an hour after the outsides had done their days work and when kennedy got back to the house and went to fenns study the latter was not there he had evidently changed and gone out again for his football clothes were lying in a heap in a corner of the room going back to his own study he met spencer  have you seen fenn he asked  no said the fag he hasnt come in  hes come in all right but hes gone out again go and ask taylor if he knows where he is  taylor was fenns fag  spencer went to the junior dayroom and returned with the information that taylor did not know  oh all right thenit doesnt matter said kennedy and went into his study to change  he had completed this operation and was thinking of putting his kettle on for tea when there was a knock at the door  it was baker jimmy silvers fag  oh kennedy he said silver says if you arent doing anything special will you go over to his study to tea  why is there anything on  it struck him as curious that jimmy should take the trouble to send his fag over to kays with a formal invitation as a rule the head of blackburns kept open house his friends were given to understand that they could drop in whenever they liked kennedy looked in for tea three times a week on an average  i dont think so said baker  who else is going to be there  jimmy silver sometimes took it into his head to entertain weird beings from other houses whose brothers or cousins he had met in the holidays on such occasions he liked to have some trusty friend by him to help the conversation along it struck kennedy that this might be one of those occasions if so he would send back a polite but firm refusal of the invitation last time he had gone to help jimmy entertain a guest of this kind conversation had come to a dead standstill a quarter of an hour after his arrival the guest refusing to do anything except eat prodigiously and reply yes or no as the question might demand when spoken to also he had declined to stir from his seat till a quarter to seven kennedy was not going to be let in for another orgy of that nature if he knew it  whos with silver he asked  only fenn said baker  kennedy pondered for a moment  all right he said at last tell him ill be round in a few minutes  he sat thinking the thing over after baker had gone back to blackburns with the message he saw silvers game of course jimmy had made no secret for some time of his disgust at the coolness between kennedy and fenn not knowing all the circumstances he considered it absolute folly if only he could get the two together over a quiet pot of tea he imagined that it would not be a difficult task to act effectively as a peacemaker  kennedy was sorry for jimmy he appreciated his feelings in the matter he would not have liked it himself if his two best friends had been at daggers drawn still he could not bring himself to treat fenn as if nothing had happened simply to oblige silver there had been a time when he might have done it but now that fenn had started a deliberate campaign against him by giving wrenand probably thought kennedy half the other fags in the houseleave down town when he ought to have sent them on to him things had gone too far however he could do no harm by going over to jimmys to tea even if fenn was there he had not looked to interview fenn before an audience but if that audience consisted only of jimmy it would not matter so much  his advent surprised fenn the astute james fancying that if he mentioned that he was expecting kennedy to tea fenn would make a bolt for it had said nothing about it  when kennedy arrived there was one of those awkward pauses which are so difficult to fill up in a satisfactory manner  now youre up fenn said jimmy as the latter rose evidently with the intention of leaving the study you might as well reach down that toastingfork and make some toast  im afraid i must be off now jimmy said fenn  no you arent said silver you bustle about and make yourself useful and dont talk rot youll find your cup on that shelf over there kennedy itll want a wipe round better use the tablecloth  there was silence in the study until tea was ready then jimmy silver spoke  long time since we three had tea together he said addressing the remark to the teapot  kennedys a busy man said fenn suavely hes got a house to look after  and im going to look after it said kennedy as youll find  jimmy silver put in a plaintive protest  i wish you two men wouldnt talk shop he said its bad enough having kays next door to one without your dragging it into the conversation how were the forwards this evening kennedy  not bad said kennedy shortly  i wonder if we shall lick tuppenham on saturday  i dont know said kennedy and there was silence again  look here jimmy said kennedy after a long pause during which the head of blackburns tried to fill up the blank in the conversation by toasting a piece of bread in a way which was intended to suggest that if he were not so busy the talk would be unchecked and animated its no good we must have it out some time so it may as well be here as anywhere else ive been looking for fenn all day  sorry to give you all that trouble said fenn with a sneer got something important to say  yes  go ahead then  jimmy silver stood between them with the toastingfork in his hand as if he meant to plunge it into the one who first showed symptoms of flying at the others throat he was unhappy his peacemaking teaparty was not proving a success  i wanted to ask you said kennedy quietly what you meant by giving the fags leave down town when you knew that they ought to come to me  the gentle and intelligent reader will remember though that miserable worm the vapid and irreflective reader will have forgotten that at the beginning of the term the fags of kays had endeavoured to show their approval of fenn and their disapproval of kennedy by applying to the former for leave when they wished to go to the town and that fenn had received them in the most ungrateful manner with blows instead of exeats strong in this recollection he was not disturbed by kennedys question indeed it gave him a comfortable feeling of rectitude there is nothing more pleasant than to be accused to your face of something which you can deny on the spot with an easy conscience it is like getting a very loose ball at cricket fenn felt almost friendly towards kennedy  i meant nothing he replied for the simple reason that i didnt do it  i caught wren down town yesterday and he said you had given him leave  then he lied and i hope you licked him  there you are you see broke in jimmy silver triumphantly its all a misunderstanding you two have got no right to be cutting one another why on earth cant you stop all this rot and behave like decent members of society again  as a matter of fact said fenn they did try it on earlier in the term i wasted a lot of valuable time pointing out to them with a swaggerstickthat i was the wrong person to come to im sorry you should have thought i could play it as low down as that  kennedy hesitated it is not very pleasant to have to climb down after starting a conversation in a stormy and wrathful vein but it had to be done  im sorry fenn he said i was an idiot  jimmy silver cut in again  you were he said with enthusiasm you both were i used to think fenn was a bigger idiot than you but now im inclined to call it a dead heat whats the good of going on trying to see which of you can make the bigger fool of himself youve both lowered all previous records  i suppose we have said fenn at least i have  no i have said kennedy  you both have said jimmy silver another cup of tea anybody say when  fenn and kennedy walked back to kays together and tead together in fenns study on the following afternoon to the amazementand even scandalof master spencer who discovered them at it spencer liked excitement and with the two leaders of the house at loggerheads things could never be really dull if as appearances seemed to suggest they had agreed to settle their differences life would become monotonous againpossibly even unpleasant  this thought flashed through spencers brain as he called it when he opened fenns door and found him helping kennedy to tea  oh the headmaster wants to see you please fenn said spencer recovering from his amazement and told me to give you this  this was a prefects cap fenn recognised it without difficulty it was the cap he had left in the sittingroom of the house in the high street     xxi  in which an episode is closed   thanks said fenn  he stood twirling the cap round in his hand as spencer closed the door then he threw it on to the table he did not feel particularly disturbed at the thought of the interview that was to come he had been expecting the cap to turn up like the corpse of eugene arams victim at some inconvenient moment it was a pity that it had come just as things looked as if they might be made more or less tolerable in kays he had been looking forward with a grim pleasure to the sensation that would be caused in the house when it became known that he and kennedy had formed a combine for its moral and physical benefit but that was all over he would be sacked beyond a doubt in the history of eckleton as far as he knew it there had never been a case of a fellow breaking out at night and not being expelled when he was caught it was one of the cardinal sins in the school code there had been the case of peter brown which his brother had mentioned in his letter and in his own time he had seen three men vanish from eckleton for the same offence he did not flatter himself that his record at the school was so good as to make it likely that the authorities would stretch a point in his favour  so long kennedy he said youll be here when i get back i suppose  what does he want you for do you think asked kennedy stretching himself with a yawn it never struck him that fenn could be in any serious trouble fenn was a prefect and when the headmaster sent for a prefect it was generally to tell him that he had got a split infinitive in his english essay that week  glad im not you he added as a gust of wind rattled the sash and the rain dashed against the pane beastly evening to have to go out  it isnt the rain i mind said fenn its whats going to happen when i get indoors again and refused to explain further there would be plenty of time to tell kennedy the whole story when he returned it was better not to keep the headmaster waiting  the first thing he noticed on reaching the school house was the strange demeanour of the butler whenever fenn had had occasion to call on the headmaster hitherto watson had admitted him with the air of a high priest leading a devotee to a shrine of which he was the sole managing director this evening he seemed restless excited  good evening mr fenn he said this way sir  those were his actual words fenn had not known for certain until now that he could talk on previous occasions their conversations had been limited to an is the headmaster in from fenn and a stately inclination of the head from watson the man was getting a positive babbler  with an eager springy step distantly reminiscent of a shopwalker heading a procession of customers with a touch of the style of the winner in a walkingrace to brighton the once slowmoving butler led the way to the headmasters study  for the first time since he started out fenn was conscious of a tremor there is something about a closed door behind which somebody is waiting to receive one which appeals to the imagination especially if the ensuing meeting is likely to be an unpleasant one  ah fenn said the headmaster come in  fenn wondered it was not in this tone of voice that the head was wont to begin a conversation which was going to prove painful  youve got your cap fenn i gave it to a small boy in your house to take to you  yes sir  he had given up all hope of understanding the heads line of action unless he was playing a deep game and intended to flash out suddenly with a keen question which it would be impossible to parry there seemed nothing to account for the strange absence of anything unusual in his manner he referred to the cap as if he had borrowed it from fenn and had returned it by bearer hoping that its loss had not inconvenienced him at all  i daresay continued the head that you are wondering how it came into my possession you missed it of course  very much sir said fenn with perfect truth  it has just been brought to my house together with a great many other things more valuable perhapshere he smiled a headmagisterial smileby a policeman from eckleton  fenn was still unequal to the intellectual pressure of the conversation he could understand in a vague way that for some unexplained reason things were going well for him but beyond that his mind was in a whirl  you will remember the unfortunate burglary of mr kays house and mine your cap was returned with the rest of the stolen property  just so thought fenn the rest of the stolen property exactly go on dont mind me i shall begin to understand soon i suppose  he condensed these thoughts into the verbal reply yes sir  i sent for you to identify your own property i see there is a silver cup belonging to you perhaps there are also other articles go and see you will find them on that table they are in a hopeless state of confusion having been conveyed here in a sack fortunately nothing is broken  he was thinking of certain valuables belonging to himself which had been abstracted from his drawingroom on the occasion of the burglars visit to the school house  fenn crossed the room and began to inspect the table indicated on it was as mixed a collection of valuable and useless articles as one could wish to see he saw his cup at once and attached himself to it but of all the other exhibits in this private collection he could recognise nothing else as his property  there is nothing of mine here except the cup sir he said  ah then that is all i think you are going back to mr kays then please send kennedy to me good night fenn  good night sir  even now fenn could not understand it the more he thought it over the more his brain reeled he could grasp the fact that his cap and his cup were safe again and that there was evidently going to be no sacking for the moment but how it had all happened and how the police had got hold of his cap and why they had returned it with the loot gathered in by the burglar who had visited kays and the school house were problems which he had to confess were beyond him  he walked to kays through the rain with the cup under his mackintosh and freely admitted to himself that there were things in heaven and earthand particularly earthwhich no fellow could understand  i dont know he said when kennedy pressed for an explanation of the reappearance of the cup its no good asking me im going now to borrow the matrons smellingsalts i feel faint after that i shall wrap a wet towel round my head and begin to think it out meanwhile youre to go over to the head hes had enough of me and he wants to have a look at you  me said kennedy why  now is it any good asking me said fenn if you can find out what its all about ill thank you if youll come and tell me  ten minutes later kennedy returned he carried a watch and chain  i couldnt think what had happened to my watch he said i missed it on the day after that burglary here but i never thought of thinking it had been collared by a professional i thought i must have lost it somewhere  well have you grasped whats been happening  ive grasped my ticker which is good enough for me half a second the old man wants to see the rest of the prefects hes going to work through the house in batches instead of man by man ill just go round the studies and rout them out and then ill come back and explain its perfectly simple  glad you think so said fenn  kennedy went and returned  now he said subsiding into a deckchair what is it you dont understand  i dont understand anything begin at the beginning  i got the yarn from the butlerwhats his name  those who know him well enough to venture to give him a nameive never dared to myselfcall him watson said fenn  i got the yarn from watson he was as excited as anything about it i never saw him like that before  i noticed something queer about him  hes awfully bucked and is doing the ancient mariner business all over the place wants to tell the story to everyone he sees  well suppose you follow his example i want to hear about it  well it seems that the police have been watching a house at the corner of the high street for some timewhats up  nothing go on  but you said by jove  well why shouldnt i say by jove when you are telling sensational yarns its my duty to say something of the sort buck along  its a house not far from the town hall at the corner of pegwell streetyouve probably been there scores of times  once or twice perhaps said fenn well  about a month ago two suspiciouslooking bounders went to live there watson says their faces were enough to hang them anyhow they must have been pretty bad for they made even the eckleton police who are pretty averagesized rotters suspicious and they kept an eye on them well after a bit there began to be a regular epidemic of burglary round about here watson says half the houses round were broken into the police thought it was getting a bit too thick but they didnt like to raid the house without some jolly good evidence that these two men were the burglars so they lay low and waited till they should give them a decent excuse for jumping on them they had had a detective chap down from london by the way to see if he couldnt do something about the burglaries and he kept his eye on them too  they had quite a gallery didnt they notice any of the eyes  no then after a bit one of them nipped off to london with a big bag the detective chap was after him like a shot he followed him from the station saw him get into a cab got into another himself and stuck to him hard the front cab stopped at about a dozen pawnbrokers shops the detective johnny took the names and addresses and hung on to the burglar man all day and finally saw him return to the station where he caught a train back to eckleton directly he had seen him off the detective got into a cab called on the dozen pawnbrokers showed his card with scotland yard on it i suppose and asked to see what the other chap had pawned he identified every single thing as something that had been collared from one of the houses round eckleton way so he came back here told the police and they raided the house and there they found stacks of loot of all descriptions  including my cap said fenn thoughtfully i see now  rummy the man thinking it worth his while to take an old cap said kennedy  very said fenn but its been a rum business all along     xxii  kays changes its name   for the remaining weeks of the winter term things went as smoothly in kays as kay would let them that restless gentleman still continued to burst in on kennedy from time to time with some sensational story of how he had found a fag doing what he ought not to have done but there was a world of difference between the effect these visits had now and that which they had had when kennedy had stood alone in the house his hand against all men now that he could work off the effects of such encounters by going straight to fenns study and picking the housemaster to pieces the latters peculiar methods ceased to be irritating and became funny mr kay was always ferreting out the weirdest misdoings on the part of the members of his house and rushing to kennedys study to tell him about them at full length like a rather indignant dog bringing a rat he has hunted down into a drawingroom to display it to the company on one occasion when fenn and jimmy silver were in kennedys study mr kay dashed in to complain bitterly that he had discovered that the junior dayroom kept mice in their lockers apparently this fact seemed to him enough to cause an epidemic of typhoid fever in the place and he hauled kennedy over the coals in a speech that lasted five minutes for not having detected this plaguespot in the house  so thats the celebrity at home is it said jimmy silver when he had gone i now begin to understand more or less why this house wants a new head every two terms is he often taken like that  hes never anything else said kennedy fenn keeps a list of the things he rags me about and we have an even shilling on each week that he will beat the record of the previous week at first i used to get the shilling if he lowered the record but after a bit it struck us that it wasnt fair so now we take it on alternate weeks this is my week by the way i think i can trouble you for that bob fenn  i wish i could make it more said fenn handing over the shilling  what sort of things does he rag you about generally inquired silver  fenn produced a slip of paper  here are a few he said for this month he came in on the 10th because he found two kids fighting kennedy was down town when it happened but that made no difference then he caught the senior dayroom making a row of some sort he said it was perfectly deafening but we couldnt hear it in our studies i believe he goes round the house listening at keyholes that was on the 16th on the 22nd he found a chap in kennedys dormitory wandering about the house at one in the morning he seemed to think that kennedy ought to have sat up all night on the chance of somebody cutting out of the dormitory at any rate he ragged him i won the weekly shilling on that and deserved it too  fenn had to go over to the gymnasium shortly after this jimmy silver stayed on talking to kennedy  and bar kay said jimmy how do you find the house doing any better  better its getting a sort of model establishment i believe if we keep pegging away at them we may win some sort of a cup sooner or later  well kays very nearly won the cricket cup last year you ought to get it next season now that you and fenn are both in the team  oh i dont know itll be a fluke if we do still were hoping it isnt every house thats got a county man in it but were breaking out in another place dont let it get about for goodness sake but were going for the sports cup  hope youll get it blackburns wont have a chance anyhow and i should like to see somebody get it away from the school house theyve had it much too long theyre beginning to look on it as their right but who are your men  well fenn ought to be a cert for the hundred and the quarter to start with  but the school house must get the long run and the mile and the half too probably  yes we havent anyone to beat milligan certainly but there are the second and third places dont forget those thats where were going to have a look in theres all sorts of unsuspected talent in kays to look at peel for instance you wouldnt think he could do the hundred in eleven would you well he can only hes been too slack to go in for the race at the sports because it meant training i had him up here and reasoned with him and hes promised to do his best eleven is good enough for second place in the hundred dont you think there are lots of others in the house who can do quite decently on the track if they try ive been making strict inquiries kays are hot stuff jimmy heap big medicine thats what they are  youre a wonderful man kennedy said jimmy silver and he meant it kennedys uphill fight at kays had appealed to him strongly he himself had never known what it meant to have to manage a hostile house he had stepped into his predecessors shoes at blackburns much as the heir to a throne becomes king nobody had thought of disputing his right to the place he was next man in so directly the departure of the previous head of blackburns left a vacancy he stepped into it and the machinery of the house had gone on as smoothly as if there had been no change at all but kennedy had gone in against a slack and antagonistic house with weak prefects to help him and a fussy housemaster and he had fought them all for a term and looked like winning jimmy admired his friend with a fervour which nothing on earth would have tempted him to reveal like most people with a sense of humour he had a fear of appearing ridiculous and he hid his real feelings as completely as he was able  how is the footer getting on inquired jimmy remembering the difficulties kennedy had encountered earlier in the term in connection with his house team  its better said kennedy keener at any rate we shall do our best in the housematches but we arent a good team  any more trouble about your being captain instead of fenn  no we both sign the lists now fenn didnt want to but i thought it would be a good idea so we tried it it seems to have worked all right  of course your getting your first has probably made a difference  a bit perhaps  well i hope you wont get the footer cup because i want it for blackburns or the cricket cup i want that too but you can have the sports cup with my blessing  thanks said kennedy its very generous of you  dont mention it said jimmy  from which conversation it will be seen that kays was gradually pulling itself together it had been asleep for years it was now waking up  when the winter term ended there were distinct symptoms of an outbreak of public spirit in the house  the easter term opened auspiciously in one way neither walton nor perry returned the former had been snapped up in the middle of the holidaysto his enormous disgustby a bank which wanted his services so much that it was prepared to pay him 40 pounds a year simply to enter the addresses of its outgoing letters in a book and post them when he had completed this ceremony after a spell of this he might hope to be transferred to another sphere of bank life and thought and at the end of his first year he might even hope for a rise in his salary of ten pounds if his conduct was good and he had not been late on more than twenty mornings in the year i am aware that in a properlyregulated story of schoollife walton would have gone to the eckleton races returned in a state of speechless intoxication and been summarily expelled but facts are facts and must not be tampered with the ingenious but not industrious perry had been superannuated for three years he had been in the lower fourth probably the master of that form went to the head and said that his constitution would not stand another year of him and that either he or perry must go so perry had departed like a poor play he had failed to attract and was withdrawn there was also another departure of an even more momentous nature  mr kay had left eckleton  kennedy was no longer head of kays he was now head of dencrofts  mr dencroft was one of the most popular masters in the school he was a keen athlete and a tactful master fenn and kennedy knew him well through having played at the nets and in scratch games with him they both liked him if kennedy had had to select a housemaster he would have chosen mr blackburn first but mr dencroft would have been easily second  fenn learned the facts from the matron and detailed them to kennedy  kay got the offer of a headmastership at a small school in the north and jumped at it i pity the fellows there they are going to have a lively time  im jolly glad dencroft has got the house said kennedy we might have had some awful rotter put in dencroft will help us buck up the house games  the new housemaster sent for kennedy on the first evening of term he wished to find out how the head of the house and the exhead stood with regard to one another he knew the circumstances and comprehended vaguely that there had been trouble  i hope we shall have a good term he said  i hope so sir said kennedy  youeryou think the house is keener kennedy than when you first came in  yes sir they are getting quite keen now we might win the sports  i hope we shall i wish we could win the football cup too but i am afraid mr blackburns are very heavy metal  its hardly likely we shall have very much chance with them but we might get into the final  it would be an excellent thing for the house if we could i hope fenn is helping you get the team into shape he added  oh yes sir said kennedy we share the captaincy we both sign the lists  a very good idea said mr dencroft relieved good night kennedy  good night sir said kennedy     xxiii  the housematches   the chances of kays in the interhouse football competition were not thought very much of by their rivals of late years each of the other houses had prayed to draw kays for the first round it being a certainty that this would mean that they got at least into the second round and so a step nearer the cup nobody however weak compared to blackburns which was at the moment the crack football house ever doubted the result of a match with kays it was looked on as a sort of gentle trial trip  but the efforts of the two captains during the last weeks of the winter term had put a different complexion on matters football is not like cricket it is a game at which anybody of average size and a certain amount of pluck can make himself at least moderately proficient kennedy after consultations with fenn had picked out what he considered the best fifteen and the two set themselves to knock it into shape in weight there was not much to grumble at there were several heavy men in the scrum if only these could be brought to use their weight to the last ounce when shoving all would be well as far as the forwards were concerned the outsides were not so satisfactory with the exception of course of fenn they lacked speed they were wellmeaning but they could not run any faster by virtue of that kays would have to trust to its scrum to pull it through peel the sprinter whom kennedy had discovered in his search for athletes had to be put in the pack on account of his weight which deprived the threequarter line of what would have been a good man in that position it was a drawback too that fenn was accustomed to play on the wing to be of real service a wing threequarter must be fed by his centres and unfortunately there was no centre in kaysor dencrofts as it should now be calledwho was capable of making openings enough to give fenn a chance so he had to play in the centre where he did not know the game so well  kennedy realised at an early date that the one chance of the house was to get together before the housematches and play as a coherent team not as a collection of units combination will often make up for lack of speed in a threequarter line so twice a week dencrofts turned out against scratch teams of varying strength  it delighted kennedy to watch their improvement the first side they played ran through them to the tune of three goals and four tries to a try and it took all the efforts of the head of the house to keep a spirit of pessimism from spreading in the ranks another frost of this sort and the sprouting keenness of the house would be nipped in the bud he conducted himself with much tact another captain might have made the fatal error of trying to stir his team up with pungent abuse he realised what a mistake this would be it did not need a great deal of discouragement to send the house back to its old slack ways another such defeat following immediately in the footsteps of the first and they would begin to ask themselves what was the good of mortifying the flesh simply to get a licking from a scratch team by twentyfour points kays they would feel always had got beaten and they always would to the end of time a house that has once got thoroughly slack does not change its views of life in a moment  kennedy acted craftily  you played jolly well he told his despondent team as they trooped off the field we havent got together yet thats all and it was a hot side we were playing today they would have licked blackburns  a good deal more in the same strain gave the house team the comfortable feeling that they had done uncommonly well to get beaten by only twentyfour points kennedy fostered the delusion and in the meantime arranged with mr dencroft to collect fifteen innocents and lead them forth to be slaughtered by the house on the following friday mr dencroft entered into the thing with a relish when he showed kennedy the list of his team on the friday morning that diplomatist chuckled he foresaw a good time in the near future you must play up like the dickens he told the house during the dinnerhour dencroft is bringing a hot lot this afternoon but i think we shall lick them  they did when the whistle blew for noside the house had just finished scoring its fourteenth try six goals and eight tries to nil was the exact total dencrofts returned to headquarters asking itself in a dazed way if these things could be they saw that cup on their mantelpiece already keenness redoubled football became the fashion in dencrofts the play of the team improved weekly and its spirit improved too the next scratch team they played beat them by a goal and a try to a goal dencrofts was not depressed it put the result down to a fluke then they beat another side by a try to nothing and by that time they had got going as an organised team and their heart was in the thing  they had improved out of all knowledge when the housematches began blairs was the lucky house that drew against them in the first round  good business said the men of blair wonder who well play in the second round  they left the field marvelling for some unaccountable reason dencrofts had flatly refused to act in the good old way as a doormat for their opponents instead they had played with a dash and knowledge of the game which for the first quarter of an hour quite unnerved blairs in that quarter of an hour they scored three times and finished the game with two goals and three tries to their name  the school looked on it as a huge joke heard the latest friends would say on meeting one another the day after the game kaysi mean dencroftshave won a match they simply sat on blairs first time theyve ever won a housematch i should think blairs are awfully sick we shall have to be looking out  whereat the friend would grin broadly the idea of dencrofts making a game of it with his house tickled him  when dencrofts took fifteen points off mulhollands the joke began to lose its humour  why they must be some good said the public startled at the novelty of the idea if they win another match theyll be in the final  kays in the final cricket oh yes they had got into the final at cricket of course but that wasnt the house it was fenn footer was different one man couldnt do everything there the only possible explanation was that they had improved to an enormous extent  then people began to remember that they had played in scratch games against the house there seemed to be a tremendous number of fellows who had done this at one time or another it seemed half the school had opposed dencrofts in the ranks of a scratch side it began to dawn on eckleton that in an unostentatious way dencrofts had been putting in about seven times as much practice as any other three houses rolled together no wonder they combined so well  when the school house with three first fifteen men in its team fell before them the reputation of dencrofts was established it had reached the final and only blackburns stood now between it and the cup  all this while blackburns had been doing what was expected of them by beating each of their opponents with great ease there was nothing sensational about this as there was in the case of dencrofts the latter were therefore favourites when the two teams lined up against one another in the final the school felt that a house that had had such a meteoric flight as dencrofts mustby all that was dramaticcarry the thing through to its obvious conclusion and pull off the final  but fenn and kennedy were not so hopeful a certain amount of science a great deal of keenness and excellent condition had carried them through the other rounds in rare style but though they would probably give a good account of themselves nobody who considered the two teams impartially could help seeing that dencrofts was a weaker side than blackburns nothing but great good luck could bring them out victorious today  and so it proved dencrofts played up for all they were worth from the kickoff to the final solo on the whistle but they were overmatched blackburns scrum was too heavy for them with its three first fifteen men and two seconds dencrofts pack were shoved off the ball time after time and it was only keen tackling that kept the score down by halftime blackburns were a couple of tries ahead fenn scored soon after the interval with a great run from his own twentyfive and for a quarter of an hour it looked as if it might be anybodys game kennedy converted the try so that blackburns only led by a single point a fluky kick or a mistake on the part of a blackburnite outside might give dencrofts the cup  but the blackburn outsides did not make mistakes they played a strong sure game and the forwards fed them well ten minutes before noside jimmy silver ran in increasing the lead to six points and though dencrofts never went to pieces and continued to show fight to the very end blackburns were not to be denied and challis scored a final try in the corner blackburns won the cup by the comfortable but not excessive margin of a goal and three tries to a goal  dencrofts had lost the cup but they had lost it well their credit had increased in spite of the defeat  i thought we shouldnt be able to manage blackburns said kennedy what we must do now is win that sports cup     xxiv  the sports   there were certain houses at eckleton which had as it were specialised in certain competitions thus gays who never by any chance survived the first two rounds of the cricket and football housers invariably won the shooting shield all the other houses sent their brace of men to the range to see what they could do but every year it was the same a pair of weedy obscurities from gays would take the shield by a comfortable margin in the same way mulhollands had only won the cricket cup once since they had become a house but they had carried off the swimming cup three years in succession and six years in all out of the last eight the sports had always been looked on as the perquisite of the school house and this year with milligan to win the long distances and maybury the high jump and the weight there did not seem much doubt at their success these two alone would pile up fifteen points three points were given for a win two for second place and one for third it was this that encouraged kennedy in the hope that dencrofts might have a chance nobody in the house could beat milligan or maybury but the school house second and third strings were not so invincible if dencrofts by means of second and third places in the long races and the other events which were certainties for their opponents could hold the school house fenns sprinting might just give them the cup in the meantime they trained hard but in an unobtrusive fashion which aroused no fear in school house circles  the sports were fixed for the last saturday of term but not all the races were run on that day the halfmile came off on the previous thursday and the long steeplechase on the monday after  the school house won the halfmile as they were expected to do milligan led from the start increased his lead at the end of the first lap doubled it halfway through the second and finally with a dazzling sprint in the last seventy yards lowered the eckleton record by a second and threefifths and gave his house three points kennedy who stuck gamely to his man for half the first lap was beaten on the tape by crake of mulhollands when sports day came therefore the score was school house three points mulhollands two dencrofts one the success of mulhollands in the half was to the advantage of dencrofts mulhollands was not likely to score many more points and a place to them meant one or two points less to the school house  the sports opened all in favour of dencrofts but those who knew drew no great consolation from this school sports always begin with the sprints and these were dencrofts certainties fenn won the hundred yards as easily as milligan had won the half peel was second and a beddells man got third place so that dencrofts had now six points to their rivals three ten minutes later they had increased their lead by winning the first two places at throwing the cricket ball fenns throw beating kennedys by ten yards and kennedys being a few feet in front of jimmy silvers which by gaining third place represented the only point blackburns managed to amass during the afternoon  it now began to dawn upon the school house that their supremacy was seriously threatened dencrofts by its success in the football competition had to a great extent lived down the reputation the house had acquired when it had been kays but even now the notion of its winning a cup seemed somehow vaguely improper but the fact had to be faced that it now led by eleven points to the school houses three  its all right said the school house our spot events havent come off yet dencrofts cant get much more now  and to prove that they were right the gap between the two scores began gradually to be filled up dencrofts struggled hard but the school house total crept up and up maybury brought it to six by winning the high jump this was only what had been expected of him the discomforting part of the business was that the other two places were filled by morrell of mulhollands and smith of dalys and when immediately afterwards maybury won the weight with another school house man second leaving dencrofts with third place only things began to look black for the latter they were now only one point ahead and there was the mile to come and milligan could give any dencroftian a hundred yards at that distance  but to balance the mile there was the quarter and in the mile kennedy contrived to beat crake by much the same number of feet as crake had beaten him by in the half the scores of the two houses were now level and a goodly number of the school house certainties were past  dencrofts forged ahead again by virtue of the quartermile fenn won it peel was second and a dark horse from dennys got in third with the greater part of the sports over and a lead of five points to their name dencrofts could feel more comfortable the hurdlerace was productive of some discomfort fenn should have won it as being blessed with twice the pace of any of his opponents but maybury the jumper made up for lack of pace by the scientific way in which he took his hurdles and won off him by a couple of feet smith dencrofts second string finished third thus leaving the totals unaltered by the race  by this time the public had become alive to the fact that dencrofts were making a great fight for the cup they had noticed that dencrofts colours always seemed to be coming in near the head of the procession but the school house had made the cup so much their own that it took some time for the school to realise that another houseespecially the late kayswas running them hard for first place then just before the hurdlerace fellows with correct cards hastily totted up the points each house had won uptodate to the general amazement it was found that while the school house had fourteen dencrofts had reached nineteen and barring the long run to be decided on the monday there was nothing now that the school house must win without dispute  a house that will persist in winning a cup year after year has to pay for it when challenged by a rival dencrofts instantly became warm favourites whenever dencrofts brown and gold appeared at the scratch the school shouted for it wildly till the event was over by the end of the day the totals were more nearly even but dencrofts were still ahead they had lost on the long jump but not unexpectedly the totals at the finish were school house twentythree dencrofts twentyfive everything now depended on the long run  we might do it said kennedy to fenn as they changed milligans a cert for three points of course but if we can only get two we win the cup  theres one thing about the long run said fenn you never quite know whats going to happen milligan might break down over one of the hedges or the brook theres no telling  kennedy felt that such a remote possibility was something of a broken reed to lean on he had no expectation of beating the school house long distance runner but he hoped for second place and second place would mean the cup for there was nobody to beat either himself or crake  the distance of the long run was as nearly as possible five miles the course was across country to the village of ledby in a sort of semicircle of three and a half miles and then back to the school gates by road every eckletonian who ran at all knew the route by heart it was the recognised training run if you wanted to train particularly hard if you did not you took a shorter spin at the milestone nearest the schoolit was about half a mile from the gatesa good number of fellows used to wait to see the first of the runners and pace their men home but as a rule there were few really hot finishes in the long run the man who got to ledby first generally kept the advantage and came in a long way ahead of the field  on this occasion the close fight kennedy and crake had had in the mile and the half added to the fact that kennedy had only to get second place to give dencrofts the cup lent a greater interest to the race than usual the crowd at the milestone was double the size of the one in the previous year when milligan had won for the first time and when amidst howls of delight from the school house the same runner ran past the stone with his long effortless stride before any of the others were in sight the crowd settled down breathlessly to watch for the second man  then a yell to which the other had been nothing burst from the school house as a white figure turned the corner it was crake waddling rather than running and breathing in gasps but still crake he toiled past the crowd at the milestone  by jove he looks bad said someone  and indeed he looked very bad but he was ahead of kennedy that was the great thing  he had passed the stone by thirty yards when the cheering broke out again kennedy this time in great straits but in better shape than crake dencrofts in a body trotted along at the side of the road shouting as they went crake hearing the shouts looked round almost fell and then pulled himself together and staggered on again there were only a hundred yards to go now and the school gates were in sight at the end of a long lane of spectators they looked to kennedy like two thick black hedges he could not sprint though a hundred voices were shouting to him to do so it was as much as he could do to keep moving only his will enabled him to run now he meant to get to the gates if he had to crawl  the hundred yards dwindled to fifty and he had diminished crakes lead by a third twenty yards from the gates and he was only halfadozen yards behind  crake looked round again and this time did what he had nearly done before his legs gave way he rolled over and there he remained with the school house watching him in silent dismay while kennedy went on and pitched in a heap on the other side of the gates                                       feeling bad said jimmy silver looking in that evening to make inquiries  im feeling good said kennedy  that the cup asked jimmy  kennedy took the huge cup from the table  thats it milligan has just brought it round well they cant say they havent had their fair share of it look here school house school house school house school house dalys school house dennys school house school house ad infinitum  they regarded the trophy in silence  first pot the house has won said kennedy at length the very first  it wont be the last returned jimmy silver with decision
