much my favourite as certain of its predecessors lady louisa stuart wrote to scott on march 26 1824 yet still i see the authors hand in it et cest tout dire meg dods the meeting vol i chap ix and the last scene between clara and her brother are marked with the true stamp not to be matched or mistaken is the siege of ptolemais really on the anvil she goes on speaking of the projected crusading tales and obviously anxious to part company with st ronans well all judgments have not agreed with lady louisas there is a literary legend or fable according to which a number of distinguished men all admirers of scott wrote down separately the name of their favourite waverley novel and all when the papers were compared had written st ronans sydney smith writing to constable on dec 28 1823 described the new story as far the best that has appeared for some time every now and then there is some mistaken or overcharged humourbut much excellent delineation of character the story very well told and the whole very interesting lady binks the old landlady and touchwood are all very good mrs blower particularly so so are macturk and lady penelope i wish he would give his people better names sir bingo binks is quite ridiculous the curtain should have dropped on finding claras glove some of the serious scenes with clara and her brother are very fine the knife scene masterly in her light and gay moments clara is very vulgar but sir walter always fails in wellbred men and women and yet who has seen more of both and who in the ordinary intercourse of society is better bred upon the whole i call this a very successful exhibition  we have seldom found sydney smith giving higher praise and nobody can deny the justice of the censure with which it is qualified scott himself explains in his introduction how in his quest of novelty he invaded modern life and the domain of miss austen unhappily he proved by example the truth of his own opinion that he could do the big bowwow strain very well but that it was not his celebrare domestica facta unlike george sand sir walter had humour abundantly but as the french writer said of herself he was wholly destitute of esprit  we need not linger over definition of these qualities but we must recognise in scott the absence of lightness of touch of delicacy in the small swordplay of conversation in fencing all should be done the masters tell us with the fingers scott works not even with the wrist but with the whole arm the twohanded sword the old claymore are his weapons not the rapier this was plain enough in the wordcombats of queen mary and her lady gaoler in loch leven much more conspicuous is the swashing blow in the repartee of st ronans the insults lavished on lady binks are violent and cruel even clara mowbray taunts her now lady binks is in the same parlous case as the postmistress who dreed penance for antenup as meg dods says in an interrupted harangue and we know that to the authors mind clara mowbray had no right to throw stones all these jeers are offensive to generous feeling and in the mouth of clara are intolerable lockhart remarked in scott a singular bluntness of the sense of smell and of taste he could drink corked wine without a suspicion that there was anything wrong with it this curious obtuseness of a physical sense in one whose eyesight was so keen who aye was the first to find the hare in coursing seems to correspond with his want of lightness in the invention of badinage he tells us that for a long while at least he had been unacquainted with the kind of society the idle useless underbred society of wateringplaces are we to believe that the company at gilsland for instance where he met and wooed miss charpentier was like the company at st ronans lockhart vouches for the snobbishness the mean admiration of mean things the devotion to the slimmest appearances of rank all this is credible enough but if there existed a society as dull and base as that which we meet in the pages of mr soapy sponge and surteess other novels assuredly it was no theme for the great and generous spirit of sir walter the worst kind of manners always prevail among people whom moderns call the secondrate smart and these are drawn in st ronans well but we may believe that even there manners are no longer quite so hideous as in the little tweedside wateringplace the extinction of duelling has destroyed or nearly destroyed the swaggering style of truculence people could not behave as mowbray and sir bingo behave to tyrrel in the afterdinner scene the man of peace the great macturk with his harangues translated from the language of ossian is no longer needed and no longer possible supposing manners to be correctly described in st ronans the pessimist himself must admit that manners have improved but it is not without regret that we see a genius born for chivalry labouring in this unworthy and alien matter  the english critics delighted to accuse scott of having committed literary suicide he had only stepped off the path to which he presently returned he was unfitted to write the domestic novel and even in st ronans he introduces events of romantic improbability these enable him to depict scenes of the most passionate tragedy as in the meeting of clara and tyrrel they who have loved so blindly and so kindly should never have met or never parted it is like a tragic rendering of the scene where diana vernon and osbaldistone encounter each other on the moonlit moor the wild words of clara is it so and was it even yourself whom i saw even now and all things considered i do carry on the farce of life wonderfully wellall this passage with the silence of the man is on the highest level of poetic invention and clara ranks with ophelia to her strain of madness we may ascribe perhaps what sydney smith calls the vulgarity of her lighter moments but here the genius of shakspeare is faultless where scotts is most faulty and most mistaken  much confusion is caused in st ronans well by scotts concession to the delicacy of james ballantyne what has shaken claras brain not her sham marriage for that was innocent and might be legally annulled lockhart writes vii 208 sir walter had shown a remarkable degree of goodnature in the composition of this novel when the end came in view james ballantyne suddenly took vast alarm about a particular feature in the heroines history in the original conception and in the book as actually written and printed miss mowbrays mock marriage had not halted at the profane ceremony of the church and the delicate printer shrank from the idea of obtruding on the fastidious public the possibility of any personal contamination having occurred to a highborn damsel of the nineteenth century scott answered you would never have quarrelled with it had the thing happened to a girl in ginghamthe silk petticoat can make little difference james reclaimed with double energy and called constable to the rescue and after some pause the author very reluctantly consented to cancel and rewrite about twentyfour pages which was enough to obliterate to a certain extent the dreaded scandaland in a similar degree as he always persisted to perplex and weaken the course of his narrative and the dark effect of its catastrophe  from a communication printed in the athen√¶um of feb 4 1893 extracts from the original proofsheets it seems that lockhart forgot the original plan of the novel the mock marriage did halt at the church door but claras virtue had yielded to her real lover tyrrel before the ceremony hannah irwin had deliberately made opportunities for the lovers meeting and at last as she says in a cancelled passage the devil and hannah irwin prevailed there followed remorse and a determination not to meet again before the church made them one and on the head of this the mock marriage shook claras reason this was the original plan it declares itself in the scene between tyrrel and clara vol i chap ix wherefore should not sorrow be the end of sin and folly the reviewer in the monthly review 1824 says there is a hint of some deeper cause of grief see the confession to the brother but it is highly problematical for all this the delicacy of james ballantyne is to blamehis delicacy and scotts concessions to a respectable man and a bad critic  the origin of st ronans well has been described by lockhart in a familiar passage as laidlaw scott and lockhart were riding along the brow of the triplepeaked eildon hills scott mentioned the row that was going on in paris about quentin durward i cant but think i could make better play still with something german he said laidlaw grumbled at this you are always best like helen macgregor when your foot is on your native heath and i have often thought that if you were to write a novel and lay the scene here in the very year you were writing it you would exceed yourself hames hame quoth scott smiling be it ever sae hamely and laidlaw bade him stick to melrose in 1823 it was now that scott spoke of the village tragedy the romance of every house of every cottage and told a tale of some horrors in the hamlet that lies beyond melrose on the north side of tweed laidlaw and lockhart believed that this conversation suggested st ronans well the scene of which has been claimed as their own by the people of innerleithen this little town is beautifully situated where the hills of tweed are steepest and least resemble the bosses verd√¢tres of prosper m√©rim√©e it is now a manufacturing town like its neighbours and contributes its quota to the pollution of the glittering and resolute streams of tweed the pilgrim will scarce rival tyrrels feat of catching a cleanrun salmon in summer but the scenes are extremely pleasing and indeed from this point to dryburgh the beautiful and fabled river is at its loveliest it is possible that a little inn farther up the water the crook on the border of the moorland and near tala linn where the covenanters held a famous assembly may have suggested the name of the cleikum lockhart describes the prosperity which soon flowed into innerleithen and the st ronans games at which the ettrick shepherd presided gleefully they are still held or were held very lately but there will never come again such another shepherd or such contests with the flying tailor of ettrick  apart from the tragedy of clara doubtless the better parts of st ronans well are the scotch characters even our generation remembers many a meg dods and he who writes has vividly in his recollection just such tartness such goodness of heart such ungoverned eloquence and vigour of rebuke as made meg famous successful on the stage and welcome to her countrymen these people mrs blower and meg are shakspearean they live with dame quickly and shallow in the hearts of scots but to the english general they are possibly caviare in the gallant and irascible macturk we have the waning highlander he resembles the captain of knockdunder in the heart of mid lothian or an exaggerated and illeducated hector of the antiquary concerning the women of the tale it may be said that lady binks has great qualities and appears to have been drawn with an eye on the object as wordsworth says and from the life lady penelope seems more exaggerated now than she probably did at the time for the fashion of affectation changes the winterblossoms and quacklebens are accurate enough in themselves but are seen through a blackwoodian atmosphere as it were through a mist of the temporary and boisterous scotch humour of the day the author occasionally stoops to a pun and like that which hood made in the hearing of thackeray the pun is not good indeed the novel in its view of the decay of the border the ruined laird the frivolous foolish society of the well taking the place of sturdy william of deloraine and farmers like scotts grandfather makes a picture of decadence as melancholy as redgauntlet not here o apollo are haunts meet for thee strangely enough among the features of the time scott mentions reckless borrowings accommodation banks of air his own business was based on a bank of air windcapital as cadell constables partner calls it and the bubble was just about to burst though scott had no apprehension of financial ruin a horrid power is visible in scotts second picture of la mauvaise pauvre the hag who despises and curses the givers of handfuls of coals and of rice his first he drew in the witches of the bride of lammermoor he has himself indicated his desire to press hard on the vice of gambling as in the fortunes of nigel ruinous at all times and in every shape gambling in scotts lifetime during the regency had crippled or destroyed many an historical scottish family with this in his mind he drew the portrait of mowbray of st ronans his picture of duelling is not more seductive he himself had lost his friend sir alexander boswell in a duel on other occasions this institution had brought discomfort into his life and though he was ready to fight general gourgaud with napoleons pistols he cannot have approved of the practices of the macturks and bingo binkses a maniac as his correspondence shows challenged sir walter insisting that he was pointed at and ridiculed in the character of macturk abbotsford mss it is interesting to have the picture of contemporary manners from scotts handmeg dods remains among his immortal portraits but a novel in which the absurd will of fiction and the conventional nabob are necessary machinery can never be ranked so high as even the monastery and peveril in scotland however it was infinitely more successful than its admirable successor redgauntlet  andrew lang december 1893     introduction  to  st ronans well   the novel which follows is upon a plan different from any other that the author has ever written although it is perhaps the most legitimate which relates to this kind of light literature  it is intended in a wordcelebrare domestica factato give an imitation of the shifting manners of our own time and paint scenes the originals of which are daily passing round us so that a minutes observation may compare the copies with the originals it must be confessed that this style of composition was adopted by the author rather from the tempting circumstance of its offering some novelty in his compositions and avoiding wornout characters and positions than from the hope of rivalling the many formidable competitors who have already won deserved honours in this department the ladies in particular gifted by nature with keen powers of observation and light satire have been so distinguished by these works of talent that reckoning from the authoress of evelina to her of marriage a catalogue might be made including the brilliant and talented names of edgeworth austin charlotte smith and others whose success seems to have appropriated this province of the novel as exclusively their own it was therefore with a sense of temerity that the author intruded upon a species of composition which had been of late practised with such distinguished success this consciousness was lost however under the necessity of seeking for novelty without which it was much to be apprehended such repeated incursions on his part would nauseate the long indulgent public at the last  the scene chosen for the authors little drama of modern life was a mineral spring such as are to be found in both divisions of britain and which are supplied with the usual materials for redeeming health or driving away care the invalid often finds relief from his complaints less from the healing virtues of the spa itself than because his system of ordinary life undergoes an entire change in his being removed from his ledger and accountbooksfrom his legal folios and progresses of titledeedsfrom his counters and shelvesfrom whatever else forms the main source of his constant anxiety at home destroys his appetite mars the custom of his exercise deranges the digestive powers and clogs up the springs of life thither too comes the saunterer anxious to get rid of that wearisome attendant himself and thither come both males and females who upon a different principle desire to make themselves double  the society of such places is regulated by their very nature upon a scheme much more indulgent than that which rules the world of fashion and the narrow circles of rank in the metropolis the titles of rank birth and fortune are received at a wateringplace without any very strict investigation as adequate to the purpose for which they are preferred and as the situation infers a certain degree of intimacy and sociability for the time so to whatever heights it may have been carried it is not understood to imply any duration beyond the length of the season no intimacy can be supposed more close for the time and more transitory in its endurance than that which is attached to a wateringplace acquaintance the novelist therefore who fixes upon such a scene for his tale endeavours to display a species of society where the strongest contrast of humorous characters and manners may be brought to bear on and illustrate each other with less violation of probability than could be supposed to attend the same miscellaneous assemblage in any other situation  in such scenes too are frequently mingled characters not merely ridiculous but dangerous and hateful the unprincipled gamester the heartless fortunehunter all those who eke out their means of subsistence by pandering to the vices and follies of the rich and gay who drive by their various arts foibles into crimes and imprudence into acts of ruinous madness are to be found where their victims naturally resort with the same certainty that eagles are gathered together at the place of slaughter by this the author takes a great advantage for the management of his story particularly in its darker and more melancholy passages the impostor the gambler all who live loose upon the skirts of society or like vermin thrive by its corruptions are to be found at such retreats when they easily and as a matter of course mingle with those dupes who might otherwise have escaped their snares but besides those characters who are actually dangerous to society a wellfrequented wateringplace generally exhibits for the amusement of the company and the perplexity and amazement of the more inexperienced a sprinkling of persons called by the newspapers eccentric charactersindividuals namely who either from some real derangement of their understanding or much more frequently from an excess of vanity are ambitious of distinguishing themselves by some striking peculiarity in dress or address conversation or manners and perhaps in all these affectations are usually adopted like drawcansirs extravagances to show they dare and i must needs say those who profess them are more frequently to be found among the english than among the natives of either of the other two divisions of the united kingdoms the reason probably is that the consciousness of wealth and a sturdy feeling of independence which generally pervade the english nation are in a few individuals perverted into absurdity or at least peculiarity the witty irishman on the contrary adapts his general behaviour to that of the best society or that which he thinks such nor is it any part of the shrewd scots national character unnecessarily to draw upon himself public attention these rules however are not without their exceptions for we find men of every country playing the eccentric at these independent resorts of the gay and the wealthy where every one enjoys the license of doing what is good in his own eyes  it scarce needed these obvious remarks to justify a novelists choice of a wateringplace as the scene of a fictitious narrative unquestionably it affords every variety of character mixed together in a manner which cannot without a breach of probability be supposed to exist elsewhere neither can it be denied that in the concourse which such miscellaneous collections of persons afford events extremely different from those of the quiet routine of ordinary life may and often do take place  it is not however sufficient that a mine be in itself rich and easily accessible it is necessary that the engineer who explores it should himself in mining phrase have an accurate knowledge of the country and possess the skill necessary to work it to advantage in this respect the author of saint ronans well could not be termed fortunate his habits of life had not led him much of late years at least into its general or bustling scenes nor had he mingled often in the society which enables the observer to shoot folly as it flies the consequence perhaps was that the characters wanted that force and precision which can only be given by a writer who is familiarly acquainted with his subject the author however had the satisfaction to chronicle his testimony against the practice of gambling a vice which the devil has contrived to render all his own since it is deprived of whatever pleads an apology for other vices and is founded entirely on the coldblooded calculation of the most exclusive selfishness the character of the traveller meddling selfimportant and what the ladies call fussing but yet generous and benevolent in his purposes was partly taken from nature the story being entirely modern cannot require much explanation after what has been here given either in the shape of notes or a more prolix introduction  it may be remarked that the english critics in many instances though none of great influence pursued saint ronans well with hue and cry many of the fraternity giving it as their opinion that the author had exhausted himself or as the technical phrase expresses it written himself out and as an unusual tract of success too often provokes many persons to mark and exaggerate a slip when it does occur the author was publicly accused in prose and verse of having committed a literary suicide in this unhappy attempt the voices therefore were for a time against saint ronans on the southern side of the tweed  in the authors own country it was otherwise many of the characters were recognised as genuine scottish portraits and the good fortune which had hitherto attended the productions of the author of waverley did not desert notwithstanding the ominous vaticinations of its censurers this new attempt although out of his ordinary style  1st february 1832     st ronans well     chapter i  an oldworld landlady      but to make up my tale     she breweth good ale     and thereof maketh sale  skelton   although few if any of the countries of europe have increased so rapidly in wealth and cultivation as scotland during the last half century sultan mahmouds owls might nevertheless have found in caledonia at any term within that flourishing period their dowery of ruined villages accident or local advantages have in many instances transferred the inhabitants of ancient hamlets from the situations which their predecessors chose with more respect to security than convenience to those in which their increasing industry and commerce could more easily expand itself and hence places which stand distinguished in scottish history and which figure in david mphersons excellent historical mapiai1 can now only be discerned from the wild moor by the verdure which clothes their site or at best by a few scattered ruins resembling pinfolds which mark the spot of their former existence  the little village of st ronans though it had not yet fallen into the state of entire oblivion we have described was about twenty years since fast verging towards it the situation had something in it so romantic that it provoked the pencil of every passing tourist and we will endeavour therefore to describe it in language which can scarcely be less intelligible than some of their sketches avoiding however for reasons which seem to us of weight to give any more exact indication of the site than that it is on the southern side of the forth and not above thirty miles distant from the english frontier  a river of considerable magnitude pours its streams through a narrow vale varying in breadth from two miles to a fourth of that distance and which being composed of rich alluvial soil is and has long been enclosed tolerably well inhabited and cultivated with all the skill of scottish agriculture either side of this valley is bounded by a chain of hills which on the right in particular may be almost termed mountains little brooks arising in these ridges and finding their way to the river offer each its own little vale to the industry of the cultivator some of them bear fine large trees which have as yet escaped the axe and upon the sides of most there are scattered patches and fringes of natural copsewood above and around which the banks of the stream arise somewhat desolate in the colder months but in summer glowing with dark purple heath or with the golden lustre of the broom and gorse this is a sort of scenery peculiar to those countries which abound like scotland in hills and in streams and where the traveller is ever and anon discovering in some intricate and unexpected recess a simple and silvan beauty which pleases him the more that it seems to be peculiarly his own property as the first discoverer  in one of these recesses and so near its opening as to command the prospect of the river the broader valley and the opposite chain of hills stood and unless neglect and desertion have completed their work still stands the ancient and decayed village of st ronans the site was singularly picturesque as the straggling street of the village ran up a very steep hill on the side of which were clustered as it were upon little terraces the cottages which composed the place seeming as in the swiss towns on the alps to rise above each other towards the ruins of an old castle which continued to occupy the crest of the eminence and the strength of which had doubtless led the neighbourhood to assemble under its walls for protection it must indeed have been a place of formidable defence for on the side opposite to the town its walls rose straight up from the verge of a tremendous and rocky precipice whose base was washed by saint ronans burn as the brook was entitled on the southern side where the declivity was less precipitous the ground had been carefully levelled into successive terraces which ascended to the summit of the hill and were or rather had been connected by staircases of stone rudely ornamented in peaceful periods these terraces had been occupied by the gardens of the castle and in times of siege they added to its security for each commanded the one immediately below it so that they could be separately and successively defended and all were exposed to the fire from the place itselfa massive square tower of the largest size surrounded as usual by lower buildings and a high embattled wall on the northern side arose a considerable mountain of which the descent that lay between the eminence on which the castle was situated seemed a detached portion and which had been improved and deepened by three successive huge trenches another very deep trench was drawn in front of the main entrance from the east where the principal gateway formed the termination of the street which as we have noticed ascended from the village and this last defence completed the fortifications of the tower  in the ancient gardens of the castle and upon all sides of it excepting the western which was precipitous large old trees had found root mantling the rock and the ancient and ruinous walls with their dusky verdure and increasing the effect of the shattered pile which towered up from the centre  seated on the threshold of this ancient pile where the proud porter had in former days reard himselfi2 a stranger had a complete and commanding view of the decayed village the houses of which to a fanciful imagination might seem as if they had been suddenly arrested in hurrying down the precipitous hill and fixed as if by magic in the whimsical arrangement which they now presented it was like a sudden pause in one of amphions countrydances when the huts which were to form the future thebes were jigging it to his lute but with such an observer the melancholy excited by the desolate appearance of the village soon overcame all the lighter frolics of the imagination originally constructed on the humble plan used in the building of scotch cottages about a century ago the greater part of them had been long deserted and their fallen roofs blackened gables and ruinous walls showed desolations triumph over poverty on some huts the rafters varnished with soot were still standing in whole or in part like skeletons and a few wholly or partially covered with thatch seemed still inhabited though scarce habitable for the smoke of the peatfires which prepared the humble meal of the indwellers stole upwards not only from the chimneys its regular vent but from various other crevices in the roofs nature in the meanwhile always changing but renewing as she changes was supplying by the power of vegetation the fallen and decaying marks of human labour small pollards which had been formerly planted around the little gardens had now waxed into huge and high forest trees the fruittrees had extended their branches over the verges of the little yards and the hedges had shot up into huge and irregular bushes while quantities of dock and nettles and hemlock hiding the ruined walls were busily converting the whole scene of desolation into a picturesque forestbank  two houses in st ronans were still in something like decent repair places essentialthe one to the spiritual weal of the inhabitants the other to the accommodation of travellers these were the clergymans manse and the village inn of the former we need only say that it formed no exception to the general rule by which the landed proprietors of scotland seem to proceed in lodging their clergy not only in the cheapest but in the ugliest and most inconvenient house which the genius of masonry can contrive it had the usual number of chimneystwo namelyrising like asses ears at either end which answered the purpose for which they were designed as ill as usual it had all the ordinary leaks and inlets to the fury of the elements which usually form the subject of the complaints of a scottish incumbent to his brethren of the presbytery and to complete the picture the clergyman being a bachelor the pigs had unmolested admission to the garden and courtyard broken windows were repaired with brown paper and the disordered and squalid appearance of a low farmhouse occupied by a bankrupt tenant dishonoured the dwelling of one who besides his clerical character was a scholar and a gentleman though a little of a humourist  beside the manse stood the kirk of st ronans a little old mansion with a clay floor and an assemblage of wretched pews originally of carved oak but heedfully clouted with white firdeal but the external form of the church was elegant in the outline having been built in catholic times when we cannot deny to the forms of ecclesiastical architecture that grace which as good protestants we refuse to their doctrine the fabric hardly raised its grey and vaulted roof among the crumbling hills of mortality by which it was surrounded and was indeed so small in size and so much lowered in height by the graves on the outside which ascended half way up the low saxon windows that it might itself have appeared only a funeral vault or mausoleum of larger size its little square tower with the ancient belfry alone distinguished it from such a monument but when the greyheaded beadle turned the keys with his shaking hand the antiquary was admitted into an ancient building which from the style of its architecture and some monuments of the mowbrays of st ronans which the old man was accustomed to point out was generally conjectured to be as early as the thirteenth century  these mowbrays of st ronans seem to have been at one time a very powerful family they were allied to and friends of the house of douglas at the time when the overgrown power of that heroic race made the stewarts tremble on the scottish throne it followed that when as our old na√Øf historian expresses it no one dared to strive with a douglas nor yet with a douglass man for if he did he was sure to come by the waur the family of st ronans shared their prosperity and became lords of almost the whole of the rich valley of which their mansion commanded the prospect but upon the turning of the tide in the reign of james ii they became despoiled of the greater part of those fair acquisitions and succeeding events reduced their importance still farther nevertheless they were in the middle of the seventeenth century still a family of considerable note and sir reginald mowbray after the unhappy battle of dunbar distinguished himself by the obstinate defence of the castle against the arms of cromwell who incensed at the opposition which he had unexpectedly encountered in an obscure corner caused the fortress to be dismantled and blown up with gunpowder  after this catastrophe the old castle was abandoned to ruin but sir reginald when like allan ramsays sir william worthy he returned after the revolution built himself a house in the fashion of that later age which he prudently suited in size to the diminished fortunes of his family it was situated about the middle of the village whose vicinity was not in those days judged any inconvenience upon a spot of ground more level than was presented by the rest of the acclivity where as we said before the houses were notched as it were into the side of the steep bank with little more level ground about them than the spot occupied by their site but the lairds house had a court in front and a small garden behind connected with another garden which occupying three terraces descended in emulation of the orchards of the old castle almost to the banks of the stream  the family continued to inhabit this new messuage until about fifty years before the commencement of our history when it was much damaged by a casual fire and the laird of the day having just succeeded to a more pleasant and commodious dwelling at the distance of about three miles from the village determined to abandon the habitation of his ancestors as he cut down at the same time an ancient rookery perhaps to defray the expenses of the migration it became a common remark among the country folk that the decay of st ronans began when laird lawrence and the crows flew off  the deserted mansion however was not consigned to owls and birds of the desert on the contrary for many years it witnessed more fun and festivity than when it had been the sombre abode of a grave scottish baron of auld lang syne in short it was converted into an inn and marked by a huge sign representing on the one side st ronan catching hold of the devils game leg with his episcopal crook as the story may be read in his veracious legend and on the other the mowbray arms it was by far the best frequented publichouse in that vicinity and a thousand stories were told of the revels which had been held within its walls and the gambols achieved under the influence of its liquors all this however had long since passed away according to the lines in my frontispiece      a merry place twas said in days of yore     but something aild it nowthe place was cursed  the worthy couple servants and favourites of the mowbray family who first kept the inn had died reasonably wealthy after long carrying on a flourishing trade leaving behind them an only daughter they had acquired by degrees not only the property of the inn itself of which they were originally tenants but of some remarkably good meadowland by the side of the brook which when touched by a little pecuniary necessity the lairds of st ronans had disposed of piecemeal as the readiest way to portion off a daughter procure a commission for the younger son and the like emergencies so that meg dods when she succeeded to her parents was a considerable heiress and as such had the honour of refusing three toppingfarmers two bonnetlairds and a horsecouper who successively made proposals to her  many bets were laid on the horsecoupers success but the knowing ones were taken in determined to ride the forehorse herself meg would admit no helpmate who might soon assert the rights of a master and so in single blessedness and with the despotism of queen bess herself she ruled all matters with a high hand not only over her menservants and maidservants but over the stranger within her gates who if he ventured to oppose megs sovereign will and pleasure or desire to have either fare or accommodation different from that which she chose to provide for him was instantly ejected with that answer which erasmus tells us silenced all complaints in the german inns of his time qu√¶re aliud hospitiumi3 or as meg expressed it troop aff wi ye to another public as this amounted to a banishment in extent equal to sixteen miles from megs residence the unhappy party on whom it was passed had no other refuge save by deprecating the wrath of his landlady and resigning himself to her will it is but justice to meg dods to state that though hers was a severe and almost despotic government it could not be termed a tyranny since it was exercised upon the whole for the good of the subject  the vaults of the old lairds cellar had not even in his own day been replenished with more excellent wines the only difficulty was to prevail on meg to look for the precise liquor you choseto which it may be added that she often became restiff when she thought a company had had as much as did them good and refused to furnish any more supplies then her kitchen was her pride and glory she looked to the dressing of every dish herself and there were some with which she suffered no one to interfere such were the cockaleeky and the savoury minced collops which rivalled in their way even the veal cutlets of our old friend mrs hall at ferrybridge megs tablelinen bedlinen and so forth were always homemade of the best quality and in the best order and a weary day was that to the chambermaid in which her lynx eye discovered any neglect of the strict cleanliness which she constantly enforced indeed considering megs country and calling we were never able to account for her extreme and scrupulous nicety unless by supposing that it afforded her the most apt and frequent pretext for scolding her maids an exercise in which she displayed so much eloquence and energy that we must needs believe it to have been a favourite onei4  we have only further to commemorate the moderation of megs reckonings which when they closed the banquet often relieved the apprehensions instead of saddening the heart of the rising guest a shilling for breakfast three shillings for dinner including a pint of old port eighteenpence for a snug suppersuch were the charges of the inn of st ronans under this landlady of the olden world even after the nineteenth century had commenced and they were ever tendered with the pious recollection that her good father never charged half so much but these weary times rendered it impossible for her to make the lawing lessi5  notwithstanding all these excellent and rare properties the inn at saint ronans shared the decay of the village to which it belonged this was owing to various circumstances the highroad had been turned aside from the place the steepness of the street being murder so the postilions declared to their posthorses it was thought that megs stern refusal to treat them with liquor or to connive at their exchanging for porter and whisky the corn which should feed their cattle had no small influence on the opinion of those respectable gentlemen and that a little cutting and levelling would have made the ascent easy enough but let that pass this alteration of the highway was an injury which meg did not easily forgive to the country gentlemen most of whom she had recollected when children their fathers she said wad not have done the like of it to a lone woman then the decay of the village itself which had formerly contained a set of feuars and bonnetlairds who under the name of the chirupping club contrived to drink twopenny qualified with brandy or whisky at least twice or thrice aweek was some small loss  the temper and manners of the landlady scared away all customers of that numerous class who will not allow originality to be an excuse for the breach of decorum and who little accustomed perhaps to attendance at home loved to play the great man at an inn and to have a certain number of bows deferential speeches and apologies in answer to the gd dn yes which they bestow on the house attendance and entertainment unto those who commenced this sort of barter in the clachan of saint ronans well could meg dods pay it back in their own coin and glad they were to escape from the house with eyes not quite scratched out and ears not more deafened than if they had been within hearing of a pitched battle  nature had formed honest meg for such encounters and as her noble soul delighted in them so her outward properties were in what tony lumpkin calls a concatenation accordingly she had hair of a brindled colour betwixt black and grey which was apt to escape in elflocks from under her mutch when she was thrown into violent agitationlong skinny hands terminated by stout talonsgrey eyes thin lips a robust person a broad though flat chest capital wind and a voice that could match a choir of fishwomen she was accustomed to say of herself in her more gentle moods that her bark was worse than her bite but what teeth could have matched a tongue which when in full career is vouched to have been heard from the kirk to the castle of saint ronans  these notable gifts however had no charms for the travellers of these light and giddypaced times and megs inn became less and less frequented what carried the evil to the uttermost was that a fanciful lady of rank in the neighbourhood chanced to recover of some imaginary complaint by the use of a mineral well about a mile and a half from the village a fashionable doctor was found to write an analysis of the healing waters with a list of sundry cures a speculative builder took land in feu and erected lodginghouses shops and even streets at length a tontine subscription was obtained to erect an inn which for the more grace was called a hotel and so the desertion of meg dods became generali6  she had still however her friends and wellwishers many of whom thought that as she was a lone woman and known to be well to pass in the world she would act wisely to retire from public life and take down a sign which had no longer fascination for guests but megs spirit scorned submission direct or implied her fathers door she said should be open to the road till her fathers bairn should be streekit and carried out at it with her feet foremost it was not for the profitthere was little profit at itprofitthere was a dead loss but she wad not be dung by any of them they maun hae a hottlei7 maun theyand an honest public canna serve them they may hottle that likes but they shall see that lucky dods can hottle on as lang as the best of themay though they had made a tamteen of it and linkit aw their breaths of lives whilk are in their nostrils on end of ilk other like a string of wildgeese and the langest liver bruick a whilk was sinful presumption she would match ilk ane of them as lang as her ain wind held out fortunate it was for meg since she had formed this doughty resolution that although her inn had decayed in custom her land had risen in value in a degree which more than compensated the balance on the wrong side of her books and joined to her usual providence and economy enabled her to act up to her lofty purpose  she prosecuted her trade too with every attention to its diminished income shut up the windows of one half of her house to baffle the taxgatherer retrenched her furniture discharged her pair of posthorses and pensioned off the old humpbacked postilion who drove them retaining his services however as an assistant to a still more aged hostler to console herself for restrictions by which her pride was secretly wounded she agreed with the celebrated dick tinto to repaint her fathers sign which had become rather undecipherable and dick accordingly gilded the bishops crook and augmented the horrors of the devils aspect until it became a terror to all the younger fry of the schoolhouse and a sort of visible illustration of the terrors of the archenemy with which the minister endeavoured to impress their infant minds  under this renewed symbol of her profession meg dods or meg dorts as she was popularly termed on account of her refractory humours was still patronised by some steady customers such were the members of the killnakelty hunt once famous on the turf and in the field but now a set of venerable greyheaded sportsmen who had sunk from foxhounds to basketbeagles and coursing and who made an easy canter on their quiet nags a gentle induction to a dinner at megs a set of honest decent men they were meg said had their sang and their jokeand what for no their bind was just a scots pint overhead and a tappithen to the bill and no man ever saw them the waur ot it was thae cocklebrained callants of the present day that would be mair owertaen with a puir quart than douce folk were with a magnum  then there was a set of ancient brethren of the angle from edinburgh who visited saint ronans frequently in the spring and summer a class of guests peculiarly acceptable to meg who permitted them more latitude in her premises than she was known to allow to any other body they were she said pawky auld carles that kend whilk side their bread was buttered upon ye never kend of ony o them ganging to the spring as they behoved to ca the stinking well yonderna nathey were up in the morninghad their parritch wi maybe a thimblefull of brandy and then awa up into the hills eat their bit cauld meat on the heather and came hame at een with the creel full of caller trouts and had them to their dinner and their quiet cogue of ale and their drap punch and were set singing their catches and glees as they cad them till ten oclock and then to bed wi god bless yeand what for no  thirdly we may commemorate some ranting blades who also came from the metropolis to visit saint ronans attracted by the humours of meg and still more by the excellence of her liquor and the cheapness of her reckonings these were members of the helter skelter club of the wildfire club and other associations formed for the express purpose of getting rid of care and sobriety such dashers occasioned many a racket in megs house and many a bourasque in megs temper various were the arts of flattery and violence by which they endeavoured to get supplies of liquor when megs conscience told her they had had too much already sometimes they failed as when the croupier of the helter skelter got himself scalded with the mulled wine in an unsuccessful attempt to coax this formidable virago by a salute and the excellent president of the wildfire received a broken head from the keys of the cellar as he endeavoured to possess himself of these emblems of authority but little did these dauntless officials care for the exuberant frolics of megs temper which were to them only pretty fannys waythe dulces amaryllidis ir√¶ and meg on her part though she often called them drunken neerdoweels and thoroughbred highstreet blackguards allowed no other person to speak ill of them in her hearing they were daft callants she said and that was allwhen the drink was in the wit was outye could not put an auld head upon young shouthersa young cowt will canter be it uphill or downand what for no was her uniform conclusion  nor must we omit among megs steady customers faithful amongst the unfaithful found the coppernosed sheriffclerk of the county who when summoned by official duty to that district of the shire warmed by recollections of her doublebrewed ale and her generous antigua always advertised that his prieves or comptis or whatever other business was in hand were to proceed on such a day and hour within the house of margaret dods vintner in saint ronans  we have only farther to notice megs mode of conducting herself towards chance travellers who knowing nothing of nearer or more fashionable accommodations or perhaps consulting rather the state of their purse than of their taste stumbled upon her house of entertainment her reception of these was as precarious as the hospitality of a savage nation to sailors shipwrecked on their coast if the guests seemed to have made her mansion their free choiceor if she liked their appearance and her taste was very capriciousabove all if they seemed pleased with what they got and little disposed to criticise or give trouble it was all very well but if they had come to saint ronans because the house at the well was fullor if she disliked what the sailor calls the cut of their jibor if above all they were critical about their accommodations none so likely as meg to give them what in her country is called a sloan in fact she reckoned such persons a part of that ungenerous and ungrateful public for whose sake she was keeping her house open at a dead loss and who had left her as it were a victim to her patriotic zeal  hence arose the different reports concerning the little inn of saint ronans which some favoured travellers praised as the neatest and most comfortable oldfashioned house in scotland where you had good attendance and good cheer at moderate rates while others less fortunate could only talk of the darkness of the rooms the homeliness of the old furniture and the detestable bad humour of meg dods the landlady  reader if you come from the more sunny side of the tweedor even if being a scot you have had the advantage to be born within the last twentyfive years you may be induced to think this portrait of queen elizabeth in dame quicklys piqued hat and green apron somewhat overcharged in the features but i appeal to my own contemporaries who have known wheelroad bridleway and footpath for thirty years whether they do not every one of them remember meg dodsor somebody very like her indeed so much is this the case that about the period i mention i should have been afraid to have rambled from the scottish metropolis in almost any direction lest i had lighted upon some one of the sisterhood of dame quickly who might suspect me of having showed her up to the public in the character of meg dods at present though it is possible that some one or two of this peculiar class of wildcats may still exist their talons must be much impaired by age and i think they can do little more than sit like the giant pope in the pilgrims progress at the door of their unfrequented caverns and grin at the pilgrims over whom they used formerly to execute their despotism  footnotes  i1 see editors notes at the end of the volume wherever a similar reference occurs the reader will understand that the same direction applies  i2 see the old ballad of king estmere in percys reliques  i3 in a colloquy of erasmus called diversaria there is a very unsavoury description of a german inn of the period where an objection of the guest is answered in the manner expressed in the texta great sign of want of competition on the road  i4 this circumstance shows of itself that the meg dods of the tale cannot be identified with her namesake jenny dods who kept the inn at howgateib on the peebles road for jenny far different from our heroine was unmatched as a slattern  i5 this was universally the case in scotland forty or fifty years ago and so little was charged for a domestics living when the author became first acquainted with the road that a shilling or eighteenpence was sufficient board wages for a manservant when a crown would not now answer the purpose it is true the cause of these reasonable charges rested upon a principle equally unjust to the landlord and inconvenient to the guest the landlord did not expect to make any thing upon the charge for eating which his bill contained in consideration of which the guest was expected to drink more wine than might be convenient or agreeable to him for the good as it was called of the house the landlord indeed was willing and ready to assist in this duty every stranger who came within his gates other things were in proportion a charge for lodging fire and candle was long a thing unheard of in scotland a shilling to the housemaid settled all such considerations i see from memorandums of 1790 that a young man with two ponies and a servinglad might travel from the house of one meg dods to another through most parts of scotland for about five or six shillings aday  i6 note ibuildingfeus in scotland  i7 this gallic word h√¥tel was first introduced in scotland during the authors childhood and was so pronounced by the lower class     chapter ii

that a solitary traveller rode under the oldfashioned archway and alighted in the courtyard of meg dodss inn and delivered the bridle of his horse to the humpbacked postilion bring my saddlebags he said into the houseor stayi am abler i think to carry them than you he then assisted the poor meagre groom to unbuckle the straps which secured the humble and now despised convenience and meantime gave strict charges that his horse should be unbridled and put into a clean and comfortable stall the girths slacked and a cloth cast over his loins but that the saddle should not be removed until he himself came to see him dressed  the companion of his travels seemed in the hostlers eye deserving of his care being a strong active horse fit either for the road or field but rather high in bone from a long journey though from the state of his skin it appeared the utmost care had been bestowed to keep him in condition while the groom obeyed the strangers directions the latter with the saddlebags laid over his arm entered the kitchen of the inn  here he found the landlady herself in none of her most blessed humours the cookmaid was abroad on some errand and meg in a close review of the kitchen apparatus was making the unpleasant discovery that trenchers had been broken or cracked pots and saucepans not so accurately scoured as her precise notions of cleanliness required which joined to other detections of a more petty description stirred her bile in no small degree so that while she disarranged and arranged the bink she maundered in an under tone complaints and menaces against the absent delinquent  the entrance of a guest did not induce her to suspend this agreeable amusementshe just glanced at him as he entered then turned her back short on him and continued her labour and her soliloquy of lamentation truth is she thought she recognised in the person of the stranger one of those useful envoys of the commercial community called by themselves and the waiters travellers par excellenceby others riders and bagmen now against this class of customers meg had peculiar prejudices because there being no shops in the old village of saint ronans the said commercial emissaries for the convenience of their traffic always took up their abode at the new inn or hotel in the rising and rival village called saint ronans well unless when some straggler by chance or dire necessity was compelled to lodge himself at the auld town as the place of megs residence began to be generally termed she had therefore no sooner formed the hasty conclusion that the individual in question belonged to this obnoxious class than she resumed her former occupation and continued to soliloquize and apostrophize her absent handmaidens without even appearing sensible of his presence  the huzzy

noand wha are ye that speers said meg in the same breath and began to rub a brass candlestick with more vehemence than beforethe dry tone in which she spoke indicating plainly how little concern she took in the conversation  a traveller good mistress dods who comes to take up his lodgings here for a day or two  i am thinking ye will be mistaen said meg theres nae room for bags or jaugs hereyeve

the guest if you had sent there for my letter you would have learned  im no wanting to learn ony thing at my years said meg if folk have ony thing to write to me about they may gie the letter to john

character of the postmistress the stranger assured her he had sent his fishingrod and trunk to her confidential friend the carrier and that he sincerely hoped she would not turn an old acquaintance out of her premises especially as he believed he could not sleep in a bed within five miles of saint ronans if he knew that her blue room was unengaged  fishingrodauld acquaintanceblue room echoed meg

travellers room as they behove to call it as if it were fu of drunken young lairds  that is because they have not you to keep good order among them mistress margaret  ay lad replied meg ye are a fine blawinmylug to think to cuittle me off sae cleverly and facing about upon her guest she honoured him with a more close and curious investigation than she had at first designed to bestow upon him  all that she remarked was in her opinion rather favourable to the stranger he was a wellmade man rather above than under the middle size and apparently betwixt fiveandtwenty and thirty years of agefor although he might at first glance have passed for one who had attained the latter period yet on a nearer examination it seemed as if the burning sun of a warmer climate than scotland and perhaps some fatigue both of body and mind had imprinted the marks of care and of manhood upon his countenance without abiding the course of years his eyes and teeth were excellent and his other features though they could scarce be termed handsome expressed sense and acuteness he bore in his aspect that ease and composure of manner equally void of awkwardness and affectation which is said emphatically to mark the gentleman and although neither the plainness of his dress nor the total want of the usual attendants allowed meg to suppose him a wealthy man she had little doubt that he was above the rank of her lodgers in general amidst these observations and while she was in the course of making them the good landlady was embarrassed with various obscure recollections of having seen the object of them formerly but when or on what occasion she was quite unable to call to remembrance she was particularly puzzled by the cold and sarcastic expression of a countenance which she could not by any means reconcile with the recollections which it awakened at length she said with as much courtesy as she was capable of assumingeither i have seen you before sir or some ane very like yeye ken the blue room too and you a stranger in these parts  not so much a stranger as you may suppose meg said the guest assuming a more intimate tone when i call myself frank tyrrel  tirl exclaimed meg with a tone of wonderits impossible you cannot be francie tirl the wild callant that was fishing and birdnesting here seven or eight years syneit canna befrancie was but a callant  but add seven or eight years to that boys life meg said the stranger gravely and you will find you have the man who is now before you  even sae said meg with a glance at the reflection of her own countenance in the copper coffeepot which she had scoured so brightly that it did the office of a mirrorjust een saebut folk maun grow auld or diebut maister tirl for i mauna ca ye francie now i am thinking  call me what you please good dame said the stranger it has been so long since i heard any one call me by a name that sounded like former kindness that such a one is more agreeable to me than a lords title would be

am to stay and have dinner here  what for no replied mrs dods  and that i am to have the blue room for a night or twoperhaps longer  i dinna ken that said the damethe blue room is the bestand they that get neist best are no ill aff in this warld  arrange it as you will said the stranger i leave the whole matter to you mistressmeantime i will go see after my horse  the merciful man said meg when her guest had left the kitchen is merciful to his beasthe had aye something about him by ordinar that callantbut eh sirs there is a sair change on his cheekhaffit since i saw him lasthe sall no want a good dinner for auld lang syne that ise engage for  meg set about the necessary preparations with all the natural energy of her disposition which was so much exerted upon her culinary cares that her two maids on their return to the house escaped the bitter reprimand which she had been previously conning over in reward for their alleged slatternly negligence nay so far did she carry her complaisance that when tyrrel crossed the kitchen to recover his saddlebags she formally rebuked eppie for an idle taupie for not carrying the gentlemans things to his room  i thank you mistress said tyrrel but i have some drawings and colours in these saddlebags and i always like to carry them myself  ay and are you at the painting trade yet said meg an unco slaister ye used to make with it lang syne  i cannot live without it said tyrrel and taking the saddlebags was formally inducted by the maid into a snug apartment where he soon had the satisfaction to behold a capital dish of minced collops with vegetables and a jug of excellent ale placed on the table by the careful hand of meg herself he could do no less in acknowledgment of the honour than ask meg for a bottle of the yellow seal if there was any of that excellent claret still left  leftay is there walth of it said meg i dinna gie it to every bodyah maister tirl ye have not got ower your auld tricksi am sure if ye are painting for your leeving as you say a little rum and water would come cheaper and do ye as much good but ye maun hae your ain way the day nae doubt if ye should never have it again  away trudged meg her keys clattering as she went and after much rummaging returned with such a bottle of claret as no fashionable tavern could have produced were it called for by a duke or at a dukes price and she seemed not a little gratified when her guest assured her that he had not yet forgotten its excellent flavour she retired after these acts of hospitality and left the stranger to enjoy in quiet the excellent matters which she had placed before him  but there was that on tyrrels mind which defied the enlivening power of good cheer and of wine which only maketh mans heart glad when that heart has no secret oppression to counteract its influence tyrrel found himself on a spot which he had loved in that delightful season when youth and high spirits awaken all those flattering promises which are so ill kept to manhood he drew his chair into the embrasure of the oldfashioned window and throwing up the sash to enjoy the fresh air suffered his thoughts to return to former days while his eyes wandered over objects which they had not looked upon for several eventful years he could behold beneath his eye the lower part of the decayed village as its ruins peeped from the umbrageous shelter with which they were shrouded still lower down upon the little holm which formed its churchyard was seen the kirk of saint ronans and looking yet farther towards the junction of saint ronans burn with the river which traversed the larger dale or valley he could see whitened by the western sun the rising houses which were either newly finished or in the act of being built about the medicinal spring  time changes all around us such was the course of natural though trite reflection which flowed upon tyrrels mind wherefore should loves and friendships have a longer date than our dwellings and our monuments as he indulged these sombre recollections his officious landlady disturbed their tenor by her entrance  i was thinking to offer you a dish of tea maister francie just for the sake of auld lang syne and ill gar the quean beenie bring it here and mask it mysellbut ye arena done with your wine yet  i am indeed mrs dods answered tyrrel and i beg you will remove the bottle  remove the bottle and the wine no half drank out said meg displeasure lowering on her brow i hope there is nae fault to be found wi the wine maister tirl  to this answer which was put in a tone resembling defiance tyrrel submissively replied by declaring the claret not only unexceptionable but excellent  and what for dinna ye drink it then said meg sharply folk should never ask for mair liquor than they can make a gude use of maybe ye think we have the fashion of the tabledot as they ca their newfangled ordinary downby yonder where a the bits of vinegar cruets are put awa into an awmry as they tell me and ilk ane wi the bit dribbles of syndings in it and a paper about the neck ot to show which of the customers is aught itthere they stand like doctors drogsand no an honest scottish mutchkin will ane o their viols haud granting it were at the fouest  perhaps said tyrrel willing to indulge the spleen and prejudice of his old acquaintance perhaps the wine is not so good as to make full measure desirable  ye may say that ladand yet them that sell it might afford a gude penniworth for they hae it for the makingmaist feck of it neer saw france or portugal but as i was sayingthis is no ane of their newfangled places where wine is put by for them that canna drink itwhen the corks drawn the bottle maun be drank outand what for nounless it be corkit  i agree entirely meg said her guest but my ride today has somewhat heated meand i think the dish of tea you promise me will do me more good than to finish my bottle  na then the best i can do for you is to put it by to be sauce for the wildduck the morn for i think ye said ye were to bide here for a day or twa  it is my very purpose meg unquestionably replied tyrrel  sae be it then said mrs dods and then the liquors no lostit has been seldom sic claret as that has simmered in a saucepan let me tell you that neighbourand i mind the day when headache or nae headache ye wad hae been at the hinderend of that bottle and maybe anither if ye could have gotten it wiled out of me but then ye had your cousin to help youah he was a blithe bairn that valentine bulmerye were a canty callant too maister francie and muckle ado i had to keep ye baith in order when ye were on the ramble but ye were a thought doucer than valentinebut o he was a bonny laddiewi een like diamonds cheeks like roses a head like a heathertaphe was the first i ever saw wear a crap as they ca it but a body cheats the barber nowand he had a laugh that wad hae raised the deadwhat wi flyting on him and what wi laughing at him there was nae minding ony other body when that valentine was in the houseand how is your cousin valentine bulmer maister francie  tyrrel looked down and only answered with a sigh  ayand is it even sae said meg and has the puir bairn been sae soon removed frae this fashious warldayaywe maun a gang ae gatecrackit quart stoups and geisend barrelsleaky quaighs are we a and canna keep in the liquor of lifeohon sirswas the puir lad bulmer frae bumer bay where they land the hollands think ye maister franciethey whiles rin in a pickle tea there tooi hope that is good that i have made you maister francie  excellent my good dame said tyrrel but it was in a tone of voice which intimated that she had pressed upon a subject that awakened some unpleasant reflections  and when did this puir lad die continued meg who was not without her share of eves qualities and wished to know something concerning what seemed to affect her guest so particularly but he disappointed her purpose and at the same time awakened another train of sentiment in her mind by turning again to the window and looking upon the distant buildings of saint ronans well as if he had observed for the first time these new objects he said to mistress dods in an indifferent tone you have got some gay new neighbours yonder mistress  neighbours said meg her wrath beginning to arise as it always did upon any allusion to this sore subjectye may ca them neighbours if ye likebut the deil flee awa wi the neighbourhood for meg dods  i suppose said tyrrel as if he did not observe her displeasure that yonder is the fox hotel they told me of  the fox said meg i am sure it is the fox that has carried off a my geesei might shut up house maister francie if it was the thing i lived byme that has seen a our gentlefolk bairns and gien them snaps and sugarbiscuit maist of them wi my ain hand they wad hae seen my fathers rooftree fa down and smoor me before they wad hae gien a boddle apiece to have propped it upbut they could a link out their fifty pounds ower head to bigg a hottle at the well yonder and muckle they hae made otthe bankrupt body sandie lawson hasna paid them a bawbee of four terms rent  surely mistress i think if the well became so famous for its cures the least the gentlemen could have done was to make you the priestess  me priestess i am nae quaker i wot maister francie and i never heard of alewife that turned preacher except luckie buchan in the westi8 and if i were to preach i think i have mair the spirit of a scottishwoman than to preach in the very room they hae been dancing in ilka night in the week saturday itsell not excepted and that till twal oclock at night na na maister francie i leave the like o that to mr simon chatterly as they ca the bit prelatical sprig of divinity from the town yonder that plays at cards and dances six days in the week and on the seventh reads the common prayerbook in the ballroom with tam simson the drunken barber for his clerk  i think i have heard of mr chatterly said tyrrel  yell be thinking o the sermon he has printed said the angry dame where he compares their nasty puddle of a well yonder to the pool of bethseda like a foulmouthed fleeching featherheaded fule as he is he should hae kend that the place got a its fame in the times of black popery and though they pat it in st ronans name ill never believe for one that the honest man had ony hand in it for i hae been telld by ane that suld ken that he was nae roman but only a cuddie or culdeeic or such likebut will ye not take anither dish of tea maister francie and a wee bit of the dietloaf raised wi my ain fresh butter maister francie and no wi greasy kitchenfee like the seedcake down at the confectioners yonder that has as mony dead flees as carvy in it set him up for a confectionerwi a penniworth of ryemeal and anither of tryacle and twa or three carvyseeds i will make better confections than ever cam out of his oven  i have no doubt of that mrs dods said the guest and i only wish to know how these new comers were able to establish themselves against a house of such good reputation and old standing as yoursit was the virtues of the mineral i dare say but how came the waters to recover a character all at once mistress  i dinna ken sirthey used to be thought good for naething but here and there for a puir bodys bairn that had gotten the cruellsi9 and could not afford a penniworth of salts but my leddy penelope penfeather had faan ill its like as nae other body ever fell ill and sae she was to be cured some gate naebody was ever cured which was naething mair than was reasonableand my leddy ye ken has wit at wull and has a the wise folk out from edinburgh at her house at windywas yonder which it is her leddyships wull and pleasure to call aircastleand they have a

the laird whose grandfather was my fathers landlord said to the new doings yonderhe just jumped at the ready penny like a cock at a grosert and feud the bonny holm beside the well that they cad the

though it has but little cause to care what comes of him or his  is it the same mr mowbray said mr tyrrel who still holds the estatethe old gentleman you know whom i had some dispute with  about hunting moorfowl upon the springwellhead muirs said meg ah lad honest mr bindloose brought you neatly off therena its no that honest man but his son john mowbraythe tother has slept downby in saint

its a shame her fathers daughter should keep company wi a that scauff and raff of physicstudents and writers prentices and bagmen and siclike trash as are down at the well yonder  you are severe mrs dods replied the guest no doubt miss claras conduct deserves all sort of freedom  i am saying naething against her conduct said the dame and theres nae ground to say onything that i ken ofbut i wad hae like draw to like maister francie i never quarrelled the ball that the gentry used to hae at my bit house a gude wheen years byganewhen they came the auld folk in their coaches wi langtailed black horses and a wheen galliard gallants on their hunting horses and mony a decent leddy behind her ain goodman and mony a bonny smirking lassie on her pownie and wha sae happy as theyand what for no and then there was the farmers ball wi the tight lads of yeomen with the bran new blues and the buckskinsthese were decent meetingsbut then they were a ae mans bairns that were at them ilk ane kend ilk otherthey danced farmers wi farmers daughters at the tane and gentles wi gentle blood at the tother unless maybe when some of the gentlemen of the killnakelty club would gie me a round of the floor mysell in the way of daffing and fun and me no able to flyte on them for laughingi am sure i never grudged these innocent pleasures although it has cost me maybe a weeks redding up before i got the better of the confusion  but dame said tyrrel this ceremonial would be a little hard upon strangers like myself for how were we to find partners in these family parties of yours  never you fash your thumb about that maister francie returned the landlady with a knowing winkevery jack will find a jill gang the world as it mayand at the warst ot better hae some fashery in finding a partner for the night than get yoked with ane that you may not be able to shake off the morn  and does that sometimes happen asked the stranger  happenand ist amang the well folk that ye mean exclaimed the hostess was it not the last season as they cat no farther gane that young sir bingo binks the english lad wi the red coat that keeps a mailcoach and drives it himsell gat cleekit with miss rachel bonnyrigg the auld leddy loupengirths langlegged daughterand they danced sae lang thegither that there was mair said than suld hae been said about itand the lad would fain hae louped back but the auld leddy held him to his tackle and the commissary court and somebody else made her leddy binks in spite of sir bingos heartand he has never daured take her to his friends in england but they have just wintered and summered it at the well ever sinceand that is what the well is good for  and does clarai mean does miss mowbray keep company with such women as these said tyrrel with a tone of interest which he checked as he proceeded with the question  what can she do puir thing said the dame she maun keep the company that her brother keeps for she is clearly dependentbut speaking of that i ken what i have to do and that is no little before it darkens i have sat clavering with you ower lang maister francie  and away she marched with a resolved step and soon the clear octaves of her voice were heard in shrill admonition to her handmaidens  tyrrel paused a moment in deep thought then took his hat paid a visit to the stable where his horse saluted him with feathering ears and that low amicable neigh with which that animal acknowledges the approach of a loving and beloved friend having seen that the faithful creature was in every respect attended to tyrrel availed himself of the continued and lingering twilight to visit the old castle which upon former occasions had been his favourite evening walk he remained while the light permitted admiring the prospect we attempted to describe in the first chapter and comparing as in his former reverie the faded hues of the glimmering landscape to those of human life when early youth and hope have ceased to gild them  a brisk walk to the inn and a light supper on a welsh rabbit and the dames homebrewed were stimulants of livelier at least more resigned thoughtsand the blue bedroom to the honours of which he had been promoted received him a contented if not a cheerful tenant  footnotes  i8 the foundress of a sect called buchanites a species of joanna southcote who long after death was expected to return and head her

where he announced his purpose of remaining for several days the oldestablished carrier of the place brought his fishingrod and travellingtrunk with a letter to meg dated a week previously desiring her to prepare to receive an old acquaintance this annunciation though something of the latest meg received with great complacency observing it was a civil attention in maister tirl and that john hislop though he was not just sae fast was far surer than ony post of them a or express either she also observed with satisfaction that there was no guncase along with her guests baggage for that weary gunning had brought him and her into troublethe lairds had cried out upont as if she made her house a howff for common fowlers and poachers and yet how could she hinder twa daft hempie callants from taking a start and an owerloupi10 they had been ower the neighbours ground they had leave on up to the march and they werena just to ken meiths when the moorfowl got up  in a day or two her guest fell into such quiet and solitary habits that meg herself the most restless and bustling of human creatures began to be vexed for want of the trouble which she expected to have had with him experiencing perhaps the same sort of feeling from his extreme and passive indifference on all points that a good horseman has for the overpatient steed which he can scarce feel under him his walks were devoted to the most solitary recesses among the neighbouring woods and hillshis fishingrod was often left behind him or carried merely as an apology for sauntering slowly by the banks of some little brookletand his success so indifferent that meg said the piper of peeblesi11 would have caught a creelfu before maister francie made out the halfdozen so that he was obliged for peaces sake to vindicate his character by killing a handsome salmon  tyrrels painting as meg called it went on equally slowly he often indeed showed her the sketches which he brought from his walks and used to finish at home but meg held them very cheap what signified she said a wheen bits of paper wi black and white scarts upon them that he cad bushes and trees and craigscouldna he paint them wi green and blue and yellow like the other folk ye will never mak your bread that way maister francie ye suld munt up a muckle square of canvass like dick tinto and paint folks ainsells that they like muckle better to see than ony craig in the haill water and i wadna muckle objeck even to some of the wallers coming up and sitting to ye they waste their time waur i wisand i warrant ye might make a guinea ahead of them dick made twa but he was an auld used hand and folk maun creep before they gang  in answer to these remonstrances tyrrel assured her that the sketches with which he busied himself were held of such considerable value that very often an artist in that line received much higher remuneration for these than for portraits or coloured drawings he added that they were often taken for the purpose of illustrating popular poems and hinted as if he himself were engaged in some labour of that nature  eagerly did meg long to pour forth to nelly trotter the fishwomanwhose cart formed the only neutral channel of communication between the auld town and the well and who was in favour with meg because as nelly passed her door in her way to the well she always had the first choice of her fishthe merits of her lodger as an artist luckie dods had in truth been so much annoyed and bullied as it were with the report of clever persons accomplished in all sorts of excellence arriving day after day at the hotel that she was overjoyed in this fortunate opportunity to triumph over them in their own way and it may be believed that the excellences of her lodger lost nothing by being trumpeted through her mouth  i maun hae the best of the cart nellyif you and me can greefor it is for ane of the best of painters your fine folk down yonder would gie their lugs to look at what he has been doinghe gets gowd in goupins for three downright skarts and three cross anesand he is no an ungrateful loon like dick tinto that had nae sooner my good fiveandtwenty shillings in his pocket than he gaed down to birl it awa at their bonny hottle yonder but a decent quiet lad that kens when he is weel aff and bides still at the auld howffand what for notell them all this and hear what they will say tillt  indeed mistress i can tell ye that already without stirring my shanks for the matter answered nelly trotter they will een say that ye are ae auld fule and me anither that may hae some

word nellythat is to be stuck as fou o the like o that as ever turkey was larded wi dabs o bacon  thus furnished with her credentials and acting the part of a herald betwixt two hostile countries honest nelly switched her little fishcart downwards to st ronans well  in wateringplaces as in other congregated assemblies of the human species various kinds of government have been dictated by chance caprice or convenience but in almost all of them some sort of direction has been adopted to prevent the consequences of anarchy sometimes the sole power has been vested in a master of ceremonies but this like other despotisms has been of late unfashionable and the powers of this great officer have been much limited even at bath where nash once ruled with undisputed supremacy committees of management chosen from among the most steady guests have been in general resorted to as a more liberal mode of sway and to such was confided the administration of the infant republic of st ronans well this little senate it must be observed had the more difficult task in discharging their high duties that like those of other republics their subjects were divided into two jarring and contending factions who every day eat drank danced and made merry together hating each other all the while with all the animosity of political party endeavouring by every art to secure the adherence of each guest who arrived and ridiculing the absurdities and follies of each other with all the wit and bitterness of which they were masters  at the head of one of these parties was no less a personage than lady penelope penfeather to whom the establishment owed its fame nay its existence and whose influence could only have been balanced by that of the lord of the manor mr mowbray of st ronans or as he was called usually by the company who affected what meg called knapping english the squire who was leader of the opposite faction  the rank and fortune of the lady her pretensions to beauty as well as talent though the former was something faded and the consequence which she arrogated to herself as a woman of fashion drew round her painters and poets and philosophers and men of science and lecturers and foreign adventurers et hoc genus omne  on the contrary the squires influence as a man of family and property in the immediate neighbourhood who actually kept greyhounds and pointers and at least talked of hunters and of racers ascertained him the support of the whole class of bucks half and whole bred from the three next counties and if more inducements were wanting he could grant his favourites the privilege of shooting over his moors which is enough to turn the head of a young scottishman at any time mr mowbray was of late especially supported in his preeminence by a close alliance with sir bingo binks a sapient english baronet who ashamed as many thought to return to his own country had set him down at the well of st ronans to enjoy the blessing which the caledonian hymen had so kindly forced on him in the person of miss rachel bonnyrigg as this gentleman actually drove a regularbuilt mailcoach not in any respect differing from that of his majesty only that it was more frequently overturned his influence with a certain set was irresistible and the squire of st ronans having the better sense of the two contrived to reap the full benefit of the consequence attached to his friendship  these two contending parties were so equally balanced that the predominance of the influence of either was often determined by the course of the sun thus in the morning and forenoon when lady penelope led forth her herd to lawn and shady bower whether to visit some ruined monument of ancient times or eat their picnic luncheon to spoil good paper with bad drawings and good verses with repetitionin a word      to rave recite and madden round the land  her ladyships empire over the loungers seemed uncontrolled and absolute and all things were engaged in the tourbillon of which she formed the pivot and centre even the hunters and shooters and hard drinkers were sometimes fain reluctantly to follow in her train sulking and quizzing and flouting at her solemn festivals besides encouraging the younger nymphs to giggle when they should have looked sentimental but after dinner the scene was changed and her ladyships sweetest smiles and softest invitations were often insufficient to draw the neutral part of the company to the tearoom so that her society was reduced to those whose constitution or finances rendered early retirement from the diningparlour a matter of convenience together with the more devoted and zealous of her own immediate dependents and adherents even the faith of the latter was apt to be debauched her ladyships poetlaureate in whose behalf she was teazing each newcomer for subscriptions got sufficiently independent to sing in her ladyships presence at supper a song of rather equivocal meaning and her chief painter who was employed upon an illustrated copy of the loves of the plants was at another time seduced into such a state of potvalour that upon her ladyships administering her usual dose of criticism upon his works he not only bluntly disputed her judgment but talked something of his right to be treated like a gentleman  these feuds were taken up by the managing committee who interceded for the penitent offenders on the following morning and obtained their reestablishment in lady penelopes good graces upon moderate terms many other acts of moderating authority they performed much to the assuaging of faction and the quiet of the wellers and so essential was their government to the prosperity of the place that without them st ronans spring would probably have been speedily deserted we must therefore give a brief sketch of that potential committee which both factions acting as if on a selfdenying ordinance had combined to invest with the reins of government  each of its members appeared to be selected as fortunio in the fairytaleid chose his followers for his peculiar gifts first on the list stood the man of medicine dr quentin quackleben who claimed right to regulate medical matters at the spring upon the principle which of old assigned the property of a newly discovered country to the bucanier who committed the earliest piracy on its shores the acknowledgment of the doctors merit as having been first to proclaim and vindicate the merits of these healing fountains had occasioned his being universally installed first physician and man of science which last qualification he could apply to all purposes from the boiling of an egg to the giving a lecture he was indeed qualified like many of his profession to spread both the bane and antidote before a dyspeptic patient being as knowing a gastronome as dr redgill himself or any other worthy physician who has written for the benefit of the cuisine from dr moncrieff of tippermalloch to the late dr hunter of york and the present dr kitchiner of london but pluralities are always invidious and therefore the doctor prudently relinquished the office of caterer and headcarver to the man of taste who occupied regularly and ex officio the head of the table reserving to himself the occasional privilege of criticising and a principal share in consuming the good things which the common entertainment afforded we have only to sum up this brief account of the learned doctor by informing the reader that he was a tall lean beetlebrowed man with an illmade black scratchwig that stared out on either side from his lantern jaws he resided nine months out of the twelve at st ronans and was supposed to make an indifferent good thing of itespecially as he played whist to admiration  first in place though perhaps second to the doctor in real authority was mr winterblossom a civil sort of person who was nicely precise in his address wore his hair cued and dressed with powder had kneebuckles set with bristol stones and a sealring as large as sir john falstaffs in his heyday he had a small estate which he had spent like a gentleman by mixing with the gay world he was in short one of those respectable links that connect the coxcombs of the present day with those of the last age and could compare in his own experience the follies of both in latter days he had sense enough to extricate himself from his course of dissipation though with impaired health and impoverished fortune  mr winterblossom now lived upon a moderate annuity and had discovered a way of reconciling his economy with much company and made dishes by acting as perpetual president of the tabledhote at the well here he used to amuse the society by telling stories about garrick foote bonnel thornton and lord kelly and delivering his opinions in matters of taste and vertu an excellent carver he knew how to help each guest to what was precisely his due and never failed to reserve a proper slice as the reward of his own labours to conclude he was possessed of some taste in the fine arts at least in painting and music although it was rather of the technical kind than that which warms the heart and elevates the feelings there was indeed about winterblossom nothing that was either warm or elevated he was shrewd selfish and sensual the last two of which qualities he screened from observation under a specious varnish of exterior complaisance therefore in his professed and apparent anxiety to do the honours of the table to the most punctilious point of good breeding he never permitted the attendants upon the public taste to supply the wants of others until all his own private comforts had been fully arranged and provided for  mr winterblossom was also distinguished for possessing a few curious engravings and other specimens of art with the exhibition of which he occasionally beguiled a wet morning at the public room they were collected viis et modis said the man of law another distinguished member of the committee with a knowing cock of his eye to his next neighbour  of this person little need be said he was a largeboned loudvoiced redfaced man named meiklewham a country writer or attorney who managed the matters of the squire much to the profit of one or otherif not of both his nose projected from the front of his broad vulgar face like the stile of an old sundial twisted all of one side he was as great a bully in his profession as if it had been military instead of civil conducted the whole technicalities concerning the cutting up the saintswellhaugh so much lamented by dame dods into buildingstances and was on excellent terms with doctor quackleben who always recommended him to make the wills of his patients  after the man of law comes captain mungo macturk a highland lieutenant on halfpay and that of ancient standing one who preferred toddy of the strongest to wine and in that fashion and cold drams finished about a bottle of whisky per diem whenever he could come by it he was called the man of peace on the same principle which assigns to constables bowstreet runners and such like who carry bludgeons to break folks heads and are perpetually and officially employed in scenes of riot the title of peaceofficersthat is because by his valour he compelled others to act with discretion the captain was the general referee in all those abortive quarrels which at a place of this kind are so apt to occur at night and to be quietly settled in the morning and occasionally adopted a quarrel himself by way of taking down any guest who was unusually pugnacious this occupation procured captain macturk a good deal of respect at the well for he was precisely that sort of person who is ready to fight with any onewhom no one can find an apology for declining to fight within fighting with whom considerable danger was incurred for he was ever and anon showing that he could snuff a candle with a pistol balland lastly through fighting with whom no eclat or credit could redound to the antagonist he always wore a blue coat and red collar had a supercilious taciturnity of manner ate sliced leeks with his cheese and resembled in complexion a dutch redherring  still remains to be mentioned the man of religionthe gentle mr simon chatterly who had strayed to st ronans well from the banks of cam or isis and who piqued himself first on his greek and secondly on his politeness to the ladies during all the week days as dame dods has already hinted this reverend gentleman was the partner at the whisttable or in the ballroom to what maid or matron soever lacked a partner at either and on the sundays he read prayers in the public room to all who chose to attend he was also a deviser of charades and an unriddler of riddles he played a little on the flute and was mr winterblossoms principal assistant in contriving those ingenious and romantic paths by which as by the zigzags which connect military parallels you were enabled to ascend to the top of the hill behind the hotel which commands so beautiful a prospect at exactly that precise angle of ascent which entitles a gentleman to offer his arm and a lady to accept it with perfect propriety  there was yet another member of this select committee mr michael meredith who might be termed the man of mirth or if you please the jack pudding to the company whose business it was to crack the best joke and sing the best songhe could unluckily however this functionary was for the present obliged to absent himself from st ronans for not recollecting that he did not actually wear the privileged motley of his profession he had passed some jest upon captain macturk which cut so much to the quick that mr meredith was fain to go to goatwhey quarters at some ten miles distance and remain there in a sort of concealment until the affair should be made up through the mediation of his brethren of the committee  such were the honest gentlemen who managed the affairs of this rising settlement with as much impartiality as could be expected they were not indeed without their own secret predilections for the lawyer and the soldier privately inclined to the party of the squire while the parson mr meredith and mr winterblossom were more devoted to the interests of lady penelope so that doctor quackleben alone who probably recollected that the gentlemen were as liable to stomach complaints as the ladies to nervous disorders seemed the only person who preserved in word and deed the most rigid neutrality nevertheless the interests of the establishment being very much at the heart of this honourable council and each feeling his own profit pleasure or comfort in some degree involved they suffered not their private affections to interfere with their public duties but acted every one in his own sphere for the public benefit of the whole community  footnotes  i10 the usual expression for a slight encroachment on a neighbours property  i11 the said piper was famous

gentleman and yet was none of the company and that you said was a handsome man  i did not say handsome maria replied her ladyship ladies never say men are handsomei only said he looked genteel and interesting  and that my lady said the young parson bowing and smiling is i will be judged by the company the more flattering compliment of the twowe shall be jealous of this unknown presently  nay but continued the sweetly communicative maria with some real and some assumed simplicity your ladyship forgetsfor you said presently after you were sure he was no gentleman for he did not run after you with your glove which you had droppedand so i went back myself to find your ladyships glove and he never offered to help me and i saw him closer than your ladyship did and i am sure he is handsome though he is not very civil  you speak a little too much and too loud miss said lady penelope a natural blush reinforcing the nuance of rouge by which it was usually superseded  what say you to that squire mowbray said the elegant sir bingo binks  a fair challenge to the field sir bingo answered the squire when a lady throws down the gauntlet a gentleman may throw the handkerchief  i have always the benefit of your best construction mr mowbray said the lady with dignity i suppose miss maria has contrived this pretty story for your amusement i can hardly answer to mr digges for bringing her into company where she receives encouragement to behave so  nay nay my lady said the president you must let the jest pass by and since this is really such an admirable sketch you must honour us with your opinion whether the company can consistently with propriety make any advances to this man  in my opinion said her ladyship the angry spot still glowing on her brow there are enough of men among us alreadyi wish i could say gentlemenas matters stand i see little business ladies can have at st ronans  this was an intimation which always brought the squire back to goodbreeding which he could make use of when he pleased he deprecated her ladyships displeasure until she told him in returning good humour that she really would not trust him unless he brought his sister to be security for his future politeness  clara my lady said mowbray is a little wilful and i believe your ladyship must take the task of unharbouring her into your own hands what say you to a gipsy party up to my old shopit is a bachelors houseyou must not expect things in much order but clara would be honoured  the lady penelope eagerly accepted the proposal of something like a party and quite reconciled with

meg dodss was quite and clean a gentleman and an illustrated poet besides  an illustrated poet dinah said lady penelope you must mean an illustrious poet  i dare to say your ladyship is right said dinah dropping a curtsy  a joyous flutter of impatient anxiety was instantly excited through all the bluestocking faction of the company nor were the news totally indifferent to the rest of the community the former belonged to that class who like the young ascanius are ever beating about in quest of a tawny lion though they are much more successful in now and then starting a great borei13

bottle of wine should furnish forth the feast of tomorrow though caring nought about either of the fine arts in question found out an interest of their own which centred in the same individual  i say little sir bingo said the squire this is the very fellow that we saw down at the willowslack on saturdayhe was togd gnostically enough and cast twelve yards of line with one handthe fly fell like a

sixteen by   will you go a dozen of blue on it to the company said the squire  no d me croaked the baronetto our own set i will  then i say done quoth the squire  and done responded the knight and out came their red pocketbooks  but who shall decide the bet said the squire the genius himself i suppose they talk of asking him here but i suppose he will scarce mind quizzes like them  write myselfjohn mowbray said the baronet  you baronetyou write answered the squire d me that cock wont fightyou wont  i will growled sir bingo more articulately than usual  why you cant said mowbray you never wrote a line in your life save those you were whipped for at school  i can writei will write said sir bingo two to one i will  and there the affair rested for the council of the company were in high consultation concerning the most proper manner of opening a communication with the mysterious stranger and the voice of mr winterblossom whose tones originally fine age had reduced to falsetto was calling upon the whole party for order order so that the bucks were obliged to lounge in silence with both arms reclined on the table and testifying by coughs and yawns their indifference to the matters in question while the rest of the company debated upon them as if they were matters of life and death  a visit from one of the gentlemenmr winterblossom if he would take the troublein name of the company at largewould lady penelope penfeather presumed to think be a necessary preliminary to an invitation  mr winterblossom was quite of her ladyships opinion and would gladly have been the personal representative of the company at st ronans wellbut it was up hillher ladyship knew his tyrant the gout was hovering upon the frontiersthere were other gentlemen younger and more worthy to fly at the ladys command than an ancient vulcan like himthere was the valiant mars and the eloquent mercury  thus speaking he bowed to captain macturk and the rev mr simon chatterly and reclined on his chair sipping his negus with the selfsatisfied smile of one who by a pretty speech has rid himself of a troublesome commission at the same time by an act probably of mental absence he put in his pocket the drawing which after circulating around the table had returned back to the chair of the president being the point from which it had set out  by cot madam said captain macturk i should be proud to obey your leddyships commandsbut by cot i never call first on any man that never called upon me at all unless it were to carry him a friends message or such like  twig the old connoisseur said the squire to the knighthe is condiddling the drawing  go it johnnie mowbraypour it into him whispered sir bingo  thank ye for nothing sir bingo said the squire in the same tone winterblossom is one of uswas one of us at leastand wont stand the ironing he has his wogdens still that were right things in his day and can hit the haystack with the best of usbut stay they are hallooing on the parson  they were indeed busied on all hands to obtain mr chatterlys consent to wait on the genius unknown but though he smiled and simpered and was absolutely incapable of saying no he begged leave in all humility to decline that commission the truth was he pleaded in his excuse that having one day walked to visit the old castle of st ronans and returning through the auld town as it was popularly called he had stopped at the door of the cleikum pronounced anglic√© with the open diphthong in hopes to get a glass of syrup of capillaire or a draught of something cooling and had in fact expressed his wishes and was knocking pretty loudly when a sashwindow was thrown suddenly up and ere he was aware what was about to happen he was soused with a deluge of water as he said while the voice of an old hag from within assured him that if that did not cool him there was another biding himan intimation which induced him to retreat in all haste from the repetition of the showerbath  all laughed at the account of the chaplains misfortune the history of which seemed to be wrung from him reluctantly by the necessity of assigning some weighty cause for declining to execute the ladies commands but the squire and baronet continued their mirth far longer than decorum allowed flinging themselves back in their chairs with their hands thrust into their sidepockets and their mouths expanded with unrestrained enjoyment until the sufferer angry disconcerted and endeavouring to look scornful incurred another general burst of laughter on all hands  when mr winterblossom had succeeded in restoring some degree of order he found the mishaps of the young divine proved as intimidating as ludicrous not one of the company chose to go envoy extraordinary to the dominions of queen meg who might be suspected of paying little respect to the sanctity of an ambassadors person and what was worse when it was resolved that a civil card from mr winterblossom in the name of the company should be sent to the stranger instead of a personal visit dinah informed them that she was sure no one about the house could be bribed to carry up a letter of the kind for when such an event had taken place two summers since meg who construed it into an attempt to seduce from her tenement the invited guest had so handled a ploughboy who carried the letter that he fled the countryside altogether and never thought himself safe till he was at a village ten miles off where it was afterwards learned he enlisted with a recruiting party choosing rather to face the french than to return within the sphere of megs displeasure  just while they were agitating this new difficulty a prodigious clamour was heard without which to the first apprehensions of the company seemed to be meg in all her terrors come to anticipate the proposed invasion upon enquiry however it proved to be her gossip trotting nelly or nelly trotter in the act of forcing her way up stairs against the united strength of the whole household of the hotel to reclaim luckie dodss picture as she called it this made the connoisseurs treasure tremble in his pocket who thrusting a halfcrown into tobys hand exhorted him to give it her and try his influence in keeping her back toby who knew nellys nature put the halfcrown into his own pocket and snatched up a gillstoup of whisky from the sideboard thus armed he boldly confronted the virago and interposing a remora which was able to check poor nellys course in her most determined moods not only succeeded in averting the immediate storm which approached the company in general and mr winterblossom in particular but brought the guests the satisfactory information that trotting nelly had agreed after she had slept out her nap in the barn to convey their commands to the unknown of cleikum of aultoun  mr winterblossom therefore having authenticated his proceedings by inserting in the minutes of the committee the authority which he had received wrote his card in the best style of diplomacy and sealed it with the seal of the spa which bore something like a nymph seated beside what was designed to represent an urn  the rival factions however did not trust entirely to this official invitation lady penelope was of opinion that they should find some way of letting the strangera man of talent unquestionablyunderstand that there were in the society to which he was invited spirits of a more select sort who felt worthy to intrude themselves on his solitude  accordingly her ladyship imposed upon the elegant mr chatterly the task of expressing the desire of the company to see the unknown artist in a neat occasional copy of verses the poor gentlemans muse however proved unpropitious for he was able to proceed no farther than two lines in half an hour which coupled with its variations we insert from the blotted manuscript as dr johnson has printed the alterations in popes version of the iliad      1 maids 2 dames unity joining     the nymphs of st ronans in purpose combining      1 swain 2 man     to the youth who is great both in verse and designing      dining  the eloquence of a prose billet was necessarily resorted to in the absence of the heavenly muse and the said billet was secretly intrusted to the care of trotting nelly the same trusty emissary when refreshed by her nap among the peasestraw and about to harness her cart for her return to the seacoast in the course of which she was to pass the aultoun received another card written as he had threatened by sir bingo binks himself who had given himself this trouble to secure the settlement of the bet conjecturing that a man with a fashionable exterior who could throw twelve yards of line at a cast with such precision might consider the invitation of winterblossom as that of an old twaddler and care as little for the good graces of an affected bluestocking and her c√¥terie whose conversation in sir bingos mind relished of nothing but of weak tea and bread and butter thus the happy mr francis tyrrel received considerably to his surprise no less than three invitations at once from the well of st ronans  footnote  i13 the one or the other was equally in votis to ascanius

first i must read thee  prior   desirous of authenticating our more important facts by as many original documents as possible we have after much research enabled ourselves to present the reader with the following accurate transcripts of the notes intrusted to the care of trotting nelly the first ran thus      mr winterblossom of silverhed has the commands of lady penelope     penfeather sir bingo and lady binks mr and miss mowbray of st     ronans and the rest of the company at the hotel and tontine inn     of st ronans well to express their hope that the gentleman lodged     at the cleikum inn old town of st ronans will favour them with     his company at the ordinary as early and as often as may suit his     convenience the company think it necessary to send this intimation     because according to the rules of the place the ordinary can only     be attended by such gentlemen and ladies as lodge at st ronans     well but they are happy to make a distinction in favour of a     gentleman so distinguished for success in the fine arts as mr       residing at cleikum if mr   should be inclined upon     becoming further acquainted with the company and rules of the     place to remove his residence to the well mr winterblossom     though he would not be understood to commit himself by a positive     assurance to that effect is inclined to hope that an arrangement     might be made notwithstanding the extreme crowd of the season to     accommodate mr   at the lodginghouse called     lilliputhall it will much conduce to facilitate this negotiation     if mr   would have the goodness to send an exact note of     his stature as captain rannletree seems disposed to resign the     foldingbed at lilliputhall on account of his finding it rather     deficient in length mr winterblossom begs farther to assure mr       of the esteem in which he holds his genius and of his     high personal consideration      for   esquire     cleikum inn old town of st ronans      the public rooms     hotel and tontine st ronans well     c c c  the above card was written we love to be precise in matters concerning orthography in a neat round clerklike hand which like mr winterblossoms character in many particulars was most accurate and commonplace though betraying an affectation both of flourish and of facility  the next billet was a contrast to the diplomatic gravity and accuracy of mr winterblossoms official communication and ran thus the young divines academic jests and classical flowers of eloquence being mingled with some wild flowers from the teeming fancy of lady penelope      a choir of dryads and naiads assembled at the healing spring of     st ronans have learned with surprise that a youth gifted by     apollo when the deity was prodigal with two of his most esteemed     endowments wanders at will among their domains frequenting grove     and river without once dreaming of paying homage to its tutelary     deities he is therefore summoned to their presence and prompt     obedience will insure him forgiveness but in case of contumacy let     him beware how he again essays either the lyre or the pallet      postscript the adorable

hairstrokes and dashes which were sometimes so dexterously thrown off as to represent lyres pallets vases and other appropriate decorations suited to the tenor of the contents  the third epistle was a complete contrast to the other two it was written in a coarse irregular schoolboy halftext which however seemed to have cost the writer as much pains as if it had been a specimen of the most exquisite caligraphy and these were the contents      surjack moobray has betted with me that the samon you killed on     saturday last weyd ni to eiteen poundsi say nyer sixteenso you     being a spurtsman tis

grooms dressing hope they will prove killing as     suiting river and season  no answer was received to any of these invitations for more than three days which while it secretly rather added to than diminished the curiosity of the wellers concerning the unknown occasioned much railing in public against him as illmannered and rude  meantime francis tyrrel to his great surprise began to find like the philosophers that he was never less alone than when alone in the most silent and sequestered walks to which the present state of his mind induced him to betake himself he was sure to find some strollers from the well to whom he had become the object of so much solicitous interest quite innocent of the knowledge that he himself possessed the attraction which occasioned his meeting them so frequently he began to doubt whether the lady penelope and her maidensmr winterblossom and his grey ponythe parson and his short black coat and ravengrey pantaloonswere not either actually polygraphic copies of the same individuals or possessed of a celerity of motion resembling omnipresence and ubiquity for nowhere could he go without meeting them and that oftener than once aday in the course of his walks sometimes the presence of the sweet lycoris was intimated by the sweet prattle in an adjacent shade sometimes when tyrrel thought himself most solitary the parsons flute was heard snoring forth gramachree molly and if he betook himself to the river he was pretty sure to find his sport watched by sir bingo or some of his friends  the efforts which tyrrel made to escape from this persecution and the impatience of it which his manner indicated procured him among the wellers the name of the misanthrope and once distinguished as an object of curiosity he was the person most attended to who could at the ordinary of the day give the most accurate account of where the misanthrope had been and how occupied in the course of the morning and so far was tyrrels shyness from diminishing the desire of the wellers for his society that the latter feeling increased with the difficulty of gratificationas the angler feels the most peculiar interest when throwing his fly for the most cunning and considerate trout in the pool  in short such was the interest which the excited imaginations of the company took in the misanthrope that notwithstanding the unamiable qualities which the word expresses there was only one of the society who did not desire to see the specimen at their rooms for the purpose of examining him closely and at leisure and the ladies were particularly desirous to enquire whether he was actually a misanthrope whether he had been always a misanthrope what had induced him to become a misanthrope and whether there were no means of inducing him to cease to be a misanthrope  one individual only as we have said neither desired to see nor hear more of the supposed timon of cleikum and that was mr mowbray of st ronans through the medium of that venerable character john pirner professed weaver and practical blackfisher in the aultoun of st ronans who usually attended tyrrel to show him the casts of the river carry his bag and so forth the squire had ascertained that the judgment of sir bingo regarding the disputed weight of the fish was more correct than his own this inferred an immediate loss of honour besides the payment of a heavy bill and the consequences might be yet more serious nothing short of the emancipation of sir bingo who had hitherto been mowbrays convenient shadow and adherent but who if triumphant confiding in his superiority of judgment upon so important a point might either cut him altogether or expect that in future the squire who had long seemed the planet of their set should be content to roll around himself sir bingo in the capacity of a satellite  the squire therefore devoutly hoped that tyrrels restive disposition might continue to prevent the decision of the bet while at the same time he nourished a very reasonable degree of dislike to that stranger who had been the indirect occasion of the unpleasant predicament in which he found himself by not catching a salmon weighing a pound heavier he therefore openly censured the meanness of those who proposed taking further notice of tyrrel and referred to the unanswered letters as a piece of impertinence which announced him to be no gentleman  but though appearances were against him and though he was in truth naturally inclined to solitude and averse to the affectation and bustle of such a society that part of tyrrels behaviour which indicated illbreeding was easily accounted for by his never having received the letters which required an answer trotting nelly whether unwilling to face her gossip meg dods without bringing back the drawing or whether oblivious through the influence of the double dram with which she had been indulged at the well jumbled off with her cart to her beloved village of scateraw from which she transmitted the letters by the first barelegged gillie who travelled towards aultoun of st ronans so that at last but after a long delay they reached the cleikum inn and the hands of mr tyrrel  the arrival of these documents explained some part of the oddity of behaviour which had surprised him in his neighbours of the well and as he saw they had got somehow an idea of his being a lion extraordinary and was sensible that such is a character equally ridiculous and difficult to support he hastened to write to mr winterblossom a card in the style of ordinary mortals in this he stated the delay occasioned by miscarriage of the letter and his regret on that account expressed his intention of dining with the company at the well on the succeeding day while he regretted that other circumstances as well as the state of his health and spirits would permit him this honour very infrequently during his stay in the country and begged no trouble might be taken about his accommodation at the well as he was perfectly satisfied with his present residence a separate note to sir bingo said he was happy he could verify the weight of the fish which he had noted in his diary dn the fellow does he keep a diary said the baronet and though the result could only be particularly agreeable to one party he should wish both winner and loser mirth with their winehe was sorry he was unable to promise himself the pleasure of participating in either enclosed was a signed note of the weight of the fish armed with this sir bingo claimed his winetriumphed in his judgmentswore louder and more articulately than ever he was known to utter any previous sounds that this tyrrel was a devilish honest fellow and he trusted to be better acquainted with him while the crestfallen squire privately cursing the stranger by all his gods had no mode of silencing his companion but by allowing his loss and fixing a day for discussing the bet  in the public rooms the company examined even microscopically the response of the stranger to mr winterblossom straining their ingenuity to discover in the most ordinary expressions a deeper and esoteric meaning expressive of something mysterious and not meant to meet the eye mr meiklewham the writer dwelt on the word circumstances which he read with peculiar emphasis  ah poor lad he concluded i doubt he sits cheaper at meg dortss chimneycorner than he could do with the present company  doctor quackleben in the manner of a clergyman selecting a word from his text as that which is to be particularly insisted upon repeated in an under tone the words state of

turning abruptly and angrily awaypray mr winterblossom let me have an order to look over the file of newspapersits very troublesome that restriction about consulting them  you know it is a necessary one doctor said the president because so few of the good company read any thing else that the old newspapers would have been worn to pieces long since  well well let me have the order said the doctor i remember something of a gentleman run away from his friendsi must look at the descriptioni believe i have a straitjacket somewhere about the dispensary  while this suggestion appalled the male part of the company who did not much relish the approaching dinner in company with a gentleman whose situation seemed so precarious some of the younger misses whispered to each otherah poor fellowand if it be as the doctor supposes my lady who knows what the cause of his illness may have beenhis spirits he complains ofah poor man  and thus by the ingenious commentaries of the company at the well on as plain a note as ever covered the eighth part of a sheet of foolscap the writer was deprived of his property his reason and his heart all or either or one or other of them as is briefly and distinctly expressed in the law phrase  in short so much was said pro and con so many ideas started and theories maintained concerning the disposition and character of the misanthrope that when the company assembled at the usual time before proceeding to dinner they doubted as it seemed whether the expected addition to their society was to enter the room on his hands or his feet and when mr tyrrel was announced by toby at the top of his voice the gentleman who entered the room had so very little to distinguish him from others that there was a momentary disappointment the ladies in particular began to doubt whether the compound of talent misanthropy madness and mental sensibility which they had pictured to themselves actually was the same with the genteel and even fashionablelooking man whom they saw before them who though in a morningdress which the distance of his residence and the freedom of the place made excusable had even in the minute points of his exterior none of the negligence or wildness which might be supposed to attach to the vestments of a misanthropic recluse whether sane or insane as he paid his compliments round the circle the scales seemed to fall from the eyes of those he spoke to and they saw with surprise that the exaggerations had existed entirely in their own preconceptions and that whatever the fortunes or rank in life of mr tyrrel might be his manners without being showy were gentlemanlike and pleasing he returned his thanks to mr winterblossom in a manner which made that gentleman recall his best breeding to answer the strangers address in kind he then escaped from the awkwardness of remaining the sole object of attention by gliding gradually among the companynot like an owl which seeks to hide itself in a thicket or an awkward and retired man shrinking from the society into which he is compelled but with the air of one who could maintain with ease his part in a higher circle his address to lady penelope was adapted to the romantic tone of mr chatterlys epistle to which it was necessary to allude he was afraid he said he must complain to juno of the neglect of iris for her irregularity in delivery of a certain ethereal command which he had not dared to answer otherwise than by mute obedienceunless indeed as the import of the letter seemed to infer the invitation was designed for some more gifted individual than he to whom chance had assigned it  lady penelope by her lips and many of the young ladies with their eyes assured him there was no mistake in the matter that he was really the gifted person whom the nymphs had summoned to their presence and that they were well acquainted with his talents as a poet and a painter tyrrel disclaimed with earnestness and gravity the charge of poetry and professed that far from attempting the art itself he read with reluctance all but the productions of the very firstrate poets and some of thesehe was almost afraid to sayhe should have liked better in humble prose  you have now only to disown your skill as an artist said lady penelope and we must consider mr tyrrel as the falsest and most deceitful of his sex who has a mind to deprive us of the opportunity of benefiting by the productions of his unparalleled endowments i assure you i shall put my young friends on their guard such dissimulation cannot be without its object  and i said mr winterblossom can produce a piece of real evidence against the culprit  so saying he unrolled the sketch which he had filched from trotting nelly and which he had pared and pasted arts in which he was eminent so as to take out its creases repair its breaches and vamp it as well as my old friend mrs weir could have repaired the damages of time on a folio shakspeare  the vara corpus delicti said the writer grinning and rubbing his hands  if you are so good as to call such scratches drawings said tyrrel i must stand so far confessed i used to do them for my own amusement but since my landlady mrs dods has of late discovered that i gain my livelihood by them why should i disown it  this avowal made without the least appearance either of shame or retenue seemed to have a striking effect on the whole society the presidents trembling hand stole the sketch back to the portfolio afraid doubtless it might be claimed in form or else compensation expected by the artist lady penelope was disconcerted like an awkward horse when it changes the leading foot in galloping she had to recede from the respectful and easy footing on which he had contrived to place himself to one which might express patronage on her own part and dependence on tyrrels and this could not be done in a moment  the man of law murmured circumstancescircumstancesi thought so  sir bingo whispered to his friend the squire run outblown upoff the coursepitydd pretty fellow he has been  a raff from the beginning whispered mowbrayi never thought him any thing else  ill hold ye a poney of that my dear and ill ask him  done for a poney provided you ask him in ten minutes said the squire but you dare not bingiehe has a dd cross game look with all that civil chaff of his  done said sir bingo but in a less confident tone than before and with a determination to proceed with some caution in the matteri have got a rouleau above and winterblossom shall hold stakes  i have no rouleau said the squire but ill fly a cheque on meiklewham  see it be better than your last said sir bingo for i wont be skylarked again jack my boy you are had  not till the bets won and i shall see yon walking dandy break your head bingie before that answered mowbray best speak to the captain before handit is a hellish scrape you are running intoill let you off yet bingie for a guinea forfeitsee i am just going to start the tattler  start and be dd said sir bingo you are gotten i assure you o that jack and with a bow and a shuffle he went up and introduced himself to the stranger as sir bingo binks  hadhonourwritesir were the only sounds which his throat or rather his cravat seemed to send forth  confound the booby thought mowbray he will get out of leading strings if he goes on at this rate and doubly confounded be this cursed tramper who the lord knows why has come hither from the lord knows where to drive the pigs through my game  in the meantime while his friend stood with his stopwatch in his hand with a visage lengthened under the influence of these reflections sir bingo with an instinctive tact which selfpreservation seemed to dictate to a brain neither the most delicate nor subtle in the world premised his enquiry by some general remark on fishing and fieldsports with all these he found tyrrel more than passably acquainted of fishing and shooting particularly he spoke with something like enthusiasm so that sir bingo began to hold him in considerable respect and to assure himself that he could not be or at least could not originally have been bred the itinerant artist which he now gave himself outand this with the fast lapse of the time induced him thus to address tyrreli say mr tyrrelwhy you have been one of usi say  if you mean a sportsman sir bingoi have been and am a pretty keen one still replied tyrrel  why then you did not always do them sort of things  what sort of things do you mean sir bingo said tyrrel i have not the pleasure of understanding you  why i mean them sketches said sir bingo ill give you a handsome order for them if you will tell me i will on my honour  does it concern you particularly sir bingo to know any thing of my affairs said tyrrel  nocertainlynot immediately answered sir bingo with some hesitation for he liked not the dry tone in which tyrrels answers were returned half so well as a bumper of dry sherry only i said you were a dd gnostic fellow and i laid a bet you have not been always professionalthats all  mr tyrrel replied a bet with mr mowbray i suppose  yes with jack replied the baronetyou have hit iti hope i have done him  tyrrel bent his brows and looked first at mr mowbray then at the baronet and after a moments thought addressed the lattersir bingo binks you are a gentleman of elegant enquiry and acute judgmentyou are perfectly righti was not bred to the profession of an artist nor did i practise it formerly whatever i may do now and so that question is answered  and jack is diddled said the baronet smiting his thigh in triumph and turning towards the squire and the stakeholder with a smile of exultation  stop a single moment sir bingo said tyrrel take one word with you i have a great respect for betsit is part of an englishmans character to bet on what he thinks fit and to prosecute his enquiries over hedge and ditch as if he were steeplehunting but as i have satisfied you on the subject of two bets that is sufficient compliance with the custom of the country and therefore i request sir bingo you will not make me or my affairs the subject of any more wagers  ill be dd if i do was the internal resolution of sir bingo aloud he muttered some apologies and was heartily glad that the dinnerbell sounding at the moment afforded him an apology for shuffling off in a different direction     chapter vi  tabletalk      and sir if these accounts be true     the dutch have mighty things in view     the austriansi admire french beans     dear maam above all other greens                                           and all as lively and as brisk     asmaam dye choose a game at whisk  tabletalk   when they were about to leave the room lady penelope assumed tyrrels arm with a sweet smile of condescension meant to make the honoured party understand in its full extent the favour conferred but the unreasonable artist far from intimating the least confusion at an attention so little to be expected seemed to consider the distinction as one which was naturally paid to the greatest stranger present and when he placed lady penelope at the head of the table by mr winterblossom the president and took a chair for himself betwixt her ladyship and lady binks the provoking wretch appeared no more sensible of being exalted above his proper rank in society than if he had been sitting at the bottom of the table by honest mrs blower from the bowhead who had come to the well to carry off the dregs of the inflienzie which she scorned to term a surfeit  now this indifference puzzled lady penelopes game extremely and irritated her desire to get at the bottom of tyrrels mystery if there was one and secure him to her own party if you were ever at a wateringplace reader you know that while the guests do not always pay the most polite attention to unmarked individuals the appearance of a stray lion makes an interest as strong as it is reasonable and the amazonian chiefs of each coterie like the hunters of buenosayres prepare their lasso and manoeuvre to the best advantage they can each hoping to noose the unsuspicious monster and lead him captive to her own menagerie a few words concerning lady penelope penfeather will explain why she practised this sport with even more than common zeal  she was the daughter of an earl possessed a showy person and features which might be called handsome in youth though now rather too much prononc√©s to render the term proper the nose was become sharper the cheeks had lost the roundness of youth and as during fifteen years that she had reigned a beauty and a ruling toast the right man had not spoken or at least had not spoken at the right time her ladyship now rendered sufficiently independent by the inheritance of an old relation spoke in praise of friendship began to dislike the town in summer and to babble of green fields  about the time lady penelope thus changed the tenor of her life she was fortunate enough with dr quacklebens assistance to find out the virtues of st ronans spring and having contributed her share to establish the urbs in rure which had risen around it she sat herself down as leader of the fashions in the little province which she had in a great measure both discovered and colonized she was therefore justly desirous to compel homage and tribute from all who should approach the territory  in other respects lady penelope pretty much resembled the numerous class she belonged to she was at bottom a wellprincipled woman but too thoughtless to let her principles control her humour therefore not scrupulously nice in her society she was goodnatured but capricious and whimsical and willing enough to be kind or generous if it neither thwarted her humour nor cost her much trouble would have chaperoned a young friend any where and moved the world for subscription tickets but never troubled herself how much her giddy charge flirted or with whom so that with a numerous class of misses her ladyship was the most delightful creature in the world then lady penelope had lived so much in society knew so exactly when to speak and how to escape from an embarrassing discussion by professing ignorance while she looked intelligence that she was not generally discovered to be a fool unless when she set up for being remarkably clever this happened more frequently of late when perhaps as she could not but observe that the repairs of the toilet became more necessary she might suppose that new lights according to the poet were streaming on her mind through the chinks that time was making many of her friends however thought that lady penelope would have better consulted her genius by remaining in mediocrity as a fashionable and wellbred woman than by parading her newfounded pretensions to taste and patronage but such was not her own opinion and doubtless her ladyship was the best judge  on the other side of tyrrel sat lady binks lately the beautiful miss bonnyrigg who during the last season had made the company at the well alternately admire smile and stare by dancing the highest highland fling riding the wildest pony laughing the loudest laugh at the broadest joke and wearing the briefest petticoat of any nymph of st ronans few knew that this wild hoydenish halfmad humour was only superinduced over her real character for the purpose ofgetting well married she had fixed her eyes on sir bingo and was aware of his maxim that to catch him a girl must be in his own phrase bang up to every thing and that he would choose a wife for the neckornothing qualities which recommend a good hunter she made out her catchmatch and she was miserable her wild goodhumour was entirely an assumed part of her character which was passionate ambitious and thoughtful delicacy she had noneshe knew sir bingo was a brute and a fool even while she was hunting him down but she had so far mistaken her own feelings as not to have expected that when she became bone of his bone she should feel so much shame and anger when she saw his folly expose him to be laughed at and plundered or so disgusted when his brutality became intimately connected with herself it is true he was on the whole rather an innocent monster and between bitting and bridling coaxing and humouring might have been made to pad on well enough but an unhappy boggling which had taken place previous to the declaration of their private marriage had so exasperated her spirits against her helpmate that modes of conciliation were the last she was likely to adopt not only had the assistance of the scottish themis so propitiously indulgent to the foibles of the fair been resorted to on the occasion but even mars seemed ready to enter upon the tapis if hymen had not intervened there was de par le monde a certain brother of the ladyan officerand as it happened on leave of absencewho alighted from a hackchaise at the fox hotel at eleven oclock at night holding in his hand a slip of welldried oak accompanied by another gentleman who like himself wore a military travellingcap and a black stock out of the said chaise as was reported by the trusty toby was handed a small reisesac an andrew ferrara and a neat mahogany box eighteen inches long three deep and some six broad next morning a solemn palaver as the natives of madagascar call their national convention was held at an unusual hour at which captain macturk and mr mowbray assisted and the upshot was that at breakfast the company were made happy by the information that sir bingo had been for some weeks the happy bridegroom of their general favourite which union concealed for family reasons he was now at liberty to acknowledge and to fly with the wings of love to bring his sorrowing turtle from the shades to which she had retired till the obstacles to their mutual happiness could be removed now though all this sounded very smoothly that gallless turtle lady binks could never think of the tenor of the proceedings without the deepest feelings of resentment and contempt for the principal actor sir bingo  besides all these unpleasant circumstances sir bingos family had refused to countenance her wish that he should bring her to his own seat and hence a new shock to her pride and new matter of contempt against poor sir bingo for being ashamed and afraid to face down the opposition of his kinsfolk for whose displeasure though never attending to any good advice from them he retained a childish awe  the manners of the young lady were no less changed than was her temper and from being much too careless and free were become reserved sullen and haughty a consciousness that many scrupled to hold intercourse with her in society rendered her disagreeably tenacious of her rank and jealous of every thing that appeared like neglect she had constituted herself mistress of sir bingos purse and unrestrained in the expenses of dress and equipage chose contrary to her maiden practice to be rather rich and splendid than gay and to command that attention by magnificence which she no longer deigned to solicit by rendering herself either agreeable or entertaining one secret source of her misery was the necessity of showing deference to lady penelope penfeather whose understanding she despised and whose pretensions to consequence to patronage and to literature she had acuteness enough to see through and to contemn and this dislike was the more grievous that she felt she depended a good deal on lady penelopes countenance for the situation she was able to maintain even among the not very select society of st ronans well and that neglected by her she must have dropped lower in the scale even there neither was lady penelopes kindness to lady binks extremely cordial she partook in the ancient and ordinary dislike of single nymphs of a certain age to those who made splendid alliances under their very eyeand she more than suspected the secret disaffection of the lady but the name sounded well and the style in which lady binks lived was a credit to the place so they satisfied their mutual dislike with saying a few sharp things to each other occasionally but all under the mask of civility  such was lady binks and yet being such her dress and her equipage and carriages were the envy of half the misses at the well who while she sat disfiguring with sullenness her very lovely face for it was as beautiful as her shape was exquisite only thought she was proud of having carried her point and felt herself with her large fortune and diamond bandeau no fit company for the rest of the party they gave way therefore with meekness to her domineering temper though it was not the less tyrannical that in her maiden state of hoydenhood she had been to some of them an object of slight and of censure and lady binks had not forgotten the offences offered to miss bonnyrigg but the fair sisterhood submitted to her retaliations as lieutenants endure the bullying of a rude and boisterous captain of the sea with the secret determination to pay it home to their underlings when they shall become captains themselves  in this state of importance yet of penance lady binks occupied her place at the dinnertable alternately disconcerted by some stupid speech of her lord and master and by some slight sarcasm from lady penelope to which she longed to reply but dared not  she looked from time to time at her neighbour frank tyrrel but without addressing him and accepted in silence the usual civilities which he proffered to her she had remarked keenly his interview with sir bingo and knowing by experience the manner in which her honoured lord was wont to retreat from a dispute in which he was unsuccessful as well as his genius for getting into such perplexities she had little doubt that he had sustained from the stranger some new indignity whom therefore she regarded with a mixture of feeling scarce knowing whether to be pleased with him for having given pain to him whom she hated or angry with him for having affronted one in whose degradation her own was necessarily involved there might be other thoughtson the whole she regarded him with much though with mute attention he paid her but little in return being almost entirely occupied in replying to the questions of the engrossing lady penelope penfeather  receiving polite though rather evasive answers to her enquiries concerning his late avocations her ladyship could only learn that tyrrel had been travelling in several remote parts of europe and even of asia baffled but not repulsed the lady continued her courtesy by pointing out to him as a stranger several individuals of the company to whom she proposed introducing him as persons from whose society he might derive either profit or amusement in the midst of this sort of conversation however she suddenly stopped short  will you forgive me mr tyrrel she said if i say i have been watching your thoughts for some moments and that i have detected you all the while that i have been talking of these good folks and that you have been making such civil replies that they might be with great propriety and utility inserted in the familiar dialogues teaching foreigners how to express themselves in english upon ordinary occasionsyour mind has been entirely fixed upon that empty chair which hath remained there opposite betwixt our worthy president and sir bingo binks  i own madam he answered i was a little surprised at seeing such a distinguished seat unoccupied while the table is rather crowded  o confess more sirconfess that to a poet a seat unoccupiedthe chair of banquohas more charms than if it were filled even as an alderman would fill itwhat if the dark ladyei14 should glide in and occupy itwould you have courage to stand the vision mr tyrreli assure you the thing is not impossible  what is not impossible lady penelope said tyrrel somewhat surprised  startled alreadynay then i despair of your enduring the awful interview  what interview who is expected said tyrrel unable with the utmost exertion to suppress some signs of curiosity though he suspected the whole to be merely some mystification of her ladyship  how delighted i am she said that i have found out where you are vulnerableexpecteddid i say expectedno not expected      she glides like night from land to land     she hath strange power of speech  but come i have you at my mercy and i will be generous and explainwe callthat is among ourselves you understandmiss clara mowbray the sister of that gentleman that sits next to miss parker the dark ladye and that seat is left for herfor she was expectedno not expectedi forget againbut it was thought possible she might honour us today when our feast was so full and piquanther brother is our lord of the manorand so they pay her that sort of civility to regard her as a visitorand neither lady binks nor i think of objectingshe is a singular young person clara mowbrayshe amuses me very muchi am always rather glad to see her  she is not to come hither today said tyrrel am i so to understand your ladyship  why it is past her timeeven her time said lady penelopedinner was kept back half an hour and our poor invalids were famishing as you may see by the deeds they have done sincebut clara is an odd creature and if she took it into her head to come hither at this moment hither she would comeshe is very whimsicalmany people think her handsomebut she looks so like something from another world that she makes me always think of mat lewiss spectre lady  and she repeated with much cadence      there is a thingthere is a thing       i fain would have from thee     i fain would have that gay gold ring       o warrior give it me  and then you remember his answer      this ring lord brooke from his daughter took       and a solemn oath he swore     that that ladye my bride should be       when this crusade was oer  you do figures as well as landscapes i suppose mr tyrrelyou shall make a sketch for mea slight thingfor sketches i think show the freedom of art better than finished piecesi dote on the first coruscations of geniusflashing like lightning from the cloudyou shall make a sketch for my boudoirmy dear sulky den at air castle and clara mowbray shall sit for the ghost ladye  that would be but a poor compliment to your ladyships friend replied tyrrel  friend we dont get quite that length though i like clara very wellquite sentimental cast of facei think i saw an antique in the louvre very like heri was there in 1800quite an antique countenanceeyes something hollowedcare has dug caves for them but they are caves of the most beautiful marble arched with jeta straight nose and absolutely the grecian mouth and china profusion of long straight black hair with the whitest skin you ever sawas white as the whitest parchmentand not a shade of colour in her cheeknone whateverif she would be naughty and borrow a prudent touch of complexion she might be called beautiful even as it is many think her so although surely mr tyrrel three colours are necessary to the female face however we used to call her the melpomene of the spring last season as we called lady binkswho was not then lady binksour euphrosynedid we not my dear  did we not what madam said lady binks in a tone something sharper than ought to have belonged to so beautiful a countenance  i am sorry i have started you out of your reverie my love answered lady penelope i was only assuring mr tyrrel that you were once euphrosyne though now so much under the banners of il penseroso  i do not know that i have been either one or the other answered lady binks one thing i certainly am noti am not capable of understanding your ladyships wit and learning  poor soul whispered lady penelope to tyrrel we know what we are we know not what we may beand now mr tyrrel i have been your sibyl to guide you through this elysium of ours i think in reward i deserve a little confidence in return  if i had any to bestow which could be in the slightest degree interesting to your ladyship answered tyrrel  oh cruel manhe will not understand me exclaimed the ladyin plain words then a peep into your portfoliojust to see what objects you have rescued from natural decay and rendered immortal by the pencil you do not knowindeed mr tyrrel you do not know how i dote upon your serenely silent art second to poetry aloneequalsuperior perhapsto music  i really have little that could possibly be worth the attention of such a judge as your ladyship answered tyrrel such trifles as your ladyship has seen i sometimes leave at the foot of the tree i have been sketching  as orlando left his verses in the forest of ardennesoh the thoughtless prodigalitymr winterblossom do you hear thiswe must follow mr tyrrel in his walks and glean what he leaves behind him  her ladyship was here disconcerted by some laughter on sir bingos side of the table which she chastised by an angry glance and then proceeded emphatically  mr tyrrelthis must not bethis is not the way of the world my good sir to which even genius must stoop its flight we must consult the engraverthough perhaps you etch as well as you draw  i should suppose so said mr winterblossom edging in a word with difficulty from the freedom of mr tyrrels touch  i will not deny my having spoiled a little copper now and then said tyrrel since i am charged with the crime by such good judges but it has only been by way of experiment  say no more said the lady my darling wish is accomplishedwe have long desired to have the remarkable and most romantic spots of our little arcadia herespots consecrated to friendship the fine arts the loves and the graces immortalized by the gravers art faithful to its charge of fameyou shall labour on this task mr tyrrel we will all assist with notes and illustrationswe will all contributeonly some of us must be permitted to remain anonymousfairy favours you know mr tyrrel must be kept secretand you shall be allowed the pillage of the albumsome sweet things there of mr chatterlysand mr edgeit a gentleman of your own profession i am sure will lend his aiddr quackleben will contribute some scientific noticesand for subscription  financialfinancialyour leddyship i speak to order said the writer interrupting lady penelope with a tone of impudent familiarity which was meant doubtless for jocular ease  how am i out of order mr meiklewham said her ladyship drawing herself up  i speak to orderno warrants for money can be extracted before intimation to the committee of management  pray who mentioned money mr meiklewham said her ladyshipthat wretched old pettifogger she added in a whisper to tyrrel thinks of nothing else but the filthy pelf  ye spake of subscription my leddy whilk is the same thing as money differing only in respect of timethe subscription being a contract de futuro and having a tractus temporis in gremioand i have kend mony honest folks in the company at the well complain of the subscriptions as a great abuse as obliging them either to look unlike other folk or to gie good lawful coin for ballants and picturebooks and things they caredna a pinch of snuff for  several of the company at the lower end of the table assented both by nods and murmurs of approbation and the orator was about to proceed when tyrrel with difficulty procured a hearing before the debate went farther and assured the company that her ladyships goodness had led her into an error that he had no work in hand worthy of their patronage and with the deepest gratitude for lady penelopes goodness had it not in his power to comply with her request there was some tittering at her ladyships expense who as the writer slyly observed had been something ultronious in her patronage without attempting for the moment any rally as indeed the time which had passed since the removal of the dinner scarce permitted an opportunity lady penelope gave the signal for the ladies retreat and left the gentlemen to the circulation of the bottle  footnote  i14 note iithe dark ladye     chapter vii  the teatable                  while the cups     which cheer but not inebriate wait on each  cowper   it was common at the well for the fair guests occasionally to give tea to the companysuch at least as from their rank and leading in the little society might be esteemed fit to constitute themselves patronesses of an evening and the same lady generally carried the authority she had acquired into the ballroom where two fiddles and a bass at a guinea a night with a quantum sufficit of tallow candles against the use of which lady penelope often mutinied enabled the companyto use the appropriate phraseto close the evening on the light fantastic toe  on the present occasion the lion of the hour mr francis tyrrel had so little answered the highwrought expectations of lady penelope that she rather regretted having ever given herself any trouble about him and particularly that of having manoeuvred herself into the patronage of the teatable for the evening to the great expenditure of souchong and congo accordingly her ladyship had no sooner summoned her own woman and her fille de chambre to make tea with her page footman and postilion to hand it about in which duty they were assisted by two richlylaced and thicklypowdered footmen of lady binkss whose liveries put to shame the more modest garb of lady penelopes and even dimmed the glory of the suppressed coronet upon the buttons than she began to vilipend and depreciate what had been so long the object of her curiosity  this mr tyrrel she said in a tone of authoritative decision seems after all a very ordinary sort of person quite a commonplace man who she dared say had considered his condition in going to the old alehouse much better than they had done for him when they asked him to the public rooms he had known his own place better than they didthere was nothing uncommon in his appearance or conversationnothing at all frappantshe scarce believed he could even draw that sketch mr winterblossom indeed made a great deal of it but then all the world knew that every scrap of engraving or drawing which mr winterblossom contrived to make his own was the instant it came into his collection the finest thing that ever was seenthat was the way with collectorstheir geese were all swans  and your ladyships swan has proved but a goose my dearest lady pen said lady binks  my swan dearest lady binks i really do not know how i have deserved the appropriation  do not be angry my dear lady penelope i only mean that for a fortnight and more you have spoke constantly of this mr tyrrel and all dinnertime you spoke to him  the fair company began to collect around at hearing the word dear so often repeated in the same brief dialogue which induced them to expect sport and like the vulgar on a similar occasion to form a ring for the expected combatants  he sat betwixt us lady binks answered lady penelope with dignity you had your usual headache you know and for the credit of the company i spoke for one  for two if your ladyship pleases replied lady binks i mean she added softening the expression for yourself and me  i am sorry said lady penelope i should have spoken for one who can speak so smartly for herself as my dear lady binksi did not by any means desire to engross the conversationi repeat it there is a mistake about this man  i think there is said lady binks in a tone which implied something more than mere assent to lady penelopes proposition  i doubt if he is an artist at all said the lady penelope or if he is he must be doing things for some magazine or encyclopedia or some such matter  i doubt too if he be a professional artist said lady binks if so he is of the very highest class for i have seldom seen a betterbred man  there are very wellbred artists said lady penelope it is the profession of a gentleman  certainly answered lady binks but the poorer class have often to struggle with poverty and dependence in general society they are like commercial people in presence of their customers and that is a difficult part to sustain and so you see them of all sortsshy and reserved when they are conscious of meritpetulant and whimsical by way of showing their independenceintrusive in order to appear easyand sometimes obsequious and fawning when they chance to be of a mean spirit but you seldom see them quite at their ease and therefore i hold this mr tyrrel to be either an artist of the first class raised completely above the necessity and degradation of patronage or else to be no professional artist at all  lady penelope looked at lady binks with much such a regard as balaam may have cast upon his ass when he discovered the animals capacity for holding an argument with him she muttered to herself      mon ane parle et m√™me il parle bien  but declining the altercation which lady binks seemed disposed to enter into she replied with goodhumour well dearest rachel we will not pull caps about this mannay i think your good opinion of him gives him new value in my eyes that is always the way with us my good friend we may confess it when there are none of these conceited male wretches among us we will know what he really ishe shall not wear fernseed and walk among us invisible thuswhat say you maria  indeed i say dear lady penelope answered miss digges whose ready chatter we have already introduced to the reader he is a very handsome man though his nose is too big and his mouth too widebut his teeth are like pearland he has such eyesespecially when your ladyship spoke to him i dont think you looked at his eyesthey are quite deep and dark and full of glow like what you read to us in the letter from that lady about robert burns  upon my word miss you come on finely said lady penelopeone had need take care what they read or talk about before you i seecome jones have mercy upon usput an end to that symphony of tinkling cups and saucers and let the first act of the teatable begin if you please  does her leddyship mean the grace said honest mrs blower for the first time admitted into this worshipful society and busily employed in arranging an indian handkerchief that might have made a mainsail for one of her husbands smuggling luggers which she spread carefully on her knee to prevent damage to a flowered black silk gown from the repast of tea and cake to which she proposed to do due honourdoes her leddyship mean the grace i see the minister is just coming inher leddyship waits till ye say a blessing an ye please sir  mr winterblossom who toddled after the chaplain his toe having given him an alert hint to quit the diningtable though he saw every feature in the poor womans face swoln with desire to procure information concerning the ways and customs of the place passed on the other side of the way regardless of her agony of curiosity  a moment after she was relieved by the entrance of dr quackleben whose maxim being that one patient was as well worth attention as another and who knew by experience that the honoraria of a godly wife of the bowhead were as apt to be forthcoming if not more so as my lady penelopes he een sat himself quietly down by mrs blower and proceeded with the utmost kindness to enquire after her health and to hope she had not forgotten taking a tablespoonful of spirits burnt to a residuum in order to qualify the crudities  indeed doctor said the honest woman i loot the brandy burn as lang as i dought look at the gude creature wasting itsell that gateand then when i was fain to put it out for very thrift i did take a thimbleful of it although it is not the thing i am used to dr quackleben and i winna say but that it did me good  unquestionably madam said the doctor i am no friend to the use of alcohol in general but there are particular casesthere are particular cases mrs blowermy venerated instructor one of the greatest men in our profession that ever lived took a wineglassful of old rum mixed with sugar every day after his dinner  ay dear heart he would be a comfortable doctor that said mrs blower he wad maybe ken something of my case is he leevin think ye sir  dead for many years madam said dr quackleben and there are but few of his pupils that can fill his place i assure ye if i could be thought an exception it is only because i was a favourite ah blessings on the old red cloak of himit covered more of the healing science than the gowns of a whole modern university  there is ane sir said mrs blower that has been muckle recommended about edinburghmacgregor i think they ca himfolk come far and near to see himi15  i know whom you mean maama clever manno denying ita clever manbut there are certain casesyours for exampleand i think that of many that come to drink this waterwhich i cannot say i think he perfectly understandshastyvery hasty and rapid now ii give the disease its own way at firstthen watch it mrs blowerwatch the turn of the tide  ay troth thats true responded the widow john blower was aye watching turn of tide puir man  then he is a starving doctor mrs blowerreduces diseases as soldiers do townsby famine not considering that the friendly inhabitants suffer as much as the hostile garrisonahem  here he gave an important and emphatic cough and then proceeded  i am no friend either to excess or to violent stimulus mrs blowerbut nature must be supporteda generous dietcordials judiciously thrown innot without the advice of a medical manthat is my opinion mrs blower to speak as a friendothers may starve their patients if they have a mind  it wadna do for me the starving dr keekerben said the alarmed relictit wadna do for me at ajust a i can do to wear through the day with the sma supports that nature requiresnot a soul to look after me doctor since john blower was taen awathank ye kindly sir to the servant who handed the teathank ye my bonny man to the page who served the cakenow dinna ye think doctor in a low and confidential voice that her leddyships tea is rather of the weakliestwater bewitched i thinkand mrs jones as they ca her has cut the seedcake very thin  it is the fashion mrs blower answered dr quackleben and her ladyships tea is excellent but your taste is a little chilled which is not uncommon at the first use of the waters so that you are not sensible of the flavourwe must support the systemreinforce the digestive powersgive me leaveyou are a stranger mrs blower and we must take care of youi have an elixir which will put that matter to rights in a moment  so saying dr quackleben pulled from his pocket a small portable case of medicinescatch me without my toolshe said here i have the real useful pharmacopoeiathe rest is all humbug and hard namesthis little case with a fortnight or month spring and fall at st ronans well and no one will die till his day come  thus boasting the doctor drew from his case a large vial or small flask full of a highcoloured liquid of which he mixed three teaspoonfuls in mrs blowers cup who immediately afterwards allowed that the flavour was improved beyond all belief and that it was vera comfortable and restorative indeed  will it not do good to my complaints doctor said mr winterblossom who had strolled towards them and held out his cup to the physician  i by no means recommend it mr winterblossom said dr quackleben shutting up his case with great coolness your case is oedematous and you treat it your own wayyou are as good a physician as i am and i never interfere with another practitioners patient  well doctor said winterblossom i must wait till sir bingo comes inhe has a huntingflask usually about him which contains as good medicine as yours to the full  you will wait for sir bingo some time said the doctor he is a gentleman of sedentary habitshe has ordered another magnum  sir bingo is an unco name for a man o quality dinna ye think sae dr cocklehen said mrs blower john blower when he was a wee bit in the winds eye as he cad it puir fallowused to sing a sang about a dog they cad bingo that suld hae belanged to a farmer  our bingo is but a puppy yet madamor if a dog he is a sad dog said mr winterblossom applauding his own wit by one of his own inimitable smiles  or a mad dog rather said mr chatterly for he drinks no water and he also smiled gracefully at the thoughts of having trumped as it were the presidents pun  twa pleasant men doctor said the widow and so is sir bungy too for that matter but o is nae it a pity he should bide sae lang by the bottle it was puir john blowers faut too that weary tippling when he wan to the leeside of a bowl of punch there was nae raising himbut they are taking awa the things and doctor is it not an awfu thing that the creaturecomforts should hae been used without grace or thanksgivingthat mr chitterling if he really be a minister has muckle to answer for that he neglects his masters service  why madam said the doctor mr chatterly is scarce arrived at the rank of a minister plenipotentiary  a minister potentiaryah doctor i doubt that is some jest of yours said the widow thats sae like puir john blower when i wad hae had him gie up the lovely peggy ship and cargo the vessel was named after me doctor kittleben to be remembered in the prayers o the congregation he wad say to me they may pray that stand the risk peggy bryce for ive made insurance he was a merry man doctor but he had the root of the matter in him for a his light way of speaking as deep as ony skipper that ever loosed anchor from leith roads i hae been a forsaken creature since his deatho the weary days and nights that i have hadand the weight on the spiritsthe spirits doctorthough i canna say i hae been easier since i hae been at the wall than even nowif i kend what i was awing ye for elickstir doctor for its done me muckle hearts good forby the opening of my mind to you  fie fie maam said the doctor as the widow pulled out a sealskin pouch such as sailors carry tobacco in but apparently well stuffed with banknotesfie fie madami am no apothecaryi have my diploma from leydena regular physician madamthe elixir is heartily at your service and should you want any advice no man will be prouder to assist you than your humble servant  i am sure i am muckle obliged to your kindness dr kickalpin said the widow folding up her pouch this was puir john blowers spleuchani16 as they ca iti een wear it for his sake he was a kind man and left me comfortable in warlds gudes but comforts hae their cumbersto be a lone woman is a sair weird dr kittlepin  dr quackleben drew his chair a little nearer that of the widow and entered into a closer communication with her in a tone doubtless of more delicate consolation than was fit for the ears of the company at large  one of the chief delights of a wateringplace is that every ones affairs seem to be put under the special surveillance of the whole company so that in all probability the various flirtations liaisons and so forth which naturally take place in the society are not only the subject of amusement to the parties engaged but also to the lookers on that is to say generally speaking to the whole community of which for the time the said parties are members lady penelope the presiding goddess of the region watchful over all her circle was not long of observing that the doctor seemed to be suddenly engaged in close communication with the widow and that he had even ventured to take hold of her fair plump hand with a manner which partook at once of the gallant suitor and of the medical adviser  for the love of heaven said her ladyship who can that comely dame be on whom our excellent and learned doctor looks with such uncommon regard  fat fair and forty said mr winterblossom that is all i know of hera mercantile person  a carrack sir president said the chaplain richly laden with colonial produce by name the lovely peggy bryceno masterthe late john blower of north leith having pushed off his boat for the stygian creek and left the vessel without a hand on board  the doctor said lady penelope turning her glass towards them seems willing to play the part of pilot  i dare say he will be willing to change her name and register said mr chatterly  he can be no less in common requital said winterblossom she has changed his name six times in the five minutes that i stood within hearing of them  what do you think of the matter my dear lady binks said lady penelope  madam said lady binks starting from a reverie and answering as one who either had not heard or did not understand the question  i mean what think you of what is going on yonder  lady binks turned her glass in the direction of lady penelopes glance fixed the widow and the doctor with one bold fashionable stare and then dropping her hand slowly said with indifference i really see nothing there worth thinking about  i dare say it is a fine thing to be married said lady penelope ones thoughts i suppose are so much engrossed with ones own perfect happiness that they have neither time nor inclination to laugh like other folks miss rachel bonnyrigg would have laughed till her eyes ran over had she seen what lady binks cares so little abouti dare say it must be an allsufficient happiness to be married  he would be a happy man that could convince your ladyship of that in good earnest said mr winterblossom  oh who knowsthe whim may strike me replied the lady but nononoand that is three times  say it sixteen times more said the gallant president and let nineteen naysays be a grant  if i should say a thousand noes there exists not the alchymy in living man that could extract one yes out of the whole mass said her ladyship blessed be the memory of queen bessshe set us all an example to keep power when we have itwhat noise is that  only the usual afterdinner quarrel said the divine i hear the captains voice else most silent commanding them to keep peace in the devils name and that of the ladies  upon my word dearest lady binks this is too bad of that lord and master of yours and of mowbray who might have more sense and of the rest of that claretdrinking set to be quarrelling and alarming our nerves every evening with presenting their pistols perpetually at each other like sportsmen confined to the house upon a rainy 12th of august i am tired of the peacemakerhe but skins the business over in one case to have it break out elsewherewhat think you love if we were to give out in orders that the next quarrel which may arise shall be bona fide fought to an endwe will all go out and see it and wear the colours on each side and if there should a funeral come of it we will attend it in a bodyweeds are so becomingare they not my dear lady binks look at widow blower in her deep blackdont you envy her my love  lady binks seemed about to make a sharp and hasty answer but checked herself perhaps under the recollection that she could not prudently come to an open breach with lady penelopeat the same moment the door opened and a lady dressed in a ridinghabit and wearing a black veil over her hat appeared at the entry of the apartment  angels and ministers of grace exclaimed lady penelope with her very best tragic startmy dearest clara why so late and why thus will you step to my dressingroomjones will get you one of my gownswe are just of a size you knowdo praylet me be vain of something of my own for once by seeing you wear it  this was spoken in the tone of the fondest female friendship and at the same time the fair hostess bestowed on miss mowbray one of those tender caresses which ladiesgod bless themsometimes bestow on each other with unnecessary prodigality to the great discontent and envy of the male spectators  you are fluttered my dearest clarayou are feverishi am sure you are continued the sweetly anxious lady penelope let me persuade you to lie down  indeed you are mistaken lady penelope said miss mowbray who seemed to receive much as a matter of course her ladyships profusion of affectionate politenessi am heated and my pony trotted hard that is the whole mysterylet me have a cup of tea mrs jones and the matter is ended  fresh tea jones directly said lady penelope and led her passive friend to her own corner as she was pleased to call the recess in which she held her little courtladies and gentlemen curtsying and bowing as she passed to which civilities the new guest made no more return than the most ordinary politeness rendered unavoidable  lady binks did not rise to receive her but sat upright in her chair and bent her head very stiffly a courtesy which miss mowbray returned in the same stately manner without farther greeting on either side  now wha can that be doctor said the widow blowermind ye have promised to tell me all about the grand folkwha can that be that leddy penelope hauds such a racket wiand what for does she come wi a habit and a beaverhat when we are a a glance at her own gown in our silks and satins  to tell you who she is my dear mrs blower is very easy said the officious doctor she is miss clara mowbray sister to the lord of the manorthe gentleman who wears the green coat with an arrow on the cape to tell why she wears that habit or does any thing else would be rather beyond doctors skill truth is i have always thought she was a littlea very littletouchedcall it nerveshypochondriaor what you will  lord help us puir thing said the compassionate widowand troth it looks like it but its a shame to let her go loose doctorshe might hurt hersell or somebody see she has taen the knifeo its only to cut a shave of the dietloaf she winna let the powdermonkey of a boy help her theres judgment in that though doctor for she can cut thick or thin as she likesdear me she has not taken mair than a crumb than ane would pit between the wires of a canarybirds cage after alli wish she would lift up that lang veil or put off that ridingskirt doctor she should really be showed the regulations doctor kickelshin  she cares about no rules we can make mrs blower said the doctor and her brothers will and pleasure and lady penelopes whim of indulging her carry her through in every thing they should take advice on her case  ay truly its time to take advice when young creatures like her caper in amang dressed leddies just as if they were come from scampering on leith sandssuch a wark as my leddy makes wi her doctor ye would think they were baith fools of a feather  they might have flown on one wing for what i know said dr quackleben but there was early and sound advice taken in lady penelopes case my friend the late earl of featherhead was a man of judgmentdid little in his family but by rule of medicineso that what with the waters and what with my own care lady penelope is only freakishfancifulthats alland her quality bears it outthe peccant principle might have broken out under other treatment  ayshe has been weelfriended said the widow but this bairn mowbray puir thing how came she to be sae left to hersell  her mother was deadher father thought of nothing but his sports said the doctor her brother was educated in england and cared for nobody but himself if he had been here what education she got was at her own handwhat reading she read was in a library full of old romanceswhat friends or company she had was what chance sent herthen no familyphysician not even a good surgeon within ten miles and so you cannot wonder if the poor thing became unsettled  puir thingno doctornor even a surgeonbut doctor said the widow maybe the puir thing had the enjoyment of her health ye ken and then  ah ha hawhy then madam she needed a physician far more than if she had been delicate a skilful physician mrs blower knows how to bring down that robust health which is a very alarming state of the frame when it is considered secundum artem most sudden deaths happen when people are in a robust state of health ah that state of perfect health is what the doctor dreads most on behalf of his patient  ay ay doctori am quite sensible nae doubt said the widow of the great advantage of having a skeelfu person about ane  here the doctors voice in his earnestness to convince mrs blower of the danger of supposing herself capable of living and breathing without a medical mans permission sunk into a soft pleading tone of which our reporter could not catch the sound he was as great orators will sometimes be inaudible in the gallery  meanwhile lady penelope overwhelmed clara mowbray with her caresses in what degree her ladyship at her heart loved this young person might be difficult to ascertainprobably in the degree in which a child loves a favourite toy but clara was a toy not always to be come byas whimsical in her way as her ladyship in her own only that poor claras singularities were real and her ladyships chiefly affected without adopting the harshness of the doctors conclusions concerning the former she was certainly unequal in her spirits and her occasional fits of levity were chequered by very long intervals of sadness her levity also appeared in the worlds eye greater than it really was for she had never been under the restraint of society which was really good and entertained an undue contempt for that which she sometimes mingled with having unhappily none to teach her the important truth that some forms and restraints are to be observed less in respect to others than to ourselves her dress her manners and her ideas were therefore very much her own and though they became her wonderfully yet like ophelias garlands and wild snatches of melody they were calculated to excite compassion and melancholy even while they amused the observer  and why came you not to dinnerwe expected youyour throne was prepared  i had scarce come to tea said miss mowbray of my own freewill but my brother says your ladyship proposes to come to shawscastle and he insisted it was quite right and necessary to confirm you in so flattering a purpose that i should come and say pray do lady penelope and so now here am i to say pray do come  is an invitation so flattering limited to me alone my dear claralady binks will be jealous  bring lady binks if she has the condescension to

own particular regiment of bears which with the usual assortment of monkeys seen in all caravans will complete the menagerie how you are to be entertained at shawscastle is i thank heaven not my business but johns  we shall want no formal entertainment my love said lady penelope a d√©je√ªner √† la fourchettewe know clara you would die of doing the honours of a formal dinner  not a bit i should live long enough to make my will and bequeath all large parties to old nick who invented them  miss mowbray said lady binks who had been thwarted by this freespoken young lady both in her former character of a coquette and romp and in that of a prude which she at present woremiss mowbray declares for      champagne and a chicken at last  the chicken without the champagne if you please said miss mowbray i have known ladies pay dear to have champagne on the boardby the by lady penelope you have not your collection in the same order and discipline as pidcock and polito there was much growling and snarling in the lower den when i passed it  it was feedingtime my love said lady penelope and the lower animals of every class become pugnacious at that houryou see all our safer and wellconditioned animals are loose and in good order  oh yesin the keepers presence you knowwell i must venture to cross the hall again among all that growling and grumblingi would i had the fairy princes quarters of mutton to toss among them if they should break outhe i mean who fetched water from the fountain of lions however on second thoughts i will take the back way and avoid themwhat says honest bottom      for if they should as lions come in strife     into such place twere pity of their life  shall i go with you my dear said lady penelope  noi have too great a soul for thati think some of them are lions only as far as the hide is concerned  but why would you go so soon clara  because my errand is finishedhave i not invited you and yours and would not lord chesterfield himself allow i have done the polite thing  but you have spoke to none of the companyhow can you be so odd my love said her ladyship  why i spoke to them all when i spoke to you and lady binksbut i am a good girl and will do as i am bid  so saying she looked round the company and addressed each of them with an affectation of interest and politeness which thinly concealed scorn and contempt  mr winterblossom i hope the gout is bettermr robert rymari have escaped calling him thomas for oncei hope the public give encouragement to the musesmr keelavine i trust your pencil is busymr chatterly i

will say with her goodnight ladiesgood night sweet ladiesand nownot my coach my coachbut my horse my horse  so saying she tripped out of the room by a side passage leaving the ladies looking at each other significantly and shaking their heads with an expression of much import  something has ruffled the poor unhappy girl said lady penelope i never saw her so very odd before  were i to speak my mind said lady binks i think as mrs highmore says in the farce her madness is but a poor excuse for her impertinence  oh fie my sweet lady binks said lady penelope spare my poor favourite you surely of all others should forgive the excesses of an amiable eccentricity of temperforgive me my love but i must defend an absent friendmy lady binks i am very sure is too generous and candid to      hate for arts which caused herself to rise  not being conscious of any high elevation my lady answered lady binks i do not know any arts i have been under the necessity of practising to attain it i suppose a scotch lady of an ancient family may become the wife of an english baronet and no very extraordinary great cause to wonder at it  no surelybut people in this world will you know wonder at nothing answered lady penelope  if you envy me my poor quiz sir bingo ill get you a better lady pen  i dont doubt your talents my dear but when i want one i will get one for myselfbut here comes the whole

celebrated dr cullens personal habits is previously mentioned dr gregory was distinguished for putting his patients on a severe regimen  i16 a fur pouch for keeping tobacco     chapter viii  after dinner      they draw the cork they broach the barrel     and first they kiss and then they quarrel  prior   if the reader has attended much to the manners of the canine race he may have remarked the very different manner in which the individuals of the different sexes carry on their quarrels among each other the females are testy petulant and very apt to indulge their impatient dislike of each others presence or the spirit of rivalry which it produces in a sudden bark and snap which last is generally made as much at advantage as possible but these ebullitions of peevishness lead to no very serious or prosecuted conflict the affair begins and ends in a moment not so the ire of the male dogs which once produced and excited by growls of mutual offence and defiance leads generally to a fierce and obstinate contest in which if the parties be dogs of game and wellmatched they grapple throttle tear roll each other in the kennel and can only be separated by choking them with their own collars till they lose wind and hold at the same time or by surprising them out of their wrath by sousing them with cold water  the simile though a currish one will hold good in its application to the human race while the ladies in the tearoom of the fox hotel were engaged in the light snappish velitation or skirmish which we have described the gentlemen who remained in the parlour were more than once like to have quarrelled more seriously  we have mentioned the weighty reasons which induced mr mowbray to look upon the stranger whom a general invitation had brought into their society with unfavourable prepossessions and these were far from being abated by the demeanour of tyrrel which though perfectly wellbred indicated a sense of equality which the young laird of st ronans considered as extremely presumptuous  as for sir bingo he already began to nourish the genuine hatred always entertained by a mean spirit against an antagonist before whom it is conscious of having made a dishonourable retreat he forgot not the manner look and tone with which tyrrel had checked his unauthorized intrusion and though he had sunk beneath it at the moment the recollection rankled in his heart as an affront to be avenged as he drank his wine courage the want of which was in his more sober moments a check upon his bad temper began to inflame his malignity and he ventured upon several occasions to show his spleen by contradicting tyrrel more flatly than good manners permitted upon so short an acquaintance and without any provocation tyrrel saw his ill humour and despised it as that of an overgrown schoolboy whom it was not worth his while to answer according to his folly  one of the apparent causes of the baronets rudeness was indeed childish enough the company were talking of shooting the most animating topic of conversation among scottish country gentlemen of the younger class and tyrrel had mentioned something of a favourite setter an uncommonly handsome dog from which he had been for some time separated but which he expected would rejoin him in the course of next week  a setter retorted sir bingo with a sneer a pointer i suppose you mean  no sir said tyrrel i am perfectly aware of the difference betwixt a setter and a pointer and i know the oldfashioned setter is become unfashionable among modern sportsmen but i love my dog as a companion as well as for his merits in the field and a setter is more sagacious more attached and fitter for his place on the hearthrug than a pointernot he added from any deficiency of intellects on the pointers part but he is generally so abused while in the management of brutal breakers and grooms that he loses all excepting his professional accomplishments of finding and standing steady to game  and who the dl desires he should have more said sir bingo  many people sir bingo replied tyrrel have been of opinion that both dogs and men may follow sport indifferently well though they do happen at the same time to be fit for mixing in friendly intercourse in society  that is for licking trenchers and scratching copper i suppose said the baronet sotto voce and added in a louder and more distinct tonehe never before heard that a setter was fit to follow any mans heels but a poachers  you know it now then sir bingo answered tyrrel and i hope you will not fall into so great a mistake again  the peacemaker here seemed to think his interference necessary and surmounting his tactiturnity made the following pithy speechby cot and do you see as you are looking for my opinion i think there is no dispute in the matterbecause by cot it occurs to me dye see that ye are both right by cot it may do fery well for my excellent friend sir bingo who hath stables and kennels and what not to maintain the six filthy prutes that are yelping and yowling all the tay and all the neight too under my window by cotand if they are yelping and yowling there may i never die but i wish they were yelping and yowling somewhere else but then there is many a man who may be as cood a gentleman at the bottom as my worthy friend sir bingo though it may be that he is poor and if he is poorand as if it might be my own case or that of this honest gentleman mr tirlis that a reason or a law that he is not to keep a prute of a tog to help him to take his sports and his pleasures and if he has not a stable or a kennel to put the crature into must he not keep it in his pit of pedroom or upon his parlour hearth seeing that luckie dods would make the kitchen too hot for the paistand so if mr tirl finds a setter more fitter for his purpose than a pointer by cot i know no law against it else may i never die the black death  if this oration appear rather long for the occasion the reader must recollect that captain macturk had in all probability the trouble of translating it from the periphrastic language of ossian in which it was originally conceived in his own mind  the man of law replied to the man of peace ye are mistaken for ance in your life captain for there is a law against setters and i will undertake to prove them to be the lying dogs which are mentioned in the auld scots statute and which all and sundry are discharged to keep under a penalty of  here the captain broke in with a very solemn mien and dignified mannerby cot master meiklewham and i shall be asking what you mean by talking to me of peing mistaken and apout lying togs sirbecause i would have you to know and to pelieve and to very well consider that i never was mistaken in my life sir unless it was when i took you for a gentleman  no offence captain said mr meiklewham dinna break the wand of peace man you that should be the first to keep ithe is as cankered continued the man of law apart to his patron as an auld hieland terrier that snaps at whatever comes near itbut i tell you ae thing st ronans and that is on saul and conscience that i believe this is the very lad tirl that i raised a summons against before the justiceshim and another hempiein your fathers time for shooting on the springwellhead muirs  the devil you did mick replied the lord of the manor also asidewell i am obliged to you for giving me some reason for the ill thoughts i had of himi knew he was some trumpery scampill blow him by  whishtstophushhaud your tongue st ronanskeep a calm soughye see i intended the process by your worthy fathers desire before the quarter sessionsbut i ken nathe auld sheriffclerk stood the lads friendand some of the justices thought it was but a mistake of the marches and sae we couldna get a judgmentand your father was very ill of the gout and i was feared to vex him and so i was fain to let the process sleep for fear they had been assoilziedsae ye had better gang cautiously to wark st ronans for though they were summoned they were not convict  could you not take up the action again said mr mowbray  whew its been prescribed sax or seeven year syne it is a great shame st ronans that the game laws whilk are the very best protection that is left to country gentlemen against the encroachment of their inferiors rin sae short a course of prescriptiona poacher may just jink ye back and forward like a flea in a blanket wi pardonhap ye out of ae county and into anither at their pleasure like pyotsand unless ye get your thumnail on them in the very nick o time ye may dine on a dish of prescription and sup upon an absolvitor  it is a shame indeed said mowbray turning from his confident and agent and addressing himself to the company in general yet not without a peculiar look directed to tyrrel  what is a shame sir said tyrrel conceiving that the observation was particularly addressed to him  that we should have so many poachers upon our muirs sir answered st ronans i sometimes regret having countenanced the well here when i think how many guns it has brought on my property every season  hout fie hout awa st ronans said his man of law no countenance the waal what would the countryside be without it i would be glad to ken its the greatest improvement that has been made on this country since the year fortyfive na na its no the waal thats to blame for the poaching and delinquencies on the game we maun to the aultoun for the howf of that kind of cattle our rules at the waal are clear and express against trespassers on the game  i cant think said the squire what made my father sell the property of the old changehouse yonder to the hag that keeps it open out of spite i think and to harbour poachers and vagabondsi cannot conceive what made him do so foolish a thing  probably because your father wanted money sir said tyrrel dryly and my worthy landlady mrs dods had got someyou know i presume sir that i lodge there  oh sir replied mowbray in a tone betwixt scorn and civility you cannot suppose the present company is alluded to i only presumed to mention as a fact that we have been annoyed with unqualified people shooting on our grounds without either liberty or license and i hope to have her sign taken down for itthat is allthere was the same plague in my fathers days i think mick  but mr meiklewham who did not like tyrrels looks so well as to induce him to become approver on the occasion replied with an inarticulate grunt addressed to the company and a private admonition to his patrons own ear to let sleeping dogs lie  i can scarce forbear the fellow said st ronans and yet i cannot well tell where my dislike to him liesbut it would be dd folly to turn out with him for nothing and so honest mick i will be as quiet as i can  and that you may be so said meiklewham i think you had best take no more wine  i think so too said the squire for each glass i drink in his company gives me the heartburnyet the man is not different from other raffs eitherbut there is a something about him intolerable to me  so saying he pushed back his chair from the table andregis ad exemplarafter the pattern of the laird all the company arose  sir bingo got up with reluctance which he testified by two or three deep growls as he followed the rest of the company into the outer apartment which served as an entrancehall and divided the diningparlour from the tearoom as it was called here while the party were assuming their hats for the purpose of joining the ladies society which oldfashioned folk used only to take up for that of going into the open air tyrrel asked a smart footman who stood near to hand him the hat which lay on the table beyond  call your own servant sir answered the fellow with the true insolence of a pampered menial  your master answered tyrrel ought to have taught you good manners my friend before bringing you here  sir bingo binks is my master said the fellow in the same insolent tone as before  now for it bingie said mowbray who was aware that the baronets potcourage had arrived at fighting pitch  yes said sir bingo aloud and more articulately than usualthe fellow is my servantwhat has any one to say to it  i at least have my mouth stopped answered tyrrel with perfect composure i should have been surprised to have found sir bingos servant better bred than himself  what dye mean by that sir said sir bingo coming up in an offensive attitude for he was no mean pupil of the fivescourtwhat dye mean by that dn you sir ill serve you out before you can say dumpling  and i sir bingo unless you presently lay aside that look and manner will knock you down before you can cry help  the visitor held in his hand a slip of oak with which he gave a flourish that however slight intimated some acquaintance with the noble art of singlestick from this demonstration sir bingo thought it prudent somewhat to recoil though backed by a party of friends who in their zeal for his honour would rather have seen his bones broken in conflict bold than his honour injured by a discreditable retreat and tyrrel seemed to have some inclination to indulge them but at the very instant when his hand was raised with a motion of no doubtful import a whispering voice close to his ear pronounced the emphatic wordsare you a man  not the thrilling tone with which our inimitable siddons used to electrify the scene when she uttered the same whisper ever had a more powerful effect upon an auditor than had these unexpected sounds on him to whom they were now addressed tyrrel forgot every thinghis quarrelthe circumstances in which he was placedthe company the crowd was to him at once annihilated and life seemed to have no other object than to follow the person who had spoken but suddenly as he turned the disappearance of the monitor was at least equally so for amid the group of commonplace countenances by which he was surrounded there was none which assorted to the tone and words which possessed such a power over him make way he said to those who surrounded him and it was in the tone of one who was prepared if necessary to make way for himself  mr mowbray of st ronans stepped forward come sir said he this will not doyou have come here a stranger among us to assume airs and dignities which by gd would become a duke or a prince we must know who or what you are before we permit you to carry your high tone any farther  this address seemed at once to arrest tyrrels anger and his impatience to leave the company he turned to mowbray collected his thoughts for an instant and then answered him thusmr mowbray i seek no quarrel with any one herewith you in particular i am most unwilling to have any disagreement i came here by invitation not certainly expecting much pleasure but at the same time supposing myself secure from incivility in the last point i find myself mistaken and therefore wish the company goodnight i must also make my adieus to the ladies  so saying he walked several steps yet as it seemed rather irresolutely towards the door of the cardroomand then to the increased surprise of the company stopped suddenly and muttering something about the unfitness of the time turned on his heel and bowing haughtily as there was way made for him walked in the opposite direction towards the door which led to the outer hall  dme sir bingo will you let him off said mowbray who seemed to delight in pushing his friend into new scrapesto him manto himhe shows the white feather  sir bingo thus encouraged planted himself with a look of defiance exactly between tyrrel and the door upon which the retreating guest bestowing on him most emphatically the epithet fool seized him by the collar and flung him out of his way with some violence  i am to be found at the old town of st ronans by whomsoever has any concern with mewithout waiting the issue of this aggression farther than to utter these words tyrrel left the hotel he stopped in the courtyard however with the air of one uncertain whither he intended to go and who was desirous to ask some question which seemed to die upon his tongue at length his eye fell upon a groom who stood not far from the door of the inn holding in his hand a handsome pony with a sidesaddle  whosesaid tyrrelbut the rest of the question he seemed unable to utter  the man however replied as if he had heard the whole interrogationmiss mowbrays sir of st ronansshe leaves directlyand so i am walking the ponya clever thing sir for a lady  she returns to shawscastle by the buckstane road  i suppose so sir said the groom it is the nighest and miss clara cares little for rough roads zounds she can spank it over wet and dry  tyrrel turned away from the man and hastily left the hotelnot however by the road which led to the aultoun but by a footpath among the natural copsewood which following the course of the brook intersected the usual horseroad to shawscastle the seat of mr mowbray at a romantic spot called the buckstane  in a small peninsula formed by a winding of the brook was situated on a rising hillock a large roughhewn pillar of stone said by tradition to commemorate the fall of a stag of unusual speed size and strength whose flight after having lasted through a whole summers day had there terminated in death to the honour and glory of some ancient baron of st ronans and of his stanch hounds during the periodical cuttings of the copse which the necessities of the family of st ronans brought round more frequently than ponty would have recommended some oaks had been spared in the neighbourhood of this massive obelisk old enough perhaps to have heard the whoop and halloo which followed the fall of the stag and to have witnessed the raising of the rude monument by which that great event was commemorated these trees with their broad spreading boughs made a twilight even of noonday and now that the sun was approaching its setting point their shade already anticipated night this was especially the case where three or four of them stretched their arms over a deep gully through which winded the horsepath to shawscastle at a point about a pistolshot distant from the buckstane as the principal access to mr mowbrays mansion was by a carriageway which passed in a different direction the present path was left almost in a state of nature full of large stones and broken by gullies delightful from the varied character of its banks to the picturesque traveller and most inconvenient nay dangerous to him who had a stumbling horse  the footpath to the buckstane which here joined the bridleroad had been constructed at the expense of a subscription under the direction of mr winterblossom who had taste enough to see the beauties of this secluded spot which was exactly such as in earlier times might have harboured the ambush of some marauding chief this recollection had not escaped tyrrel to whom the whole scenery was familiar who now hastened to the spot as one which peculiarly suited his present purpose he sat down by one of the larger projecting trees and screened by its enormous branches from observation was enabled to watch the road from the hotel for a great part of its extent while he was himself invisible to any who might travel upon it  meanwhile his sudden departure excited a considerable sensation among the party whom he had just left and who were induced to form conclusions not very favourable to his character sir bingo in particular blustered loudly and more loudly in proportion to the increasing distance betwixt himself and his antagonist declaring his resolution to be revenged on the scoundrel for his insolenceto drive him from the neighbourhoodand i know not what other menaces of formidable import the devil in the old stories of di√†blerie was always sure to start up at the elbow of any one who nursed diabolical purposes and only wanted a little backing from the foul fiend to carry his imaginations into action the noble captain macturk had so far this property of his infernal majesty that the least hint of an approaching quarrel drew him always to the vicinity of the party concerned he was now at sir bingos side and was taking his own view of the matter in his character of peacemaker  by cot and its very exceedingly true my goot friend sir bincoand as you say it concerns your honour and the honour of the place and credit and character of the whole company by cot that this matter be properly looked after for as i think he laid hands on your body my excellent goot friend  hands captain macturk exclaimed sir bingo in some confusion no blast himnot so bad as that neitherif he had i should have handed him over the windowbut by  the fellow had the impudence to offer to collar mei had just stepped back to square at him when curse me the blackguard ran away  right vara right sir bingo said the man of law a vara perfect blackguard a poaching sorning sort of fallow that i will have scoured out of the country before he be three days aulder fash you your beard nae farther about the matter sir bingo  by cot but i can tell you mr meiklewham said the man of peace with great solemnity of visage that you are scalding your lips in other folks kale and that it is necessary for the credit and honour and respect of this company at the well of st ronans that sir bingo goes by more competent advice than yours upon the present occasion mr meiklewham for though your counsel may do very well in a small debt court here you see mr meiklewham is a question of honour which is not a thing in your line as i take it  no before george it is not answered meiklewham een take it all to yoursell captain and meikle ye are likely to make ont  then said the captain sir binco i will beg the favour of your company to the smoking room where we may have a cigar and a glass of gintwist and we will consider how the honour of the company must be supported and upholden upon the present conjuncture  the baronet complied with this invitation as much perhaps in consequence of the medium through which the captain intended to convey his warlike counsels as for the pleasure with which he anticipated the result of these counsels themselves he followed the military step of his leader whose stride was more stiff and his form more perpendicular when exalted by the consciousness of an approaching quarrel to the smokingroom where sighing as he lighted his cigar sir bingo prepared to listen to the words of wisdom and valour as they should flow in mingled stream from the lips of captain macturk  meanwhile the rest of the company joined the ladies here has been clara said lady penelope to mr mowbray here has been miss mowbray among us like the ray of a sun which does but dazzle and die  ah poor clara said mowbray i thought i saw her thread her way through the crowd a little while since but i was not sure  well said lady penelope she has asked us all up to shawscastle on thursday to a d√©je√ªner √† la fourchettei trust you confirm your sisters invitation mr mowbray  certainly lady penelope replied mowbray and i am truly glad clara has had the grace to think of ithow we shall acquit ourselves is a different question for neither she nor i are much accustomed to play host or hostess  oh it will be delightful i am sure said lady penelope clara has a grace in every thing she does and you mr mowbray can be a perfectly wellbred gentlemanwhen you please  that qualification is severewellgood manners be my speedi will certainly please to do my best when i see your ladyship at shawscastle which has received no company this many a dayclara and i have lived a wild life of it each in their own way  indeed mr mowbray said lady binks if i might presume to speaki think you do suffer your sister to ride about a little too much without an attendant i know miss mowbray rides as woman never rode before but still an accident may happen  an accident replied mowbrayah lady binks accidents happen as frequently when ladies have attendants as when they are without them  lady binks who in her maiden state had cantered a good deal about these woods under sir bingos escort coloured looked spiteful and was silent  besides said john mowbray more lightly where is the risk after all there are no wolves in our woods to eat up our pretty redriding hoods and no lions eitherexcept those of lady penelopes train  who draw the car of cybele said mr chatterly  lady penelope luckily did not understand the allusion which was indeed better intended than imagined  apropos she said what have you done with the great lion of the day i see mr tyrrel nowhereis he finishing an additional bottle with sir bingo  mr tyrrel madam said mowbray has acted successively the lion rampant and the lion passant he has been quarrelsome and he has run awayfled from the ire of your doughty knight lady binks  i am sure i hope not said lady binks my chevaliers unsuccessful campaigns have been unable to overcome his taste for quarrelsa victory would make a fightingman of him for life  that inconvenience might bring its own consolations said winterblossom apart to mowbray quarrellers do not usually live long  no no replied mowbray the ladys despair which broke out just now even in her own despite is quite naturalabsolutely legitimate sir bingo will give her no chance that way  mowbray then made his bow to lady penelope and in answer to her request that he would join the ball or the cardtable observed that he had no time to lose that the heads of the old domestics at shawscastle would be by this time absolutely turned by the apprehensions of what thursday was to bring forth and that as clara would certainly give no directions for the proper arrangements it was necessary that he should take that trouble himself  if you ride smartly said lady penelope you may save even a temporary alarm by overtaking clara dear creature ere she gets homeshe sometimes suffers her pony to go at will along the lane as slow as betty foys  ah but then said little miss digges miss mowbray sometimes gallops as if the lark was a snail to her ponyand it quite frights one to see her  the doctor touched mrs blower who had approached so as to be on the verge of the genteel circle though she did not venture within itthey exchanged sagacious looks and a most pitiful shake of the head mowbrays eye happened at that moment to glance on them and doubtless notwithstanding their hasting to compose their countenances to a different expression he comprehended what was passing through their mindsand perhaps it awoke a corresponding note in his own he took his hat and with a cast of thought upon his countenance which it seldom wore left the apartment a moment afterwards his horses feet were heard spurning the pavement as he started off at a sharp pace  there is something singular about these mowbrays tonight said lady penelopeclara poor dear angel is always particular but i should have thought mowbray had too much worldly wisdom to be fancifulwhat are you consulting your souvenir for with such attention my dear lady binks  only for the age of the moon said her ladyship putting the little tortoiseshellbound calendar into her reticule and having done so she proceeded to assist lady penelope in the arrangements for the evening  illustration     chapter ix  the meeting      we meet as shadows in the land of dreams     which speak not but in signs  anonymous   behind one of the old oaks which we have described in the preceding chapter shrouding himself from observation like a hunter watching for his game or an indian for his enemy but with different very different purpose tyrrel lay on his breast near the buckstane his eye on the horseroad which winded down the valley and his ear alertly awake to every sound which mingled with the passing breeze or with the ripple of the brook  to have met her in yonder congregated assembly of brutes and foolssuch was a part of his internal reflectionshad been little less than an act of madnessmadness almost equal in its degree to that cowardice which has hitherto prevented my approaching her when our eventful meeting might have taken place unobservedbut nownowmy resolution is as fixed as the place is itself favourable i will not wait till some chance again shall throw us together with an hundred malignant eyes to watch and wonder and stare and try in vain to account for the expression of feelings which i might find it impossible to suppressharkharki hear the tread of a horsenoit was the changeful sound of the water rushing over the pebbles surely she cannot have taken the other road to shawscastlenothe sounds become distincther figure is visible on the path coming swiftly forwardhave i the courage to show myselfi havethe hour is come and what must be shall be  yet this resolution was scarcely formed ere it began to fluctuate when he reflected upon the fittest manner of carrying it into execution to show himself at a distance might give the lady an opportunity of turning back and avoiding the interview which he had determined uponto hide himself till the moment when her horse in rapid motion should pass his lurkingplace might be attended with danger to the riderand while he hesitated which course to pursue there was some chance of his missing the opportunity of presenting himself to miss mowbray at all he was himself sensible of this formed a hasty and desperate resolution not to suffer the present moment to escape and just as the ascent induced the pony to slacken its pace tyrrel stood in the middle of the defile about six yards distant from the young lady  she pulled up the reins and stopped as if arrested by a thunderboltclaratyrrel these were the only words which were exchanged between them until tyrrel moving his feet as slowly as if they had been of lead began gradually to diminish the distance which lay betwixt them it was then that observing his closer approach miss mowbray called out with great eagernessno nearerno nearerso long have i endured your presence but if you approach me more closely i shall be mad indeed  what do you fear said tyrrel in a hollow voicewhat can you fear and he continued to draw nearer until they were within a pace of each other  clara meanwhile dropping her bridle clasped her hands together and held them up towards heaven muttering in a voice scarcely audible great godif this apparition be formed by my heated fancy let it pass away if it be real enable me to bear its presencetell me i conjure you are you francis tyrrel in blood and body or is this but one of those wandering visions that have crossed my path and glared on me but without daring to abide my steadfast glance  i am francis tyrrel answered he in blood and body as much as she to whom i speak is clara mowbray  then god have mercy on us both said clara in a tone of deep feeling  amen said tyrrelbut what avails this excess of agitationyou saw me but now miss mowbrayyour voice still rings in my earsyou saw me but nowyou spoke to meand that when i was among strangerswhy not preserve your composure when we are where no human eye can seeno human ear can hear  is it so said clara and was it indeed yourself whom i saw even nowi thought so and something i said at the timebut my brain has been but ill settled since we last metbut i am well nowquite welli have invited all the people yonder to come to shawscastlemy brother desired me to do iti hope i shall have the pleasure of seeing mr tyrrel therethough i think there is some old grudge between my brother and you  alas clara you mistake your brother i have scarcely seen replied tyrrel much distressed and apparently uncertain in what tone to address her which might soothe and not irritate her mental malady of which he could now entertain no doubt  truetrue she said after a moments reflection my brother was then at college it was my father my poor father whom you had some quarrel withbut you will come to shawscastle on thursday at two oclockjohn will be glad to see youhe can be kind when he pleasesand then we will talk of old timesi must get on to have things readygood evening  she would have passed him but he took gently hold of the rein of her bridlei will walk with you clara he said the road is rough and dangerousyou ought not to ride fasti will walk along with you and we will talk of former times now more conveniently than in company  truetruevery true mr tyrrelit shall be as you say my brother obliges me sometimes to go into company at that hateful place down yonder and i do so because he likes it and because the folks let me have my own way and come and go as i list do you know tyrrel that very often when i am there and john has his eye on me i can carry it on as gaily as if you and i had never met  i would to god we never had said tyrrel in a trembling voice since this is to be the end of all  and wherefore should not sorrow be the end of sin and of folly and when did happiness come of disobedienceand when did sound sleep visit a bloody pillow that is what i say to myself tyrrel and that is what you must learn to say too and then you will bear your burden as cheerfully as i endure mine if we have no more than our deserts why should we complainyou are shedding tears i thinkis not that childishthey say it is a reliefif so weep on and i will look another way  tyrrel walked on by the ponys side in vain endeavouring to compose himself so as to reply  poor tyrrel said clara after she had remained silent for some timepoor frank tyrrelperhaps you will say in your turn poor clarabut i am not so poor in spirit as youthe blast may bend but it shall never break me  there was another long pause for tyrrel was unable to determine with himself in what strain he could address the unfortunate young lady without awakening recollections equally painful to her feelings and dangerous when her precarious state of health was considered at length she herself proceeded  what needs all this tyrreland indeed why came you herewhy did i find you but now brawling and quarrelling among the loudest of the brawlers and quarrellers of yonder idle and dissipated debaucheesyou were used to have more tempermore sense another personay another that you and i once knewhe might have committed such a folly and he would have acted perhaps in characterbut you who pretend to wisdomfor shame for shameand indeed when we talk of that what wisdom was there in coming hither at allor what good purpose can your remaining here servesurely you need not come either to renew your own unhappiness or to augment mine  to augment yoursgod forbid answered tyrrel noi came hither only because after so many years of wandering i longed to revisit the spot where all my hopes lay buried  ayburied is the word she replied crushed down and buried when they budded fairest i often think of it tyrrel and there are times when heaven help me i can think of little elselook at meyou remember what i wassee what grief and solitude have made me  she flung back the veil which surrounded her ridinghat and which had hitherto hid her face it was the same countenance which he had formerly known in all the bloom of early beauty but though the beauty remained the bloom was fled for ever not the agitation of exercisenot that which arose from the pain and confusion of this unexpected interview had called to poor claras cheek even the momentary semblance of colour her complexion was marblewhite like that of the finest piece of statuary  is it possible said tyrrel can grief have made such ravages  grief replied clara is the sickness of the mind and its sister is the sickness of the bodythey are twinsisters tyrrel and are seldom long separate sometimes the bodys disease comes first and dims our eyes and palsies our hands before the fire of our mind and of our intellect is quenched but mark mesoon after comes her cruel sister with her urn and sprinkles cold dew on our hopes and on our loves our memory our recollections and our feelings and shows us that they cannot survive the decay of our bodily powers  alas said tyrrel is it come to this  to this she replied speaking from the rapid and irregular train of her own ideas rather than comprehending the purport of his sorrowful exclamationto this it must ever come while immortal souls are wedded to the perishable substance of which our bodies are composed there is another state tyrrel in which it will be otherwisegod grant our time of enjoying it were come  she fell into a melancholy pause which tyrrel was afraid to disturb the quickness with which she spoke marked but too plainly the irregular succession of thought and he was obliged to restrain the agony of his own feelings rendered more acute by a thousand painful recollections lest by giving way to his expressions of grief he should throw her into a still more disturbed state of mind  i did not think she proceeded that after so horrible a separation and so many years i could have met you thus calmly and reasonably but although what we were formerly to each other can never be forgotten it is now all over and we are only friendsis it not so  tyrrel was unable to reply  but i must not remain here she said till the evening grows darker on mewe shall meet again tyrrelmeet as friendsnothing moreyou will come up to shawscastle and see meno need of secrecy nowmy poor father is in his grave and his prejudices sleep with himmy brother john is kind though he is stern and severe sometimesindeed tyrrel i believe he loves me though he has taught me to tremble at his frown when i am in spirits and talk too muchbut he loves me at least i think so for i am sure i love him and i try to go down amongst them yonder and to endure their folly and all things considered i do carry on the farce of life wonderfully wellwe are but actors you know and the world but a stage  and ours has been a sad and tragic scene said tyrrel in the bitterness of his heart unable any longer to refrain from speech  it has indeedbut tyrrel when was it otherwise with engagements formed in youth and in folly you and i would you know become men and women while we were yet scarcely more than childrenwe have run while yet in our nonage through the passions and adventures of youth and therefore we are now old before our day and the winter of our life has come on ere its summer was well beguno tyrrel often and often have i thought of thisthought of it often alas when will the time come that i shall be able to think of any thing else  the poor young woman sobbed bitterly and her tears began to flow with a freedom which they had not probably enjoyed for a length of time tyrrel walked on by the side of her horse which now prosecuted its road homewards unable to devise a proper mode of addressing the unfortunate young lady and fearing alike to awaken her passions and his own whatever he might have proposed to say was disconcerted by the plain indications that her mind was clouded more or less slightly with a shade of insanity which deranged though it had not destroyed her powers of judgment  at length he asked her with as much calmness as he could assumeif she was contentedif aught could be done to render her situation more easyif there was aught of which she could complain which he might be able to remedy she answered gently that she was calm and resigned when her brother would permit her to stay at home but that when she was brought into society she experienced such a change as that which the water of the brook that slumbers in a crystalline pool of the rock may be supposed to feel when gliding from its quiet bed it becomes involved in the hurry of the cataract  but my brother mowbray she said thinks he is rightand perhaps he is so there are things on which we may ponder too longand were he mistaken why should i not constrain myself in order to please himthere are so few left to whom i can now give either pleasure or paini am a gay girl too in conversation tyrrelstill as gay for a moment as when you used to chide me for my folly so now i have told you alli have one question to ask on my partone questionif i had but breath to ask itis he still alive  he lives answered tyrrel but in a tone so low that nought but the eager attention which miss mowbray paid could possibly have caught such feeble sounds  lives she exclaimedliveshe lives and the blood on your hand is not then indelibly imprintedo tyrrel did you but know the joy which this assurance gives to me  joy replied tyrreljoy that the wretch lives who has poisoned our happiness for everlives perhaps to claim you for his own  never never shall hedare he do so replied clara wildly while water can drown while cords can strangle steel piercewhile there is a precipice on the hill a pool in the rivernevernever  be not thus agitated my dearest clara said tyrrel i spoke i know not whathe lives indeedbut far distant and i trust never again to revisit scotland  he would have said more but that agitated with fear or passion she struck her horse impatiently with her ridingwhip the spirited animal thus stimulated and at the same time restrained became intractable and reared so much that tyrrel fearful of the consequences and trusting to claras skill as a horsewoman thought he best consulted her safety in letting go the rein the animal instantly sprung forward on the broken and hilly path at a very rapid pace and was soon lost to tyrrels anxious eyes  as he stood pondering whether he ought not to follow miss mowbray towards shawscastle in order to be satisfied that no accident had befallen her on the road he heard the tread of a horses feet advancing hastily in the same direction leading from the hotel unwilling to be observed at this moment he stepped aside under shelter of the underwood and presently afterwards saw mr mowbray of st ronans followed by a groom ride hastily past his lurkingplace and pursue the same road which had been just taken by his sister the presence of her brother seemed to assure miss mowbrays safety and so removed tyrrels chief reason for following her involved in deep and melancholy reflection upon what had passed nearly satisfied that his longer residence in claras vicinity could only add to her unhappiness and his own yet unable to tear himself from that neighbourhood or to relinquish feelings which had become entwined with his heartstrings he returned to his lodgings in the aultoun in a state of mind very little to be envied  tyrrel on entering his apartment found that it was not lighted nor were the abigails of mrs dods quite so alert as a waiter at longs might have been to supply him with candles unapt at any time to exact much personal attendance and desirous to shun at that moment the necessity of speaking to any person whatever even on the most trifling subject he walked down into the kitchen to supply himself with what he wanted he did not at first observe that mrs dods herself was present in this the very centre of her empire far less that a lofty air of indignation was seated on the worthy matrons brow at first it only vented itself in broken soliloquy and interjections as for example vera bonny wark thisvera creditable wark indeeda decent house to be disturbed at these hourskeep a publicas weel keep a bedlam  finding these murmurs attracted no attention the dame placed herself betwixt her guest and the door to which he was now retiring with his lighted candle and demanded of him what was the meaning of such behaviour  of what behaviour madam said her guest repeating her question in a tone of sternness and impatience so unusual with him that perhaps she was sorry at the moment that she had provoked him out of his usual patient indifference nay she might even feel intimidated at the altercation she had provoked for the resentment of a quiet and patient person has always in it something formidable to the professed and habitual grumbler but her pride was too great to think of a retreat after having sounded the signal for contest and so she continued though in a tone somewhat lowered  maister tirl i wad but just ask you that are a man of sense whether i hae ony right to take your behaviour weel here have you been these ten days and mair eating the best and drinking the best and taking up the best room in my house and now to think of your gaun doun and taking up with yon idle harebrained cattle at the waali maun een be plain wi yei like nane of the fairfashioned folk that can say my jo and think it no and therefore  mrs dods said tyrrel interrupting her i have no time at present for trifles i am obliged to you for your attention while i have been in your house but the disposal of my time here or elsewhere must be according to my own ideas of pleasure or businessif you are tired of me as a guest send in your bill tomorrow  my bill said mrs dods my bill tomorrow and what for no wait till saturday when it may be cleared atween us plack and bawbee as it was on saturday last  wellwe will talk of it tomorrow mrs dodsgoodnight and he withdrew accordingly  luckie dods stood ruminating for a moment the deils in him she said for he winna bide being thrawn and i think the deils in me too for thrawing him sic a canny lad and sae gude a customerand i am judging he has something on his mindwant of siller it canna bei am sure if i thought that i wadna care about my small thingbut want o siller it canna behe pays ower the shillings as if they were sclate stanes and thats no the way that folk part with their siller when theres but little onti ken weel eneugh how a customer looks thats near the grund of the purseweel i hope he winna mind ony thing of this nonsense the morn and ill try to guide my tongue something betterhegh sirs but as the minister says its an unruly membertroth i am whiles ashamed ot mysell     chapter x  resources      come let me have thy counsel for i need it     thou art of those who better help their friends     with sage advice than usurers with gold     or brawlers with their swordsill trust to thee     for i ask only from thee words not deeds  the devil hath met his match   the day of which we last gave the events chanced to be monday and two days therefore intervened betwixt it and that for which the entertainment was fixed that was to assemble in the halls of the lord of the manor the flower of the company now at st ronans well the interval was but brief for the preparations necessary on an occasion so unusual since the house though delightfully situated was in very indifferent repair and for years had never received any visitors except when some blithe bachelor or foxhunter shared the hospitality of mr mowbray an event which became daily more and more uncommon for as he himself almost lived at the well he generally contrived to receive his companions where it could be done without expense to himself besides the health of his sister afforded an irresistible apology to any of those oldfashioned scottish gentlemen who might be too apt in the rudeness of more primitive days to consider a friends house as their own mr mowbray was now however to the great delight of all his companions nailed down by invitation given and accepted and they looked forward to the accomplishment of his promise with the eagerness which the prospect of some entertaining novelty never fails to produce among idlers  a good deal of trouble devolved on mr mowbray and his trusty agent mr meiklewham before any thing like decent preparation could be made for the ensuing entertainment and they were left to their unassisted endeavours by clara who during both the tuesday and wednesday obstinately kept herself secluded nor could her brother either by threats or flattery extort from her any light concerning her purpose on the approaching and important thursday to do john mowbray justice he loved his sister as much as he was capable of loving any thing but himself and when in several arguments he had the mortification to find that she was not to be prevailed on to afford her assistance he without complaint quietly set himself to do the best he could by his own unassisted judgment or opinion with regard to the necessary preparations  this was not at present so easy a task as might be supposed for mowbray was ambitious of that character of ton and elegance which masculine faculties alone are seldom capable of attaining on such momentous occasions the more solid materials of a collation were indeed to be obtained for money from the next markettown and were purchased accordingly but he felt it was likely to present the vulgar plenty of a farmers feast instead of the elegant entertainment which might be announced in a corner of the county paper as given by john mowbray esq of st ronans to the gay and fashionable company assembled at that celebrated spring there was likely to be all sorts of error and irregularity in dishing and in sending up for shawscastle boasted neither an accomplished housekeeper nor a kitchenmaid with a hundred pair of hands to execute her mandates all the domestic arrangements were on the minutest system of economy consistent with ordinary decency except in the stables which were excellent and well kept but can a groom of the stables perform the labours of a groom of the chambers or can the gamekeeper arrange in tempting order the carcasses of the birds he has shot strew them with flowers and garnish them with piquant sauces it would be as reasonable to expect a gallant soldier to act as undertaker and conduct the funeral of the enemy he has slain  in a word mowbray talked and consulted and advised and squabbled with the deaf cook and a little old man whom he called the butler until he at length perceived so little chance of bringing order out of confusion or making the least advantageous impression on such obdurate understandings as he had to deal with that he fairly committed the whole matter of the collation with two or three hearty curses to the charge of the officials principally concerned and proceeded to take the state of the furniture and apartments under his consideration  here he found himself almost equally helpless for what male wit is adequate to the thousand little coquetries practised in such arrangements how can masculine eyes judge of the degree of demijour which is to be admitted into a decorated apartment or discriminate where the broad light should be suffered to fall on a tolerable picture where it should be excluded lest the stiff daub of a periwigged grandsire should become too rigidly prominent and if men are unfit for weaving such a fairy web of light and darkness as may best suit furniture ornaments and complexions how shall they be adequate to the yet more mysterious office of arranging while they disarrange the various movables in the apartment so that while all has the air of negligence and chance the seats are placed as if they had been transported by a wish to the spot most suitable for accommodation stiffness and confusion are at once avoided the company are neither limited to a formal circle of chairs nor exposed to break their noses over wandering stools but the arrangements seem to correspond to what ought to be the tone of the conversation easy without being confused and regulated without being constrained or stiffened  then how can a clumsy male wit attempt the arrangement of all the chiffonerie by which old snuffboxes heads of canes pomander boxes lamer beads and all the trash usually found in the pigeonholes of the bureaus of oldfashioned ladies may be now brought into play by throwing them carelessly grouped with other unconsidered trifles such as are to be seen in the windows of a pawnbrokers shop upon a marble encognure or a mosaic worktable thereby turning to advantage the trash and trinketry which all the old maids or magpies who have inhabited the mansion for a century have contrived to accumulate with what admiration of the ingenuity of the fair artist have i sometimes pried into these miscellaneous groups of pseudobijouterie and seen the great grandsires thumbring couchant with the coral and bells of the firstbornand the boatswains whistle of some old naval uncle or his silver tobaccobox redolent of oroonoko happily grouped with the mothers ivory combcase still odorous of musk and with some virgin aunts tortoiseshell spectaclecase and the eagles talon of ebony with which in the days of long and stiff stays our grandmothers were wont to alleviate any little irritation in their back or shoulders then there was the silver strainer on which in more economical times than ours the lady of the house placed the tealeaves after the very last drop had been exhausted that they might afterwards be hospitably divided among the company to be eaten with sugar and with bread and butter blessings upon a fashion which has rescued from the claws of abigails and the meltingpot of the silversmith those neglected cimelia for the benefit of antiquaries and the decoration of sidetables but who shall presume to place them there unless under the direction of female taste and of that mr mowbray though possessed of a large stock of such treasures was for the present entirely deprived  this digression upon his difficulties is already too long or i might mention the lairds inexperience in the art of making the worse appear the better garnishment of hiding a darned carpet with a new floorcloth and flinging an indian shawl over a faded and threadbare sofa but i have said enough and more than enough to explain his dilemma to an unassisted bachelor who without mother sister or cousin without skilful housekeeper or experienced clerk of the kitchen or valet of parts and figure adventures to give an entertainment and aspires to make it elegant and comme il faut  the sense of his insufficiency was the more vexatious to mowbray as he was aware he would find sharp critics in the ladies and particularly in his constant rival lady penelope penfeather he was therefore incessant in his exertions and for two whole days ordered and disordered demanded commanded countermanded and reprimanded without pause or cessation the companion for he could not be termed an assistant of his labours was his trusty agent who trotted from room to room after him affording him exactly the same degree of sympathy which a dog doth to his master when distressed in mind by looking in his face from time to time with a piteous gaze as if to assure him that he partakes of his trouble though he neither comprehends the cause or the extent of it nor has in the slightest degree the power to remove it  at length when mowbray had got some matters arranged to his mind and abandoned a great many which he would willingly have put in better order he sat down to dinner upon the wednesday preceding the appointed day with his worthy aidedecamp mr meiklewham and after bestowing a few muttered curses upon the whole concern and the fantastic old maid who had brought him into the scrape by begging an invitation declared that all things might now go to the devil their own way for so sure as his name was john mowbray he would trouble himself no more about them  keeping this doughty resolution he sat down to dinner with his counsel learned in the law and speedily they dispatched the dish of chops which was set before them and the better part of the bottle of old port which served for its menstruum  we are well enough now said mowbray though we have had none of their dd kickshaws  a wamefou is a wamefou said the writer swabbing his greasy chops whether it be of the barleymeal or the bran  a carthorse thinks so said mowbray but we must do as others do and gentlemen and ladies are of a different opinion  the waur for themselves and the country baith st ronansits the jinketing and the jirbling wi tea and wi trumpery that brings our nobles to ninepence and mony a het hahouse to a hired lodging in the abbey  the young gentleman paused for a few minutesfilled a bumper and pushed the bottle to the seniorthen said abruptly do you believe in luck mick  in luck answered the attorney what do you mean by the question  why because i believe in luck myselfin a good or bad run of luck at cards  you wad have mair luck the day if you had never touched them replied his confident  that is not the question now said mowbray but what i wonder at is the wretched chance that has attended us miserable lairds of st ronans for more than a hundred years that we have always been getting worse in the world and never better never has there been such a backsliding generation as the parson would sayhalf the country once belonged to my ancestors and now the last furrows of it seem to be flying  fleeing said the writer they are barking and fleeing baiththis shawscastle here ise warrant it flee up the chimney after the rest were it not weel fastened down with your grandfathers tailzie  damn the tailzie said mowbray if they had meant to keep up their estate they should have entailed it when it was worth keeping to tie a man down to such an insignificant thing as st ronans is like tethering a horse on six roods of a highland moor  ye have broke weel in on the mailing by your feus down at the well said meiklewham and raxed ower the tether maybe a wee bit farther than ye had ony right to do  it was by your advice was it not said the laird  ise neer deny it st ronans answered the writer but i am such a gudenatured guse that i just set about pleasing you as an auld wife pleases a bairn  ay said the man of pleasure when she reaches it a knife to cut its own fingers withthese acres would have been safe enough if it had not been for your dd advice  and yet you were grumbling een now said the man of business that you have not the power to gar the whole estate flee like a wildduck across a bog troth you need care little about it for if you have incurred an irritancyand sae thinks mr wisebehind the advocate upon an a b memorial that i laid before himyour sister or your sisters goodman if she should take the fancy to marry might bring a declarator and evict st ronans frae ye in the course of twa or three sessions  my sister will never marry said john mowbray  thats easily said replied the writer but as broken a ships come to land if ony body kend o the chance she has o the estate theres mony a weeldoing man would think little of the bee in her bonnet  harkye mr meiklewham said the laird i will be obliged to you if you will speak of miss mowbray with the respect due to her fathers daughter and my sister  nae offence st ronans nae offence answered the man of law but ilka man maun speak sae as to be understoodthat is when he speaks about business ye ken yoursell that miss clara is no just like other folk and were i youits my duty to speak plaini wad een gie in a bit scroll of a petition to the lords to be appointed curator bonis in respect of her incapacity to manage her own affairs  meiklewham said mowbray you are aand then stopped short  what am i mr mowbray said meiklewham somewhat sternlywhat am i i wad be glad to ken what i am  a very good lawyer i dare say replied st ronans who was too much in the power of his agent to give way to his first impulse but i must tell you that rather than take such a measure against poor clara as you recommend i would give her up the estate and become an ostler or a postilion for the rest of my life  ah st ronans said the man of law if you had wished to keep up the auld house you should have taken another trade than to become an ostler or a postilion what ailed you man but to have been a lawyer as weel as other folk my auld maister had a wee bit latin about rerum dominos gentemque togatam whilk signified he said that all lairds should be lawyers  all lawyers are likely to become lairds i think replied mowbray they purchase our acres by the thousand and pay us according to the old story with a multiplepoinding as your learned friends call it mr meiklewham  weeland mightna you have purchased as weel as other folk  not i replied the laird i have no turn for that service i should only have wasted bombazine on my shoulders and flour upon my threetailed wigshould but have lounged away my mornings in the outerhouse and my evenings at the playhouse and acquired no more law than what would have made me a wise justice at a smalldebt court  if you gained little you would have lost as little said meiklewham and albeit ye were nae great gun at the bar ye might aye have gotten a sheriffdom or a commissaryship amang the lave to keep the banes green and sae ye might have saved your estate from deteriorating if ye didna mend it muckle  yes but i could not have had the chance of doubling it as i might have done answered mowbray had that inconstant jade fortune but stood a moment faithful to me i tell you mick that i have been within this twelvemonth worth a hundred thousandworth fifty thousandworth nothing but the remnant of this wretched estate which is too little to do one good while it is mine though were it sold i could start again and mend my hand a little  ay ay just fling the helve after the hatchet said his legal adviserthats a you think of what signifies winning a hundred thousand pounds if you win them to lose them a again  what signifies it replied mowbray why it signifies as much to a man of spirit as having won a battle signifies to a generalno matter that he is beaten afterwards in his turn he knows there is luck for him as well as others and so he has spirit to try it again here is the young earl of etherington will be amongst us in a day or twothey say he is up to every thingif i had but five hundred to begin with i should be soon up to him  mr mowbray said meiklewham i am sorry for ye i have been your houses manofbusinessi may say in some measure your houses servantand now i am to see an end of it all and just by the lad that i thought maist likely to set it up again better than ever for to do ye justice you have aye had an ee to your ain interest sae far as your lights gaed it brings tears into my auld een  never weep for the matter mick answered mowbray some of it will stick my old boy in your pockets if not in mineyour service will not be altogether gratuitous my old friendthe labourer is worthy of his hire  weel i wot is he said the writer but double fees would hardly carry folk through some wark but if ye will have siller ye maun have sillerbut i warrant it goes just where the rest gaed  no by twenty devils exclaimed mowbray to fail this time is impossiblejack wolverine was too strong for etherington at any thing he could name and i can beat wolverine from the landsend to johnnie groatsbut there must be something to go uponthe blunt must be had mick  very likelynae doubtthat is always provided it can be had answered the legal adviser  thats your business my old cock said mowbray this youngster will be here perhaps tomorrow with money in both pocketshe takes up his rents as he comes down mickthink of that my old friend  weel for them that have rents to take up said meiklewham ours are lying rather ower low to be lifted at presentbut are you sure this earl is a man to mell withare you sure ye can win of him and that if you do he can pay his losings mr mowbraybecause i have kend mony are come for wool and gang hame shorn and though ye are a clever young gentleman and i am bound to suppose ye ken as much about life as most folk and all that yet some gate or other ye have aye come off at the losing hand as ye have ower much reason to ken this dayhowbeit  o the devil take your gossip my dear mick if you can give no help spare drowning me with your potherwhy man i was a fresh handhad my apprenticefees to payand these are no trifles mickbut what of thati am free of the company now and can trade on my own bottom  aweel aweel i wish it may be sae said meiklewham  it will be so and it shall be so my trusty friend replied mowbray cheerily so you will but help me to the stock to trade with  the stockwhat dye ca the stock i ken nae stock that ye have left  but you have plenty my old boycome sell out a few of your three per cents i will pay differenceinterestexchangeevery thing  ay ayevery thing or naething answered meiklewham but as you are sae very pressing i hae been thinkingwhan is the siller wanted  this instantthis daytomorrow at farthest exclaimed the proposed borrower  whew whistled the lawyer with a long prolongation of the note the thing is impossible  it must be mick for all that answered mr mowbray who knew by experience that impossible when uttered by his accommodating friend in this tone meant only when interpreted extremely difficult and very expensive  then it must be by miss clara selling her stock now that ye speak of stock said meiklewham i wonder ye didna think of this before  i wish you had been dumb rather than that you had mentioned it now said mowbray starting as if stung by an adderwhat claras pittancethe trifle my aunt left her for her own fanciful expensesher own little private store that she puts to so many good purposespoor clara that has so littleand why not rather your own master meiklewham who call yourself the friend and servant of our family  ay st ronans answered meiklewham that is a very truebut service is nae inheritance and as for friendship it begins at hame as wise folk have said lang before our time and for that matter i think they that are nearest sib should take maist risk you are nearer and dearer to your sister st ronans than you are to poor saunders meiklewham that hasna sae muckle gentle blood as would supper up an hungry flea  i will not do this said st ronans walking up and down with much agitation for selfish as he was he loved his sister and loved her the more on account of those peculiarities which rendered his protection indispensable to her comfortable existencei will not he said pillage her come ont what will i will rather go a volunteer to the continent and die like a gentleman  he continued to pace the room in a moody silence which began to disturb his companion who had not been hitherto accustomed to see his patron take matters so deeply at length he made an attempt to attract the attention of the silent and sullen ponderer  mr mowbrayno answeri was saying st ronansstill no reply i have been thinking about this matterand  and what sir said st ronans stopping short and speaking in a stern tone of voice  and to speak truth i see little feasibility in the matter ony way for if ye had the siller in your pocket today it would be a in the earl of etheringtons the morn  pshaw you are a fool answered mowbray  that is not unlikely said meiklewham but so is sir bingo binks and yet hes had the better of you st ronans this twa or three times  it is falsehe has not answered st ronans fiercely  weel i wot resumed meiklewham he took you in about the saumon fish and some other wager ye lost to him this very day  i tell you once more meiklewham you are a fool and no more up to my trim than you are to the longitudebingo is got shyi must give him a little line that is allthen i shall strike him to purposei am as sure of him as i am of the otheri know the fly they will both rise tothis cursed want of five hundred will do me out of ten thousand  if you are so certain of being the bangsterso very certain i mean of sweeping stakeswhat harm will miss clara come to by your having the use of her siller you can make it up to her for the risk ten times told  and so i can by heaven said st ronans mick you are right and i am a scrupulous chickenhearted fool clara shall have a thousand for her poor five hundredshe shall by  and i will carry her to edinburgh for a season or perhaps to london and we will have the best advice for her case and the best company to divert her and if they think her a little oddwhy d me i am her brother and will bear her through it yesyesyoure right there can be no hurt in borrowing five hundred of her for a few days when such profit may be made ont both for her and mehere fill the glasses my old boy and drink success to it for you are right  here is success to it with all my heart answered meiklewham heartily glad to see his patrons sanguine temper arrive at this desirable conclusion and yet willing to hedge in his own credit but it is you are right and not me for i advise nothing except on your assurances that you can make your ain of this english earl and of this sir bingoand if you can but do that i am sure it would be unwise and unkind in ony ane of your friends to stand in your light  true mick true answered mowbrayand yet dice and cards are but bones and pasteboard and the best horse ever started may slip a shoulder before he get to the winningpostand so i wish claras venture had not been in such a bottombut hang it care killed a cati can hedge as well as any one if the odds turn up against meso let us have the cash mick  aha but there go two words to that bargainthe stock stands in my name and tam turnpenny the bankers as trustees for miss claranow get you her letter to us desiring us to sell out and to pay you the proceeds and tam turnpenny will let you have five hundred pounds instanter on the faith of the transaction for i fancy you would desire a the stock to be sold out and it will produce more than six hundred or seven hundred pounds eitherand i reckon you will be selling out the wholeits needless making twa bites of a cherry  true answered mowbray since we must be rogues or something like it let us make it worth our while at least so give me a form of the letter and clara shall copy itthat is if she consents for you know she can keep her own opinion as well as any other woman in the world  and that said meiklewham is as the wind will keep its way preach to it as ye like but if i might advise about miss clarai wad say naething mair than that i was stressed for the penny money for i mistake her muckle if she would like to see you ganging to pitch and toss wi this lord and tither baronet for her aunts three per centsi ken she has some queer notionsshe gies away the feck of the dividends on that very stock in downright charity  and i am in hazard to rob the poor as well as my sister said mowbray filling once more his own glass and his friends come mick no skylightshere is claras healthshe is an angeland i amwhat i will not call myself and suffer no other man to call mebut i shall win this timei am sure i shall since claras fortune depends upon it  now i think on the other hand said meiklewham that if any thing should chance wrang and heaven kens that the bestlaid schemes will gang ajee it will be a great comfort to think that the ultimate losers will only be the poor folk that have the parish between them and absolute starvationif your sister spent her ain siller it would be a very different story  hush mickfor gods sake hush mine honest friend said mowbray it is quite true thou art a rare counsellor in time of need and hast as happy a manner of reconciling a mans conscience with his necessities as might set up a score of casuists but beware my most zealous counsellor and confessor how you drive the nail too fari promise you some of the chaffing you are at just now rather abates my pluckwellgive me your scrolli will to clara with itthough i would rather meet the best shot in britain with ten paces of green sod betwixt us so saying he left the apartment     chapter xi  fraternal love      nearest of blood should still be next in love     and when i see these happy children playing     while william gathers flowers for ellens ringlets     and ellen dresses flies for williams angle     i scarce can think that in advancing life     coldness unkindness interest or suspicion     will eer divide that unity so sacred     which nature bound at birth  anonymous    when mowbray had left his dangerous adviser in order to steer the course which his agent had indicated without offering to recommend it he went to the little parlour which his sister was wont to term her own and in which she spent great part of her time it was fitted up with a sort of fanciful neatness and in its perfect arrangement and good order formed a strong contrast to the other apartments of the old and neglected mansionhouse a number of little articles lay on the worktable indicating the elegant and at the same time the unsettled turn of the inhabitants mind there were unfinished drawings blotted music needlework of various kinds and many other little female tasks all undertaken with zeal and so far prosecuted with art and elegance but all flung aside before any one of them was completed  clara herself sat upon a little low couch by the window reading or at least turning over the leaves of a book in which she seemed to read but instantly starting up when she saw her brother she ran towards him with the most cordial cheerfulness  welcome welcome my dear john this is very kind of you to come to visit your recluse sister i have been trying to nail my eyes and my understanding to a stupid book here because they say too much thought is not quite good for me but either the mans dulness or my want of the power of attending makes my eyes pass over the page just as one seems to read in a dream without being able to comprehend one word of the matter you shall talk to me and that will do better what can i give you to show that you are welcome i am afraid tea is all i have to offer and that you set too little store by  i shall be glad of a cup at present said mowbray for i wish to speak with you  then jessy shall make it ready instantly said miss mowbray ringing and giving orders to her waitingmaidbut you must not be ungrateful john and plague me with any of the ceremonial for your f√™tesufficient for the day is the evil thereof i will attend and play my part as prettily as you can desire but to think of it beforehand would make both my head and my heart ache and so i beg you will spare me on the subject  why you wild kitten said mowbray you turn every day more shy of human communicationwe shall have you take the woods one day and become as savage as the princess caraboo but i will plague you about nothing if i can help it if matters go not smooth on the great day they must een blame the dull thick head that had no fair lady to help him in his need but clara i had something more material to say to yousomething indeed of the last importance  what is it said clara in a tone of voice approaching to a screamin the name of god what is it you know not how you terrify me  nay you start at a shadow clara answered her brother it is no such uncommon matter neithergood faith it is the most common distress in the world so far as i know the worldi am sorely pinched for money  is that all replied clara in a tone which seemed to her brother as much to underrate the difficulty when it was explained as her fears had exaggerated it before she heard its nature  is that all indeed it is all and comprehends a great deal of vexation i shall be hard run unless i can get a certain sum of moneyand i must een ask you if you can help me  help you replied clara yes with all my heartbut you know my purse is a light onemore than half of my last dividend is in it however and i am sure john i shall be happy if it can serve youespecially as that will at least show that your wants are but small ones  alas clara if you would help me said her brother half repentant of his purpose you must draw the neck of the goose which lays the golden eggsyou must lend me the whole stock  and why not john said the simplehearted girl if it will do you a kindness are you not my natural guardian are you not a kind one and is not my little fortune entirely at your disposal you will i am sure do all for the best  i fear i may not said mowbray starting from her and more distressed by her sudden and unsuspicious compliance than he would have been by difficulties or remonstrance in the latter case he would have stifled the pangs of conscience amid the manoeuvres which he must have resorted to for obtaining her acquiescence as matters stood there was all the difference that there is between slaughtering a tame and unresisting animal and pursuing wild game until the animation of the sportsmans exertions overcomes the internal sense of his own crueltyie the same idea occurred to mowbray himself  by g he said this is like shooting the bird sittingclara he added i fear this money will scarce be employed as you would wish  employ it as you yourself please my dearest brother she replied and i will believe it is all for the best  nay i am doing for the best he replied at least i am doing what must be done for i see no other way through itso all you have to do is to copy this paper and bid adieu to bank dividendsfor a little while at least i trust soon to double this little matter for you if fortune will but stand my friend  do not trust to fortune john said clara smiling though with an expression of deep melancholy alas she has never been a friend to our familynot at least for many a day  she favours the bold say my old grammatical exercises answered her brother and i must trust her were she as changeable as a weathercockand yetif she should jilt mewhat will you dowhat will you say clara if i am unable contrary to my hope trust and expectation to repay you this money within a short time  do replied clara i must do without it you know and for saying i will not say a word  true replied mowbray but your little expensesyour charitiesyour halt and blindyour round of paupers  well i can manage all that too look you here john how many halfworked trifles there are the needle or the pencil is the resource of all distressed heroines you know and i promise you though i have been a little idle and unsettled of late yet when i do set about it no emmeline or ethelinde of them all ever sent such loads of trumpery to market as i shall or made such wealth as i will do i dare say lady penelope and all the gentry at the well will purchase and will raffle and do all sort of things to encourage the pensive performer i will send them such lots of landscapes with sapgreen trees and mazareenblue rivers and portraits that will terrify the originals themselvesand handkerchiefs and turbans with needlework scallopped exactly like the walks on the belviderewhy i shall become a little fortune in the first season  no clara said john gravely for a virtuous resolution had gained the upperhand in his bosom while his sister ran on in this mannerwe will do something better than all this if this kind help of yours does not fetch me through i am determined i will cut the whole concern it is but standing a laugh or two and hearing a gay fellow say d me jack are you turned clodhopper at lastthat is the worst dogs horses and all shall go to the hammer we will keep nothing but your pony and i will trust to a pair of excellent legs there is enough left of the old acres to keep us in the way you like best and that i will learn to like i will work in the garden and work in the forest mark my own trees and cut them myself keep my own accounts and send saunders meiklewham to the devil  that last is the best resolution of all john said clara and if such a day should come round i should be the happiest of living creaturesi should not have a grief left in the worldif i had you should never see or hear of itit should lie here she said pressing her hand on her bosom buried as deep as a funereal urn in a cold sepulchre oh could we not begin such a life tomorrow if it is absolutely necessary that this trifle of money should be got rid of first throw it into the river and think you have lost it amongst gamblers and horsejockeys  claras eyes which she fondly fixed on her brothers face glowed through the tears which her enthusiasm called into them while she thus addressed him mowbray on his part kept his looks fixed on the ground with a flush on his cheek that expressed at once false pride and real shame  at length he looked upmy dear girl he said how foolishly you talk and how foolishly i that have twenty things to do stand here listening to you all will go smooth on my planif it should not we have yours in reserve and i swear to you i will adopt it the trifle which this letter of yours enables me to command may have luck in it and we must not throw up the cards while we have a chance of the gamewere i to cut from this moment these few hundreds would make us little better or little worseso you see we have two strings to our bow luck is sometimes against me that is truebut upon true principle and playing on the square i can manage the best of them or my name is not mowbray adieu my dearest clara so saying he kissed her cheek with a more than usual degree of affection  ere he could raise himself from his stooping posture she threw her arm kindly over his neck and said with a tone of the deepest interest my dearest brother your slightest wish has been and ever shall be a law to meoh if you would but grant me one request in return  what is it you silly girl said mowbray gently disengaging himself from her holdwhat is it you can have to ask that needs such a solemn prefaceremember i hate prefaces and when i happen to open a book always skip them  without preface then my dearest brother will you for my sake avoid those quarrels in which the people yonder are eternally engaged i never go down there but i hear of some new brawl and i never lay my head down to sleep but i dream that you are the victim of it even last night  nay clara if you begin to tell your dreams we shall never have done sleeping to be sure is the most serious employment of your lifefor as to eating you hardly match a sparrow but i entreat you to sleep without dreaming or to keep your visions to yourselfwhy do you keep such fast hold of mewhat on earth can you be afraid ofsurely you do not think the blockhead binks or any other of the good folks below yonder dared to turn on me egad i wish they would pluck up a little mettle that i might have an excuse for drilling them gad i would soon teach them to follow at heel  no john replied his sister it is not of such men as these that i have any fearand yet cowards are sometimes driven to desperation and become more dangerous than better menbut it is not such as these that i fear but there are men in the world whose qualities are beyond their seemingwhose spirit and courage lie hidden like metals in the mine under an unmarked or a plain exterioryou may meet with suchyou are rash and headlong and apt to exercise your wit without always weighing consequences and thus  on my word clara answered mowbray you are in a most sermonizing humour this morning the parson himself could not have been more logical or profound you have only to divide your discourse into heads and garnish it with conclusions for use and conclusions for doctrine and it might be preached before a whole presbytery with every chance of instruction and edification but i am a man of the world my little clara and though i wish to go in deaths way as little as possible i must not fear the rawhead and bloodybones neitherand who the devil is to put the question to mei must know that clara for you have some especial person in your eye when you bid me take care of quarrelling  clara could not become paler than was her usual complexion but her voice faltered as she eagerly assured her brother that she had no particular person in her thoughts  clara said her brother do you remember when there was a report of a boglei17 in the upper orchard when we were both childrendo you remember how you were perpetually telling me to take care of the bogle and keep away from its hauntsand do you remember my going on purpose to detect the bogle finding the cowboy with a shirt about him busied in pulling pears and treating him to a handsome drubbingi am the same jack mowbray still as ready to face danger and unmask imposition and your fears clara will only make me watch more closely till i find out the real object of them if you warn me of quarrelling with some one it must be because you know some one who is not unlikely to quarrel with me you are a flighty and fanciful girl but you have sense enough not to trouble either yourself or me on a point of honour save when there is some good reason for it  clara once more protested and it was with the deepest anxiety to be believed that what she had said arose only out of the general consequences which she apprehended from the line of conduct her brother had adopted and which in her apprehension was so likely to engage him in the broils that divided the good company at the spring mowbray listened to her explanation with an air of doubt or rather incredulity sipped a cup of tea which had for some time been placed before him and at length replied well clara whether i am right or wrong in my guess it would be cruel to torment you any more remembering what you have just done for me but do justice to your brother and believe that when you have any thing to ask of him an explicit declaration of your wishes will answer your purpose much better than any ingenious oblique attempts to influence me give up all thoughts of such my dear clarayou are but a poor manoeuvrer but were you the very machiavel of your sex you should not turn the flank of john mowbray  he left the room as he spoke and did not return though his sister twice called upon him it is true that she uttered the word brother so faintly that perhaps the sound did not reach his earshe is gone she said and i have had no power to speak out i am like the wretched creatures who it is said lie under a potent charm that prevents them alike from shedding tears and from confessing their crimesyes there is a spell on this unhappy heart and either that must be dissolved or this must break  footnote  i17 boglein english goblin     chapter xii  the challenge      a slight note i have about me for the delivery of which you must     excuse me it is an office which friendship calls upon me to do and     no way offensive to you as i desire nothing but right on both     sides  king and no king   the intelligent reader may recollect that tyrrel departed from the fox hotel on terms not altogether so friendly towards the company as those under which he entered it indeed it occurred to him that he might probably have heard something farther on the subject though amidst matters of deeper and more anxious consideration the idea only passed hastily through his mind and two days having gone over without any message from sir bingo binks the whole affair glided entirely out of his memory  the truth was that although never old woman took more trouble to collect and blow up with her bellows the embers of her decayed fire than captain macturk kindly underwent for the purpose of puffing into a flame the dying sparkles of the baronets courage yet two days were spent in fruitless conferences before he could attain the desired point he found sir bingo on these different occasions in all sorts of different moods of mind and disposed to view the thing in all shades of light except what the captain thought was the true onehe was in a drunken humourin a sullen humourin a thoughtless and vilipending humourin every humour but a fighting one and when captain macturk talked of the reputation of the company at the well sir bingo pretended to take offence said the company might go to the devil and hinted that he did them sufficient honour by gracing them with his countenance but did not mean to constitute them any judges of his affairs the fellow was a raff and he would have nothing to do with him  captain macturk would willingly have taken measures against the baronet himself as in a state of contumacy but was opposed by winterblossom and other members of the committee who considered sir bingo as too important and illustrious a member of their society to be rashly expelled from a place not honoured by the residence of many persons of rank and finally insisted that nothing should be done in the matter without the advice of mowbray whose preparations for his solemn festival on the following thursday had so much occupied him that he had not lately appeared at the well  in the meanwhile the gallant captain seemed to experience as much distress of mind as if some stain had lain on his own most unblemished of reputations he went up and down upon the points of his toes rising up on his instep with a jerk which at once expressed vexation and defiancehe carried his nose turned up in the air like that of a pig when he snuffs the approaching stormhe spoke in monosyllables when he spoke at all andwhat perhaps illustrated in the strongest manner the depth of his feelingshe refused in face of the whole company to pledge sir bingo in a glass of the baronets peculiar cogniac  at length the whole well was alarmed by the report brought by a smart outrider that the young earl of etherington reported to be rising on the horizon of fashion as a star of the first magnitude intended to pass an hour or a day or a week as it might happen for his lordship could not be supposed to know his own mind at st ronans well  this suddenly put all in motion almanacks were opened to ascertain his lordships age enquiries were made concerning the extent of his fortune his habits were quoted his tastes were guessed at and all that the ingenuity of the managing committee could devise was resorted to in order to recommend their spa to this favourite of fortune an express was dispatched to shawscastle with the agreeable intelligence which fired the train of hope that led to mowbrays appropriation of his sisters capital he did not however think proper to obey the summons to the spring for not being aware in what light the earl might regard the worthies there assembled he did not desire to be found by his lordship in any strict connexion with them  sir bingo binks was in a different situation the bravery with which he had endured the censure of the place began to give way when he considered that a person of such distinction as that which public opinion attached to lord etherington should find him bodily indeed at st ronans but so far as society was concerned on the road towards the ancient city of coventry and his banishment thither incurred by that most unpardonable offence in modern morality a solecism in the code of honour though sluggish and inert when called to action the baronet was by no means an absolute coward or if so he was of that class which fights when reduced to extremity he manfully sent for captain macturk who waited upon him with a grave solemnity of aspect which instantly was exchanged for a radiant joy when sir bingo in a few words empowered him to carry a message to that dd strolling artist by whom he had been insulted three days since  by cot said the captain my exceedingly goot and excellent friend and i am happy to do such a favour for you and its well you have thought of it yourself because if it had not been for some of our very goot and excellent friends that would be putting their spoon into other folks dish i should have been asking you a civil question myself how you came to dine with us with all that mud and mire which mr tyrrels grasp has left upon the collar of your coatyou understand mebut it is much better as it is and i will go to the man with all the speed of light and though to be sure it should have been sooner thought of yet let me alone to make an excuse for that just in my own civil waybetter late thrive than never do well you know sir bingo and if you have made him wait a little while for his morning you must give him the better measure my darling  so saying he awaited no reply lest peradventure the commission with which he was so hastily and unexpectedly charged should have been clogged with some condition of compromise no such proposal however was made on the part of the doughty sir bingo who eyed his friend as he hastily snatched up his rattan to depart with a dogged look of obstinacy expressive to use his own phrase of a determined resolution to come up to the scratch and when he heard the captains parting footsteps and saw the door shut behind him he valiantly whistled a few bars of jenny sutton in token he cared not a farthing how the matter was to end  with a swifter pace than his halfpay leisure usually encouraged or than his habitual dignity permitted captain macturk cleared the ground betwixt the spring and its gay vicinity and the ruins of the aultoun where reigned our friend meg dods the sole assertor of its ancient dignities to the door of the cleikum inn the captain addressed himself as one too much accustomed to war to fear a rough reception although at the very first aspect of meg who presented her person at the half opened door his military experience taught him that his entrance into the place would in all probability be disputed  is mr tyrrel at home was the question and the answer was conveyed by the counterinterrogation wha may ye be that speers  as the most polite reply to this question and an indulgence at the same time of his own taciturn disposition the captain presented to luckie dods the fifth part of an ordinary playing card much grimed with snuff which bore on its blank side his name and quality but luckie dods rejected the information thus tendered with contemptuous scorn  nane of your deils playbooks for me said she its an ill world since sic prickmydainty doings came in fashionits a poor tongue that canna tell its ain name and ill hae nane of your scarts upon pasteboard  i am captain macturk of the  regiment said the captain disdaining further answer  macturk repeated meg with an emphasis which induced the owner of the name to reply yes honest womanmacturkhector macturkhave you any objections to my name goodwife  nae objections have i answered meg its een an excellent name for a heathenbut captain macturk since sae it be that ye are a captain ye may een face about and march your ways hame again to the tune of dumbarton drums for ye are ganging to have nae speech of maister tirl or ony lodger of mine  and wherefore not demanded the veteran and is this of your own foolish head honest woman or has your lodger left such orders  maybe he has and maybe no answered meg sturdily and i ken nae mair right that ye suld ca me honest woman than i have to ca you honest man whilk is as far frae my thoughts as it wad be from heavens truth  the woman is deleerit said captain macturk but coom cooma gentleman is not to be misused in this way when he comes on a gentlemans business so make you a bit room on the doorstane that i may pass by you or i will make room for myself by cot to your small pleasure  and so saying he assumed the air of a man who was about to make good his passage but meg without deigning farther reply flourished around her head the hearthbroom which she had been employing to its more legitimate purpose when disturbed in her housewifery by captain macturk  i ken your errand weel eneugh captainand i ken yoursell ye are ane of the folk that gang about yonder setting folk by the lugs as callants set their collies to fight but ye sall come to nae lodger o mine let abe maister tirl wi ony sic ungodly errand for i am ane that will keep gods peace and the kings within my dwelling  so saying and in explicit token of her peaceable intentions she again flourished her broom  the veteran instinctively threw himself under saint georges guard and drew two paces back exclaiming that the woman was either mad or as drunk as whisky could make her an alternative which afforded meg so little satisfaction that she fairly rushed on her retiring adversary and began to use her weapon to fell purpose  me drunk ye scandalous blackguard a blow with the broom interposed as parenthesis me that am fasting from all but sin and bohea another whack  the captain swearing exclaiming and parrying caught the blows as they fell showing much dexterity in singlestick the people began to gather and how long his gallantry might have maintained itself against the spirit of selfdefence and revenge must be left uncertain for the arrival of tyrrel returned from a short walk put a period to the contest  meg who had a great respect for her guest began to feel ashamed of her own violence and slunk into the house observing however that she trewed she had made her hearthbroom and the auld heathens pow right weel acquainted the tranquillity which ensued upon her departure gave tyrrel an opportunity to ask the captain whom he at length recognised the meaning of this singular affray and whether the visit was intended for him to which the veteran replied very discomposedly that he should have known that long enough ago if he had had decent people to open his door and answer a civil question instead of a flyting madwoman who was worse than an eagle he said or a mastiffbitch or a shebear or any other female beast in the creation  half suspecting his errand and desirous to avoid unnecessary notoriety tyrrel as he showed the captain to the parlour which he called his own entreated him to excuse the rudeness of his landlady and to pass from the topic to that which had procured him the honour of this visit  and you are right my good master tyrrel said the captain pulling down the sleeves of his coat adjusting his handkerchief and breastruffle and endeavouring to recover the composure of manner becoming his mission but still adverting indignantly to the usage he had receivedby cot if she had but been a man if it were the king himselfhowever mr tyrrel i am come on a civil errandand very civilly i have been treatedthe auld bitch should be set in the stocks and be tamnedmy friend sir bingoby cot i shall never forget that womans insolenceif there be a constable or a catoninetails within ten miles  i perceive captain said tyrrel that you are too much disturbed at this moment to enter upon the business which has brought you hereif you will step into my bedroom and make use of some cold water and a towel it will give you the time to compose yourself a little  i shall do no such thing mr tyrrel answered the captain snappishly i do not want to be composed at all and i do not want to stay in this house a minute longer than to do my errand to you on my friends behalfand as for this tamned woman dods  you will in that case forgive my interrupting you captain macturk as i presume your errand to me can have no reference to this strange quarrel with my landlady with which i have nothing to  and if i thought that it had sir said the captain interrupting tyrrel in his turn you should have given me satisfaction before you was a quarter of an hour olderoh i would give five pounds to the pretty fellow that would say captain macturk the woman did right  i certainly will not be that person you wish for captain replied tyrrel because i really do not know who was in the right or wrong but i am certainly sorry that you should have met with ill usage when your purpose was to visit me  well sir if you are concerned said the man of peace snappishly so am i and there is an end of itand touching my errand to youyou cannot have forgotten that you treated my friend sir bingo binks with singular incivility  i recollect nothing of the kind captain replied tyrrel i remember that the gentleman so called took some uncivil liberties in laying foolish bets concerning me and that i treated him from respect to the rest of the company and the ladies in particular with a great degree of moderation and forbearance  and you must have very fine ideas of forbearance replied the captain when you took my good friend by the collar of the coat and lifted him out of your way as if he had been a puppy dog my good mr tyrrel i can assure you he does not think that you have forborne him at all and he has no purpose to forbear you and i must either carry back a sufficient apology or you must meet in a quiet way with a good friend on each sideand this was the errand i came on when this tamned woman with the hearthbroom who is an enemy to all quiet and peaceable proceedings  we will forget mrs dods for the present if you please captain macturk said tyrreland to speak to the present subject you will permit me to say that i think this summons comes a little of the latest you know best as a military man but i have always understood that such differences are usually settled immediately after they occurnot that i intend to baulk sir bingos inclinations upon the score of delay or any other account  i dare say you will noti dare say you will not mr tyrrel answered the captaini am free to think that you know better what belongs to a gentlemanand as to timelook you my good sir there are different sorts of people in this world as there are different sorts of firearms there are your hairtriggerd rifles that go off just at the right moment and in the twinkling of an eye and that mr tyrrel is your true man of honourand there is a sort of person that takes a thing up too soon and sometimes backs out of it like your rubbishy birmingham pieces that will at one time go off at halfcock and at another time burn priming without going off at allthen again pieces that hang fireor i should rather say that are like the matchlocks which the black fellows use in the east indiesthere must be some blowing of the match and so forth which occasions delay but the piece carries true enough after all  and your friend sir bingos valour is of this last kind captaini presume that is the inference i should have thought it more like a boys cannon which is fired by means of a train and is but a popgun after all  i cannot allow of such comparisons sir said the captain you will understand that i come here as sir bingos friend and a reflection on him will be an affront to me  i disclaim all intended offence to you captaini have no wish to extend the number of my adversaries or to add to them the name of a gallant officer like yourself replied tyrrel  you are too obliging sir said the captain drawing himself up with dignity by cot and that was said very handsomelywell sir and shall i not have the pleasure of carrying back any explanation from you to sir bingoi assure you it would give me pleasure to make this matter handsomely up  to sir bingo captain macturk i have no apology to offeri think i treated him more gently than his impertinence deserved  och och sighed the captain with a strong highland intonation then there is no more to be said but just to settle time and place for pistols i suppose must be the weapons  all these matters are quite the same to me said tyrrel only in respect of time i should wish it to be as speedy as possiblewhat say you to one afternoon this very dayyou may name the place  at one afternoon replied the captain deliberately sir bingo will attend youthe place may be the buckstane for as the whole company go to the waterside today to eat a kettle of fishi18 there will be no risk of interruptionand who shall i speak to my good friend on your side of the quarrel  really captain replied tyrrel that is a puzzling questioni have no friend herei suppose you could hardly act for both  it would be totally absolutely and altogether out of the question my good friend replied macturk but if you will trust to me i will bring up a friend on your part from the well who though you have hardly seen him before will settle matters for you as well as if you had been intimate for twenty yearsand i will bring up the doctor too if i can get him unloosed from the petticoat of that fat widow blower that he has strung himself upon  i have no doubt you will do every thing with perfect accuracy captain at one oclock then we meet at the buckstanestay permit me to see you to the door  by cot and it is not altogether so unnecessary said the captain for the tamned woman with the besom might have some advantage in that long dark passage knowing the ground better than i dotamn her i will have amends on her if there be whippingpost or duckingstool or a pair of stocks in the parish and so saying the captain trudged off his spirits ever and anon agitated by recollection of the causeless aggression of meg dods and again composed to a state of happy serenity by the recollection of the agreeable arrangement which he had made between mr tyrrel and his friend sir bingo binks  we have heard of men of undoubted benevolence of character and disposition whose principal delight was to see a miserable criminal degraded alike by his previous crimes and the sentence which he had incurred conclude a vicious and wretched life by an ignominious and painful death it was some such inconsistency of character which induced honest captain macturk who had really been a meritorious officer and was a goodnatured honourable and wellintentioned man to place his chief delight in setting his friends by the ears and then acting as umpire in the dangerous rencontres which according to his code of honour were absolutely necessary to restore peace and cordiality we leave the explanation of such anomalies to the labours of craniologists for they seem to defy all the researches of the ethic philosopher  footnote  i18 a kettle of fish is a f√™techamp√™tre of a particular kind which is to other f√™teschamp√™tres what the piscatory eclogues of brown or sannazario are to pastoral poetry a large caldron is boiled by the side of a salmon river containing a quantity of water thickened with salt to the consistence of brine in this the fish is plunged when taken and eaten by the company fronde super viridi this is accounted the best way of eating salmon by those who desire to taste the fish in a state of extreme freshness others prefer it after being kept a day or two when the curd melts into oil and the fish becomes richer and more luscious the more judicious gastronomes eat no other sauce than a spoonful of the water in which the salmon is boiled together with a little pepper and vinegar     chapter xiii  disappointment      evans i pray you now good master slenders servingman and     friend simple by your name which way have you looked for master     caius      slender marry sir the cityward the parkward every way old     windsor way and every way  merry wives of windsor   sir bingo binks received the captains communication with the same dogged sullenness he had displayed at sending the challenge a most ungracious humph ascending as it were from the very bottom of his stomach through the folds of a belcher handkerchief intimating his acquiescence in a tone nearly as gracious as that with which the drowsy traveller acknowledges the intimation of the slipshod ostler that it is on the stroke of five and the horn will sound in a minute captain macturk by no means considered this ejaculation as expressing a proper estimate of his own trouble and services humph he replied and what does that mean sir bingo have not i here had the trouble to put you just into the neat road and would you have been able to make a handsome affair out of it at all after you had let it hang so long in the wind if i had not taken on myself to make it agreeable to the gentleman and cooked as neat a mess out of it as i have seen a frenchman do out of a stale sprat  sir bingo saw it was necessary to mutter some intimation of acquiescence and acknowledgment which however inarticulate was sufficient to satisfy the veteran to whom the adjustment of a personal affair of this kind was a labour of love and who now kindly mindful of his promise to tyrrel hurried away as if he had been about the most charitable action upon earth to secure the attendance of some one as a witness on the strangers part  mr winterblossom was the person whom macturk had in his own mind pitched upon as the fittest person to perform this act of benevolence and he lost no time in communicating his wish to that worthy gentleman but mr winterblossom though a man of the world and well enough acquainted with such matters was by no means so passionately addicted to them as was the man of peace captain hector macturk as a bon vivant he hated trouble of any kind and the shrewd selfishness of his disposition enabled him to foresee that a good deal might accrue to all concerned in the course of this business he therefore coolly replied that he knew nothing of mr tyrrelnot even whether he was a gentleman or not and besides he had received no regular application in his behalfhe did not therefore feel himself at all inclined to go to the field as his second this refusal drove the poor captain to despair he conjured his friend to be more publicspirited and entreated him to consider the reputation of the well which was to them as a common country and the honour of the company to which they both belonged and of which mr winterblossom was in a manner the proper representative as being with consent of all the perpetual president he reminded him how many quarrels had been nightly undertaken and departed from on the ensuing morning without any suitable consequencessaid that people began to talk of the place oddly and that for his own part he found his own honour so nearly touched that he had begun to think he himself would be obliged to bring somebody or other to account for the general credit of the well and now just when the most beautiful occasion had arisen to put every thing on a handsome footing it was hardit was cruelit was most unjustifiablein mr winterblossom to decline so simple a matter as was requested of him  dry and taciturn as the captain was on all ordinary occasions he proved on the present eloquent and almost pathetic for the tears came into his eyes when he recounted the various quarrels which had become addled notwithstanding his best endeavours to hatch them into an honourable meeting and here was one at length just chipping the shell like to be smothered for want of the most ordinary concession on the part of winterblossom in short that gentleman could not hold out any longer it was he said a very foolish business he thought but to oblige sir bingo and captain macturk he had no objection to walk with them about noon as far as the buckstane although he must observe the day was hazy and he had felt a prophetic twinge or two which looked like a visit of his old acquaintance podagra  never mind that my excellent friend said the captain a sup out of sir bingos flask is like enough to put that to rights and by my soul it is not the thing he is like to leave behind him on this sort of occasion unless i be far mistaken in my man  but said winterblossom although i comply with your wishes thus far captain macturk i by no means undertake for certain to back this same master tyrrel of whom i know nothing at all but only agree to go to the place in hopes of preventing mischief  never fash your beard about that mr winterblossom replied the captain for a little mischief as you call it is become a thing absolutely necessary to the credit of the place and i am sure whatever be the consequences they cannot in the present instance be very fatal to any body for here is a young fellow that if he should have a misfortune nobody will miss for nobody knows him then there is sir bingo whom every body knows so well that they will miss him all the less  and there will be lady bingo a wealthy and handsome young widow said winterblossom throwing his hat upon his head with the grace and pretension of former days and sighing to see as he looked in the mirror how much time that had whitened his hair rounded his stomach wrinkled his brow and bent down his shoulders had disqualified him as he expressed it for entering for such a plate  secure of winterblossom the captains next anxiety was to obtain the presence of dr quackleben who although he wrote himself md did not by any means decline practice as a surgeon when any job offered for which he was likely to be well paid as was warranted in the present instance the wealthy baronet being a party principally concerned the doctor therefore like the eagle scenting the carnage seized at the first word the huge volume of morocco leather which formed his case of portable instruments and uncoiled before the captain with ostentatious display its formidable and glittering contents upon which he began to lecture as upon a copious and interesting text until the man of war thought it necessary to give him a word of caution  och says he i do pray you doctor to carry that packet of yours under the breast of your coat or in your pocket or somewhere out of sight and by no means to produce or open it before the parties for although scalpels and tourniquets and pincers and the like are very ingenious implements and pretty to behold and are also useful when time and occasion call for them yet i have known the sight of them take away a mans fighting stomach and so lose their owner a job dr quackleben  by my faith captain macturk said the doctor you speak as if you were graduatedi have known these treacherous articles play their master many a cursed trick the very sight of my forceps without the least effort on my part once cured an inveterate toothache of three days duration prevented the extraction of a carious molendinar which it was the very end of their formation to achieve and sent me home minus a guineabut hand me that greatcoat captain and we will place the instruments in ambuscade until they are called into action in due time i should think something will happensir bingo is a sure shot at a moorcock  cannot say replied macturk i have known the pistol shake many a hand that held the fowlingpiece fast enough yonder tyrrel looks like a teevilish cool customeri watched him the whole time i was delivering my errand and i can promise you he is mettle to the backbone  welli will have my bandages ready secundum artem replied the man of medicine we must guard against h√¶morrhagesir bingo is a plethoric subjectone oclock you sayat the buckstanei will be punctual  will you not walk with us said captain macturk who seemed willing to keep his whole convoy together on this occasion lest peradventure any of them had fled from under his patronage  no replied the doctor i must first make an apology to worthy mrs blower for i had promised her my arm down to the riverside where they are all to eat a kettle of fish  by cot and i hope we shall make them a prettier kettle of fish than was ever seen at st ronans said the captain rubbing his hands  dont say we captain replied the cautious doctor i for one have nothing to do with the meetingwash my hands of it no no i cannot afford to be clapt up as accessoryyou ask me to meet you at the buckstaneno purpose assignedi am willing to oblige my worthy friend captain macturkwalk that way thinking of nothing particularhear the report of pistolshasten to the spotfortunately just in time to prevent the most fatal consequenceschance most opportunely to have my case of instruments with meindeed generally walk with them about menunquam non paratusthen give my professional definition of the wound and state of the patient that is the way to give evidence captain before sheriffs coroners and such sort of folknever commit ones selfit is a rule of our profession  well well doctor answered the captain you know your own ways best and so you are but there to give a chance of help in case of accident all the laws of honour will be fully complied with but it would be a foul reflection upon me as a man of honour if i did not take care that there should be somebody to come in thirdsman between death and my principal  at the awful hour of one afternoon there arrived upon the appointed spot captain macturk leading to the field the valorous sir bingo not exactly straining like a greyhound in the slips but rather looking moody like a butchers bulldog which knows he must fight since his master bids him yet the baronet showed no outward flinching or abatement of courage excepting that the tune of jenny sutton which he had whistled without intermission since he left the hotel had during the last half mile of their walk sunk into silence although to look at the muscles of the mouth projection of the lip and vacancy of the eye it seemed as if the notes were still passing through his mind and that he whistled jenny sutton in his imagination mr winterblossom came two minutes after this happy pair and the doctor was equally punctual  upon my soul said the former this is a mighty silly affair sir bingo and might i think be easily taken up at less risk to all parties than a meeting of this kind you should recollect sir bingo that you have much depending upon your lifeyou are a married man sir bingo  sir bingo turned the quid in his mouth and squirted out the juice in a most coachmanlike manner  mr winterblossom said the captain sir bingo has in this matter put himself in my hands and unless you think yourself more able to direct his course than i am i must frankly tell you that i will be disobliged by your interference you may speak to your own friend as much as you please and if you find yourself authorized to make any proposal i shall be desirous to lend an ear to it on the part of my worthy principal sir bingo but i will be plain with you that i do not greatly approve of settlements upon the field though i hope i am a quiet and peaceable man but here is our honour to be looked after in the first place and moreover i must insist that every proposal for accommodation shall originate with your party or yourself  my party answered winterblossom why really though i came hither at your request captain macturk yet i must see more of the matter ere i can fairly pronounce myself second to a man i never saw but once  and perhaps may never see again said the doctor looking at his watch for it is ten minutes past the hour and here is no mr tyrrel  hey whats that you say doctor said the baronet awakened from his apathy  he speaks tamned nonsense said the captain pulling out a huge oldfashioned turnipshaped implement with a blackened silver dialplate it is not above three minutes after one by the true time and i will uphold mr tyrrel to be a man of his wordnever saw a man take a thing more coolly  not more coolly than he takes his walk this way said the doctor for the hour is as i tell youremember i am professionalhave pulses to count by the second and halfsecondmy timepiece must go as true as the sun  and i have mounted guard a thousand times by my watch said the captain and i defy the devil to say that hector macturk did not always discharge his duty to the twentieth part of the fraction of a secondit was my great grandmother lady killbracklins and i will maintain its reputation against any timepiece that ever went upon wheels  well then look at your own watch captain said winterblossom for time stands still with no man and while we speak the hour advances on my word i think this mr tyrrel intends to humbug us  hey whats that you say said sir bingo once more starting from his sullen reverie  i shall not look at my watch upon no such matter said the captain nor will i any way be disposed to doubt your friends honour mr winterblossom  my friend said mr winterblossom i must tell you once more captain that this mr tyrrel is no friend of minenone in the world he is your friend captain macturk and i own if he keeps us waiting much longer on this occasion i will be apt to consider his friendship as of very little value  and how dare you then say that the man is my friend said the captain knitting his brows in a most formidable manner  pooh pooh captain answered winterblossom coolly if not contemptuouslykeep all that for silly boys i have lived in the world too long either to provoke quarrels or to care about them so reserve your fire it is all thrown away on such an old cock as i am but i really wish we knew whether this fellow means to cometwenty minutes past the houri think it is odds that you are bilked sir bingo  bilked hey cried sir bingo by gad i always thought soi wagered with mowbray he was a raffi am had by gad ill wait no longer than the half hour by gad were he a fieldmarshal  you will be directed in that matter by your friend if you please sir bingo said the captain  d me if i will returned the baronetfriend a pretty friend to bring me out here on such a fools errand i knew the fellow was a raffbut i never thought you with all your chaff about honour such a dd spoon as to bring a message from a fellow who has fled the pit  if you regret so much having come here to no purpose said the captain in a very lofty tone and if you think i have used you like a spoon as you say i will have no objection in life to take mr tyrrels place and serve your occasion my boy  by  and if you like it you may fire away and welcome said sir bingo and ill spin a crown for first shot for i do not understand being brought here for nothing d me  and there was never man alive so ready as i am to give you something to stay your stomach said the irritable highlander  illustration  oh fie gentlemen fie fie fie exclaimed the pacific mr winterblossomfor shame captainout upon you sir bingo are you madwhat principal and secondthe like was never heard ofnever  the parties were in some degree recalled to their more cool recollections by this expostulation yet continued a short quarterdeck walk to and fro upon parallel lines looking at each other sullenly as they passed and bristling like two dogs who have a mind to quarrel yet hesitate to commence hostilities during this promenade also the perpendicular and erect carriage of the veteran rising on his toes at every step formed a whimsical contrast with the heavy loutish shuffle of the bulky baronet who had by dint of practice very nearly attained that most enviable of all carriages the gait of a shambling yorkshire ostler his coarse spirit was now thoroughly kindled and like iron or any other baser metal which is slow in receiving heat it retained long the smouldering and angry spirit of resentment that had originally brought him to the place and now rendered him willing to wreak his uncomfortable feelings upon the nearest object which occurred since the first purpose of his coming thither was frustrated in his own phrase his pluck was up and finding himself in a fighting humour he thought it a pity like bob acres that so much good courage should be thrown away as however that courage after all consisted chiefly in ill humour and as in the demeanour of the captain he read nothing deferential or deprecatory of his wrath he began to listen with more attention to the arguments of mr winterblossom who entreated them not to sully by private quarrel the honour they had that day so happily acquired without either blood or risk  it was now he said three quarters of an hour past the time appointed for this person who calls himself tyrrel to meet sir bingo binks now instead of standing squabbling here which serves no purpose i propose we should reduce to writing the circumstances which attend this affair for the satisfaction of the company at the well and that the memorandum shall be regularly attested by our subscriptions after which i shall farther humbly propose that it be subjected to the revision of the committee of management  i object to any revision of a statement to which my name shall be appended said the captain  rightvery true captain said the complaisant mr winterblossom undoubtedly you know best and your signature is completely sufficient to authenticate this transactionhowever as it is the most important which has occurred since the spring was established i propose we shall all sign the proc√®sverbal as i may term it  leave me out if you please said the doctor not much satisfied that both the original quarrel and the bybattle had passed over without any occasion for the offices of a machaon leave me out if you please for it does not become me to be ostensibly concerned in any proceedings which have had for their object a breach of the peace and for the importance of waiting here for an hour in a fine afternoon it is my opinion there was a more important service done to the well of st ronans when i quentin quackleben md cured lady penelope penfeather of her seventh attack upon the nerves attended with febrile symptoms  no disparagement to your skill at all doctor said mr winterblossom but i conceive the lesson which this fellow has received will be a great means to prevent improper persons from appearing at the spring hereafter and for my part i shall move that no one be invited to dine at the table in future till his name is regularly entered as a member of the company in the lists at the public room and i hope both sir bingo and the captain will receive the thanks of the company for their spirited conduct in expelling the intrudersir bingo will you allow me to apply to your flaska little twinge i feel owing to the dampness of the grass  sir bingo soothed by the consequence he had acquired readily imparted to the invalid a thimbleful of his cordial which we believe had been prepared by some cunning chemist in the wilds of glenlivat he then filled a bumper and extended it towards the veteran as an unequivocal symptom of reconciliation the real turbinacious flavour no sooner reached the nose of the captain than the beverage was turned down his throat with symptoms of most unequivocal applause  i shall have some hope of the young fellows of this day he said now that they begin to give up their dutch and french distilled waters and stick to genuine highland ware by cot it is the only liquor fit for a gentleman to drink in a morning if he can have the good fortune to come by it you see  or after dinner either captain said the doctor to whom the glass had passed in rotation it is worth all the wines in france for flavour and more cordial to the system besides  and now said the captain that we may not go off the ground with any thing on our stomachs worse than the whisky i can afford to say as captain hector macturks character is tolerably well established that i am sorry for the little difference that has occurred betwixt me and my worthy friend sir bingo here  and since you are so civil captain said sir bingo why i am sorry tooonly it would put the devil out of temper to lose so fine a fishing daywind southfine air on the poolwater settled from the floodjust in trimand i dare say three pairs of hooks have passed over my cast before this time  he closed this elaborate lamentation with a libation of the same cordial which he had imparted to his companions and they returned in a body to the hotel where the transactions of the morning were soon afterwards announced to the company by the following program       statement      sir bingo binks baronet having found himself aggrieved by the     uncivil behaviour of an individual calling himself francis tyrrel     now or lately a resident at the cleikum inn aultoun of st ronans     and having empowered captain hector macturk to wait upon the said     mr tyrrel to demand an apology under the alternative of personal     satisfaction according to the laws of honour and the practice of     gentlemen the said tyrrel voluntarily engaged to meet the said sir     bingo binks baronet at the buckstane near st ronans burn upon     this present day being wednesday  august in consequence of     which appointment we the undersigned did attend at the place     named from one oclock till two without seeing or hearing any     thing whatever of the said francis tyrrel or any one in his     behalfwhich fact we make thus publicly known that all men and     particularly the distinguished company assembled at the fox hotel     may be duly apprized of the character and behaviour of the said     francis tyrrel in case of his again presuming to intrude himself     into the society of persons of honour      the fox inn and hotel st ronans wellaugust 18      signed     bingo binks     hector macturk     philip winterblossom  a little lower followed this separate attestation      i quentin quackleben md frs de bl xz c c     being called upon to attest what i know in the said matter do     hereby verify that being by accident at the buckstane near st     ronans burn on this present day at the hour of one afternoon and     chancing to remain there for the space of nearly an hour conversing     with sir bingo binks captain macturk and mr winterblossom we did     not during that time see or hear any thing of or from the person     calling himself francis tyrrel whose presence at that place seemed     to be expected by the gentlemen i have just named  this affiche was dated like the former and certified under the august hand of quentin quackleben md c c c  again and prefaced by the averment that an improper person had been lately introduced into the company of st ronans well there came forth a legislative enactment on the part of the committee declaring that no one shall in future be invited to the dinners or balls or other entertainments of the well until their names shall be regularly entered in the books kept for the purpose at the rooms lastly there was a vote of thanks to sir bingo binks and captain macturk for their spirited conduct and the pains which they had taken to exclude an improper person from the company at st ronans well  these annunciations speedily became the magnet of the day all idlers crowded to peruse them and it would be endless to notice the god bless mesthe lord have a care of usthe saw you ever the likes of gossips any more than the dear mes and oh laas of the titupping misses and the oaths of the pantalooned or buckskind beaux the character of sir bingo rose like the stocks at the news of a dispatch from the duke of wellington and what was extraordinary attained some consequence even in the estimation of his lady all shook their heads at the recollection of the unlucky tyrrel and found out much in his manner and address which convinced them that he was but an adventurer and swindler a few however less partial to the committee of management for whenever there is an administration there will soon arise an opposition whispered among themselves that to give the fellow his due the man be he what he would had only come among them like the devil when he was called for and honest dame blower blessed herself when she heard of such bloodthirsty doings as had been intended and thanked god that honest doctor kickherben had come to nae harm amang a their nonsense     chapter xiv  the consultation       clown i hope here be proofs  measure for measure   the borough of  lies as all the world knows about fourteen miles distant from st ronans being the county town of that shire which as described in the tourists guide numbers among its objects of interest that gay and popular wateringplace whose fame no doubt will be greatly enhanced by the present annals of its earlier history as it is at present unnecessary to be more particular concerning the scene of our story we will fill up the blank left in the first name with the fictitious appellation of marchthorn having often found ourselves embarrassed in the course of a story by the occurrence of an ugly hiatus which we cannot always at first sight fill up with the proper reference to the rest of the narrative  marchthorn then was an oldfashioned scottish town the street of which on marketday showed a reasonable number of stout greatcoated yeomen bartering or dealing for the various commodities of their farms and on other days of the week only a few forlorn burghers crawling about like halfawakened flies and watching the town steeple till the happy sound of twelve strokes from times oracle should tell them it was time to take their meridian dram the narrow windows of the shops intimated very imperfectly the miscellaneous contents of the interior where every merchant as the shopkeepers of marchthorn were termed more scotico sold every thing that could be thought of as for manufactures there were none except that of the careful towncouncil who were mightily busied in preparing the warp and woof which at the end of every five or six years the town of marchthorn contributed for the purpose of weaving the fourth or fifth part of a member of parliament  in such a town it usually happens that the sheriffclerk especially supposing him agent for several lairds of the higher order is possessed of one of the bestlooking houses and such was that of mr bindloose none of the smartness of the brickbuilt and brasshammered mansion of a southern attorney appeared indeed in this mansion which was a tall thin grimlooking building in the centre of the town with narrow windows and projecting gables notched into that sort of descent called crowsteps and having the lower casements defended by stancheons of iron for mr bindloose as frequently happens kept a branch of one of the two national banks which had been lately established in the town of marchthorn  towards the door of this tenement there advanced slowly up the ancient but empty streets of this famous borough a vehicle which had it appeared in piccadilly would have furnished unremitted laughter for a week and conversation for a twelvemonth it was a twowheeled vehicle which claimed none of the modern appellations of tilbury tandem dennet or the like but aspired only to the humble name of that almost forgotten accommodation a whiskey or according to some authorities a timwhiskey green was or had been its original colour and it was placed sturdily and safely low upon its little oldfashioned wheels which bore much less than the usual proportion to the size of the carriage which they sustained it had a calash head which had been pulled up in consideration either to the dampness of the morning air or to the retiring delicacy of the fair form which shrouded by leathern curtains tenanted this venerable specimen of antediluvian coachbuilding  but as this fair and modest dame noway aspired to the skill of a charioteer the management of a horse which seemed as old as the carriage he drew was in the exclusive charge of an old fellow in a postilions jacket whose grey hairs escaped on each side of an oldfashioned velvet jockeycap and whose left shoulder was so considerably elevated above his head that it seemed as if with little effort his neck might have been tucked under his arm like that of a roasted grousecock this gallant equerry was mounted on a steed as old as that which toiled betwixt the shafts of the carriage and which he guided by a leading rein goading one animal with his single spur and stimulating the other with his whip he effected a reasonable trot upon the causeway which only terminated when the whiskey stopped at mr bindlooses dooran event of importance enough to excite the curiosity of the inhabitants of that and the neighbouring houses wheels were laid aside needles left sticking in the halffinished seams and many a nose spectacled and unspectacled was popped out of the adjoining windows which had the good fortune to command a view of mr bindlooses front door the faces of two or three giggling clerks were visible at the barred casements of which we have spoken much amused at the descent of an old lady from this respectable carriage whose dress and appearance might possibly have been fashionable at the time when her equipage was new a satin cardinal lined with grey squirrels skin and a black silk bonnet trimmed with crape were garments which did not now excite the respect which in their fresher days they had doubtless commanded but there was that in the features of the wearer which would have commanded mr bindlooses best regard though it had appeared in far worse attire for he beheld the face of an ancient customer who had always paid her law expenses with the ready penny and whose accompt with the bank was balanced by a very respectable sum at her credit it was indeed no other than our respected friend mrs dods of the cleikum inn st ronans aultoun  now her arrival intimated matter of deep import meg was a person of all others most averse to leave her home where in her own opinion at least nothing went on well without her immediate superintendence limited therefore as was her sphere she remained fixed in the centre thereof and few as were her satellites they were under the necessity of performing their revolutions around her while she herself continued stationary saturn in fact would be scarce more surprised at a passing call from the sun than mr bindloose at this unexpected visit of his old client in one breath he rebuked the inquisitive impertinence of his clerks in another stimulated his housekeeper old hannahfor mr bindloose was a bluff bachelorto get tea ready in the green parlour and while yet speaking was at the side of the whiskey unclasping the curtains rolling down the apron and assisting his old friend

body and maybe the auld housetyke that wadna be sae weel guided puir fallow  fie fie mrs dods said the clerk in a tone of friendly rebuke it vexes an auld friend to hear ye speak of yourself in that respectless sort of a way and as for quitting us i bless god i have not seen you look better this half score of years but maybe you will be thinking of setting your house in order which is the act of a carefu and of a christian womano its an awfu thing to die intestate if we had grace to consider it  aweel i daur say ill consider that some day soon mr bindloose but thats no my present errand  be it what it like mrs dods ye are right heartily welcome here and we have a the day to speak of the business in handfestina lente that is the true law languagehooly and fairly as one may sayill treating of business with an empty stomachand here comes your tea and i hope hannah has made it to your taste  meg sipped her teaconfessed hannahs skill in the mysteries of the chinese herbsipped again then tried to eat a bit of bread and butter with very indifferent success and notwithstanding the lawyers compliments to her good looks seemed in reality on the point of becoming ill  in the deils name what is the matter said the lawyer too well read in a profession where sharp observation is peculiarly necessary to suffer these symptoms of agitation to escape him ay dame ye are taking this business of yours deeper to heart than ever i kend you take ony thing ony o your banded debtors failed or like to fail what then cheer ye upyou can afford a little loss and it canna be ony great matter or i would doubtless have heard of it  in troth but it is a loss mr bindloose and what say ye to the loss of a friend  this was a possibility which had never entered the lawyers long list of calamities and he was at some loss to conceive what the old lady could possibly mean by so sentimental a prolusion but just as he began to come out with his ay ay we are all mortal vita incerta mors certissima and two or three more pithy reflections which he was in the habit of uttering after funerals when the will of the deceased was about to be openedjust then mrs dods was pleased to become the expounder of her own oracle  i see how it is mr bindloose she said i maun tell my ain ailment for you are no likely to guess it and so if ye will shut the door and see that nane of your giggling callants are listening in the passage i will een tell you how things stand with me  mr bindloose hastily arose to obey her commands gave a cautionary glance into the bankoffice and saw that his idle apprentices were fast at their desksturned the key upon them as if it were in a fit of absence and then returned not a little curious to know what could be the matter with his old friend and leaving off all further attempts to put cases quietly drew his chair near hers and awaited her own time to make her communication  mr bindloose said she i am no sure that you may mind about six or seven years ago that there were twa daft english callants lodgers of mine that had some trouble from auld st ronans about shooting on the springwellhead muirs  i mind it as weel as yesterday mistress said the clerk by the same token you gave me a note for my trouble which wasna worth speaking about and bade me no bring in a bill against the puir bairnsye had aye a kind heart mrs dods  maybe and maybe no mr bindloosethat is just as i find folkbut concerning these lads they baith left the country and as i think in some ill blude wi ane another and now the auldest and the doucest of the twa came back again about a fortnight sin syne and has been my guest ever since  aweel and i trust he is not at his auld tricks again goodwife answered the clerk i havena sae muckle to say either wi the new sheriff or the bench of justices as i used to hae mrs dodsand the procuratorfiscal is very severe on poaching being borne out by the new associationfew of our auld friends of the killnakelty are able to come to the sessions now mrs dods  the waur for the country mr bindloose replied the old ladythey were decent considerate men that didna plague a puir herd callant muckle about a moorfowl or a mawkin unless he turned common fowlersir robert ringhorse used to say the herd lads shot as mony gleds and pyots as they did gamebut new lords new lawsnaething but fine and imprisonment and the game no a feather the plentier if i wad hae a brace or twa of birds in the house as every body looks for them after the twelfthi ken what they are like to cost meand what for norisk maun be paid forthere is john pirner himsell that has keepit the muirside thirty year in spite of a the lairds in the country shoots he tells me nowadays as if he felt a rape about his neck  it wasna about ony game business then that you wanted advice said bindloose who though somewhat of a digresser himself made little allowance for the excursions of others from the subject in hand  indeed is it no mr bindloose said meg but it is een about this unhappy callant that i spoke to you aboutye maun ken i have cleiket a particular fancy to this lad francis tirla fancy that whiles surprises my very sell mr bindloose only that there is nae sin in it  nonenone in the world mrs dods said the lawyer thinking at the same time within his own mind oho the mist begins to clear upthe young poacher has hit the mark i seewinged the old barren grey henay aya marriagecontract no doubtbut i maun gie her lineye are a wise woman mrs dods he continued aloud and can doubtless consider the chances and the changes of human affairs  but i could never have considered what has befallen this puir lad mr bindloose said mrs dods through the malice of wicked menhe lived then at the cleikum as i tell you for mair than a fortnight as quiet as a lamb on a leariga decenter lad never came within my doorate and drank eneugh for the gude of the house and nae mair than was for his ain gude whether of body or soulcleared his bills ilka saturday at een as regularly as saturday came round  an admirable customer no doubt mrs dods said the lawyer  never was the like of him for that matter answered the honest dame but to see the malice of mensome of thae landloupers and gillflirts down at the filthy puddle yonder that they ca the waal had heard of this puir lad and the bits of pictures that he made fashion of drawing and they maun cuitle him awa doun to the bottle where mony a bonny story they had clecked mr bindloose baith of mr tirl and of mysell  a commissary court business said the writer going off again upon a false scent i shall trim their jackets for them mrs dods if you can but bring tight evidence of the factsi will soon bring them to fine and palinodei will make them repent meddling with your good name  my gude name what the sorrow is the matter wi my name mr bindloose said the irritable client i think ye hae been at the wee cappie this morning for as early as it ismy gude nameif ony body touched my gude name i would neither fash counsel nor commissaryi wad be down amang them like a jerfalcon amang a wheen wildgeese and the best amang them that dared to say ony thing of meg dods by what was honest and civil i wad sune see if her cockernonnie was made of her ain hair or other folks my gude name indeed  weel weel mrs dods i was mistaen thats a said the writer i was mistaen and i dare to say you would haud your ain wi your neighbours as weel as ony woman in the landbut let us hear now what the grief is in one word  in one word then clerk bindloose it is little short ofmurder said meg in a low tone as if the very utterance of the word startled her  murder murder mrs dodsit cannot bethere is not a word of it in the sheriffofficethe procuratorfiscal kens nothing of itthere could not be murder in the country and me not hear of itfor gods sake take heed what you say woman and dinna get yourself into trouble  mr bindloose i can but speak according to my lights said mrs dods you are in a sense a judge in israel at least you are one of the scribes having authorityand i tell you with a wae and bitter heart that this puir callant of mine that was lodging in my house has been murdered or kidnapped awa amang thae banditti folk down at the new waal and ill have the law put in force against them if it should cost me a hundred pounds  the clerk stood much astonished at the nature of megs accusation and the pertinacity with which she seemed disposed to insist upon it  i have this comfort she continued that whatever has happened it has been by no fault of mine mr bindloose for weel i wot before that bloodthirsty auld halfpay philistine macturk got to speech of him i clawed his cantle to some purpose with my hearthbesombut the poor simple bairn himsell that had nae mair knowledge of the wickedness of human nature than a calf has of a fleshers gully he threepit to see the auld hardened bloodshedder and trysted wi him to meet wi some of the gang at an hour certain that same day and awa he gaed to keep tryst but since that hour naebody ever has set een on himand the mansworn villains now want to put a disgrace on him and say that he fled the country rather than face thema likely storyfled the country for themand leave his bill unsettledhim that was sae regularand his portmantle and his fishingrod and the pencils and pictures he held sic a wark aboutits my faithful belief mr bindlooseand ye may trust me or no as ye likethat he had some foul play between the cleikum and the buckstane i have thought it and i have dreamed it and i will be at the bottom of it or my name is not meg dods and that i wad have them a to reckon onay ay thats right mr bindloose tak out your pen and inkhorn and let us set about it to purpose  with considerable difficulty and at the expense of much crossexamination mr bindloose extracted from his client a detailed account of the proceedings of the company at the well towards tyrrel so far as they were known to or suspected by meg making notes as the examination proceeded of what appeared to be matter of consequence after a moments consideration he asked the dame the very natural question how she came to be acquainted with the material fact that a hostile appointment was made between captain macturk and her lodger when according to her own account it was made intra parietes and remotis testibus  ay but we victuallers ken weel eneugh what goes on in our ain houses said megand what for noif ye maun ken a about it i een listened through the keyhole of the door  and do you say you heard them settle an appointment for a duel said the clerk and did you no take ony measures to hinder mischief mrs dods having such a respect for this lad as you say you have mrs dodsi really wadna have looked for the like o this at your hands  in truth mr bindloose said meg putting her apron to her eyes and thats what vexes me mair than a the rest and ye needna say muckle to ane whose heart is een the sairer that she has been a thought to blame but there has been mony a challenge as they ca it passed in my house when thae daft lads of the wildfire club and the helterskelter were upon their rambles and they had aye sense eneugh to make it up without fighting sae that i really did not apprehend ony thing like mischiefand ye maun think moreover mr bindloose that it would have been an unco thing if a guest in a decent and creditable public like mine was to have cried coward before ony of thae landlouping blackguards that live down at the hottle yonder  that is to say mrs dods you were desirous your guest should fight for the honour of your house said bindloose  what for no mr bindlooseisna that kind of fray aye about honour and what for should the honour of a substantial fournooked sclated house of three stories no be foughten for as weel as the credit of ony of these feckless callants that make such a fray about their reputationi promise you my house the cleikum stood in the auld town of st ronans before they were born and it will stand there after they are hanged as i trust some of them are like to be  well but perhaps your lodger had less zeal for the honour of the house and has quietly taken himself out of harms way said mr bindloose for if i understand your story this meeting never took place  have less zeal said meg determined to be pleased with no supposition of her lawyer mr bindloose ye little ken himi wish ye had seen him when he was angryi dared hardly face him mysell and there are no mony folk that i am feared formeeting there was nae meeting i trowthey never dared to meet him fairlybut i am sure waur came of it than ever would have come of a meeting for anthony heard twa shots gang off as he was watering the auld naig down at the burn and that is not far frae the footpath that leads to the buckstane i was angry at him for no making on to see what the matter was but he thought it was auld pirner out wi the double barrel and he wasna keen of making himself a witness in case he suld have been caad on in the poaching court  well said the sheriffclerk and i dare say he did hear a poacher fire a couple of shotsnothing more likely believe me mrs dods your guest had no fancy for the party captain macturk invited him toand being a quiet sort of man he has just walked away to his own home if he has onei am really sorry you have given yourself the trouble of this long journey about so simple a matter  mrs dods remained with her eyes fixed on the ground in a very sullen and discontented posture and when she spoke it was in a tone of corresponding displeasure  aweelaweellive and learn they sayi thought i had a friend in you mr bindloosei am sure i aye took your part when folk miscaad ye and said ye were this that and the other thing and little better than an auld sneckdrawing loon mr bindlooseand ye have aye keepit my penny of money though nae doubt tam turnpenny lives nearer me and they say he allows half a per cent mair than ye do if the siller lies and mine is but seldom steered  but ye have not the banks security madam said mr bindloose reddening i say harm of nae mans creditill would it beseem mebut there is a difference between tam turnpenny and the bank i trow  weel weel bank here bank there i thought i had a friend in you mr bindloose and here am i come from my ain house all the way to yours for sma comfort i think  my stars madam said the perplexed scribe what would you have me to do in such a blind story as yours mrs dodsbe a thought reasonableconsider that there is no corpus delicti  corpus delicti and whats that said meg something to be paid for nae doubt for your hard words a end in thatand what for suld i no have a corpus delicti or a habeas corpus or ony other corpus that i like sae lang as i am willing to lick and lay down the ready siller  lord help and pardon us mrs dods said the distressed agent ye mistake the matter athegether when i say there is no corpus delicti i mean to say there is no proof that a crime has been committedi19  and does the man say that murder is not a crime than answered meg who had taken her own view of the subject far too strongly to be converted to any otherweel i wot its a crime baith by the law of god and man and mony a pretty man has been strapped for it  i ken all that very weel answered the writer but my stars mrs dods there is nae evidence of murder in this casenae proof that a man has been slainnae production of his dead bodyand that is what we call the corpus delicti  weel than the deil lick it out of ye said meg rising in wrath for i will awa hame again and as for the puir lads body ill hae it fund if it cost me turning the earth for three miles round wi pick and shoolif it were but to give the puir bairn christian burial and to bring punishment on macturk and the murdering crew at the waal and to shame an auld doited fule like yoursell john bindloose  she rose in wrath to call her vehicle but it was neither the interest nor the intention of the writer that his customer and he should part on such indifferent terms he implored her patience and reminded her that the horses poor things had just come off their stagean argument which sounded irresistible in the ears of the old shepublican in whose early education due care of the postcattle mingled with the most sacred duties she therefore resumed her seat again in a sullen mood and mr bindloose was cudgelling his brains for some argument which might bring the old lady to reason when his attention was drawn by a noise in the passage  footnote  i19 for example a man cannot be tried for murder merely in the case of the nonappearance of an individual there must be proof that the party has been murdered     chapter xv  a praiser of past times      now your traveller     he and his toothpick at my worships mess  king john   the noise stated at the conclusion of last chapter to have disturbed mr bindloose was the rapping of one as in haste and impatience at the bankoffice door which office was an apartment of the bankers house on the left hand of his passage as the parlour in which he had received mrs dods was upon the right  in general this office was patent to all having business there but at present whatever might be the hurry of the party who knocked the clerks within the office could not admit him being themselves made prisoners by the prudent jealousy of mr bindloose to prevent them from listening to his consultation with mrs dods they therefore answered the angry and impatient knocking of the stranger only with stifled giggling from within finding it no doubt an excellent joke that their masters precaution was thus interfering with their own discharge of duty  with one or two hearty curses upon them as the regular plagues of his life mr bindloose darted into the passage and admitted the stranger into his official apartment the doors both of the parlour and office remaining open the ears of luckie dods experienced as the reader knows in collecting intelligence could partly overhear what passed the conversation seemed to regard a cash transaction of some importance as meg became aware when the stranger raised a voice which was naturally sharp and high as he did when uttering the following words towards the close of a conversation which had lasted about five minutespremiumnot a pice sirnot a courienot a farthingpremium for a bank of england billdye take me for a fool sirdo not i know that you call forty days par when you give remittances to london  mr bindloose was here heard to mutter something indistinctly about the custom of the trade  custom retorted the stranger no such thingdamnd bad custom if it is onedont tell me of customssbodikins man i know the rate of exchange all over the world and have drawn bills from timbuctoomy friends in the strand filed it along with bruces from gondartalk to me of premium on a bank of england postbillwhat dye look at the bill fordye think it doubtfuli can change it  by no means necessary answered bindloose the bill is quite right but it is usual to indorse sir  certainlyreach me a pendye think i can write with my rattanwhat sort of ink is thisyellow as curry saucenever mindthere is my nameperegrine touchwoodi got it from the willoughbies my christian namehave i my full change here  your full change sir answered bindloose  why you should give me a premium friend instead of me giving you one  it is out of our way i assure you sir said the banker quite out of our waybut if you would step into the parlour and take a cup of tea  why ay said the stranger his voice sounding more distinctly as talking all the while and ushered along by mr bindloose he left the office and moved towards the parlour a cup of tea were no such bad thing if one could come by it genuinebut as for your premiumso saying he entered the parlour and made his bow to mrs dods who seeing what she called a decent purposelike body and aware that his pocket was replenished with english and scottish paper currency returned the compliment with her best curtsy  mr touchwood when surveyed more at leisure was a short stout active man who though sixty years of age and upwards retained in his sinews and frame the elasticity of an earlier period his countenance expressed selfconfidence and something like a contempt for those who had neither seen nor endured so much as he had himself his short black hair was mingled with grey but not entirely whitened by it his eyes were jetblack deepset small and sparkling and contributed with a short turnedup nose to express an irritable and choleric habit his complexion was burnt to a brickcolour by the vicissitudes of climate to which it had been subjected and his face which at the distance of a yard or two seemed hale and smooth appeared when closely examined to be seamed with a million of wrinkles crossing each other in every direction possible but as fine as if drawn by the point of a very small needlei20 his dress was a blue coat and buff waistcoat half boots remarkably well blacked and a silk handkerchief tied with military precision the only antiquated part of his dress was a cocked hat of equilateral dimensions in the buttonhole of which he wore a very small cockade mrs dods accustomed to judge of persons by their first appearance said that in the three steps which he made from the door to the teatable she recognised without the possibility of mistake the gait of a person who was well to pass in the world and that she added with a wink is what we victuallers are seldom deceived in if a goldlaced waistcoat has an empty pouch the plain swansdown will be the brawer of the twa  a drizzling morning good madam said mr touchwood as with a view of sounding what sort of company he had got into  a fine saft morning for the crap sir answered mrs dods with equal solemnity  right my good madam soft is the very word though it has been some time since i heard it i have cast a double hank about the round world since i last heard of a softi21 morning  you will be from these parts then said the writer ingeniously putting a case which he hoped would induce the stranger to explain himself and yet sir he added after a pause i was thinking that touchwood is not a scottish name at least that i ken of  scottish nameno replied the traveller but a man may have been in these parts before without being a nativeor being a native he may have had some reason to change his namethere are many reasons why men change their names  certainly and some of them very good ones said the lawyer as in the common case of an heir of entail where deed of provision and tailzie is maist ordinarily implemented by taking up name and arms  ay or in the case of a man having made the country too hot for him under his own proper appellative said mr touchwood  that is a supposition sir replied the lawyer which it would ill become me to putbut at any rate if you knew this country formerly ye cannot but be marvellously pleased with the change we have been making since the american warhillsides bearing clover instead of heatherrents doubled trebled quadrupledthe auld reekie dungeons pulled down and gentlemen living in as good houses as you will see any where in england  much good may it do them for a pack of fools replied mr touchwood hastily  you do not seem much delighted with our improvements sir said the banker astonished to hear a dissentient voice where he conceived all men were unanimous  pleased answered the strangeryes as much pleased as i am with the devil who i believe set many of them agoing ye have got an idea that every thing must be changedunstable as water ye shall not exceli tell ye there have been more changes in this poor nook of yours within the last forty years than in the great empires of the east for the space of four thousand for what i know  and why not replied bindloose if they be changes for the better  but they are not for the better replied mr touchwood eagerly i left your peasantry as poor as rats indeed but honest and industrious enduring their lot in this world with firmness and looking forward to the next with hopenow they are mere eyeservantslooking at their watches forsooth every ten minutes lest they should work for their master half an instant after loosingtimeand then instead of studying the bible on the work days to kittle the clergymen with doubtful points of controversy on the sabbath they glean all their theology from tom paine and voltaire  weel i wot the gentleman speaks truth said mrs dods i fand a bundle of their bawbee blasphemies in my ain kitchenbut i trow i made a clean house of the packman loon that brought themno content wi turning the tawpies heads wi ballants and driving them daft wi ribands to cheat them out of their precious souls and gie them the deevils ware that i suld say sae in exchange for the siller that suld support their puir father thats aff wark and bedridden  father madam said the stranger they think no more of their father than regan or goneril  in gude troth ye have skeel of our sect sir replied the dame they are gomerils every one of themi tell them sae every hour of the day but catch them profiting by the doctrine  and then the brutes are turned mercenary madam said mr touchwood i remember when a scottishman would have scorned to touch a shilling that he had not earned and yet was as ready to help a stranger as an arab of the desert and now i did but drop my cane the other day as i was ridinga fellow who was working at the hedge made three steps to lift iti thanked him and my friend threw his hat on his head and damned my thanks if that were allsaint giles could not have excelled him  weel weel said the banker that may be a as you say sir and nae doubt wealth makes wit waver but the countrys wealthy that cannot be denied and wealth sir ye ken  i know wealth makes itself wings answered the cynical stranger but i am not quite sure we have it even now you make a great show indeed with building and cultivation but stock is not capital any more than the fat of a corpulent man is health or strength  surely mr touchwood said bindloose who felt his own account in the modern improvements a set of landlords living like lairds in good earnest and tenants with better housekeeping than the lairds used to have and facing whitsunday and martinmas as i would face my breakfastif these are not signs of wealth i do not know where to seek for them  they are signs of folly sir replied touchwood folly that is poor and renders itself poorer by desiring to be thought rich and how they come by the means they are so ostentatious of you who are a banker perhaps can tell me better than i can guess  there is maybe an accommodation bill discounted now and then mr touchwood but men must have accommodation or the world would stand stillaccommodation is the grease that makes the wheels go  ay makes them go down hill to the devil answered touchwood i left you bothered about one ayr bank but the whole country is an air bank now i thinkand who is to pay the piperbut its all onei will see little more of itit is a perfect babel and would turn the head of a man who has spent his life with people who love sitting better than running silence better than speaking who never eat but when they are hungry never drink but when thirsty never laugh without a jest and never speak but when they have something to say but here it is all run ride and drivefroth foam and flippancyno steadinessno character  ill lay the burden of my life said dame dods looking towards her friend bindloose that the gentleman has been at the new spawwaal yonder  spaw do you call it madamif you mean the new establishment that has been spawned down yonder at st ronans it is the very fountainhead of folly and coxcombrya babel for noise and a vanityfair for nonsenseno well in your swamps tenanted by such a conceited colony of clamorous frogs  sir sir exclaimed dame dods delighted with the unqualified sentence passed upon her fashionable rivals and eager to testify her respect for the judicious stranger who had pronounced itwill you let me have the pleasure of pouring you out a dish of tea and so saying she took bustling possession of the administration which had hitherto remained in the hands of mr bindloose himself  i hope it is to your taste sir she continued when the traveller had accepted her courtesy with the grateful acknowledgment which men addicted to speak a great deal usually show to a willing auditor  it is as good as we have any right to expect maam answered mr touchwood not quite like what i have drunk at canton with old fong quabut the celestial empire does not send its best tea to leadenhall street nor does leadenhall street send its best to marchthorn  that may be very true sir replied the dame but i will venture to say that mr bindlooses tea is muckle better than you had at the spawwaal yonder  tea madami saw noneash leaves and blackthorn leaves were brought in in painted canisters and handed about by powdermonkeys in livery and consumed by those who liked it amidst the chattering of parrots and the squalling of kittens i longed for the days of the spectator when i might have laid my penny on the bar and retired without ceremonybut nothis blessed decoction was circulated under the auspices of some halfcrazed bluestocking or other and we were saddled with all the formality of an entertainment for this miserable allowance of a cockleshell full of catlap per head  weel sir answered dame dods all i can say is that if it had been my luck to have served you at the cleikum inn which our folk have kept for these twa generations i canna pretend to say ye should have had such tea as ye have been used to in foreign parts where it grows but the best i had i wad have gien it to a gentleman of your appearance and i never charged mair than sixpence in all my time and my fathers before me  i wish i had known the old inn was still standing madam said the traveller i should certainly have been your guest and sent down for the water every morningthe doctors insist i must use cheltenham or some substitute for the bilethough dn them i believe its only to hide their own ignorance and i thought this spaw would have been the least evil of the two but i have been fairly overreachedone might as well live in the inside of a bell i think young st ronans must be mad to have established such a vanityfair upon his fathers old property  do you ken this st ronans that now is enquired the dame  by report only said mr touchwood but i have heard of the family and i think i have read of them too in scottish history i am sorry to understand they are lower in the world than they have been this young man does not seem to take the best way to mend matters spending his time among gamblers and blacklegs  i should be sorry if it were so said honest meg dods whose hereditary respect for the family always kept her from joining in any scandal affecting the character of the young lairdmy forbears sir have had kindness frae his and although maybe he may have forgotten all about it it wad ill become me to say ony thing of him that should not be said of his fathers son  mr bindloose had not the same motive for forbearance he declaimed against mowbray as a thoughtless dissipater of his own fortune and that of others i have some reason to speak he said having two of his notes for l100 each which i discounted out of mere kindness and respect for his ancient family and which he thinks nae mair of retiring than he does of paying the national debtand here has he been raking every shop in marchthorn to fit out an entertainment for all the fine folk at the well yonder and tradesfolk are obliged to take his acceptances for their furnishings but they may cash his bills that will i ken ane that will never advance a bawbee on ony paper that has john mowbray either on the back or front of it he had mair need to be paying the debts which he has made already than making new anes that he may feed fules and flatterers  i believe he is likely to lose his preparations too said mr touchwood for the entertainment has been put off as i heard in consequence of miss mowbrays illness  ay ay puir thing said dame margaret dods her health has been unsettled for this mony a day  something wrong here they tell me said the traveller pointing to his own forehead significantly  god only kens replied mrs dods but i rather suspect the heart than the headthe puir thing is hurried here and there and down to the waal and up again and nae society or quiet at hame and a thing ganging this unthrifty gaitnae wonder she is no that weel settled  well replied touchwood she is worse they say than she has been and that has occasioned the party at shawscastle having been put off besides now this fine young lord has come down to the well undoubtedly they will wait her recovery  a lord ejaculated the astonished mrs dods a lord come down to the waalthey will be neither to haud nor to bind nowance wud and aye waura lordset them up and shute them forwarda lordthe lord have a care o usa lord at the hottlemaister touchwood its my mind he will only prove to be a lord o session  nay not so my good lady replied the traveller he is an english lord and as they say a lord of parliamentbut some folk pretend to say there is a flaw in the title  ill warrant is therea dozen of them said meg with alacrityfor she could by no means endure to think on the accumulation of dignity likely to accrue to the rival establishment from its becoming the residence of an actual nobleman ill warrant hell prove a landlouping lord on their hand and they will be een cheap o the lossand he has come down out of order its like and nae doubt hell no be lang there before he will recover his health for the credit of the spaw  faith madam his present disorder is one which the spaw will hardly curehe is shot in the shoulder with a pistolbulleta robbery attempted it seemsthat is one of your new accomplishmentsno such thing happened in scotland in my timemen would have sooner expected to meet with the phoenix than with a highwayman  and where did this happen if you please sir asked the man of bills  somewhere near the old village replied the stranger and if i am rightly informed on wednesday last  this explains your twa shots i am thinking mrs dods said mr bindloose your groom heard them on the wednesdayit must have been this attack on the stranger nobleman  maybe it was and maybe it was not said mrs dods but ill see gude reason before i give up my ain judgment in that casei wad like to ken if this gentleman she added returning to the subject from which mr touchwoods interesting conversation had for a few minutes diverted her thoughts has heard aught of mr tirl  if you mean the person to whom this paper relates said the stranger taking a printed handbill from his pocket i heard of little elsethe whole place rang of him till i was almost as sick of tyrrel as william rufus was some idiotical quarrel which he had engaged in and which he had not fought out as their wisdom thought he should have done was the principal cause of censure that is another folly now which has gained ground among you formerly two old proud lairds or cadets of good family perhaps quarrelled and had a rencontre or fought a duel after the fashion of their old gothic ancestors but men who had no grandfathers never dreamt of such follyand here the folk denounce a trumpery dauber of canvass for such i understand to be this heros occupation as if he were a fieldofficer who made valour his profession and who if you deprived him of his honour was like to be deprived of his bread at the same timeha ha ha it reminds one of don quixote who took his neighbour samson carrasco for a knighterrant  the perusal of this paper which contained the notes formerly laid before the reader containing the statement of sir bingo and the censure which the company at the well had thought fit to pass upon his affair with mr tyrrel induced mr bindloose to say to mrs dods with as little exultation on the superiority of his own judgment as human nature would permit  ye see now that i was right mrs dods and that there was nae earthly use in your fashing yoursell wi this lang journeythe lad had just taen the bent rather than face sir bingo and troth i think him the wiser of the twa for sae doingthere ye hae print for it  meg answered somewhat sullenly ye may be mistaen for a that your ainsell for as wise as ye are mr bindloose i shall hae that matter mair strictly enquired into  this led to a renewal of the altercation concerning the probable fate of tyrrel in the course of which the stranger was induced to take some interest in the subject  at length mrs dods receiving no countenance from the experienced lawyer for the hypothesis she had formed rose in something like displeasure to order her whiskey to be prepared but hostess as she was herself when in her own dominions she reckoned without her host in the present instance for the humpbacked postilion as absolute in his department as mrs dods herself declared that the cattle would not be fit for the road these two hours yet the good lady was therefore obliged to wait his pleasure bitterly lamenting all the while the loss which a house of public entertainment was sure to sustain by the absence of the landlord or landlady and anticipating a long list of broken dishes miscalculated reckonings unarranged chambers and other disasters which she was to expect at her return mr bindloose zealous to recover the regard of his good friend and client which he had in some degree forfeited by contradicting her on a favourite subject did not choose to offer the unpleasing though obvious topic of consolation that an unfrequented inn is little exposed to the accidents she apprehended on the contrary he condoled with her very cordially and went so far as to hint that if mr touchwood had come to marchthorn with posthorses as he supposed from his dress she could have the advantage of them to return with more despatch to st ronans  i am not sure said mr touchwood suddenly but i may return there myself in that case i will be glad to set this good lady down and to stay a few days at her house if she will receive mei respect a woman like you maam who pursue the occupation of your fatheri have been in countries maam where people have followed the same trade from father to son for thousands of yearsand i like the fashionit shows a steadiness and sobriety of character  mrs dods put on a joyous countenance at this proposal protesting that all should be done in her power to make things agreeable and while her good friend mr bindloose expatiated upon the comfort her new guest would experience at the cleikum she silently contemplated with delight the prospect of a speedy and dazzling triumph by carrying off a creditable customer from her showy and successful rival at the well  i shall be easily accommodated maam said the stranger i have travelled too much and too far to be troublesome a spanish venta a persian khan or a turkish caravanserail is all the same to meonly as i have no servantindeed never can be plagued with one of these idle loiterersi must beg you will send to the well for a bottle of the water on such mornings as i cannot walk there myselfi find it is really of some service to me  mrs dods readily promised compliance with this reasonable request graciously conceding that there could be nae ill in the water itsell but maybe some gudeit was only the new inn and the daft haverils that they caad the company that she misliked folk had a jest that st ronan dookit the deevil in the waal which garrd it taste aye since of brimstanebut she dared to say that was a papist nonsense for she was tellt by him that kend weel and that was the minister himsell that st ronan was nane of your idolatrous roman saunts but a chaldee meaning probably a culdee whilk was doubtless a very different story  matters being thus arranged to the satisfaction of both parties the postchaise was ordered and speedily appeared at the door of mr bindlooses

c c c  footnotes  i20 this was a peculiarity in the countenance of the celebrated cossack leader platoff  i21 an epithet which expresses in scotland what the barometer calls rainy     chapter xvi  the clergyman      a man he was to all the country dear     and passing rich with forty pounds ayear  goldsmiths deserted village   mrs dodss conviction that her friend tyrrel had been murdered by the sanguinary captain macturk remained firm and unshaken but some researches for the supposed body having been found fruitless as well as expensive she began to give up the matter in despair she had done her dutyshe left the matter to them that had a charge anent such thingsand providence would bring the mystery to light in his own fitting timesuch were the moralities with which the good dame consoled herself and with less obstinacy than mr bindloose had expected she retained her opinion without changing her banker and man of business  perhaps megs acquiescent inactivity in a matter which she had threatened to probe so deeply was partly owing to the place of poor tyrrel being supplied in her blue chamber and in her daily thoughts and cares by her new guest mr touchwood in possessing whom a deserter as he was from the well she obtained according to her view of the matter a decided triumph over her rivals it sometimes required however the full force of this reflection to induce meg old and crabbed as she was to submit to the various caprices and exactions of attention which were displayed by her new lodger never any man talked so much as touchwood of his habitual indifference to food and accommodation in travelling and probably there never was any traveller who gave more trouble in a house of entertainment he had his own whims about cookery and when these were contradicted especially if he felt at the same time a twinge of incipient gout one would have thought he had taken his lessons in the pastryshop of bedreddin hassan and was ready to renew the scene of the unhappy creamtart which was compounded without pepper every now and then he started some new doctrine in culinary matters which mrs dods deemed a heresy and then the very house rang with their disputes again his bed must necessarily be made at a certain angle from the pillow to the footposts and the slightest deviation from this disturbed he said his nocturnal rest and did certainly ruffle his temper he was equally whimsical about the brushing of his clothes the arrangement of the furniture in his apartment and a thousand minuti√¶ which in conversation he seemed totally to contemn  it may seem singular but such is the inconsistency of human nature that a guest of this fanciful and capricious disposition gave much more satisfaction to mrs dods than her quiet and indifferent friend mr tyrrel if her present lodger could blame he could also applaud and no artist conscious of such skill as mrs dods possessed is indifferent to the praises of such a connoisseur as mr touchwood the pride of art comforted her for the additional labour nor was it a matter unworthy of this most honest publicans consideration that the guests who give most trouble are usually those who incur the largest bills and pay them with the best grace on this point touchwood was a jewel of a customer he never denied himself the gratification of the slightest whim whatever expense he might himself incur or whatever trouble he might give to those about him and all was done under protestation that the matter in question was the most indifferent thing to him in the world what the devil did he care for burgesss sauces he that had eat his kouscousou spiced with nothing but the sand of the desert only it was a shame for mrs dods to be without what every decent house above the rank of an alehouse ought to be largely provided with  in short he fussed fretted commanded and was obeyed kept the house in hot water and yet was so truly goodnatured when essential matters were in discussion that it was impossible to bear him the least illwill so that mrs dods though in a moment of spleen she sometimes wished him at the top of tintockif always ended by singing forth his praises she could not indeed help suspecting that he was a nabob as well from his conversation about foreign parts as from his freaks of indulgence to himself and generosity to othersattributes which she understood to be proper to most men of ind but although the reader has heard her testify a general dislike to this species of fortunes favourites mrs dods had sense enough to know that a nabob living in the neighbourhood who raises the price of eggs and poultry upon the good housewives around was very different from a nabob residing within her own gates drawing all his supplies from her own larder and paying without hesitation or question whatever bills her conscience permitted her to send in in short to come back to the point at which we perhaps might have stopped some time since landlady and guest were very much pleased with each other  but ennui finds entrance into every scene when the gloss of novelty is over and the fiend began to seize upon mr touchwood just when he had got all matters to his mind in the cleikum innhad instructed dame dods in the mysteries of curry and mullegatawnydrilled the chambermaid into the habit of making his bed at the angle recommended by sir john sinclairand made some progress in instructing the humpbacked postilion in the arabian mode of grooming pamphlets and newspapers sent from london and from edinburgh by loads proved inadequate to rout this invader of mr touchwoods comfort and at last he bethought himself of company the natural resource would have been the wellbut the traveller had a holy shivering of awe which crossed him at the very recollection of lady penelope who had worked him rather hard during his former brief residence and although lady binkss beauty might have charmed an asiatic by the plump graces of its contour our senior was past the thoughts of a sultana and a haram at length a bright idea crossed his mind and he suddenly demanded of mrs dods who was pouring out his tea for breakfast into a large cup of a very particular species of china of which he had presented her with a service on condition of her rendering him this personal good officepray mrs dods what sort of a man is your minister  hes just a man like other men maister touchwood replied meg what sort of a man should he be  a man like other menaythat is to say he has the usual complement of legs and arms eyes and earsbut is he a sensible man  no muckle o that sir answered dame dods for if he was drinking this very tea that ye gat doun from london wi the mail he wad mistake it for common bohea  then he has not all his organswants a nose or the use of one at least said mr touchwood the tea is right gunpowdera perfect nosegay  aweel that may be said the landlady but i have gien the minister a dram frae my ain best bottle of real coniac brandy and may i

meg he keeps nae company at a neither in his ain house or ony gate else he comes down in the morning in a lang ragged nightgown like a potato bogle and down he sits amang his books and if they dinna

housethat is when he dines at aa drink of milk and a bit of bread serves his turn or maybe a cauld potatoits a heathenish fashion of him for as good a man as he is for surely there is nae christian man but loves his own bowels  why that may be answered touchwood but i have known many who took so much care of their own bowels my good dame as to have none for any one elsebut comebustle to the

a minister  why you foolish person is there not the woman up the village that has just brought another fool into the world and will she not need sack and caudle if we leave some of our wine  a gude aleposset wad set her better said meg however if its your will it shall be my pleasurebut the like of sic a gentleman as yoursell never entered my doors  the traveller was gone before she had completed the sentence and leaving meg to bustle and maunder at her leisure away he marched with the haste that characterised all his motions when he had any new project in his head to form an acquaintance with the minister of st ronans whom while he walks down the street to the manse we will endeavour to introduce to the reader  the rev josiah cargill was the son of a small farmer in the south of scotland and a weak constitution joined to the disposition for study which frequently accompanies infirm health induced his parents though at the expense of some sacrifices to educate him for the ministry they were the rather led to submit to the privations which were necessary to support this expense because they conceived from their family traditions that he had in his veins some portion of the blood of that celebrated boanerges of the covenant donald cargillig who was slain by the persecutors at the town of queensferry in the melancholy days of charles ii merely because in the plenitude of his sacerdotal power he had cast out of the church and delivered over to satan by a formal excommunication the king and royal family with all the ministers and courtiers thereunto belonging but if josiah was really derived from this uncompromising champion the heat of the family spirit which he might have inherited was qualified by the sweetness of his own disposition and the quiet temper of the times in which he had the good fortune to live he was characterised by all who knew him as a mild gentle and studious lover of learning who in the quiet prosecution of his own sole object the acquisition of knowledge and especially of that connected with his profession had the utmost indulgence for all whose pursuits were different from his own his sole relaxations were those of a retiring mild and pensive temper and were limited to a ramble almost always solitary among the woods and hills in praise of which he was sometimes guilty of a sonnet but rather because he could not help the attempt than as proposing to himself the fame or the rewards which attend the successful poet indeed far from seeking to insinuate his fugitive pieces into magazines and newspapers he blushed at his poetical attempts even while alone and in fact was rarely so indulgent to his vein as to commit them to paper  from the same maidlike modesty of disposition our student suppressed a strong natural turn towards drawing although he was repeatedly complimented upon the few sketches which he made by some whose judgment was generally admitted it was however this neglected talent which like the swift feet of the stag in the fable was fated to render him a service which he might in vain have expected from his worth and learning  my lord bidmore a distinguished connoisseur chanced to be in search of a private tutor for his son and heir the honourable augustus bidmore and for this purpose had consulted the professor of theology who passed before him in review several favourite students any of whom he conceived well suited for the situation but still his answer to the important and unlookedfor question did the candidate understand drawing was answered in the negative the professor indeed added his opinion that such an accomplishment was neither to be desired nor expected in a student of theology but pressed hard with this condition as a sine qua non he at length did remember a dreaming lad about the hall who seldom could be got to speak above his breath even when delivering his essays but was said to have a strong turn for drawing this was enough for my lord bidmore who contrived to obtain a sight of some of young cargills sketches and was satisfied that under such a tutor his son could not fail to maintain that character for hereditary taste which his father and grandfather had acquired at the expense of a considerable estate the representative value of which was now the painted canvass in the great gallery at bidmorehouse  upon following up the enquiry concerning the young mans character he was found to possess all the other necessary qualifications of learning and morals in a greater degree than perhaps lord bidmore might have required and to the astonishment of his fellowstudents but more especially to his own josiah cargill was promoted to the desired and desirable situation of private tutor to the honourable mr bidmore  mr cargill did his duty ably and conscientiously by a spoiled though goodhumoured lad of weak health and very ordinary parts he could not indeed inspire into him any portion of the deep and noble enthusiasm which characterises the youth of genius but his pupil made such progress in each branch of his studies as his capacity enabled him to attain he understood the learned languages and could be very profound on the subject of various readingshe pursued science and could class shells pack mosses and arrange mineralshe drew without taste but with much accuracy and although he attained no commanding height in any pursuit he knew enough of many studies literary and scientific to fill up his time and divert from temptation a head which was none of the strongest in point of resistance  miss augusta bidmore his lordships only other child received also the instructions of cargill in such branches of science as her father chose she should acquire and her tutor was capable to teach but her progress was as different from that of her brother as the fire of heaven differs from that grosser element which the peasant piles upon his smouldering hearth her acquirements in italian and spanish literature in history in drawing and in all elegant learning were such as to enchant her teacher while at the same time it kept him on the stretch lest in her successful career the scholar should outstrip the master  alas such intercourse fraught as it is with dangers arising out of the best and kindest as well as the most natural feelings on either side proved in the present as in many other instances fatal to the peace of the preceptor every feeling heart will excuse a weakness which we shall presently find carried with it its own severe punishment cadenus indeed believe him who will has assured us that in such a perilous intercourse he himself preserved the limits which were unhappily transgressed by the unfortunate vanessa his more impassioned pupil      the innocent delight he took     to see the virgin mind her book     was but the masters secret joy     in school to hear the finest boy  but josiah cargill was less fortunate or less cautious he suffered his fair pupil to become inexpressibly dear to him before he discovered the precipice towards which he was moving under the direction of a blind and misplaced passion he was indeed utterly incapable of availing himself of the opportunities afforded by his situation to involve his pupil in the toils of a mutual passion honour and gratitude alike forbade such a line of conduct even had it been consistent with the natural bashfulness simplicity and innocence of his disposition to sigh and suffer in secret to form resolutions of separating himself from a situation so fraught with danger and to postpone from day to day the accomplishment of a resolution so prudent was all to which the tutor found himself equal and it is not improbable that the veneration with which he regarded his patrons daughter with the utter hopelessness of the passion which he nourished tended to render his love yet more pure and disinterested  at length the line of conduct which reason had long since recommended could no longer be the subject of procrastination mr bidmore was destined to foreign travel for a twelvemonth and mr cargill received from his patron the alternative of accompanying his pupil or retiring upon a suitable provision the reward of his past instructions it can hardly be doubted which he preferred for while he was with young bidmore he did not seem entirely separated from his sister he was sure to hear of augusta frequently and to see some part at least of the letters which she was to write to her brother he might also hope to be remembered in these letters as her good friend and tutor and to these consolations his quiet contemplative and yet enthusiastic disposition clung as to a secret source of pleasure the only one which life seemed to open to him  but fate had a blow in store which he had not anticipated the chance of augustas changing her maiden condition for that of a wife probable as her rank beauty and fortune rendered such an event had never once occurred to him and although he had imposed upon himself the unwavering belief that she could never be his he was inexpressibly affected by the intelligence that she had become the property of another  the honourable mr bidmores letters to his father soon after announced that poor mr cargill had been seized with a nervous fever and again that his reconvalescence was attended with so much debility it seemed both of mind and body as entirely to destroy his utility as a travelling companion shortly after this the travellers separated and cargill returned to his native country alone indulging upon the road in a melancholy abstraction of mind which he had suffered to grow upon him since the mental shock which he had sustained and which in time became the most characteristical feature of his demeanour his meditations were not even disturbed by any anxiety about his future subsistence although the cessation of his employment seemed to render that precarious for this however lord bidmore had made provision for though a coxcomb where the fine arts were concerned he was in other particulars a just and honourable man who felt a sincere pride in having drawn the talents of cargill from obscurity and entertained due gratitude for the manner in which he had achieved the important task intrusted to him in his family  his lordship had privately purchased from the mowbray family the patronage or advowson of the living of st ronans then held by a very old incumbent who died shortly afterwards so that upon arriving in england cargill found himself named to the vacant living so indifferent however did he feel himself towards this preferment that he might possibly not have taken the trouble to go through the necessary steps previous to his ordination had it not been on account of his mother now a widow and unprovided for unless by the support which he afforded her he visited her in her small retreat in the suburbs of marchthorn heard her pour out her gratitude to heaven that she should have been granted life long enough to witness her sons promotion to a charge which in her eyes was more honourable and desirable than an episcopal seeheard her chalk out the life which they were to lead together in the humble independence which had thus fallen on himhe heard all this and had no power to crush her hopes and her triumph by the indulgence of his own romantic feelings he passed almost mechanically through the usual forms and was inducted into the living of st ronans  although fanciful and romantic it was not in josiah cargills nature to yield to unavailing melancholy yet he sought relief not in society but in solitary study his seclusion was the more complete that his mother whose education had been as much confined as her fortunes felt awkward under her new dignities and willingly acquiesced in her sons secession from society and spent her whole time in superintending the little household and in her way providing for all emergencies the occurrence of which might call josiah out of his favourite bookroom as old age rendered her inactive she began to regret the incapacity of her son to superintend his own household and talked something of matrimony and the mysteries of the muckle wheel to these admonitions mr cargill returned only slight and evasive answers and when the old lady slept in the village churchyard at a reverend old age there was no one to perform the office of superintendent in the ministers family neither did josiah cargill seek for any but patiently submitted to all the evils with which a bachelor estate is attended and which were at least equal to those which beset the renowned magopico during his state of celibacyi22 his butter was ill churned and declared by all but himself and the quean who made it altogether uneatable his milk was burnt in the pan his fruit and vegetables were stolen and his black stockings mended with blue and white thread  for all these things the minister cared not his mind ever bent upon far different matters do not let my fair readers do josiah more than justice or suppose that like beltenebros in the desert he remained for years the victim of an unfortunate and misplaced passion noto the shame of the male sex be it spoken that no degree of hopeless love however desperate and sincere can ever continue for years to embitter life there must be hopethere must be uncertaintythere must be reciprocity to enable the tyrant of the soul to secure a dominion of very long duration over a manly and wellconstituted mind which is itself desirous to will its freedom the memory of augusta had long faded from josiahs thoughts or was remembered only as a pleasing but melancholy and unsubstantial dream while he was straining forward in pursuit of a yet nobler and coyer mistress in a word of knowledge herself  every hour that he could spare from his parochial duties which he discharged with zeal honourable to his heart and head was devoted to his studies and spent among his books but this chase of wisdom though in itself interesting and dignified was indulged to an excess which diminished the respectability nay the utility of the deceived student and he forgot amid the luxury of deep and dark investigations that society has its claims and that the knowledge which is unimparted is necessarily a barren talent and is lost to society like the misers concealed hoard by the death of the proprietor his studies were also under the additional disadvantage that being pursued for the gratification of a desultory longing after knowledge and directed to no determined object they turned on points rather curious than useful and while they served for the amusement of the student himself promised little utility to mankind at large  bewildered amid abstruse researches metaphysical and historical mr cargill living only for himself and his books acquired many ludicrous habits which exposed the secluded student to the ridicule of the world and which tinged though they did not altogether obscure the natural civility of an amiable disposition as well as the acquired habits of politeness which he had learned in the good society that frequented lord bidmores mansion he not only indulged in neglect of dress and appearance and all those ungainly tricks which men are apt to acquire by living very much alone but besides and especially he became probably the most abstracted and absent man of a profession peculiarly liable to cherish such habits no man fell so regularly into the painful dilemma of mistaking or in scottish phrase miskenning the person he spoke to or more frequently enquired of an old maid for her husband of a childless wife about her young people of the distressed widower for the spouse at whose funeral he himself had assisted but a fortnight before and none was ever more familiar with strangers whom he had never seen or seemed more estranged from those who had a title to think themselves well known to him the worthy man perpetually confounded sex age and calling and when a blind beggar extended his hand for charity he has been known to return the civility by taking off his hat making a low bow and hoping his worship was well  among his brethren mr cargill alternately commanded respect by the depth of his erudition and gave occasion to laughter from his odd peculiarities on the latter occasions he used abruptly to withdraw from the ridicule he had provoked for notwithstanding the general mildness of his character his solitary habits had engendered a testy impatience of contradiction and a keener sense of pain arising from the satire of others than was natural to his unassuming disposition as for his parishioners they enjoyed as may reasonably be supposed many a hearty laugh at their pastors expense and were sometimes as mrs dods hinted more astonished than edified by his learning for in pursuing a point of biblical criticism he did not altogether remember that he was addressing a popular and unlearned assembly not delivering a concio ad cleruma mistake not arising from any conceit of his learning or wish to display it but from the same absence of mind which induced an excellent divine when preaching before a party of criminals condemned to death to break off by promising the wretches who were to suffer next morning the rest of the discourse at the first proper opportunity but all the neighbourhood acknowledged mr cargills serious and devout discharge of his ministerial duties and the poorer parishioners forgave his innocent peculiarities in consideration of his unbounded charity while the heritors if they ridiculed the abstractions of mr cargill on some subjects had the grace to recollect that they had prevented him from suing an augmentation of stipend according to the fashion of the clergy around him or from demanding at their hands a new manse or the repair of the old one he once indeed wished that they would amend the roof of his bookroom which rained ini23 in a very pluvious manner but receiving no direct answer from our friend meiklewham who neither relished the proposal nor saw means of eluding it the minister quietly made the necessary repairs at his own expense and gave the heritors no farther trouble on the subject  such was the worthy divine whom our bon vivant at the cleikum inn hoped to conciliate by a good dinner and cockburns particular an excellent menstruum in most cases but not likely to be very efficacious on the present occasion  footnotes  i22 note iiimagopico  i23 scottic√© for admitted the rain     chapter xvii  the acquaintance      twixt us thus the difference

traveller rapid in all his resolutions and motions strode stoutly down the street and arrived at the manse which was as we have already described it all but absolutely ruinous the total desolation and want of order about the door would have argued the place uninhabited had it not been for two or three miserable tubs with suds or such like sluttish contents which were left there that those who broke their shins among them might receive a sensible proof that here the hand of woman had been the door being half off its hinges the entrance was for the time protected by a broken harrow which must necessarily be removed before entry could be obtained the little garden which might have given an air of comfort to the old house had it been kept in any order was abandoned to a desolation of which that of the sluggard was only a type and the ministers man an attendant always proverbial for doing half work and who seemed in the present instance to do none was seen among docks and nettles solacing himself with the few gooseberries which remained on some mossgrown bushes to him mr touchwood called loudly enquiring after his master but the clown conscious of being taken in flagrant delict as the law says fled from him like a guilty thing instead of obeying his summons and was soon heard hupping and geeing to the cart which he had left on the other side of the broken wall  disappointed in his application to the manservant mr touchwood knocked with his cane at first gently then harder holloaed bellowed and shouted in the hope of calling the attention of some one within doors but received not a word in reply at length thinking that no trespass could be committed upon so forlorn and deserted an establishment he removed the obstacles to entrance with such a noise as he thought must necessarily have alarmed some one if there was any live person about the house at all all was still silent and entering a passage where the damp walls and broken flags corresponded to the appearance of things out of doors he opened a door to the left which wonderful to say still had a latch remaining and found himself in the parlour and in the presence of the person whom he came to visit  amid a heap of books and other literary lumber which had accumulated around him sat in his wellworn leathern elbow chair the learned minister of st ronans a thin spare man beyond the middle age of a dark complexion but with eyes which though now obscured and vacant had been once bright soft and expressive and whose features seemed interesting the rather that notwithstanding the carelessness of his dress he was in the habit of performing his ablutions with eastern precision for he had forgot neatness but not cleanliness his hair might have appeared much more disorderly had it not been thinned by time and disposed chiefly around the sides of his countenance and the back part of his head black stockings ungartered marked his professional dress and his feet were thrust into the old slipshod shoes which served him instead of slippers the rest of his garments as far as visible consisted in a plaid nightgown wrapt in long folds round his stooping and emaciated length of body and reaching down to the slippers aforesaid he was so intently engaged in studying the book before him a folio of no ordinary bulk that he totally disregarded the noise which mr touchwood made in entering the room as well as the coughs and hems with which he thought it proper to announce his presence  no notice being taken of these inarticulate signals mr touchwood however great an enemy he was to

charity sounds with which he was well acquainted and which never failed to produce some effect on him he looked at his visitor with lacklustre eye and without correcting the first opinion which he had formed although the strangers plump and sturdy frame as well as his nicelybrushed coat glancing cane and above all his upright and selfsatisfied manner resembled in no respect the dress form or bearing of a mendicant he quietly thrust a shilling into his hand and relapsed into the studious contemplation which the entrance of touchwood had interrupted  upon my word my good sir said his visitor surprised at a degree of absence of mind which he could hardly have conceived possible you have entirely mistaken my object  i am sorry my mite is insufficient my friend said the clergyman without again raising his eyes it is all i have at present to bestow  if you will have the kindness to look up for a moment my good sir said the traveller you may possibly perceive that you labour under a considerable mistake  mr cargill raised his head recalled his attention and seeing that he had a welldressed respectablelooking person before him he exclaimed in much confusion hayeson my word i was so immersed in my booki believei think i have the pleasure to see my worthy friend mr lavender  no such thing mr cargill replied mr touchwood i will save you the trouble of trying to recollect meyou never saw me beforebut do not let me disturb your studiesi am in no hurry and my business can wait your leisure  i am much obliged said mr cargill have the goodness to take a chair if you can find onei have a train of thought to recovera slight calculation to finishand then i am at your command  the visitor found among the broken furniture not without difficulty a seat strong enough to support his weight and sat down resting upon his cane and looking attentively at his host who very soon became totally insensible of his presence a long pause of total silence ensued only disturbed by the rustling leaves of the folio from which mr cargill seemed to be making extracts and now and then by a little exclamation of surprise and impatience when he dipped his pen as happened once or twice into his snuffbox instead of the inkstandish which stood beside it at length just as mr touchwood began to think the scene as tedious as it was singular the abstracted student raised his head and spoke as if in soliloquy from acon accor or st john dacre to jerusalem how far  twentythree miles north northwest answered his visitor without hesitation  mr cargill expressed no more surprise at a question which he had put to himself being answered by the voice of another than if he had found the distance on the map and indeed was not probably aware of the medium through which his question had been solved and it was the tenor of the answer alone which he attended to in his replytwentythree milesingulphus laying his hand on the volume and jeffrey winesauf do not agree in this  they may both be dd then for lying blockheads answered the traveller  you might have contradicted their authority sir without using such an expression said the divine gravely  i cry you mercy doctor said mr touchwood but would you compare these parchment fellows with me that have made my legs my compasses over great part of the inhabited world  you have been in palestine then said mr cargill drawing himself upright in his chair and speaking with eagerness and with interest  you may swear that doctor and at acre too why i was there the month after boney had found it too hard a nut to cracki dined with sir sydneys chum old djezzar pacha and an excellent dinner we had but for a dessert of noses and ears brought on after the last remove which spoiled my digestion old djezzar thought it so good a joke that you hardly saw a man in acre whose face was not as flat as the palm of my handgad i respect my olfactory organ and set off the next morning as fast as the most cursed hardtrotting dromedary that ever fell to poor pilgrims lot could contrive to tramp  if you have really been in the holy land sir said mr cargill whom the reckless gaiety of touchwoods manner rendered somewhat suspicious of a trick you will be able materially to enlighten me on the subject of the crusades  they happened before my time doctor replied the traveller  you are to understand that my curiosity refers to the geography of the countries where these events took place answered mr cargill  o as to that matter you are lighted on your feet said mr touchwood for the time present i can fit you turk arab copt and druse i know every one of them and can make you as well acquainted with them as myself without stirring a step beyond your threshold you shall know syria as well as i dobut one good turn deserves anotherin that case you must have the goodness to dine with me  i go seldom abroad sir said the minister with a good deal of hesitation for his habits of solitude and seclusion could not be entirely overcome even by the expectation raised by the travellers discourse yet i cannot deny myself the pleasure of waiting on a gentleman possessed of so much experience  well then said mr touchwood three be the houri never dine later and always to a minuteand the place the cleikum inn up the way where mrs dods is at this moment busy in making ready such a dinner as your learning has seldom seen doctor for i brought the receipts from the four different quarters of the globe  upon this treaty they parted and mr cargill after musing for a short while upon the singular chance which had sent a living man to answer those doubts for which he was in vain consulting ancient authorities at length resumed by degrees the train of reflection and investigation which mr touchwoods visit had interrupted and in a short time lost all recollection of his episodical visitor and of the engagement which he had formed  not so mr touchwood who when not occupied with business of real importance had the art as the reader may have observed to make a prodigious fuss about nothing at all upon the present occasion he bustled in and out of the kitchen till mrs dods lost patience and threatened to pin the dishclout to his tail a menace which he pardoned in consideration that in all the countries which he had visited which are sufficiently civilized to boast of cooks these artists toiling in their fiery element have a privilege to be testy and impatient he therefore retreated from the torrid region of mrs dodss microcosm and employed his time in the usual devices of loiterers partly by walking for an appetite partly by observing the progress of his watch towards three oclock when he had happily succeeded in getting an employment more serious his table in the blue parlour was displayed with two covers after the fairest fashion of the cleikum inn yet the landlady with a look civil but sly contrived to insinuate a doubt whether the clergyman would come when a was dune  mr touchwood scorned to listen to such an insinuation until the fated hour arrived and brought with it no mr cargill the impatient entertainer allowed five minutes for difference of clocks and variation of time and other five for the procrastination of one who went little into society but no sooner were the last five minutes expended than he darted off for the manse not indeed much like a greyhound or a deer but with the momentum of a corpulent and wellappetized elderly gentleman who is in haste to secure his dinner he bounced without ceremony into the parlour where he found the worthy divine clothed in the same plaid nightgown and seated in the very elbowchair in which he had left him five hours before his sudden entrance recalled to mr cargill not an accurate but something of a general recollection of what had passed in the morning and he hastened to apologize with haindeedalreadyupon my word mr aa i mean my dear friendi am afraid i have used you illi forgot to order any dinnerbut we will do our besteppieeppie  not at the first second nor third call but ex intervallo as the lawyers express it eppie a barelegged shockheaded thickankled redarmed wench entered and announced her presence by an emphatic whats your wull  have you got any thing in the house for dinner eppie  naething but bread and milk plenty otwhat should i have  you see sir said mr cargill you are like to have a pythagorean entertainment but you are a traveller and have doubtless been in your time thankful for bread and milk  but never when there was any thing better to be had said mr touchwood come doctor i beg your pardon but your wits are fairly gone a woolgathering it was i invited you to dinner up at the inn yonder and not you me  on my word and so it was said mr cargill i knew i was quite righti knew there was a dinner engagement betwixt us i was sure of that and that is the main pointcome sir i wait upon you  will you not first change your dress said the visitor seeing with astonishment that the divine proposed to attend him in his plaid nightgown why we shall have all the boys in the village after usyou will look like an owl in sunshine and they will flock round you like so many hedgesparrows  i will get my clothes instantly said the worthy clergyman i will get ready directlyi am really ashamed to keep you waiting my dear mrehehyour name has this instant escaped me  it is touchwood sir at your service i do not believe you ever heard it before answered the traveller  truerightno more i havewell my good mr touchstone will you sit down an instant until we see what we can dostrange slaves we make ourselves to these bodies of ours mr touchstonethe clothing and the sustaining of them costs us much thought and leisure which might be better employed in catering for the wants of our immortal spirits  mr touchwood thought in his heart that never had bramin or gymnosophist less reason to reproach himself with excess in the indulgence of the table or of the toilet than the sage before him but he assented to the doctrine as he would have done to any minor heresy rather than protract matters by farther discussing the point at present in a short time the minister was dressed in his sundays suit without any farther mistake than turning one of his black stockings inside out and mr touchwood happy as was boswell when he carried off dr johnson in triumph to dine with strahan and john wilkes had the pleasure of escorting him to the cleikum inn  in the course of the afternoon they became more familiar and the familiarity led to their forming a considerable estimate of each others powers and acquirements it is true the traveller thought the student too pedantic too much attached to systems which formed in solitude he was unwilling to renounce even when contradicted by the voice and testimony of experience and moreover considered his utter inattention to the quality of what he eat and drank as unworthy of a rational that is of a cooking creature or of a being who as defined by johnson holds his dinner as the most important business of the day cargill did not act up to this definition and was therefore in the eyes of his new acquaintance so far ignorant and uncivilized what then he was still a sensible intelligent man however abstemious and bookish  on the other hand the divine could not help regarding his new friend as something of an epicure or bellygod nor could he observe in him either the perfect education or the polished bearing which mark the gentleman of rank and of which while he mingled with the world he had become a competent judge neither did it escape him that in the catalogue of mr touchwoods defects occurred that of many travellers a slight disposition to exaggerate his own personal adventures and to prose concerning his own exploits but then his acquaintance with eastern manners existing now in the same state in which they were found during the time of the crusades formed a living commentary on the works of william of tyre raymund of saint giles the moslem annals of abulfaragi and other historians of the dark period with which his studies were at present occupied  a friendship a companionship at least was therefore struck up hastily betwixt these two originals and to the astonishment of the whole parish of st ronans the minister thereof was seen once more leagued and united with an individual of his species generally called among them the cleikum nabob their intercourse sometimes consisted in long walks which they took in company traversing however as limited a space of ground as if it had been actually roped in for their pedestrian exercise their parade was according to circumstances a low haugh at the nether end of the ruinous hamlet or the esplanade in the front of the old castle and in either case the direct longitude of their promenade never exceeded a hundred yards sometimes but rarely the divine took share of mr touchwoods meal though less splendidly set forth than when he was first invited to partake of it for like the owner of the gold cup in parnells hermit when cured of his ostentation      still he welcomed but with less of cost  on these occasions the conversation was not of the regular and compacted nature which passes betwixt men as they are ordinarily termed of this world on the contrary the one party was often thinking of saladin and coeur de lion when the other was haranguing on hyder ali and sir eyre coote still however the one spoke and the other seemed to listen and perhaps the lighter intercourse of society where amusement is the sole object can scarcely rest on a safer and more secure basis  it was on one of the evenings when the learned divine had taken his place at mr touchwoods social board or rather at mrs dodssfor a cup of excellent tea the only luxury which mr cargill continued to partake of with some complacence was the regale before themthat a card was delivered to the nabob      mr and miss mowbray see company at shawscastle on the twentieth     current at two oclocka d√©je√ªnerdresses in character     admitteda dramatic picture  see company the more fools they he continued by way of comment see companychoice phrases are ever commendableand this piece of pasteboard is to intimate that one may go and meet all the fools of the parish if they have a mindin my time they asked the honour or the pleasure of a strangers company i

to gie ane maybebut they ken best  i say doctor doctorbless his five wits he is charging the moslemah with stout king richardi say doctor do you know any thing of these mowbrays  nothing extremely particular answered mr cargill after a pause it is an ordinary tale of greatness which blazes in one century and is extinguished in the next i think camden says that thomas mowbray who was grandmarshal of england succeeded to that high office as well as to the dukedom of norfolk as grandson of roger bigot in 1301  pshaw man you are back into the 14th centuryi mean these mowbrays of st ronansnow dont fall asleep again until you have answered my questionand dont look so like a startled harei am speaking no treason  the clergyman floundered a moment as is usual with an absent man who is recovering the train of his ideas or a somnambulist when he is suddenly awakened and then answered still with hesitation  mowbray of st ronanshaehi knowthat isi did know the family  here they are going to give a masquerade a bal par√© private theatricals i think and what not handing him the card  i saw something of this a fortnight ago said mr cargill indeed i either had a ticket myself or i saw such a one as that  are you sure you did not attend the party doctor said the nabob  who attend i you are jesting mr touchwood  but are you quite positive demanded mr touchwood who had observed to his infinite amusement that the learned and abstracted scholar was so conscious of his own peculiarities as never to be very sure on any such subject  positive he repeated with embarrassment my memory is so wretched that i never like to be positivebut had i done any thing so far out of my usual way i must have remembered it one would thinkandi am positive i was not there  neither could you doctor said the nabob laughing at the process by which his friend reasoned himself into confidence for it did not take placeit was adjourned and this is the second invitationthere will be one for you as you had a card to the formercome doctor you must goyou and i will go togetheri as an imaumi can say my bismillah with any hadgi of them allyou as a cardinal or what you like best  who iit is unbecoming my station mr touchwood said the clergymana folly altogether inconsistent with my habits  all the betteryou shall change your habits  you had better gang up and see them mr cargill said mrs dods for its maybe the last sight ye may see of miss mowbraythey say she is to be married and off to england ane of thae oddcomeshortlies wi some of the gowks about the waal downby  married said the clergyman it is impossible  but wheres the impossibility mr cargill when ye see folk marry every day and buckle them yoursell into the bargainmaybe ye think the puir lassie has a bee in her bannet but ye ken yoursell if naebody but wise folk were to marry the warld wad be ill peopled i think its the wise folk that keep single like yoursell and me mr cargillgude guide usare ye weelwill ye taste a drap o something  sniff at my ottar of roses said mr touchwood the scent would revive the deadwhy what in the devils name is the meaning of thisyou were quite well just now  a sudden qualm said mr cargill recovering himself  oh mr cargill said dame dods this comes of your lang fasts  right dame subjoined mr touchwood and of breaking them with sour milk and pease bannockthe least morsel of christian food is rejected by stomach just as a small gentleman refuses the visit of a creditable neighbour lest he see the nakedness of the landha ha  and there is really a talk of miss mowbray of st ronans being married said the clergyman  troth is there said the dame its trotting nellys news and though she likes a drappie i dinna think she would invent a lee or carry aneat least to me that am a gude customer  this must be looked to said mr cargill as if speaking to himself  in troth and so it should said dame dods its a sin and a shame if they should employ the tinkling cymbal they ca chatterly and sic a presbyterian trumpet as yoursell in the land mr cargill and if ye will take a fules advice ye winna let the multure be taen by your ain mill mr cargill  true true good mother dods said the nabob gloves and hatbands are things to be looked after and mr cargill had better go down to this cursed festivity with me in order to see after his own interest  i must speak with the young lady said the clergyman still in a brown study  right right my boy of blackletter said the nabob with me you shall go and well bring them to submission to motherchurch i warrant youwhy the idea of being cheated in such a way would scare a santon out of his trancewhat dress will you wear  my own to be sure said the divine starting from his reverie  true thou art right againthey may want to knit the knot on the spot and who would be married by a parson in masqueradewe go to the entertainment thoughit is a done thing  the clergyman assented provided he should receive an invitation and as that was found at the manse he had no excuse for retracting even if he had seemed to desire one     chapter xviii  fortunes frolics      count basset we gentlemen whose carriages run on the four aces     are apt to have a wheel out of order  the provoked husband   our history must now look a little backwards and although it is rather foreign to our natural style of composition it must speak more in narrative and less in dialogue rather telling what happened than its effects upon the actors our purpose however is only conditional for we foresee temptations which may render it difficult for us exactly to keep it  the arrival of the young earl of etherington at the salutiferous fountain of st ronans had produced the strongest sensation especially as it was joined with the singular accident of the attempt upon his lordships person as he took a short cut through the woods on foot at a distance from his equipage and servants the gallantry with which he beat off the highwayman was only equal to his generosity for he declined making any researches after the poor devil although his lordship had received a severe wound in the scuffle  of the three black graces as they have been termed by one of the most pleasant companions of our time law and physic hastened to do homage to lord etherington represented by mr meiklewham and dr quackleben while divinity as favourable though more coy in the person of the reverend mr simon chatterly stood on tiptoe to offer any service in her power  for the honourable reason already assigned his lordship after thanking mr meiklewham and hinting that he might have different occasion for his services declined his offer to search out the delinquent by whom he had been wounded while to the care of the doctor he subjected the cure of a smart fleshwound in the arm together with a slight scratch on the temple and so very genteel was his behaviour on the occasion that the doctor in his anxiety for his safety enjoined him a months course of the waters if he would enjoy the comfort of a complete and perfect recovery nothing so frequent he could assure his lordship as the opening of cicatrized wounds and the waters of st ronans spring being according to dr quackleben a remedy for all the troubles which flesh is heir to could not fail to equal those of barege in facilitating the discharge of all splinters or extraneous matter which a bullet may chance to incorporate with the human frame to its great annoyance for he was wont to say that although he could not declare the waters which he patronised to be an absolute panpharmacon yet he would with word and pen maintain that they possessed the principal virtues of the most celebrated medicinal springs in the known world in short the love of alpheus for arethusa was a mere jest compared to that which the doctor entertained for his favourite fountain  the new and noble guest whose arrival so much illustrated these scenes of convalescence and of gaiety was not at first seen so much at the ordinary and other places of public resort as had been the hope of the worthy company assembled his health and his wound proved an excuse for making his visits to the society few and far between  but when he did appear his manners and person were infinitely captivating and even the carnationcoloured silk handkerchief which suspended his wounded arm together with the paleness and languor which loss of blood had left on his handsome and open countenance gave a grace to the whole person which many of the ladies declared irresistible all contended for his notice attracted at once by his affability and piqued by the calm and easy nonchalance with which it seemed to be blended the scheming and selfish mowbray the coarseminded and brutal sir bingo accustomed to consider themselves and to be considered as the first men of the party sunk into comparative insignificance but chiefly lady penelope threw out the captivations of her wit and her literature while lady binks trusting to her natural charms endeavoured equally to attract his notice the other nymphs of the spa held a little back upon the principle of that politeness which at continental hunting parties affords the first shot at a fine piece of game to the person of the highest rank present but the thought throbbed in many a fair bosom that their ladyships might miss their aim in spite of the advantages thus allowed them and that there might then be room for less exalted but perhaps not less skilful markswomen to try their chance  but while the earl thus withdrew from public society it was necessary at least natural that he should choose some one with whom to share the solitude of his own apartment and mowbray superior in rank to the halfpay whiskydrinking captain macturk in dash to winterblossom who was broken down and turned twaddler and in tact and sense to sir bingo binks easily manoeuvred himself into his lordships more intimate society and internally thanking the honest footpad whose bullet had been the indirect means of secluding his intended victim from all society but his own he gradually began to feel the way and prove the strength of his antagonist at the various games of skill and hazard which he introduced apparently with the sole purpose of relieving the tedium of a sickchamber  meiklewham who felt or affected the greatest possible interest in his patrons success and who watched every opportunity to enquire how his schemes advanced received at first such favourable accounts as made him grin from ear to ear rub his hands and chuckle forth such bursts of glee as only the success of triumphant roguery could have extorted from him mowbray looked grave however and checked his mirth  there was something in it after all he said that he could not perfectly understand etherington an used handdd sharpup to every thing and yet he lost his money like a baby  and what the matter how he loses it so you win it like a man said his legal friend and adviser  why hang it i cannot tell replied mowbraywere it not that i think he has scarce the impudence to propose such a thing to succeed curse me but i should think he was coming the old soldier over me and keeping up his gamebut nohe can scarce have the impudence to think of thati find however that he has done wolverinecleaned out poor tomthough tom wrote to me the precise contrary yet the truth has since come outwell i shall avenge him for i see his lordship is to be had as well as other folk  weel mr mowbray said the lawyer in a tone of affected sympathy ye ken your own ways bestbut the heavens will bless a moderate mind i would not like to see you ruin this poor lad funditus that is to say out and out to lose some of the ready will do him no great harm and maybe give him a lesson he may be the better of as long as he livesbut i wad not as an honest man wish you to go deeperyou should spare the lad mr mowbray  who spared me meiklewham said mowbray with a look and tone of deep emphasisno nohe must go through the millmoney and moneys worthhis seat is called oakendalethink of that mickoakendale oh name of thrice happy auguryspeak not of mercy mickthe squirrels of oakendale must be dismounted and learn to go afootwhat mercy can the wandering lord of troy expect among the greeksthe greeksi am a very suliotethe bravest of greeks      i think not of pity i think not of fear     he neither must know who would serve the vizier  and necessity mick he concluded with a tone something altered necessity is as unrelenting a leader as any vizier or pacha whom scanderbeg ever fought with or byron has sung  meiklewham echoed his patrons ejaculation with a sound betwixt a whine a chuckle and a groan the first being designed to express his pretended pity for the destined victim the second his sympathy with his patrons prospects of success and the third being a whistle admonitory of the dangerous courses through which his object was to be pursued  suliote as he boasted himself mowbray had soon after this conversation some reason to admit that      when greek meets greek then comes the tug of war  the light skirmishing betwixt the parties was ended and the serious battle commenced with some caution on either side each perhaps desirous of being master of his opponents system of tactics before exposing his own piquet the most beautiful game at which a man can make sacrifice of his fortune was one with which mowbray had for his misfortune perhaps been accounted from an early age a great proficient and in which the earl of etherington with less experience proved no novice they now played for such stakes as mowbrays state of fortune rendered considerable to him though his antagonist appeared not to regard the amount and they played with various success for though mowbray at times returned with a smile of confidence the enquiring looks of his friend meiklewham there were other occasions on which he seemed to evade them as if his own had a sad confession to make in reply  these alternations though frequent did not occupy after all many days for mowbray a friend of all hours spent much of his time in lord etheringtons apartment and these few days were days of battle in the meantime as his lordship was now sufficiently recovered to join the party at shawscastle and miss mowbrays health being announced as restored that proposal was renewed with the addition of a dramatic entertainment the nature of which we shall afterwards have occasion to explain cards were anew issued to all those who had been formerly included in the invitation and of course to mr touchwood as formerly a resident at the well and now in the neighbourhood it being previously agreed among the ladies that a nabob though sometimes a dingy or damaged commodity was not to be rashly or unnecessarily neglected as to the parson he had been asked of course as an old acquaintance of the mowbray house not to be left out when the friends of the family were invited on a great scale but his habits were well known and it was no more expected that he would leave his manse on such an occasion than that the kirk should loosen itself from its foundations  it was after these arrangements had been made that the laird of st ronans suddenly entered meiklewhams private apartment with looks of exultation the worthy scribe turned his spectacled nose towards his patron and holding in one hand the bunch of papers which he had been just perusing and in the other the tape with which he was about to tie them up again suspended that operation to await with open eyes and ears the communication of mowbray  i have done him he said exultingly yet in a tone of voice lowered almost to a whisper capotted his lordship for this boutdoubled my capital mick and something morehush dont interrupt mewe must think of clara nowshe must share the sunshine should it prove but a blink before a stormyou know mick these two dd women lady penelope and the binks have settled that they will have something like a bal par√© on this occasion a sort of theatrical exhibition and that those who like it shall be dressed in characteri know their meaningthey think clara has no dress fit for such foolery and so they hope to eclipse her lady pen with her oldfashioned illset diamonds and my lady binks with the newfashioned finery which she swopt her character for but clara shant borne down so by  i got that affected slut lady binkss maid to tell me what her mistress had set her mind on and she is to wear a grecian habit forsooth like one of will allans eastern subjectsbut heres the rubthere is only one shawl for sale in edinburgh that is worth showing off in and that is at the gallery of fashionnow mick my friend that shawl must be had for clara with the other trankums of muslin and lace and so forth which you will find marked in the paper theresend instantly and secure it for as lady binks writes by tomorrows post your order can go by tonights mailthere is a note for l100  from a mechanical habit of never refusing any thing meiklewham readily took the note but having looked at it through his spectacles he continued to hold it in his hand as he remonstrated with his patronthis is a very kindly meant st ronansvery kindly meant and i wad be the last to say that miss clara does not merit respect and kindness at your hand but i doubt mickle if she wad care a bodle for thae braw things ye ken yoursell she seldom alters her fashions od she thinks her ridinghabit dress eneugh for ony company and if you were ganging by good looks so it isif she had a thought mair colour poor dear  well well said mowbray impatiently let me alone to reconcile a woman and a fine dress  to be sure ye ken best said the writer but after a now wad it no be better to lay by this hundred pound in tam turnpennys in case the young lady should want it afterhend just for a sair foot  you are a fool mick what signifies healing a sore foot when there will be a broken heart in the caseno noget the things as i desire youwe will blaze them down for one day at least perhaps it will be the beginning of a proper dash  weel weel i wish it may be so answered meiklewham but this young earlhae ye found the weak pointcan ye get a decerniture against him with expensesthat is the question  i wish i could answer it said mowbray thoughtfullyconfound the fellowhe is a cut above me in rank and in society toobelongs to the great clubs and is in with the superlatives and inaccessibles and all that sort of folkmy training has been a peg lowerbut hang it there are better dogs bred in the kennel than in the parlour i am up to him i thinkat least i will soon know mick whether i am or no and that is always one comfort never minddo you execute my commission and take care you name no namesi must save my little abigails reputation  they parted meiklewham to execute his patrons commissionhis patron to bring to the test those hopes the uncertainty of which he could not disguise from his own sagacity  trusting to the continuance of his run of luck mowbray resolved to bring affairs to a crisis that same evening every thing seemed in the outset to favour his purpose they had dined together in lord etheringtons apartmentshis state of health interfered with the circulation of the bottle and a drizzly autumnal evening rendered walking disagreeable even had they gone no farther than the private stable where lord etheringtons horses were kept under the care of a groom of superior skill cards were naturally almost necessarily resorted to as the only alternative for helping away the evening and piquet was as formerly chosen for the game  lord etherington seemed at first indolently careless and indifferent about his play suffering advantages to escape him of which in a more attentive state of mind he could not have failed to avail himself mowbray upbraided him with his inattention and proposed a deeper stake in order to interest him in the game the young nobleman complied and in the course of a few hands the gamesters became both deeply engaged in watching and profiting by the changes of fortune these were so many so varied and so unexpected that the very souls of the players seemed at length centred in the event of the struggle and by dint of doubling stakes the accumulated sum of a thousand pounds and upwards upon each side came to be staked in the issue of the gameso large a risk included all those funds which mowbray commanded by his sisters kindness and nearly all his previous winnings so to him the alternative was victory or ruin he could not hide his agitation however desirous to do so he drank wine to supply himself with couragehe drank water to cool his agitation and at length bent himself to play with as much care and attention as he felt himself enabled to command  in the first part of the game their luck appeared tolerably equal and the play of both befitting gamesters who had dared to place such a sum on the cast but as it drew towards a conclusion fortune altogether deserted him who stood most in need of her favour and mowbray with silent despair saw his fate depend on a single trick and that with every odds against him for lord etherington was elder hand but how can fortunes favour secure any one who is not true to himselfby an infraction of the laws of the game which could only have been expected from the veriest bungler that ever touched a card lord etherington called a point without showing it and by the ordinary rule mowbray was entitled to count his ownand in the course of that and the next hand gained the game and swept the stakes lord etherington showed chagrin and displeasure and seemed to think that the rigour of the game had been more insisted upon than in courtesy it ought to have been when men were playing for so small a stake mowbray did not understand this logic a thousand pounds he said were in his eyes no nutshells the rules of piquet were insisted on by all but boys and women and for his part he had rather not play at all than not play the game  so it would seem my dear mowbray said the earl for on my soul i never saw so disconsolate a visage as thine during that unlucky gameit withdrew all my attention from my hand and i may safely say your rueful countenance has stood me in a thousand pounds if i could transfer thy long visage to canvass i should have both my revenge and my money for a correct resemblance would be worth not a penny less than the original has cost me  you are welcome to your jest my lord said mowbray it has been well paid for and i will serve you in ten thousand at the same rate what say you he proceeded taking up and shuffling the cards will you do yourself more justice in another gamerevenge they say is sweet  i have no appetite for it this evening said the earl gravely if i had mowbray you might come by the worse i do not always call a point without showing it  your lordship is out of humour with yourself for a blunder that might happen to any manit was as much my good luck as a good hand would have been and so fortune be praised  but what if with this fortune had nought to do replied lord etheringtonwhat if sitting down with an honest fellow and a friend like yourself mowbray a man should rather choose to lose his own money which he could afford than to win what it might distress his friend to part with  supposing a case so far out of supposition my lord answered mowbray who felt the question ticklishfor with submission the allegation is easily made and is totally incapable of proofi should say no one had a right to think for me in such a particular or to suppose that i played for a higher stake than was convenient  and thus your friend poor devil replied lord etherington would lose his money and run the risk of a quarrel into the bootwe will try it another waysuppose this goodhumoured and simpleminded gamester had a favour of the deepest import to ask of his friend and judged it better to prefer his request to a winner than to a loser  if this applies to me my lord replied mowbray it is necessary i should learn how i can oblige your lordship  that is a word soon spoken but so difficult to be recalled that i am almost tempted to pausebut yet it must be saidmowbray you have a sister  mowbray startedi have indeed a sister my lord but i can conceive no case in which her name can enter with propriety into our present discussion  again in the menacing mood said lord etherington in his former tone now here is a pretty fellowhe would first cut my throat for having won a thousand pounds from me and then for offering to make his sister a countess  a countess my lord said mowbray you are but jestingyou have never even seen clara mowbray  perhaps notbut what theni may have seen her picture as puff says in the critic or fallen in love with her from rumouror to save farther suppositions as i see they render you impatient i may be satisfied with knowing that she is a beautiful and accomplished young lady with a large fortune  what fortune do you mean my lord said mowbray recollecting with alarm some claims which according to meiklewhams view of the subject his sister might form upon his propertywhat estatethere is nothing belongs to our family save these lands of st ronans or what is left of them and of these i am my lord an undoubted heir of entail in possession  be it so said the earl for i have no claim on your mountain realms here which are doubtless      renownd of old     for knights and squires and barons bold  my views respect a much richer though less romantic domaina large manor hight nettlewood house old but standing in the midst of such glorious oaksthree thousand acres of land arable pasture and woodland exclusive of the two closes occupied by widow hodge and goodman trampclodmanorial rightsmines and mineralsand the devil knows how many good things besides all lying in the vale of bever  and what has my sister to do with all this asked mowbray in great surprise  nothing but that it belongs to her when she becomes countess of etherington  it is then your lordships property already  no by jove nor can it unless your sister honours me with her approbation of my suit replied the earl  this is a sorer puzzle than one of lady penelopes charades my lord said mr mowbray i must call in the assistance of the reverend mr chatterly  you shall not need said lord etherington i will give you the key but listen to me with patienceyou know that we nobles of england less jealous of our sixteen quarters than those on the continent do not take scorn to line our decayed ermines with the little cloth of gold from the city and my grandfather was lucky enough to get a wealthy wife with a halting pedigreerather a singular circumstance considering that her father was a countryman of yours she had a brother however still more wealthy than herself and who increased his fortune by continuing to carry on the trade which had first enriched his family at length he summed up his books washed his hands of commerce and retired to nettlewood to become a gentleman and here my much respected granduncle was seized with the rage of making himself a man of consequence he tried what marrying a woman of family would do but he soon found that whatever advantage his family might derive from his doing so his own condition was but little illustrated he next resolved to become a man of family himself his father had left scotland when very young and bore i blush to say the vulgar name of scrogie this hapless dissyllable my uncle carried in person to the herald office in scotland but neither lyon nor marchmont nor islay nor snadoun neither herald nor pursuivant would patronise scrogiescrogiethere could nothing be made out of itso that my worthy relative had recourse to the surer side of the house and began to found his dignity on his mothers name of mowbray in this he was much more successful and i believe some sly fellow stole for him a slip from your own family tree mr mowbray of st ronans which i daresay you have never missed at any rate for his argent and or he got a handsome piece of parchment blazoned with a white lion for mowbray to be borne quarterly with three stunted or scrogbushes for scrogie and became thenceforth mr scrogie mowbray or rather as he subscribed himself reginald his former christian name was ronald s mowbray he had a son who most undutifully laughed at all this refused the honours of the high name of mowbray and insisted on retaining his fathers original appellative of scrogie to the great annoyance of his said fathers ears and damage of his temper  why faith betwixt the two said mowbray i own i should have preferred my own name and i think the old gentlemans taste rather better than the young ones  true but both were wilful absurd originals with a happy obstinacy of temper whether derived from mowbray or scrogie i know not but which led them so often into opposition that the offended father reginald s mowbray turned his recusant son scrogie fairly out of doors and the fellow would have paid for his plebeian spirit with a vengeance had he not found refuge with a surviving partner of the original scrogie of all who still carried on the lucrative branch of traffic by which the family had been first enriched i mention these particulars to account in so far as i can for the singular predicament in which i now find myself placed  proceed my lord said mr mowbray there is no denying the singularity of your story and i presume you are quite serious in giving me such an extraordinary detail  entirely so upon my honourand a most serious matter it is you will presently find when my worthy uncle mr s mowbray for i will not call him scrogie even in the grave paid his debt to nature every body concluded he would be found to have disinherited his son the unfilial scrogie and so far every body was rightbut it was also generally believed that he would settle the estate on my father lord etherington the son of his sister and therein every one was wrong for my excellent granduncle had pondered with himself that the favoured name of mowbray would take no advantage and attain no additional elevation if his estate of nettlewood otherwise called mowbraypark should descend to our family without any condition and with the assistance of a sharp attorney he settled it on me then a schoolboy on condition that i should before attaining the age of twentyfive complete take unto myself in holy wedlock a young lady of good fame of the name of mowbray and by preference of the house of st ronans should a damsel of that house existnow my riddle is read  and a very extraordinary one it is replied mowbray thoughtfully  confess the truth said lord etherington laying his hand on his shoulder you think the story will bear a grain of a scruple of doubt if not a whole scruple itself  at least my lord answered mowbray your lordship will allow that being miss mowbrays only near relation and sole guardian i may without offence pause upon a suit for her hand made under such odd circumstances  if you have the least doubt either respecting my rank or fortune i can give of course the most satisfactory references said the earl of etherington  that i can easily believe my lord said mowbray nor do i in the least fear deception where detection would be so easy your lordships proceedings towards me too with a conscious glance at the bills he still held in his hand have i admit been such as to intimate some such deep cause of interest as you have been pleased to state but it seems strange that your lordship should have permitted years to glide away without so much as enquiring after the young lady who i believe is the only person qualified as your granduncles will requires with whom you can form an alliance it appears to me that long before now this matter ought to have been investigated and that even now it would have been more natural and more decorous to have at least seen my sister before proposing for her hand  on the first point my dear mowbray said lord etherington i am free to own to you that without meaning your sister the least affront i would have got rid of this clause if i could for every man would fain choose a wife for himself and i feel no hurry to marry at all but the roguelawyers after taking fees and keeping me in hand for years have at length roundly told me the clause must be complied with or nettlewood must have another master so i thought it best to come down here in person in order to address the fair lady but as accident has hitherto prevented my seeing her and as i found in her brother a man who understands the world i hope you will not think the worse of me that i have endeavoured in the outset to make you my friend truth is i shall be twentyfive in the course of a month and without your favour and the opportunities which only you can afford me that seems a short time to woo and win a lady of miss mowbrays merit  and what is the alternative if you do not form this proposed alliance my lord said mowbray  the bequest of my granduncle lapses said the earl and fair nettlewood with its old house and older oaks manorial rights hodge trampclod and all devolves on a certain cousingerman of mine whom heaven of his mercy confound  you have left yourself little time to prevent such an event my lord said mowbray but things being as i now see them you shall have what interest i can give you in the affairwe must stand however on more equal terms my lordi will condescend so far as to allow it would have been inconvenient for me at this moment to have lost that game but i cannot in the circumstances think of acting as if i had fairly won it we must draw stakes my lord  not a word of that if you really mean me kindly my dear mowbray the blunder was a real one for i was indeed thinking as you may suppose on other things than the showing my pointall was fairly lost and woni hope i shall have opportunities of offering real services which may perhaps give me some right to your partial regardat present we are on equal footing on all sidesperfectly so  if your lordship thinks so said mowbrayand then passing rapidly to what he felt he could say with more confidenceindeed at any rate no personal obligation to myself could prevent my doing my full duty as guardian to my sister  unquestionably i desire nothing else replied the earl of etherington  i must therefore understand that your lordship is quite serious in your proposal and that it is not to be withdrawn even if upon acquaintance with miss mowbray you should not perhaps think her so deserving of your lordships attentions as report may have spoken her  mr mowbray replied the earl the treaty between you and me shall be as definite as if i were a sovereign prince demanding in marriage the sister of a neighbouring monarch whom according to royal etiquette he neither has seen nor could see i have been quite frank with you and i have stated to you that my present motives for entering upon negotiation are not personal but territorial when i know miss mowbray i have no doubt they will be otherwise i have heard she is beautiful  something of the palest my lord answered mowbray  a fine complexion is the first attraction which is lost in the world of fashion and that which it is easiest to replace  dispositions my lord may differ said mowbray without faults on either side i presume your lordship has enquired into my sisters she is amiable accomplished sensible and highspirited but yet  i understand you mr mowbray and will spare you the pain of speaking out i have heard miss mowbray is in some respectsparticular to use a broader worda little whimsicalno matter she will have the less to learn when she becomes a countess and a woman of fashion  are you serious my lord said mowbray  i amand i will speak my mind still more plainly i have good temper and excellent spirits and can endure a good deal of singularity in those i live with i have no doubt your sister and i will live happily togetherbut in case it should prove otherwise arrangements may be made previously which will enable us in certain circumstances to live happily apart my own estate is large and nettlewood will bear dividing  nay then said mowbray i have little more to saynothing indeed remains for enquiry so far as your lordship is concerned but my sister must have free liberty of choiceso far as i am concerned your lordships suit has my interest  and i trust we may consider it as a done thing  with claras approbationcertainly answered mowbray  i trust there is no chance of personal repugnance on the young ladys part said the young peer  i anticipate nothing of the kind my lord answered mowbray as i presume there is no reason for any but young ladies will be capricious and if clara after i have done and said all that a brother ought to do should remain repugnant there is a point in the exertion of my influence which it would be cruelty to pass  the earl of etherington walked a turn through the apartment then paused and said in a grave and doubtful tone in the meanwhile i am bound and the young lady is free mowbray is this quite fair  it is what happens in every case my lord where a gentleman proposes for a lady answered mowbray he must remain of course bound by his offer until within a reasonable time it is accepted or rejected it is not my fault that your lordship has declared your wishes to me before ascertaining claras inclination but while as yet the matter is between ourselvesi make you welcome to draw back if you think proper clara mowbray needs not push for a catchmatch  nor do i desire said the young nobleman any time to reconsider the resolution which i have confided to you i am not in the least fearful that i shall change my mind on seeing your sister and i am ready to stand by the proposal which i have made to youif however you feel so extremely delicately on my account he continued i can see and even converse with miss mowbray at this f√™te of yours without the necessity of being at all presented to herthe character which i have assumed in a manner obliges me to wear a mask  certainly said the laird of st ronans and i am glad for both our sakes your lordship thinks of taking a little law upon this occasion  i shall profit nothing by it said the earl my doom is fixed before i startbut if this mode of managing the matter will save your conscience i have no objection to itit cannot consume much time which is what i have to look to  they then shook hands and parted without any farther discourse which could interest the reader  mowbray was glad to find himself alone in order to think over what had happened and to ascertain the state of his own mind which at present was puzzling even to himself he could not but feel that much greater advantages of every kind might accrue to himself and his family from the alliance of the wealthy young earl than could have been derived from any share of his spoils which he had proposed to gain by superior address in play or greater skill on the turf but his pride was hurt when he recollected that he had placed himself entirely in lord etheringtons power and the escape from absolute ruin which he had made solely by the sufferance of his opponent had nothing in it consolatory to his wounded feelings he was lowered in his own eyes when he recollected how completely the proposed victim of his ingenuity had seen through his schemes and only abstained from baffling them entirely because to do so suited best with his own there was a shade of suspicion too which he could not entirely eradicate from his mindwhat occasion had this young nobleman to preface by the voluntary loss of a brace of thousands a proposal which must have been acceptable in itself without any such sacrifice and why should he after all have been so eager to secure his accession to the proposed alliance before he had even seen the lady who was the object of it however hurried for time he might have waited the event at least of the entertainment at shawscastle at which clara was necessarily obliged to make her appearanceyet such conduct however unusual was equally inconsistent with any sinister intentions since the sacrifice of a large sum of money and the declaration of his views upon a portionless young lady of family could scarcely be the preface to any unfair practice so that upon the whole mowbray settled that what was uncommon in the earls conduct arose from the hasty and eager disposition of a rich young englishman to whom money is of little consequence and who is too headlong in pursuit of the favourite plan of the moment to proceed in the most rational or most ordinary manner if however there should prove any thing farther in the matter than he could at present discover mowbray promised himself that the utmost circumspection on his part could not fail to discover it and that in full time to prevent any ill consequences to his sister or himself  immersed in such cogitations he avoided the inquisitive presence of mr meiklewham who as usual had been watching for him to learn how matters were going on and although it was now late he mounted his horse and rode hastily to shawscastle on the way he deliberated with himself whether to mention to his sister the application which had been made to him in order to prepare her to receive the young earl as a suitor favoured with her brothers approbation but no no no such was the result of his contemplation she might take it into her head that his thoughts were bent less upon having her for a countess than on obtaining possession of his granduncles estatewe must keep quiet concluded he until her personal appearance and accomplishments may appear at least to have some influence upon his choicewe must say nothing till this blessed entertainment has been given and received     chapter xix  a letter      has he so long held out with me untired     and stops he now for breathwellbe it so  richard iii   mowbray had no sooner left the earls apartment than the latter commenced an epistle to a friend and associate which we lay before the reader as best calculated to illustrate the views and motives of the writer it was addressed to captain jekyl of the  regiment of guards at the green dragon harrowgate and was of the following tenor      dear harry      i have expected you here these ten days past anxiously as ever man     was looked for and have now to charge your absence as high treason     to your sworn allegiance surely you do not presume like one of     napoleons newmade monarchs to grumble for independence as if     your greatness were of your own making or as if i had picked you     out of the whole of st jamess coffeehouse to hold my backhand     for your sake forsooth not for my own wherefore lay aside all     your own proper business be it the pursuit of dowagers or the     plucking of pigeons and instantly repair to this place where i may     speedily want your assistancemay want it said i why most     negligent of friends and allies i have wanted it already and     that when it might have done me yeomans service know that i have     had an affair since i came hitherhave got hurt myself and have     nearly shot my friend and if i had i might have been hanged for     it for want of harry jekyl to bear witness in my favour i was so     far on my road to this place when not choosing for certain     reasons to pass through the old village i struck by a footpath     into the woods which separate it from the new spa leaving my     carriage and people to go the carriageway i had not walked half a     mile when i heard the footsteps of some one behind and looking     round what should i behold but the face in the world which i most     cordially hate and abhori mean that which stands on the shoulders     of my right trusty and wellbeloved cousin and counsellor saint     francis he seemed as much confounded as i was at our unexpected     meeting and it was a minute ere he found breath to demand what i     did in scotland contrary to my promise as he was pleased to     express iti retaliated and charged him with being here in     contradiction to hishe justified and said he had only come down     upon the express information that i was upon my road to st     ronansnow harry how the devil should he have known this hadst     thou been quite faithful for i am sure to no ear but thine own did     i breathe a whisper of my purposenext with the insolent     assumption of superiority which he founds on what he calls the     rectitude of his purpose he proposed we should both withdraw from a     neighbourhood into which we could bring nothing but wretchednessi     have told you how difficult it is to cope with the calm and resolute     manner that the devil gifts him with on such occasions but i was     determined he should not carry the day this time i saw no chance     for it however but to put myself into a towering passion which     thank heaven i can always do on short noticei charged him with     having imposed formerly on my youth and made himself judge of my     rights and i accompanied my defiance with the strongest terms of     irony and contempt as well as with demand of instant satisfaction     i had my travelling pistols with me et pour cause and to my     surprise my gentleman was equally providedfor fair plays sake     i made him take one of my pistolsright kuchenrittersa brace of     balls in each but that circumstance i forgoti would fain have     argued the matter a little longer but i thought at the time and     think still that the best arguments which he and i can exchange     must come from the point of the sword or the muzzle of the     pistolwe fired nearly together and i think both droppedi am     sure i did but recovered in a minute with a damaged arm and a     scratch on the templeit was the last which stunned meso much for     doubleloaded pistolsmy friend was invisible and i had nothing     for it but to walk to the spa bleeding all the way like a calf and     tell a rawheadandbloodybone story about a footpad which but     for my earldom and my gory locks no living soul would have     believed      shortly after when i had been installed in a sick room i had the     mortification to learn that my own impatience had brought all this     mischief upon me at a moment when i had every chance of getting rid     of my friend without trouble had i but let him go on his own     errand for it seems he had an appointment that morning with a booby     baronet who is said to be a bulletslitter and would perhaps have     rid me of saint francis without any trouble or risk on my part     meantime his nonappearance at this rendezvous has placed master     francis tyrrel as he chooses to call himself in the worst odour     possible with the gentry at the spring who have denounced him as a     coward and no gentlemanwhat to think of the business myself i     know not and i much want your assistance to see what can have     become of this fellow who like a spectre of ill omen has so often     thwarted and baffled my best plans my own confinement renders me     inactive though my wound is fast healing dead he cannot be for     had he been mortally wounded we should have heard of him somewhere     or otherhe could not have vanished from the earth like a bubble of     the elements well and sound he cannot be for besides that i am     sure i saw him stagger and drop firing his pistol as he fell i     know him well enough to swear that had he not been severely     wounded he would have first pestered me with his accursed presence     and assistance and then walked forward with his usual composure to     settle matters with sir bingo binks nonosaint francis is none     of those who leave such jobs half finishedit is but doing him     justice to say he has the devils courage to back his own     deliberate impertinence but then if wounded severely he must be     still in this neighbourhood and probably in concealmentthis is     what i must discover and i want your assistance in my enquiries     among the nativeshaste hither harry as ever you look for good     at my hand      a good player harry always studies to make the best of bad     cardsand so i have endeavoured to turn my wound to some account     and it has given me the opportunity to secure monsieur le frere in     my interests you say very truly that it is of consequence to

you     may easily judge every point of national character is opposed to     the pretensions of this luckless race when they attempt to take on     them a personage which is assumed with so much facility by their     brethren of the isle of saints they are a shrewd people indeed     but so destitute of ease grace pliability of manners and     insinuation of address that they eternally seem to suffer actual     misery in their attempts to look gay and careless then their pride     heads them back at one turn their poverty at another their     pedantry at a third their mauvaise honte at a fourth and with     so many obstacles to make them bolt off the course it is positively     impossible they should win the plate no harry it is the grave     folk in old england who have to fear a

would let pass under their noses     unavailingly but assuredly heaven did not form the caledonian for     the gay world and his efforts at ease grace and gaiety resemble     only the clumsy gambols

scarce necessary to tell you harry that this half     fellowship will not pass on the better side of the tweed      yet for all i have told you this trout was not easily tickled     nor should i have made much of him had he not in the plenitude of     his northern conceit entertained that notion of my being a good     subject of plunder which you had contrived blessings on your     contriving brain to insinuate into him by means of wolverine he     commenced this hopeful experiment and as you must have     anticipated caught a tartar with a vengeance of course i used my     victory only so far as to secure his interest in accomplishing my     principal object and yet i could see my gentlemans pride was so     much injured in the course of the negotiation that not all the     advantages which the match offered to his damned family were able     entirely to subdue the chagrin arising from his defeat he did gulp     it down though and we are friends and allies for the present at     leastnot so cordially so however as to induce me to trust him     with the whole of the strangely complicated tale the circumstance     of the will it was necessary to communicate as affording a     sufficiently strong reason for urging my suit and this partial     disclosure enabled me for the present to dispense with farther     confidence      you will observe that i stand by no means secure

nine hundred and ninetynine all was agreed to and the deeds were ordered to be drawn but the tenant as he walked down the avenue began to reflect that the lease though so very long as to be almost perpetual nevertheless had a termination and that after the lapse of a thousand years lacking one the connexion of his family and representatives with the estate would cease he took a qualm at the thought of the loss to be sustained by his posterity a thousand years hence and going back to the house of the gentleman who feued the ground he demanded and readily obtained the additional term of

arrived the arrangement for which had for some time occupied all the conversation and thoughts of the good company at the well of st ronans to give it at the same time a degree of novelty and consequence lady penelope penfeather had long since suggested to mr mowbray that the more gifted and accomplished part of the guests might contribute to furnish out entertainment for the rest by acting a few scenes of some popular drama an accomplishment in which her selfconceit assured her that she was peculiarly qualified to excel mr mowbray who seemed on this occasion to have thrown the reins entirely into her ladyships hands made no objection to the plan which she proposed excepting that the oldfashioned hedges and walks of the garden at shawscastle must necessarily serve for stage and scenery as there was no time to fit up the old hall for the exhibition of the proposed theatricalsii1 but upon enquiry among the company this plan was wrecked upon the ordinary shelve to wit the difficulty of finding performers who would consent to assume the lower characters of the drama for the first parts there were candidates more than enough but most of these were greatly too highspirited to play the fool except they were permitted to top the part then amongst the few unambitious underlings who could be coaxed or cajoled to undertake subordinate characters there were so many bad memories and short memories and treacherous memories that at length the plan was resigned in despair  a substitute proposed by lady penelope was next considered it was proposed to act what the italians call a comedy of character that is not an exact drama in which the actors deliver what is set down for them by the author but one in which the plot having been previously fixed upon and a few striking scenes adjusted the actors are expected to supply the dialogue extempore or as petruchio says from their mother wit this is an amusement which affords much entertainment in italy particularly in the state of venice where the characters of their drama have been long since all previously fixed and are handed down by tradition and this species of drama though rather belonging to the mask than the theatre is distinguished by the name of commedia dell arteii2 but the shamefaced character of britons is still more alien from a species of display where there is a constant and extemporaneous demand for wit or the sort of ready smalltalk which supplies its place than from the regular exhibitions of the drama where the author standing responsible for language and sentiment leaves to the personators of the scenes only the trouble of finding enunciation and action  but the ardent and active spirit of lady penelope still athirst after novelty though baffled in her two first projects brought forward a third in which she was more successful this was the proposal to combine a certain number at least of the guests properly dressed for the occasion as representing some wellknown historical or dramatic characters in a group having reference to history or to a scene of the drama in this representation which may be called playing a picture action even pantomimical action was not expected and all that was required of the performers was to throw themselves into such a group as might express a marked and striking point of an easily remembered scene but where the actors are at a pause and without either speech or motion in this species of representation there was no tax either on the invention or memory of those who might undertake parts and what recommended it still farther to the good company there was no marked difference betwixt the hero and heroine of the group and the less distinguished characters by whom they were attended on the stage and every one who had confidence in a handsome shape and a becoming dress might hope though standing in not quite so broad and favourable a light as the principal personages to draw nevertheless a considerable portion of attention and applause this motion therefore that the company or such of them as might choose to appear properly dressed for the occasion should form themselves into one or more groups which might be renewed and varied as often as they pleased was hailed and accepted as a bright idea which assigned to every one a share of the importance attached to its probable success  mowbray on his side promised to contrive some arrangement which should separate the actors in this mute drama from the spectators and enable the former to vary the amusement by withdrawing themselves from the scene and again appearing upon it under a different and new combination this plan of exhibition where fine clothes and affected attitudes supplied all draughts upon fancy or talent was highly agreeable to most of the ladies present and even lady binks whose discontent seemed proof against every effort that could be proposed to soothe it acquiesced in the project with perfect indifference indeed but with something less of sullenness than usual  it now only remained to rummage the circulating library for some piece of sufficient celebrity to command attention and which should be at the same time suited to the execution of their project bells british theatre millers modern and ancient drama and about twenty odd volumes in which stray tragedies and comedies were associated like the passengers in a mailcoach without the least attempt at selection or arrangement were all examined in the course of their researches but lady penelope declared loftily and decidedly for shakspeare as the author whose immortal works were fresh in every ones recollection shakspeare was therefore chosen and from his works the midsummer nights dream was selected as the play which afforded the greatest variety of characters and most scope of course for the intended representation an active competition presently occurred among the greater part of the company for such copies of the midsummer nights dream or the volume of shakspeare containing it as could be got in the neighbourhood for notwithstanding lady penelopes declaration that every one who could read had shakspeares plays by heart it appeared that such of his dramas as have not kept possession of the stage were very little known at st ronans save among those people who are emphatically called readers  the adjustment of the parts was the first subject of consideration so soon as those who intended to assume characters had refreshed their recollection on the subject of the piece theseus was unanimously assigned to mowbray the giver of the entertainment and therefore justly entitled to represent the duke of athens the costume of an amazonian crest and plume a tuckedup vest and a tight buskin of skyblue silk buckled with diamonds reconciled lady binks to the part of hippolyta the superior stature of miss mowbray to lady penelope made it necessary that the former should perform the part of helena and her ladyship rest contented with the shrewish character of hermia it was resolved to compliment the young earl of etherington with the part of lysander which however his lordship declined and preferring comedy to tragedy refused to appear in any other character than that of the magnanimous bottom and he gave them such a humorous specimen of his quality in that part that all were delighted at once with his condescension in assuming and his skill in performing the presenter of pyramus  the part of egeus was voted to captain macturk whose obstinacy in refusing to appear in any other than the full highland garb had nearly disconcerted the whole affair at length this obstacle was got over on the authority of childe harold who remarks the similarity betwixt the highland and grecian costumeii3 and the company dispensing with the difference of colour voted the captains variegated kilt of the macturk tartan to be the kirtle of a grecian mountaineeregeus to be an arnout and the captain to be egeus chatterly and the painter walking gentlemen by profession agreed to walk through the parts of demetrius and lysander the two athenian lovers and mr winterblossom loath and lazy after many excuses was bribed by lady penelope with an antique or supposed antique cameo to play the part of philostratus master of the revels provided his gout would permit him to remain so long upon the turf which was to be their stage  muslin trowsers adorned with spangles a voluminous turban of silver gauze and wings of the same together with an embroidered slipper converted at once miss digges into oberon the king of shadows whose sovereign gravity however was somewhat indifferently represented by the silly gaiety of miss in her teens and the uncontrolled delight which she felt in her fine clothes a younger sister represented titania and two or three subordinate elves were selected among families attending the salutiferous fountain who were easily persuaded to let their children figure in fine clothes at so juvenile an age though they shook their head at miss digges and her pantaloons and no less at the liberal display of lady binkss right leg with which the amazonian garb gratified the public of st ronans  dr quackleben was applied to to play wall by the assistance of such a wooden horse or screen as clothes are usually dried upon the old attorney stood for lion and the other characters of bottoms drama were easily found among the unnamed frequenters of the spring dressed rehearsals and so forth went merrily onall voted there was a play fitted  but even the doctors eloquence could not press mrs blower into the scheme although she was particularly wanted to represent thisbe  truth is she replied i dinna greatly like stageplays john blower honest man as sailors are aye for some spree or another wad take me ance to see ane mrs siddonsi thought we should hae been crushed to death before we gat ina my things riven aff my back forby the four lilywhite shillings that it cost usand then

penfitter and the great folk may just take it as they like but in my mind dr cacklehen its a mere blasphemy for folk to gar themselves look otherwise than their maker made them and then the changing the name which was given them at baptism is i think an awful falling away from our vows and though thisby which i take to be greek for tibbie may be a very good name yet margaret was i christened and margaret will i die  you mistake the matter entirely my dear mrs blower said the doctor there is nothing serious intendeda mere placebojust a divertisement to cheer the spirits and assist the effect of the waterscheerfulness is a great promoter of health  dinna tell me o health dr kittlepincan it be for the puir body mdurks health to major about in the tartans like a tobacconists sign in a frosty morning wi his poor wizzened houghs as blue as a blawortweel i wot he is a humbling spectacle or can it gie ony body health or pleasure either to see your ainsell doctor ganging about wi a claise

to sit a haill afternoon by mysell ill een gae doun to mr sowerbrowst the maltstershe is a pleasant sensible man and a sponsible man in the world and his sisters a very decent woman  confound sowerbrowst thought the doctor if i had guessed he was to come across me thus he should not have got the better of his dyspepsy so earlymy dear mrs blower he continued but aloud it is a foolish affair enough i must confess but every person of style and fashion at the well has settled to attend this exhibition there has been nothing else talked of for this month through the whole country and it will be a year before it is forgotten and i would have you consider how ill it will look my dear mrs blower to stay awaynobody will believe you had a cardno not though you were to hang it round your neck like a label round a vial of tincture mrs blower  if ye thought that doctor kickherben said the widow alarmed at the idea of losing caste i wad een gang to the show like other folk sinful and shameful if it be let them that make the sin bear the shame but then i will put on nane of their popish disguisesme that has lived in north leith baith wife and lass for i shanna say how mony years and has a character to keep up baith with saint and sinnerand then whas to take care of me since you are gaun to make a limeandstane wa of yoursell dr kickinben  my dear mrs blower if such is your determination i will not make a wall of myself her ladyship must consider my professionshe must understand it is my function to look after my patients in preference to all the stageplays in this worldand to attend on a case like yours mrs blower it is my duty to sacrifice were it called for the whole drama from shakspeare to okeefe  on hearing this magnanimous resolution the widows heart was greatly cheered for in fact she might probably have considered the doctors perseverance in the plan of which she had expressed such high disapprobation as little less than a symptom of absolute defection from his allegiance by an accommodation therefore which suited both parties it was settled that the doctor should attend his loving widow to shawscastle without mask or mantle and that the painted screen should be transferred from quacklebens back to the broad shoulders of a briefless barrister well qualified for the part of wall since the composition of his skull might have rivalled in solidity the mortar and stone of the most approved builder  we must not pause to dilate upon the various labours of body and spirit which preceded the intervening space betwixt the settlement of this gay scheme and the time appointed to carry it into execution we will not attempt to describe how the wealthy by letter and by commissioners urged their researches through the stores of the gallery of fashion for specimens of oriental fineryhow they that were scant of diamonds supplied their place with paste and bristol stoneshow the country dealers were driven out of patience by the demand for goods of which they had never before heard the nameand lastly how the busy fingers of the more economical damsels twisted handkerchiefs into turbans and converted petticoats into pantaloons shaped and sewed cut and clipped and spoiled many a decent gown and petticoat to produce something like a grecian habit who can describe the wonders wrought by active needles and scissors aided by thimbles and thread upon silver gauze and sprigged muslin or who can show how if the fair nymphs of the spring did not entirely succeed in attaining the desired resemblance to heathen greeks they at least contrived to get rid of all similitude to sober christians  neither is it necessary to dwell upon the various schemes of conveyance which were resorted to in order to transfer the beau monde of the spa to the scene of revelry at shawscastle these were as various as the fortunes and pretensions of the owners from the lordly curricle with its outriders to the humble taxed cart nay untaxed cart which conveyed the personages of lesser rank for the latter indeed the two postchaises at the inn seemed converted into hourly stages so often did they come and go between the hotel and the castlea glad day for the postilions and a day of martyrdom for the poor posthorses so seldom is it that every department of any society however constituted can be injured or benefited by the same occurrence  such indeed was the penury of vehicular conveyance that applications were made in manner most humble even to meg dods herself entreating she would permit her old whiskey to ply for such might have been the phrase at st ronans well for that day only and that upon good cause shown but not for sordid lucre would the undaunted spirit of meg compound her feud with her neighbours of the detested well her carriage she briefly replied was engaged for her ain guest and the minister and deil anither bodys fit should gang intillt let every herring hing by its ain head and accordingly at the duly appointed hour creaked forth the leathern convenience in which carefully screened by the curtain from the gaze of the fry of the village sat nabob touchwood in the costume of an indian merchant or shroff as they are termed the clergyman would not perhaps have been so punctual had not a set of notes and messages from his friend at the cleikum ever following each other as thick as the papers which decorate the tail of a schoolboys kite kept him so continually on the alert from daybreak till noon that mr touchwood found him completely dressed and the whiskey was only delayed for about ten minutes before the door of the manse a space employed by mr cargill in searching for the spectacles which at last were happily discovered upon his own nose  at length seated by the side of his new friend mr cargill arrived safe at shawscastle the gate of which mansion was surrounded by a screaming group of children so extravagantly delighted at seeing the strange figures to whom each successive carriage gave birth that even the stern brow and wellknown voice of johnie tirlsneck the beadle though stationed in the court on express purpose was not equal to the task of controlling them these noisy intruders however who it was believed were somewhat favoured by clara mowbray were excluded from the court which opened before the house by a couple of grooms or helpers armed with their whips and could only salute with their shrill and wondering hailing the various personages as they passed down a short avenue leading from the exterior gate  the cleikum nabob and the minister were greeted with shouts not the least clamorous which the former merited by the ease with which he wore the white turban and the latter by the infrequency of his appearance in public and both by the singular association of a decent clergyman of the church of scotland in a dress more oldfashioned than could now be produced in the general assembly walking arm in arm and seemingly in the most familiar terms with a parsee merchant they stopped a moment at the gate of the courtyard to admire the front of the old mansion which had been disturbed with so unusual a scene of gaiety  shawscastle though so named presented no appearance of defence and the present edifice had never been designed for more than the accommodation of a peaceful family having a low heavy front loaded with some of that meretricious ornament which uniting or rather confounding the gothic and grecian architecture was much used during the reigns of james vi of scotland and his unfortunate son the court formed a small square two sides of which were occupied by such buildings as were required for the family and the third by the stables the only part to which much attention had been paid the present mr mowbray having put them into excellent order the fourth side of the square was shut up by a screen wall through which a door opened to the avenue the whole being a kind of structure which may be still found on those old scottish properties where a rage to render their place parkish as was at one time the prevailing phrase has not induced the owners to pull down the venerable and sheltering appendages with which their wiser fathers had screened their mansion and to lay the whole open to the keen northeast much after the fashion of a spinster of fifty who chills herself to gratify the public by an exposure of her thin red elbows and shrivelled neck and bosom  a double door thrown hospitably open on the present occasion admitted the company into a dark and low hall where mowbray himself wearing the under dress of theseus but not having yet assumed his ducal cap and robes stood to receive his guests with due courtesy and to indicate to each the road allotted to him those who were to take a share in the representation of the morning were conducted to an old saloon destined for a greenroom and which communicated with a series of apartments on the right hastily fitted with accommodations for arranging and completing their toilet while others who took no part in the intended drama were ushered to the left into a large unfurnished and long disused dining parlour where a sashed door opened into the gardens crossed with yew and holly hedges still trimmed and clipped by the old greyheaded gardener upon those principles which a dutchman thought worthy of commemorating in a didactic poem upon the ars topiaria  a little wilderness surrounding a beautiful piece of the smoothest turf and itself bounded by such high hedges as we have described had been selected as the stage most proper for the exhibition of the intended dramatic picture it afforded many facilities for a rising bank exactly in front was accommodated with seats for the spectators who had a complete view of the silvan theatre the bushes and shrubs having been cleared away and the place supplied with a temporary screen which being withdrawn by the domestics appointed for that purpose was to serve for the rising of the curtain a covered trellis which passed through another part of the garden and terminated with a private door opening from the right wing of the building seemed as if it had been planted on purpose for the proposed exhibition as it served to give the personages of the drama a convenient and secret access from the greenroom to the place of representation indeed the dramatis person√¶ at least those who adopted the management of the matter were induced by so much convenience to extend in some measure their original plan and instead of one group as had been at first proposed they now found themselves able to exhibit to the good company a succession of three or four selected and arranged from different parts of the drama thus giving some duration as well as some variety to the entertainment besides the advantage of separating and contrasting the tragic and the comic scenes  after wandering about amongst the gardens which contained little to interest any one and endeavouring to recognise some characters who accommodating themselves to the humours of the day had ventured to appear in the various disguises of balladsingers pedlars shepherds highlanders and so forth the company began to draw together towards the spot where the seats prepared for them and the screen drawn in front of the bosky stage induced them to assemble and excited expectation especially as a scroll in front of the esplanade set forth in the words of the play this green plot shall be our stage this hawthorn brake our tiringhouse and we will do it in action a delay of about ten minutes began to excite some suppressed murmurs of impatience among the audience when the touch of gows fiddle suddenly burst from a neighbouring hedge behind which he had established his little orchestra all were of course silent      as through his dear strathspeys he bore with highland rage  and when he changed his strain to an adagio and suffered his music to die away in the plaintive notes of roslin castle the echoes of the old walls were after a long slumber awakened by that enthusiastic burst of applause with which the scots usually received and rewarded their countrys gifted minstrel  he is his fathers own son said touchwood to the clergyman for both had gotten seats near about the centre of the place of audience it is many a long year since i listened to old neil at inver and to say truth spent a night with him over pancakes and athole brose and i never expected to hear his match again in my lifetime but stopthe curtain rises  the screen was indeed withdrawn and displayed hermia helena and their lovers in attitudes corresponding to the scene of confusion occasioned by the error of puck  messrs chatterly and the painter played their parts neither better nor worse than amateur actors in general and the best that could be said of them was that they seemed more than half ashamed of their exotic dresses and of the public gaze  but against this untimely weakness lady penelope was guarded by the strong shield of selfconceit she minced ambled and notwithstanding the slight appearance of her person and the depredations which time had made on a countenance that had never been very much distinguished for beauty seemed desirous to top the part of the beautiful daughter of egeus the sullenness which was proper to the character of hermia was much augmented by the discovery that miss mowbray was so much better dressed than herselfa discovery which she had but recently made as that young lady had not attended on the regular rehearsals at the well but once and then without her stage habit her ladyship however did not permit this painful sense of inferiority where she had expected triumph so far to prevail over her desire of shining as to interrupt materially the manner in which she had settled to represent her portion of the scene the nature of the exhibition precluded much action but lady penelope made amends by such a succession of grimaces as might rival in variety at least the singular display which garrick used to call going his rounds she twisted her poor features into looks of most desperate love towards lysander into those of wonder and offended pride when she turned them upon demetrius and finally settled them on helena with the happiest possible imitation of an incensed rival who feels the impossibility of relieving her swollen heart by tears alone and is just about to have recourse to her nails  no contrast could be stronger in looks demeanour and figure than that between hermia and helena in the latter character the beautiful form and foreign dress of miss mowbray attracted all eyes she kept her place on the stage as a sentinel does that which his charge assigns him for she had previously told her brother that though she consented at his importunity to make part of the exhibition it was as a piece of the scene not as an actor and accordingly a painted figure could scarce be more immovable the expression of her countenance seemed to be that of deep sorrow and perplexity belonging to her part over which wandered at times an air of irony or ridicule as if she were secretly scorning the whole exhibition and even herself for condescending to become part of it above all a sense of bashfulness had cast upon her cheek a colour which though sufficiently slight was more than her countenance was used to display and when the spectators beheld in the splendour and grace of a rich oriental dress her whom they had hitherto been accustomed to see attired only in the most careless manner they felt the additional charms of surprise and contrast so that the bursts of applause which were vollied towards the stage might be said to be addressed to her alone and to vie in sincerity with those which have been forced from an audience by the most accomplished performer  oh that puir lady penelope said honest mrs blower who when her scruples against the exhibition were once got over began to look upon it with particular interesti am really sorry for her puir face for she gars it work like the sails of john blowers vesshel in a stiff breezeoh doctor cacklehen dinna ye think she wad need if it were possible to rin ower her face wi a gusing iron just to take the wrunkles out ot  hush hush my good dear mrs blower said the doctor lady penelope is a woman of quality and my patient and such people always act charminglyyou must understand there is no hissing at a private theatrehem  ye may say what ye like doctor but there is nae fule like an auld fuleto be sure if she was as young and beautiful as miss

warrant  real indian said mr touchwood in an accent of disdain which rather disturbed mrs blowers equanimitywhy what do you suppose it should be madam  i dinna ken sir said she edging somewhat nearer the doctor not being altogether pleased as she afterwards allowed with the outlandish appearance and sharp tone of the traveller then pulling her own drapery round her shoulders she added courageously there are braw shawls made at paisley that ye will scarce ken frae foreign  not know paisley shawls from indian madam said touchwood why a blind man could tell by the slightest touch of his little finger yon shawl now is the handsomest i have seen in britainand at this distance i can tell it to be a real tozie  cozie may she weel be that wears it said mrs blower i declare now i look ont again its a perfect beauty  it is called tozie maam not cozie continued the traveller the shroffs at surat told me in 1801 that it is made out of the inner coat of a goat  of a sheep sir i am thinking ye mean for goats has nae woo  not much of it indeed madam but you are to understand they use only the inmost coat and then their dyesthat tozie now will keep its colour while there is a rag of it leftmen bequeath them in legacies to their grandchildren  and a very bonny colour it is said the dame something like a mouses back only a thought redderi wonder what they ca that colour  the colour is much admired madam said touchwood who was now on a favourite topic the mussulmans say the colour is betwixt that of an elephant and the breast of the faughta  in troth i am as wise as i was said mrs blower  the faughta madam so called by the moors for the hindhus call it hollah is a sort of pigeon held sacred among the moslem of india because they think it dyed its breast in the blood of alibut i see they are closing the scenemr cargill are you composing your sermon my good friend or what can you be thinking of  mr cargill had during the whole scene remained with his eyes fixed in intent and anxious although almost unconscious gaze upon clara mowbray and when the voice of his companion startled him out of his reverie he exclaimed most lovelymost unhappyyesi must and will see her  see her replied touchwood too much accustomed to his friends singularities to look for much reason or connexion in any thing he said or did why you shall see her and talk to her too if that will give you pleasurethey say now he continued lowering his voice to a whisper that this mowbray is ruined i see nothing like it since he can dress out his sister like a begum did you ever see such a splendid shawl  dearly purchased splendour said mr cargill with a deep sigh i wish that the price be yet fully paid  very likely not said the traveller very likely its gone to the book and for the price i have known a thousand rupees given for such a shawl in the countrybut hush hush we are to have another tune from nathanielfaith and they are withdrawing the screenwell they have some mercythey do not let us wait long between the acts of their follies at leasti love a quick and rattling fire in these vanitiesfolly walking a funeral pace and clinking her bells to the time of a passing knell makes sad work indeed  a strain of music beginning slowly and terminating in a light and wild allegro introduced on the stage those delightful creatures of the richest imagination that ever teemed with wonders the oberon and titania of shakspeare the pigmy majesty of the captain of the fairy band had no unapt representative in miss digges whose modesty was not so great an intruder as to prevent her desire to present him in all his dignity and she moved conscious of the graceful turn of a pretty ankle which encircled with a string of pearls and clothed in fleshcoloured silk of the most cobweb texture rose above the crimson sandal her jewelled tiara too gave dignity to the frown with which the offended king of shadows greeted his consort as each entered upon the scene at the head of their several attendants  the restlessness of the children had been duly considered and therefore their part of the exhibition had been contrived to represent dumb show rather than a stationary picture the little queen of elves was not inferior in action to her moody lord and repaid with a look of female impatience and scorn the haughty air which seemed to express his sullen greeting      ill met by moonlight proud titania  the other children were as usual some clever and forward some loutish and awkward enough but the gambols of childhood are sure to receive applause paid perhaps with a mixture of pity and envy by those in advanced life and besides there were in the company several fond papas and mammas whose clamorous approbation though given apparently to the whole performers was especially dedicated in their hearts to their own little jackies and mariasfor mary though the prettiest and most classical of scottish names is now unknown in the land the elves therefore played their frolics danced a measure and vanished with good approbation  the antimask as it may be called of bottom and his company of actors next appeared on the stage and a thunder of applause received the young earl who had with infinite taste and dexterity transformed himself into the similitude of an athenian clown observing the grecian costume yet so judiciously discriminated from the dress of the higher characters as at once to fix the character of a thickskinned mechanic on the wearer touchwood in particular was loud in his approbation from which the correctness of the costume must be inferred for that honest gentleman like many other critics was indeed not very much distinguished for good taste but had a capital memory for petty matters of fact and while the most impressive look or gesture of an actor might have failed to interest him would have censured most severely the fashion of a sleeve or the colour of a shoetie  but the earl of etheringtons merits were not confined to his external appearance for had his better fortunes failed him his deserts like those of hamlet might have got him a fellowship in a cry of players he presented though in dumb show the pragmatic conceit of bottom to the infinite amusement of all present especially of those who were well acquainted with the original and when he was translated by puck he bore the asss head his newlyacquired dignity with an appearance of conscious greatness which made the metamorphosis though in itself sufficiently farcical irresistibly comic he afterwards displayed the same humour in his frolics with the fairies and the intercourse which he held with messrs cobweb mustardseed peaseblossom and the rest of titanias cavaliers who lost all command of their countenances at the gravity with which he invited them to afford him the luxury of scratching his hairy snout mowbray had also found a fitting representative for puck in a queerlooking smalleyed boy of the aultoun of st ronans with large ears projecting from his head like turrets from a gothic building this exotic animal personified the merry and mocking spirit of hobgoblin with considerable power so that the group bore some resemblance to the wellknown and exquisite delineation of puck by sir joshua in the select collection of the bard of memory it was however the ruin of the st ronans robin goodfellow who did no good afterwardsgaed an ill gate as meg dods said and took on with a party of strolling players  the entertainment closed with a grand parade of all the characters that had appeared during which mowbray concluded that the young lord himself unremarked might have time enough to examine the outward form at least of his sister clara whom in the pride of his heart he could not help considering superior in beauty dressed as she now was with every advantage of art even to the brilliant amazon lady binks it is true mowbray was not a man to give preference to the intellectual expression of poor claras features over the sultanalike beauty of the haughty dame which promised to an admirer all the vicissitudes that can be expressed by a countenance lovely in every change and changing as often as an ardent and impetuous disposition unused to constraint and despising admonition should please to dictate yet to do him justice though his preference was perhaps dictated more by fraternal partiality than by purity of taste he certainly on the present occasion felt the full extent of claras superiority and there was a proud smile on his lip as at the conclusion of the divertisement he asked the earl how he had been pleased the rest of the performers had separated and the young lord remained on the stage employed in disembarrassing himself of his awkward visor when mowbray put this question to which though general in terms he naturally gave a particular meaning  i could wear my asss head for ever he said on condition my eyes were to be so delightfully employed as they have been during the last scenemowbray your sister is an angel  have a care that that headpiece of yours has not perverted your taste my lord said mowbray but why did you wear that disguise on your last appearance you should i think have been uncovered  i am ashamed to answer you said the earl but truth is first impressions are of consequence and i thought i might do as wisely not to appear before your sister for the first time in the character of bully bottom  then you change your dress my lord for dinner if we call our luncheon by that name said mowbray  i am going to my room this instant for that very purpose replied the earl  and i said mowbray must step in front and dismiss the audience for i see they are sitting gaping there waiting for another scene  they parted upon this and mowbray as duke theseus stepped before the screen and announcing the conclusion of the dramatic pictures which they had had the honour to present before the worshipful company thanked the spectators for the very favourable reception which they had afforded and intimated to them that if they could amuse themselves by strolling for an hour among the gardens a bell would summon to the house at the expiry of that time when some refreshments would wait their acceptance this annunciation was received with the applause due to the amphitryon ou lon dine and the guests arising from before the temporary theatre dispersed through the gardens which were of some extent to seek for or create amusement to themselves the music greatly aided them in this last purpose and it was not long ere a dozen of couples and upwards were tripping it on the light fantastic toe i love a phrase that is not hackneyed to the tune of monymusk  others strolled through the grounds meeting some quaint disguise at the end of every verdant alley and communicating to others the surprise and amusement which they themselves were receiving the scene from the variety of dresses the freedom which it gave to the display of humour amongst such as possessed any and the general disposition to give and receive pleasure rendered the little masquerade more entertaining than others of the kind for which more ample and magnificent preparations have been made there was also a singular and pleasing contrast between the fantastic figures who wandered through the gardens and the quiet scene itself to which the old clipt hedges the formal distribution of the ground and the antiquated appearance of one or two fountains and artificial cascades in which the naiads had been for the nonce compelled to resume their ancient frolics gave an appearance of unusual simplicity and seclusion and which seemed rather to belong to the last than to the present generation  footnotes  ii1 at kilruddery the noble seat of lord meath in the county of wicklow there is a situation for private theatrical exhibitions in the open air planted out with the evergreens which arise there in the most luxuriant magnificence it has a wild and romantic effect reminding one of the scene in

hours     forerun fair love strewing his way with flowers  loves labours lost      worthies awaythe scene begins to cloud  ibidem   mr touchwood and his inseparable friend mr cargill wandered on amidst the gay groups we have described the former censuring with great scorn the frequent attempts which he observed towards an imitation of the costume of the east and appealing with selfcomplacence to his own superior representation as he greeted in moorish and in persic the several turband figures who passed his way while the clergyman whose mind seemed to labour with some weighty and important project looked in every direction for the fair representative of helena but in vain at length he caught a glimpse of the memorable shawl which had drawn forth so learned a discussion from his companion and starting from touchwoods side with a degree of anxious alertness totally foreign to his usual habits he endeavoured to join the person by whom it was worn  by the lord said his companion the doctor is beside himselfthe parson is madthe divine is out of his senses that is clear and how the devil can he who scarce can find his road from the cleikum to his own manse venture himself unprotected into such a scene of confusionhe might as well pretend to cross the atlantic without a piloti must push off in chase of him lest worse come of it  but the traveller was prevented from executing his friendly purpose by a sort of crowd which came rushing down the alley the centre of which was occupied by captain macturk in the very act of bullying two pseudo highlanders for having presumed to lay aside their breeches before they had acquired the gaelic language the sounds of contempt and insult with which the genuine celt was overwhelming the unfortunate impostors were not indeed intelligible otherwise than from the tone and manner of the speaker but these intimated so much displeasure that the plaided forms whose unadvised choice of a disguise had provoked ittwo raw lads from a certain great manufacturing townheartily repented their temerity and were in the act of seeking for the speediest exit from the gardens rather choosing to resign their share of the dinner than to abide the farther consequences that might follow from the displeasure of this highland termagant  touchwood had scarcely extricated himself from this impediment and again commenced his researches after the clergyman when his course was once more interrupted by a sort of pressgang headed by sir bingo binks who in order to play his character of a drunken boatswain to the life seemed certainly drunk enough however little of a seaman his cheer sounded more like a viewhollo than a hail when with a volley of such oaths as would have blown a whole fleet of the bethel union out of the water he ordered touchwood to come under his lee and be dd for smash his old timbers he must go to sea again for as weatherbeaten a hulk as he was  touchwood answered instantly to sea with all my heart but not with a landlubber for commanderharkye brother do you know how much of a horses furniture belongs to a ship  come none of your quizzing my old buck said sir bingowhat the devil has a ship to do with horses furnituredo you think we belong to the horsemarinesha ha i think youre matched brother  why you son of a freshwater gudgeon replied the traveller that never in your life sailed farther than the isle of dogs do you pretend to play a sailor and not know the bridle of the bowline and the saddle of the boltsprit and the bit for the cable and the girth to hoist the rigging and the whip to serve for small tacklethere is a trick for you to find out an abramman and save sixpence when he begs of you as a disbanded seamanget along with you or the constable shall be charged with the whole pressgang to man the workhouse  a general laugh arose at the detection of the swaggering boatswain and all that the baronet had for it was to sneak off saying dn the old quiz who the devil thought to have heard so much slang from an old muslin nightcap  touchwood being now an object of some attention was followed by two or three stragglers whom he endeavoured to rid himself of the best way he could testifying an impatience a little inconsistent with the decorum of his oriental demeanour but which arose from his desire to rejoin his companion and some apprehension of inconvenience which he feared cargill might sustain during his absence for being in fact as goodnatured a man as any in the world mr touchwood was at the same time one of the most conceited and was very apt to suppose that his presence advice and assistance were of the most indispensable consequence to those with whom he lived and that not only on great emergencies but even in the most ordinary occurrences of life  meantime mr cargill whom he sought in vain was on his part anxiously keeping in sight of the beautiful indian shawl which served as a flag to announce to him the vessel which he held in chase at length he approached so close as to say in an anxious whisper miss mowbraymiss mowbrayi must speak with you  and what would you have with miss mowbray said the fair wearer of the beautiful shawl but without turning round her head  i have a secretan important secret of which to make you aware but it is not for this placedo not turn from meyour happiness in this and perhaps in the next life depends on your listening to me  the lady led the way as if to give him an opportunity of speaking with her more privately to one of those oldfashioned and deeplyembowered recesses which are commonly found in such gardens as that of shawscastle and with her shawl wrapped around her head so as in some degree to conceal her features she stood before mr cargill in the doubtful light and shadow of a huge platanus tree which formed the canopy of the arbour and seemed to await the communication he had promised  report says said the clergyman speaking in an eager and hurried manner yet with a low voice and like one desirous of being heard by her whom he addressed and by no one elsereport says that you are about to be married  and is report kind enough to say to whom answered the lady with a tone of indifference which seemed to astound her interrogator  young lady he answered with a solemn voice had this levity been sworn to me i could never have believed it have you forgot the circumstances in which you standhave you forgotten that my promise of secrecy sinful perhaps even in that degree was but a conditional promiseor did you think that a being so sequestered as i am was already dead to the world even while he was walking upon its surfaceknow young lady that i am indeed dead to the pleasures and the ordinary business of life but i am even therefore the more alive to its duties  upon my honour sir unless you are pleased to be more explicit it is impossible for me either to answer or understand you said the lady you speak too seriously for a masquerade pleasantry and yet not clearly enough to make your earnest comprehensible  is this sullenness miss mowbray said the clergyman with increased animation is it levityor is it alienation of mindeven after a fever of the brain we retain a recollection of the causes of our illnesscome you must and do understand me when i say that i will not consent to your committing a great crime to attain temporal wealth and rank no not to make you an empress my path is a clear one and should i hear a whisper breathed of your alliance with this earl or whatever he may be rely upon it that i will withdraw the veil and make your brother your bridegroom and the whole world acquainted with the situation in which you stand and the impossibility of your forming the alliance which you propose to yourself i am compelled to say against the laws of god and man  but sirsir answered the lady rather eagerly than anxiously you have not yet told me what business you have with my marriage or what arguments you can bring against it  madam replied mr cargill in your present state of mind and in such a scene as this i cannot enter upon a topic for which the season is unfit and you i am sorry to say are totally unprepared it is enough that you know the grounds on which you stand at a fitter opportunity i will as it is my duty lay before you the enormity of what you are said to have meditated with the freedom which becomes one who however humble is appointed to explain to his fellowcreatures the laws of his maker in the meantime i am not afraid that you will take any hasty step after such a warning as this  so saying he turned from the lady with that dignity which a conscious discharge of duty confers yet at the same time with a sense of deep pain inflicted by the careless levity of her whom he addressed she did not any longer attempt to detain him but made her escape from the arbour by one alley as she heard voices which seemed to approach it from another the clergyman who took the opposite direction met in full encounter a whispering and tittering pair who seemed at his sudden appearance to check their tone of familiarity and assume an appearance of greater distance towards each other the lady was no other than the fair queen of the amazons who seemed to have adopted the recent partiality of titania towards bully bottom being in conference such and so close as we have described with the late representative of the athenian weaver whom his recent visit to his chamber had metamorphosed into the more gallant disguise of an ancient spanish cavalier he now appeared with cloak and drooping plume sword poniard and guitar richly dressed at all points as for a serenade beneath his mistresss window a silk mask at the breast of his embroidered doublet hung ready to be assumed in case of intrusion as an appropriate part of the national dress  it sometimes happened to mr cargill as we believe it may chance to other men much subject to absence of mind that contrary to their wont and much after the manner of a sunbeam suddenly piercing a deep mist and illuminating one particular object in the landscape some sudden recollection rushes upon them and seems to compel them to act under it as under the influence of complete certainty and conviction mr cargill had no sooner set eyes on the spanish cavalier in whom he neither knew the earl of etherington nor recognised bully bottom than with hasty emotion he seized on his reluctant hand and exclaimed with a mixture of eagerness and solemnity i rejoice to see youheaven has sent you here in its own good time  i thank you sir replied lord etherington very coldly i believe you have the joy of the meeting entirely on your side as i cannot remember having seen you before  is not your name bulmer said the clergyman ii knowi am sometimes apt to make mistakesbut i am sure your name is bulmer  not that ever i or my godfathers heard ofmy name was bottom half an hour agoperhaps that makes the confusion answered the earl with very cold and distant politenesspermit me to pass sir that i may attend the lady  quite unnecessary answered lady binks i leave you to adjust your mutual recollections with your new old friend my lordhe seems to have something to say so saying the lady walked on not perhaps sorry of an opportunity to show apparent indifference for his lordships society in the presence of one who had surprised them in what might seem a moment of exuberant intimacy  you detain me sir said the earl of etherington to mr cargill who bewildered and uncertain still kept himself placed so directly before the young nobleman as to make it impossible for him to pass without absolutely pushing him to one side i must really attend the lady he added making another effort to walk on  young man said mr cargill you cannot disguise yourself from me i am suremy mind assures me that you are that very bulmer whom heaven hath sent here to prevent crime  and you said lord etherington whom my mind assures me i never saw in my life are sent hither by the devil i think to create confusion  i beg pardon sir said the clergyman staggered by the calm and pertinacious denial of the earli beg pardon if i am in a mistakethat is if i am really in a mistakebut i am noti am sure i am notthat lookthat smilei am not mistaken you are valentine bulmerthe very valentine bulmer whom ibut i will not make your private affairs any part of this expositionenough you are valentine bulmer  valentinevalentine answered lord etherington impatientlyi am neither valentine nor orsoni wish you goodmorning sir  stay sir stay i charge you said the clergyman if you are unwilling to be known yourself it may be because you have forgotten who i amlet me name myself as the reverend josiah cargill minister of st ronans  if you bear a character so venerable sir replied the young noblemanin which however i am not in the least interestedi think when you make your morning draught a little too potent it might be as well for you to stay at home and sleep it off before coming into company  in the name of heaven young gentleman said mr cargill lay aside this untimely and unseemly jesting and tell me if you be notas i cannot but still believe you to bethat same youth who seven years since left in my deposit a solemn secret which if i should unfold to the wrong person woe would be my own heart and evil the consequences which might ensue  you are very pressing with me sir said the earl and in exchange i will be equally frank with youi am not the man whom you mistake me for and you may go seek him where you willit will be still more lucky for you if you chance to find your own wits in the course of your researches for i must tell you plainly i think they are gone somewhat astray so saying with a gesture expressive of a determined purpose to pass on mr cargill had no alternative but to make way and suffer him to proceed  the worthy clergyman stood as if rooted to the ground and with his usual habit of thinking aloud exclaimed to himself my fancy has played me many a bewildering trick but this is the most extraordinary of them allwhat can this young man think of me it must have been my conversation with that unhappy young lady that has made such an impression upon me as to deceive my very eyesight and causes me to connect with her history the face of the next person that i metwhat must the stranger think of me  why what every one thinks of thee that knows thee prophet said the friendly voice of touchwood accompanying his speech with an awakening slap on the clergymans shoulder and that is that thou art an unfortunate philosopher of laputa who has lost his flapper in the throngcome alonghaving me once more by your side you need fear nothing why now i look at you closer you look as if you had seen a basilisknot that there is any such thing otherwise i must have seen it myself in the course of my travelsbut you seem pale and frightenedwhat the devil is the matter  nothing answered the clergyman except that i have even this very moment made an egregious fool of myself  pooh pooh that is nothing to sigh over prophetevery man does so at least twice in the fourandtwenty hours said touchwood  but i had nearly betrayed to a stranger a secret deeply concerning the honour of an ancient family  that was wrong doctor said touchwood take care of that in future and indeed i would advise you not to speak even to your beadle johnie tirlsneck until you have assured yourself by at least three pertinent questions and answers that you have the said johnie corporeally and substantially in presence before you and that your fancy has not invested some stranger with honest johnies singed periwig and threadbare brown josephcome alongcome along  so saying he hurried forward the perplexed clergyman who in vain made all the excuses he could think of in order to effect his escape from the scene of gaiety in which he was so unexpectedly involved he pleaded headache and his friend assured him that a mouthful of food and a glass of wine would mend it he stated he had business and touchwood replied that he could have none but composing his next sermon and reminded him that it was two days till sunday at length mr cargill confessed that he had some reluctance again to see the stranger on whom he had endeavoured with such pertinacity to fix an acquaintance which he was now well assured existed only in his own imagination the traveller treated his scruples with scorn and said that guests meeting in this general manner had no more to do with each other than if they were assembled in a caravansary  so that you need not say a word to him in the way of apology or otherwiseor what will be still better i who have seen so much of the world will make the pretty speech for you as they spoke he dragged the divine towards the house where they were now summoned by the appointed signal and where the company were assembling in the old saloon already noticed previous to passing into the diningroom where the refreshments were prepared now doctor continued the busy friend of mr cargill let us see which of all these people has been the subject of your blunder is it yon animal of a highlandmanor the impertinent brute that wants to be thought a boatswainor which of them all is itay here they come two and two newgate fashionthe young lord of the manor with old lady penelopedoes he set up for ulysses i wonderthe earl of etherington with lady bingomethinks it should have been with miss mowbray  the earl of what did you say quoth the clergyman anxiously how is it you titled that young man in the spanish dress  oho said the traveller what i have discovered the goblin that has scared youcome alongcome alongi will make you acquainted with him so saying he dragged him towards lord etherington and before the divine could make his negative intelligible the ceremony of introduction had taken place my lord etherington allow me to present mr cargill minister of this parisha learned gentleman whose head is often in the holy land when his person seems present among his friends he suffers extremely my lord under the sense of mistaking your lordship for the lord knows who but when you are acquainted with him you will find that he can make a hundred stranger mistakes than that so we hope that your lordship will take no prejudice or offence  there can be no offence taken where no offence is intended said lord etherington with much urbanity it is i who ought to beg the reverend gentlemans pardon for hurrying from him without allowing him to make a complete eclaircissement i beg his pardon for an abruptness which the place and the timefor i was immediately engaged in a ladys servicerendered unavoidable  mr cargill gazed on the young nobleman as he pronounced these words with the easy indifference of one who apologizes to an inferior in order to maintain his own character for politeness but with perfect indifference whether his excuses are or are not held satisfactory and as the clergyman gazed the belief which had so strongly clung to him that the earl of etherington and young valentine bulmer were the same individual person melted away like frostwork before the morning sun and that so completely that he marvelled at himself for having ever entertained it some strong resemblance of features there must have been to have led him into such a delusion but the person the tone the manner of expression were absolutely different and his attention being now especially directed towards these particulars mr cargill was inclined to think the two personages almost totally dissimilar  the clergyman had now only to make his apology and fall back from the head of the table to some lower seat which his modesty would have preferred when he was suddenly seized upon by the lady penelope penfeather who detaining him in the most elegant and persuasive manner possible insisted that they should be introduced to each other by mr mowbray and that mr cargill should sit beside her at tableshe had heard so much of his learningso much of his excellent characterdesired so much to make his acquaintance that she could not think of losing an opportunity which mr cargills learned seclusion rendered so very rarein a word catching the black lion was the order of the day and her ladyship having trapped her prey soon sat triumphant with him by her side  a second separation was thus effected betwixt touchwood and his friend for the former not being included in the invitation or indeed at all noticed by lady penelope was obliged to find room at a lower part of the table where he excited much surprise by the dexterity with which he dispatched boiled rice with chopsticks  mr cargill being thus exposed without a consort to the fire of lady penelope speedily found it so brisk and incessant as to drive his complaisance little tried as it had been for many years by small talk almost to extremity she began by begging him to draw his chair close for an instinctive terror of fine ladies had made him keep his distance at the same time she hoped he was not afraid of her as an episcopalian her father had belonged to that communion for she added with what was intended for an arch smile we were somewhat naughty in the fortyfive as you may have heard but all that was over and she was sure mr cargill was too liberal to entertain any dislike or shyness on that scoreshe could assure him she was far from disliking the presbyterian formindeed she had often wished to hear it where she was sure to be both delighted and edified here a gracious smile in the church of st ronansand hoped to do so whenever mr mowbray had got a stove which he had ordered from edinburgh on purpose to air his pew for her accommodation  all this which was spoken with wreathed smiles and nods and so much civility as to remind the clergyman of a cup of tea oversweetened to conceal its want of strength and flavour required and received no farther answer than an accommodating look and acquiescent bow  ah mr cargill continued the inexhaustible lady penelope your profession has so many demands on the heart as well as the understandingis so much connected with the kindnesses and charities of our naturewith our best and purest feelings mr cargill you know what goldsmith says      to his duty prompt at every call     he watchd and wept and felt and prayd for all  and then dryden has such a picture of a parish priest so inimitable one would think did we not hear now and then of some living mortal presuming to emulate its features here another insinuating nod and expressive smile      refined himself to soul to curb the sense     and almost made a sin of abstinence     yet had his aspect nothing of severe     but such a face as promised him sincere     nothing reserved or sullen was to see     but sweet regard and pleasing sanctity  while her ladyship declaimed the clergymans wandering eye confessed his absent mind his thoughts travelling perhaps to accomplish a truce betwixt saladin and conrade of mountserrat unless they chanced to be occupied with some occurrences of that very day so that the lady was obliged to recall her indocile auditor with the leading question you are well acquainted with dryden of course mr cargill  i have not the honour madam said mr cargill starting from his reverie and but half understanding the question he replied to  sir said the lady in surprise  madammy lady answered mr cargill in embarrassment  i asked you if you admired drydenbut you learned men are so absentperhaps you thought i said leyden  a lamp too early quenched madam said mr cargill i knew him well  and so did i eagerly replied the lady of the cerulean buskin he spoke ten languageshow mortifying to poor me mr cargill who could only boast of fivebut i have studied a little since that timei must have you to help me in my studies mr cargillit will be charitablebut perhaps you are afraid of a female pupil  a thrill arising from former recollections passed through poor cargills mind with as much acuteness as the pass of a rapier might have done through his body and we cannot help remarking that a forward prater in society like a busy bustler in a crowd besides all other general points of annoyance is eternally rubbing upon some tender point and galling mens feelings without knowing or regarding it  you must assist me besides in my little charities mr cargill now that you and i are become so well acquaintedthere is that anne heggiei sent her a trifle yesterday but i am toldi should not mention it but only one would not have the little they have to bestow lavished on an improper objecti am told she is not quite properan unwedded mother in short mr cargilland it would be especially unbecoming in me to encourage profligacy  i believe madam said the clergyman gravely the poor womans distress may justify your ladyships bounty even if her conduct has been faulty  o i am no prude neither i assure you mr cargill answered the lady penelope i never withdraw my countenance from any one but on the most irrefragable grounds i could tell you of an intimate friend of my own whom i have supported against the whole clamour of the people at the well because i believe from the bottom of my soul she is only thoughtlessnothing in the world but thoughtlesso mr cargill how can you look across the table so intelligentlywho would have thought it of youoh fie to make such personal applications  upon my word madam i am quite at a loss to comprehend  oh fie fie mr cargill throwing in as much censure and surprise as a confidential whisper can conveyyou looked at my lady binksi know what you think but you are quite wrong i assure you you are entirely wrongi wish she would not flirt quite so much with that young lord etherington though mr cargillher situation is particularindeed i believe she wears out his patience for see he is leaving the room before we sit downhow singularand then do you not think it very odd too that miss mowbray has not come down to us  miss mowbraywhat of miss mowbrayis she not here said mr cargill starting and with an expression of interest which he had not yet bestowed on any of her ladyships liberal communications  ay poor miss mowbray said lady penelope lowering her voice and shaking her head she has not appearedher brother went up stairs a few minutes since i believe to bring her down and so we are all left here to look at each otherhow very awkwardbut you know clara mowbray  i madam said mr cargill who was now sufficiently attentive i reallyi know miss mowbraythat is i knew her some years sincebut your ladyship knows she has been long in bad healthuncertain health at least and i have seen nothing of the young lady for a very long time  i know it my dear mr cargilli know it continued the lady penelope in the same tone of deep sympathy i know it and most unhappy surely have been the circumstances that have separated her from your advice and friendly counselall this i am aware ofand to say truth it has been chiefly on poor claras account that i have been giving you the trouble of fixing an acquaintance upon youyou and i together mr cargill might do wonders to cure her unhappy state of mindi am sure we mightthat is if you could bring your mind to repose absolute confidence in me  has miss mowbray desired your ladyship to converse with me upon any subject which interests her said the clergyman with more cautious shrewdness than lady penelope had suspected him of possessing i will in that case be happy to hear the nature of her communication and whatever my poor services can perform your ladyship may command them  iii cannot just assert said her ladyship with hesitation that i have miss mowbrays direct instructions to speak to you mr cargill upon the present subject but my affection for the dear girl is so very greatand then you know the inconveniences which may arise from this match  from which match lady penelope said mr cargill  nay now mr cargill you really carry the privilege of scotland too fari have not put a single question to you but what you have answered by anotherlet us converse intelligibly for five minutes if you can but condescend so far  for any length of time which your ladyship may please to command said mr cargill provided the subject regard your ladyships own affairs or minecould i suppose these last for a moment likely to interest you  out upon you said the lady laughing affectedly you should really have been a catholic priest instead of a presbyterian what an invaluable father confessor have the fair sex lost in you mr cargill and how dexterously you would have evaded any crossexaminations which might have committed your penitents  your ladyships raillery is far too severe for me to withstand or reply to said mr cargill bowing with more ease than her ladyship expected and retiring gently backward he extricated himself from a conversation which he began to find somewhat embarrassing  at that moment a murmur of surprise took place in the apartment which was just entered by miss mowbray leaning on her brothers arm the cause of this murmur will be best understood by narrating what had passed betwixt the brother and sister     chapter iii  expostulation      seek not the feast in these irreverent robes     go to my chamberput on clothes of mine  the taming of the shrew   it was with a mixture of anxiety vexation and resentment that mowbray just when he had handed lady penelope into the apartment where the tables were covered observed that his sister was absent and that lady binks was hanging on the arm of lord etherington to whose rank it would properly have fallen to escort the lady of the house an anxious and hasty glance cast through the room ascertained that she was absent nor could the ladies present give any account of her after she had quitted the gardens except that lady penelope had spoken a few words with her in her own apartment immediately after the scenic entertainment was concluded  thither mowbray hurried complaining aloud of his sisters laziness in dressing but internally hoping that the delay was occasioned by nothing of a more important character  he hastened up stairs entered her sittingroom without ceremony and knocking at the door of her dressingroom begged her to make haste  here is the whole company impatient he said assuming a tone of pleasantry and sir bingo binks exclaiming for your presence that he may be let loose on the cold meat  paddock calls said clara from within anonanon  nay it is no jest clara continued her brother for here is lady penelope miauling like a starved cat  i comei come greymalkin answered clara in the same vein as before and entered the parlour as she spoke her finery entirely thrown aside and dressed in the ridinghabit which was her usual and favourite attire  her brother was both surprised and offended on my soul he said clara this is behaving very ill i indulge you in every freak upon ordinary occasions but you might surely on this day of all others have condescended to appear something like my sister and a gentlewoman receiving company in her own house  why dearest john said clara so that the guests have enough to eat and drink i cannot conceive why i should concern myself about their finery or they trouble themselves about my plain clothes  come come clara this will not do answered mowbray you must positively go back into your dressingroom and huddle your things on as fast as you can you cannot go down to the company dressed as you are  i certainly can and i certainly will johni have made a fool of myself once this morning to oblige you and for the rest of the day i am determined to appear in my own dress that is in one which shows i neither belong to the world nor wish to have any thing to do with its fashions  by my soul clara i will make you repent this said mowbray with more violence than he usually exhibited where his sister was concerned  you cannot dear john she coolly replied unless by beating me and that i think you would repent of yourself  i do not know but what it were the best way of managing you said mowbray muttering between his teeth but commanding his violence he only said aloud i am sure from long experience clara that your obstinacy will at the long run beat my anger do let us compound the point for oncekeep your old habit since you are so fond of making a sight of yourself and only throw the shawl round your shouldersit has been exceedingly admired and every woman in the house longs to see it closerthey can hardly believe it genuine  do be a man mowbray answered his sister meddle with your horsesheets and leave shawls alone  do you be a woman clara and think a little on them when custom and decency render it necessarynay is it possiblewill you not stirnot oblige me in such a trifle as this  i would indeed if i could said clara but since you must know the truthdo not be angryi have not the shawl i have given it awaygiven it up perhaps i should say to the rightful ownershe has promised me something or other in exchange for it however i have given it to lady penelope  yes answered mowbray some of the work of her own fair hands i suppose or a couple of her ladyships drawings made up into firescreenson my wordon my soul this is too badit is using me too ill clarafar too ill if the thing had been of no value my giving it to you should have fixed some upon itgoodeven to you we will do as well as we can without you  nay but my dear johnstay but a moment said clara taking his arm as he sullenly turned towards the door there are but two of us on the earthdo not let us quarrel about a trumpery shawl  trumpery said mowbray it cost fifty guineas by g which i can but ill sparetrumpery  o never think of the cost said clara it was your gift and that should i own have been enough to have made me keep to my deaths day the poorest rag of it but really lady penelope looked so very miserable and twisted her poor face into so many odd expressions of anger and chagrin that i resigned it to her and agreed to say she had lent it to me for the performance i believe she was afraid that i would change my mind or that you would resume it as a seignorial waif for after she had walked a few turns with it wrapped around her merely by way of taking possession she dispatched it by a special messenger to her apartment at the well  she may go to the devil said mowbray for a greedy unconscionable jade who has varnished over a selfish spiteful heart that is as hard as a flint with a fine glossing of taste and sensibility  nay but john replied his sister she really had something to complain of in the present case the shawl had been bespoken on her account or very nearly soshe showed me the tradesmans letteronly some agent of yours had come in between with the ready money which no tradesman can resistah john i suspect half of your anger is owing to the failure of a plan to mortify poor lady pen and that she has more to complain of than you havecome come you have had the advantage of her in the first display of this fatal piece of finery if wearing it on my poor shoulders can be called a displayeen make her welcome to the rest for peaces sake and let us go down to these good folks and you shall see how pretty and civil i shall behave  mowbray a spoiled child and with all the petted habits of indulgence was exceedingly fretted at the issue of the scheme which he had formed for mortifying lady penelope but he saw at once the necessity of saying nothing more to his sister on the subject vengeance he privately muttered against lady pen whom he termed an absolute harpy in bluestockings unjustly forgetting that in the very important affair at issue he himself had been the first to interfere with and defeat her ladyships designs on the garment in question  but i will blow her he said i will blow her ladyships conduct in the business she shall not outwit a poor whimsical girl like clara without hearing it on more sides than one  with this christian and gentlemanlike feeling towards lady penelope he escorted his sister into the eatingroom and led her to her proper place at the head of the table it was the negligence displayed in her dress which occasioned the murmur of surprise that greeted clara on her entrance mowbray as he placed his sister in her chair made her general apology for her late appearance and her ridinghabit some fairies he supposed puck or such like tricksy goblin had been in her wardrobe and carried off whatever was fit for wearing  there were answers from every quarterthat it would have been too much to expect miss mowbray to dress for their amusement a second timethat nothing she chose to wear could misbecome miss mowbraythat she had set like the sun in her splendid scenic dress and now rose like the full moon in her ordinary attire this flight was by the reverend mr chatterlyand that miss mowbray being at hame had an unco gude right to please hersell which last piece of politeness being at least as much to the purpose as any that had preceded it was the contribution of honest mrs blower and was replied to by miss mowbray with a particular and most gracious bow  mrs blower ought to have rested her colloquial fame as dr johnson would have said upon a compliment so evidently acceptable but no one knows where to stop she thrust her broad goodnatured delighted countenance forward and sending her voice from the bottom to the top of the table like her umquhile husband when calling to his mate during a breeze wondered why miss clara moubrie didna wear that grand shawl she had on at the playmaking and her just sitting upon the wind of a door nae doubt it was for fear of the soup and the butterboats and the likebut she had three shawls which she really fand was ane ower monyif miss moubrie wad like to wear ane o themit was but imitashion to be surebut it wad keep her shouthers as warm as if it were real indian and if it were dirtied it was the less matter  much obliged mrs blower said mowbray unable to resist the temptation which this speech offered but my sister is not yet of quality sufficient to entitle her to rob her friends of their shawls  lady penelope coloured to the eyes and bitter was the retort that arose to her tongue but she suppressed it and nodding to miss mowbray in the most friendly way in the world yet with a very particular expression she only said so you have told your brother of the little transaction which we have had this morningtu me lo pagheraii give you fair warning take care none of your secrets come into my keepingthats all  upon what mere trifles do the important events of human life sometimes depend if lady penelope had given way to her first movements of resentment the probable issue would have been some such halfcomic halfserious skirmish as her ladyship and mr mowbray had often amused the company withal but revenge which is suppressed and deferred is always most to be dreaded and to the effects of the deliberate resentment which lady penelope cherished upon this trifling occasion must be traced the events which our history has to record secretly did she determine to return the shawl which she had entertained hopes of making her own upon very reasonable terms and as secretly did she resolve to be revenged both upon brother and sister conceiving herself already possessed to a certain degree of a clew to some part of their family history which might serve for a foundation on which to raise her projected battery the ancient offences and emulation of importance of the laird of st ronans and the superiority which had been given to clara in the exhibition of the day combined with the immediate cause of resentment and it only remained for her to consider how her revenge should be most signally accomplished  whilst such thoughts were passing through lady penelopes mind mowbray was searching with his eyes for the earl of etherington judging that it might be proper in the course of the entertainment or before the guests had separated to make him formally acquainted with his sister as a preface to the more intimate connexion which must in prosecution of the plan agreed upon take place betwixt them greatly to his surprise the young earl was no where visible and the place which he had occupied by the side of lady binks had been quietly appropriated by winterblossom as the best and softest chair in the room and nearest to the head of the table where the choicest of the entertainment is usually arranged this honest gentleman after a few insipid compliments to her ladyship upon her performance as queen of the amazons had betaken himself to the much more interesting occupation of ogling the dishes through the glass which hung suspended at his neck by a gold chain of maltese workmanship after looking and wondering for a few seconds mowbray addressed himself to the old beaugar√ßon and asked him what had become of etherington  retreated said winterblossom and left but his compliments to you behind hima complaint i think in his wounded armupon my word that soup has a most appetizing flavourlady penelope shall i have the honour to help younonor you lady binksyou are too crueli must comfort myself like a heathen priest of old by eating the sacrifice which the deities have scorned to accept of  here he helped himself to the plate of soup which he had in vain offered to the ladies and transferred the further duty of dispensing it to mr chatterly it is your profession sir to propitiate the divinitiesahem  i did not think lord etherington would have left us so soon said mowbray but we must do the best we can without his countenance  so saying he assumed his place at the bottom of the table and did his best to support the character of a hospitable and joyous landlord while on her part with much natural grace and delicacy of attention calculated to set every body at their ease his sister presided at the upper end of the board but the vanishing of lord etherington in a manner so sudden and unaccountablethe obvious illhumour of lady penelopeand the steady though passive sullenness of lady binks spread among the company a gloom like that produced by an autumnal mist upon a pleasing landscape the women were lowspirited dull nay peevish they did not well know why and the men could not be joyous though the ready resource of old hock and champagne made some of them talkativelady penelope broke up the party by wellfeigned apprehension of the difficulties nay dangers of returning by so rough a road lady binks begged a seat with her ladyship as sir bingo she said judging from his devotion to the green flask was likely to need their carriage home from the moment of their departure it became bad tone to remain behind and all as in a retreating army were eager to be foremost excepting macturk and a few stanch topers who unused to meet with such good cheer every day of their lives prudently determined to make the most of the opportunity  we will not dwell on the difficulties attending the transportation of a large company by few carriages though the delay and disputes thereby occasioned were of course more intolerable than in the morning for the parties had no longer the hopes of a happy day before them as a bribe to submit to temporary inconvenience the impatience of many was so great that though the evening was raw they chose to go on foot rather than await the dull routine of the returning carriages and as they retired they agreed with one consent to throw the blame of whatever inconvenience they might sustain on their host and hostess who had invited so large a party before getting a shorter and better road made between the well and shawscastle  it would have been so easy to repair the path by the buckstane  and this was all the thanks which mr mowbray received for an entertainment which had cost him so much trouble and expense and had been looked forward to by the good society at the well with such impatient expectation  it was an unco pleasant show said the goodnatured mrs blower only it was a pity it was sae tediousome and there was surely an awfu waste of gauze and muslin  but so well had dr quackleben improved his numerous opportunities that the good lady was much reconciled to affairs in general by the prospect of coughs rheumatisms and other maladies acquired upon the occasion which were likely to afford that learned gentleman in whose prosperity she much interested herself a very profitable harvest  mowbray somewhat addicted to the service of bacchus did not find himself freed by the secession of so large a proportion of the company from the service of the jolly god although upon the present occasion he could well have dispensed with his orgies neither the song nor the pun nor the jest had any power to kindle his heavy spirit mortified as he was by the event of his party being so different from the brilliant consummation which he had anticipated the guests stanch boon companions suffered not however their party to flag for want of the landlords participation but continued to drink bottle after bottle with as little regard for mr mowbrays grave looks as if they had been carousing at the mowbray arms instead of the mowbray mansionhouse midnight at length released him when with an unsteady step he sought his own apartment cursing himself and his companions consigning his own person with all dispatch to his bed and bequeathing those of the company to as many mosses and quagmires as could be found betwixt shawscastle and st ronans well     chapter iv  the proposal      oh you would be a vestal maid i warrant     the bride of heavencomewe may shake your purpose     for here i bring in hand a jolly suitor     hath taen degrees in the seven sciences     that ladies love besthe is young and noble     handsome and valiant gay and rich and liberal  the nun   the morning after a debauch is usually one of reflection even to the most determined boon companion and in the retrospect of the preceding day the young laird of st ronans saw nothing very consolatory unless that the excess was not in the present case of his own seeking but had arisen out of the necessary duties of a landlord or what were considered as such by his companions  but it was not so much his dizzy recollections of the late carouse which haunted him on awakening as the inexplicability which seemed to shroud the purposes and conduct of his new ally the earl of etherington  that young nobleman had seen miss mowbray had declared his high satisfaction had warmly and voluntarily renewed the proposal which he had made ere she was yet known to himand yet far from seeking an opportunity to be introduced to her he had even left the party abruptly in order to avoid the necessary intercourse which must there have taken place between them his lordships flirtation with lady binks had not escaped the attention of the sagacious mowbrayher ladyship also had been in a hurry to leave shawscastle and mowbray promised to himself to discover the nature of this connexion through mrs gingham her ladyships attendant or otherwise vowing deeply at the same time that no peer in the realm should make an affectation of addressing miss mowbray a cloak for another and more secret intrigue but his doubts on this subject were in great measure removed by the arrival of one of lord etheringtons grooms with the following letter      my dear mowbrayyou would naturally be surprised at my escape     from the table yesterday before you returned to it or your lovely     sister had graced it with her presence i must confess my folly and     i may do so the more boldly for as the footing on which i first     opened this treaty was not a very romantic one you will scarce     suspect me of wishing to render it such but i did in reality feel     during the whole of yesterday a reluctance which i cannot express     to be presented to the lady on whose favour the happiness of my     future life is to depend upon such a public occasion and in the     presence of so promiscuous a company i had my mask indeed to wear     while in the promenade but of course that was to be laid aside at     table and consequently i must have gone through the ceremony of     introduction a most interesting moment which i was desirous to     defer till a fitter season i trust you will permit me to call upon     you at shawscastle this morning in the hopethe anxious hopeof     being allowed to pay my duty to miss mowbray and apologize for not     waiting upon her yesterday i expect your answer with the utmost     impatience being always yours c c c  etherington  this said st ronans to himself as he folded the letter deliberately after having twice read it over seems all fair and above board i could not wish any thing more explicit and moreover it puts into black and white as old mick would say what only rested before on our private conversation an especial cure for the headache such a billet as this in a morning  so saying he sat him down and wrote an answer expressing the pleasure he should have in seeing his lordship as soon as he thought proper he watched even the departure of the groom and beheld him gallop off with the speed of one who knows that his quick return was expected by an impatient master  mowbray remained for a few minutes by himself and reflected with delight upon the probable consequences of this matchthe advancement of his sisterand above all the various advantages which must necessarily accrue to himself by so close an alliance with one whom he had good reason to think deep in the secret and capable of rendering him the most material assistance in his speculations on the turf and in the sporting world he then sent a servant to let miss mowbray know that he intended to breakfast with her  i suppose john said clara as her brother entered the apartment you are glad of a weaker cup this morning than those you were drinking last nightyou were carousing till after the first cock  yes said mowbray that sandbed old macturk upon whom whole hogsheads make no impression did make a bad boy of mebut the day is over and they will scarce catch me in such another scrapewhat did you think of the masks  supported as well said clara as such folk support the disguise of gentlemen and ladies during life and that is with a great deal of bustle and very little propriety  i saw only one good mask there and that was a spaniard said her brother  o i saw him too answered clara but he wore his visor on an old indian merchant or some such thing seemed to me a better characterthe spaniard did nothing but stalk about and twangle his guitar for the amusement of my lady binks as i think  he is a very clever fellow though that same spaniard rejoined mowbraycan you guess who he is  no indeed nor shall i take the trouble of trying to set to guessing about it were as bad as seeing the whole mummery over again  well replied her brother you will allow one thing at leastbottom was well actedyou cannot deny that  yes replied clara that worthy really deserved to wear his asss head to the end of the chapterbut what of him  only conceive that he should be the very same person with that handsome spaniard replied mowbray  then there is one fool fewer than i thought there was replied clara with the greatest indifference  her brother bit his lip  clara he said i believe you are an excellent good girl and clever to boot but pray do not set up for wit and oddity there is nothing in life so intolerable as pretending to think differently from other peoplethat gentleman was the earl of etherington  this annunciation though made in what was meant to be an imposing tone had no impression on clara  i hope he plays the peer better than the fidalgo she replied carelessly  yes answered mowbray he is one of the handsomest men of the time and decidedly fashionableyou will like him much when you see him in private  it is of little consequence whether i do or no answered clara  you mistake the matter said mowbray gravely it may be of considerable consequence  indeed said clara with a smile i must suppose myself then too important a person not to make my approbation necessary to one of your firstrates he cannot pretend to pass muster at st ronans without itwell i will depute my authority to lady binks and she shall pass your new recruits instead of me  this is all nonsense clara said mowbray lord etherington calls here this very morning and wishes to be made known to you i expect you will receive him as a particular friend of mine  with all my heartso you will engage after this visit to keep him down with your other particular friends at the wellyou know it is a bargain that you bring neither buck nor pointer into my parlourthe one worries my cat and the other my temper  you mistake me entirely clarathis is a very different visitor from any i have ever introduced to youi expect to see him often here and i hope you and he will be better friends than you think of i have more reasons for wishing this than i have now time to tell you  clara remained silent for an instant then looked at her brother with an anxious and scrutinizing glance as if she wished to penetrate into his inmost purpose  if i thoughtshe said after a minutes consideration and with an altered and disturbed tone but noi will not think that heaven intends me such a blowleast of all that it should come from your hands she walked hastily to the window and threw it openthen shut it again and returned to her seat saying with a constrained smile may heaven forgive you brother but you frightened me heartily  i did not mean to do so clara said mowbray who saw the necessity of soothing her i only alluded in joke to those chances that are never out of other girls heads though you never seem to calculate on them  i wish you my dear john said clara struggling to regain entire composure i wish you would profit by my example and give up the science of chance alsoit will not avail you  how dye know thatill show you the contrary you silly wench answered mowbrayhere is a bankers bill payable to your own order for the cash you lent me and something overdont let old mick have the fingering but let bindloose manage it for youhe is the honester man between two dd knaves  will not you brother send it to the man bindloose yourself  nono replied mowbrayhe might confuse it with some of my transactions and so you forfeit your stake  well i am glad you are able to pay me for i want to buy campbells new work  i wish you joy of your purchasebut dont scratch me for not caring about iti know as little of books as you of the long odds and come now be serious and tell me if you will be a good girllay aside your whims and receive this english young nobleman like a lady as you are  that were easy said clarabutbutpray ask no more of me than just to see himsay to him at once i am a poor creature in body in mind in spirits in temper in understandingabove all say that i can receive him only once  i shall say no such thing said mowbray bluntly it is good to be plain with you at oncei thought of putting off this discussionbut since it must come the sooner it is over the betteryou are to understand clara mowbray that lord etherington has a particular view in this visit and that his view has my full sanction and approbation  i thought so said clara in the same altered tone of voice in which she had before spoken my mind foreboded this last of misfortunesbut mowbray you have no child before youi neither will nor can see this nobleman  how exclaimed mowbray fiercely do you dare return me so peremptory an answerthink better of it for if we differ you will find you will have the worst of the game  rely upon it she continued with more vehemence i will see him nor no man upon the footing you mentionmy resolution is taken and threats and entreaties will prove equally unavailing  upon my word madam said mowbray you have for a modest and retired young lady plucked up a goodly spirit of your ownbut you shall find mine equals it if you do not agree to see my friend lord etherington ay and to receive him with the politeness due to the consideration i entertain for him by heaven clara i will no longer regard you as my fathers daughter think what you are giving upthe affection and protection of a brotherand for whatmerely for an idle point of etiquetteyou cannot i suppose even in the workings of your romantic brain imagine that the days of clarissa harlowe and harriet byron are come back again when women were married by main force and it is monstrous vanity in you to suppose that lord etherington since he has honoured you with any thoughts at all will not be satisfied with a proper and civil refusalyou are no such prize methinks that the days of romance are to come back for you  i care not what days they are said clarai tell you i will not see lord etherington or any one else upon such preliminaries as you have statedi cannoti will notand i ought nothad you meant me to receive him which can be a matter of no consequence whatever you should have left him on the footing of an ordinary visitoras it is i will not see him  you shall see and hear him both said mowbray you shall find me as obstinate as you areas willing to forget i am a brother as you to forget that you have one  it is time then replied clara that this house once our fathers should no longer hold us both i can provide for myself and may god bless you  you take it coolly madam said her brother walking through the apartment with much anxiety both of look and gesture  i do she answered for it is what i have often foreseenyes brother i have often foreseen that you would make your sister the subject of your plots and schemes so soon as other stakes failed you that hour is come and i am as you see prepared to meet it  and where may you propose to retire to said mowbray i think that i your only relation and natural guardian have a right to know thatmy honour and that of my family is concerned  your honour she retorted with a keen glance at him your interest i suppose you mean is somehow connected with the place of my abodebut keep yourself patientthe den of the rock the linn of the brook should be my choice rather than a palace without my freedom  you are mistaken however said mowbray sternly if you hope to enjoy more freedom than i think you capable of making a good use of the law authorizes and reason and even affection require that you should be put under restraint for your own safety and that of your character you roamed the woods a little too much in my fathers time if all stories be true  i didi did indeed mowbray said clara weeping god pity me and forgive you for upbraiding me with my state of mindi know i cannot sometimes trust my own judgment but is it for you to remind me of this  mowbray was at once softened and embarrassed  what folly is this he said you say the most cutting things to meare ready to fly from my houseand when i am provoked to make an angry answer you burst into tears  say you did not mean what you said my dearest brother exclaimed clara o say you did not mean itdo not take my liberty from meit is all i have left and god knows it is a poor comfort in the sorrows i undergo i will put a fair face on every thingwill go down to the wellwill wear what you please and say what you pleasebut o leave me the liberty of my solitude herelet me weep alone in the house of my fatherand do not force a brokenhearted sister to lay her death at your doormy span must be a brief one but let not your hand shake the sandglassdisturb me notlet me pass quietlyi do not ask this so much for my sake as for your own i would have you think of me sometimes mowbray after i am gone and without the bitter reflections which the recollection of harsh usage will assuredly bring with it pity me were it but for your own sakei have deserved nothing but compassion at your handthere are but two of us on earth why should we make each other miserable  she accompanied these entreaties with a flood of tears and the most heartbursting sobs mowbray knew not what to determine on the one hand he was bound by his promise to the earl on the other his sister was in no condition to receive such a visitor nay it was most probable that if he adopted the strong measure of compelling her to receive him her behaviour would probably be such as totally to break off the projected match on the success of which he had founded so many castles in the air in this dilemma he had again recourse to argument  clara he said i am as i have repeatedly said your only relation and guardianif there be any real reason why you ought not to receive and at least make a civil reply to such a negotiation as the earl of etherington has thought fit to open surely i ought to be intrusted with it you enjoyed far too much of that liberty which you seem to prize so highly during my fathers lifetimein the last years of it at leasthave you formed any foolish attachment during that time which now prevents you from receiving such a visit as lord etherington has threatened  threatenedthe expression is well chosen said miss mowbray and nothing can be more dreadful than such a threat excepting its accomplishment  i am glad your spirits are reviving replied her brother but that is no answer to my question  is it necessary said clara that one must have actually some engagement or entanglement to make them unwilling to be given in marriage or even to be pestered upon such a subjectmany young men declare they intend to die bachelors why may not i be permitted to commence old maid at threeandtwentylet me do so like a kind brother and there were never nephews and nieces so petted and so scolded so nursed and so cuffed by a maiden aunt as your children when you have them shall be by aunt clara  and why not say all this to lord etherington said mowbray wait until he propose such a terrible bugbear as matrimony before you refuse to receive him who knows the whim that he hinted at may have passed awayhe was as you say flirting with lady binks and her ladyship has a good deal of address as well as beauty  heaven improve both in an honest way if she will but keep his lordship to herself said clara  well then continued her brother things standing thus i do not think you will have much trouble with his lordshipno more perhaps than just to give him a civil denial after having spoken on such a subject to a man of my condition he cannot well break off without you give him an apology  if that is all said clara he shall as soon as he gives me an opportunity receive such an answer as will leave him at liberty to woo any one whatsoever of eves daughters excepting clara mowbray methinks i am so eager to set the captive free that i now wish as much for his lordships appearance as i feared it a little while since  nay nay but let us go fair and softly said her brother you are not to refuse him before he asks the question  certainly said clara but i well know how to manage thathe shall never ask the question at all i will restore lady binkss admirer without accepting so much as a civility in ransom  worse and worse clara answered mowbray you are to remember he is my friend and guest and he must not be affronted in my house leave things to themselvesbesides consider an instant clarahad you not better take a little time for reflection in this case the offer is a splendid onetitlefortuneand what is more a fortune which you will be well entitled to share largely in  this is beyond our implied treaty said clara i have yielded more than ever i thought i should have done when i agreed that this earl should be introduced to me on the footing of a common visitor and now you talk favourably of his pretensions this is an encroachment mowbray and now i shall relapse into my obstinacy and refuse to see him at all  do as you will replied mowbray sensible that it was only by working on her affections that he had any chance of carrying a point against her inclinationdo as you will my dear clara but for heavens sake wipe your eyes  and behave myself said she trying to smile as she obeyed himbehave myself you would say like folks of this world but the quotation is lost on you who never read either prior or shakspeare  i thank heaven for that said mowbray i have enough to burden my brain without carrying such a lumber of rhymes in it as you and lady pen docome that is right go to the mirror and make yourself decent  a woman must be much borne down indeed by pain and suffering when she loses all respect for her external appearance the madwoman in bedlam wears her garland of straw with a certain air of pretension and we have seen a widow whom we knew to be most sincerely affected by a recent deprivation whose weeds nevertheless were arranged with a dolorous degree of grace which amounted almost to coquetry clara mowbray had also negligent as she seemed to be of appearances her own art of the toilet although of the most rapid and most simple character she took off her little ridinghat and unbinding a lace of indian gold which retained her locks shook them in dark and glossy profusion over her very handsome form which they overshadowed down to her slender waist and while her brother stood looking on her with a mixture of pride affection and compassion she arranged them with a large comb and without the assistance of any femme datours wove them in the course of a few minutes into such a natural headdress as we see on the statues of the grecian nymphs  now let me but find my best muff she said come prince and peer i shall be ready to receive them  pshaw your muffwho has heard of such a thing these twenty years muffs were out of fashion before you were born  no matter john replied his sister when a woman wears a muff especially a determined old maid like myself it is a sign she has no intentions to scratch and therefore the muff serves all the purposes of a white flag and prevents the necessity of drawing on a glove so prudentially recommended by the motto of our cousins the mintoshesii4  be it as you will then said mowbray for other than you do will it you will not suffer it to bebut how is thisanother billetwe are in request this morning  now heaven send his lordship may have judiciously considered all the risks which he is sure to encounter on this charmed ground and resolved to leave his adventure unattempted said miss mowbray  her brother glanced a look of displeasure at her as he broke the seal of the letter which was addressed to him with the words haste and secrecy written on the envelope the contents which greatly surprised him we remit to the commencement of the next chapter  footnote  ii4 the well known crest of this ancient race is a cat rampant with a motto bearing the cautiontouch not the cat but ie be out or without the glove     chapter v  private information      ope this letter     i can produce a champion that will prove     what is avouched there  king lear   the billet which mowbray received and read in his sisters presence contained these words      sirclara mowbray has few friendsnone perhaps excepting     yourself in right of blood and the writer of this letter by right     of the fondest truest and most disinterested attachment that ever     man bore to woman i am thus explicit with you because though it     is unlikely that i should ever again see or speak to your sister i     am desirous that you should be clearly acquainted with the cause of     that interest which i must always even to my dying breath take in     her affairs      the person calling himself lord etherington is i am aware in     the neighbourhood of shawscastle with the intention of paying his     addresses to miss mowbray and it is easy for me to foresee arguing     according to the ordinary views of mankind that he may place his     proposals in such a light as may make them seem highly desirable     but ere you give this person the encouragement which his offers may     seem to deserve please to enquire whether his fortune is certain     or his rank indisputable and be not satisfied with light evidence     on either point a man may be in possession of an estate and title     to which he has no better right than his own rapacity and     forwardness of assumption and supposing mr mowbray jealous as he     must be of the honour of his family the alliance of such a one     cannot but bring disgrace this comes from one who will make good     what he has written  on the first perusal of a billet so extraordinary mowbray was inclined to set it down to the malice of some of the people at the well anonymous letters being no uncommon resource of the small wits who frequent such places of general resort as a species of deception safely and easily executed and well calculated to produce much mischief and confusion but upon closer consideration he was shaken in this opinion and starting suddenly from the reverie into which he had fallen asked for the messenger who had brought the letter he was in the hall the servant thought and mowbray ran to the hall nothe messenger was not there but mowbray might see his back as he walked up the avenuehe hollodno answer was returnedhe ran after the fellow whose appearance was that of a countryman the man quickened his pace as he saw himself pursued and when he got out of the avenue threw himself into one of the numerous bypaths which wanderers who strayed in quest of nuts or for the sake of exercise had made in various directions through the extensive copse which surrounded the castle and were doubtless the reason of its acquiring the name of shaws which signifies in the scottish dialect a wood of this description  irritated by the mans obvious desire to avoid him and naturally obstinate in all his resolutions mowbray pursued for a considerable way until he fairly lost breath and the flier having been long out of sight he recollected at length that his engagement with the earl of etherington required his attendance at the castle  the young lord indeed had arrived at shawscastle so few minutes after mowbrays departure that it was wonderful they had not met in the avenue the servant to whom he applied conceiving that his master must return instantly as he had gone out without his hat ushered the earl without farther ceremony into the breakfastroom where clara was seated upon one of the windowseats so busily employed with a book or perhaps with her own thoughts while she held a book in her hands that she scarce raised her head until lord etherington advancing pronounced the words miss mowbray a start and a loud scream announced her deadly alarm and these were repeated as he made one pace nearer and in a firmer accent said clara  no nearerno nearer she exclaimed if you would have me look upon you and live lord etherington remained standing as if uncertain whether to advance or retreat while with incredible rapidity she poured out her hurried entreaties that he would begone sometimes addressing him as a real personage sometimes and more frequently as a delusive phantom the offspring of her own excited imagination i knew it she muttered i knew what would happen if my thoughts were forced into that fearful channelspeak to me brother speak to me while i have reason left and tell me that what stands before me is but an empty shadow but it is no shadowit remains before me in all the lineaments of mortal substance  clara said the earl with a firm yet softened voice collect and compose yourself i am indeed no shadowi am a muchinjured man come to demand rights which have been unjustly withheld from me i am now armed with power as well as justice and my claims shall be heard  nevernever replied clara mowbray since extremity is my portion let extremity give me courageyou have no rightsnonei know you not and i defy you  defy me not clara mowbray answered the earl in a tone and with a manner how different from those which delighted society for now he was solemn tragic and almost stern like the judge when he passes sentence upon a criminal defy me not he repeated i am your fate and it rests with you to make me a kind or severe one  dare you speak thus said clara her eyes flashing with anger while her lips grew white and quivered for feardare you speak thus and remember that the same heaven is above our heads to which you so solemnly vowed you would never see me more without my own consent  that vow was conditionalfrancis tyrrel as he calls himself swore the samehath he not seen you he fixed a piercing look on her he hasyou dare not disown itand shall an oath which to him is but a cobweb be to me a shackle of iron  alas it was but for a moment said miss mowbray sinking in courage and drooping her head as she spoke  were it but the twentieth part of an instantthe least conceivable space of subdivided timestill you did meethe saw youyou spoke to him and me also you must seeme also you must hear or i will first claim you for my own in the face of the world and having vindicated my rights i will seek out and extinguish the wretched rival who has dared to interfere with them  can you speak thus said claracan you so burst through the ties of naturehave you a heart  i have and it shall be moulded like wax to your slightest wishes if you agree to do me justice but not granite nor aught else that nature has of hardest will be more inflexible if you continue an useless oppositionclara mowbray i am your fate  not so proud man said clara rising god gave not one potsherd the power to break another save by his divine permissionmy fate is in the will of him without whose will even a sparrow falls not to the groundbegonei am strong in faith of heavenly protection  do you speak thus in sincerity said the earl of etherington consider first what is the prospect before you i stand here in no doubtful or ambiguous characteri offer not the mere name of a husbandpropose to you not a humble lot of obscurity and hardship with fears for the past and doubts for the future yet there was a time when to a suit like this you could listen favourablyi stand high among the nobles of the country and offer you as my bride your share in my honours and in the wealth which becomes themyour brother is my friend and favours my suit i will raise from the ground and once more render illustrious your ancient houseyour motions shall be regulated by your wishes even by your capricesi will even carry my selfdenial so far that you shall should you insist on so severe a measure have your own residence your own establishment and without intrusion on my part until the most devoted love the most unceasing attentions shall make way on your inflexible dispositionall this i will consent to for the futureall that is past shall be concealed from the publicbut mine clara mowbray you must be  nevernever she said with increasing vehemence i can but repeat a negative but it shall have all the force of an oathyour rank is nothing to meyour fortune i scornmy brother has no right by the law of scotland or of nature to compel my inclinationsi detest your treachery and i scorn the advantage you propose to attain by itshould the law give you my hand it would but award you that of a corpse  alas clara said the earl you do but flutter in the net but i will urge you no farther nowthere is another encounter before me  he was turning away when clara springing forward caught him by the arm and repeated in a low and impressive voice the commandmentthou shalt do no murder  fear not any violence he said softening his voice and attempting to take her hand but what may flow from your own severityfrancis is safe from me unless you are altogether unreasonableallow me but what you cannot deny to any friend of your brother the power of seeing you at timessuspend at least the impetuosity of your dislike to me and i will on my part modify the current of my just and otherwise uncontrollable resentment  clara extricating herself and retreating from him only replied there is a heaven above us and there shall be judged our actions towards each other you abuse a power most treacherously obtainedyou break a heart that never did you wrongyou seek an alliance with a wretch who only wishes to be wedded to her graveif my brother brings you hither i cannot help itand if your coming prevents bloody and unnatural violence it is so far wellbut by my consent you come not and were the choice mine i would rather be struck with lifelong blindness than that my eyes should again open on your personrather that my ears were stuffed with the earth of the grave than that they should again hear your voice  the earl of etherington smiled proudly and replied even this madam i can hear without resentment anxious and careful as you are to deprive your compliance of every grace and of every kindness i receive the permission to wait on you as i interpret your words  do not so interpret them she replied i do but submit to your presence as an unavoidable evil heaven be my witness that were it not to prevent greater and more desperate evil i would not even so far acquiesce  let acquiescence then be the word he said and so thankful will i be even for your acquiescence miss mowbray that all shall remain private which i conceive you do not wish to be disclosed and unless absolutely compelled to it in selfdefence you may rely no violence will be resorted to by me in any quarteri relieve you from my presence  so saying he withdrew from the apartment     chapter vi  explanatory      by your leave gentle wax  shakspeare   in the hall of shawscastle the earl of etherington met mowbray returned from his fruitless chase after the bearer of the anonymous epistle before recited and who had but just learned on his return that the earl of etherington was with his sister there was a degree of mutual confusion when they met for mowbray had the contents of the anonymous letter fresh in his mind and lord etherington notwithstanding all the coolness which he had endeavoured to maintain had not gone through the scene with clara without discomposure mowbray asked the earl whether he had seen his sister and invited him at the same time to return to the parlour and his lordship replied in a tone as indifferent as he could assume that he had enjoyed the honour of the ladys company for several minutes and would not now intrude farther upon miss mowbrays patience  you have had such a reception as was agreeable my lord i trust said mowbray i hope clara did the honours of the house with propriety during my absence  miss mowbray seemed a little fluttered with my sudden appearance said the earl the servant showed me in rather abruptly and circumstanced as we were there is always awkwardness in a first meeting where there is no third party to act as master of the ceremoniesi suspect from the ladys looks that you have not quite kept my secret my good friend i myself too felt a little consciousness in approaching miss mowbraybut it is over now and the ice being fairly broken i hope to have other and more convenient opportunities to improve the advantage i have just gained in acquiring your lovely sisters personal acquaintance  so be it said mowbray but as you declare for leaving the castle just now i must first speak a single word with your lordship for which this place is not altogether convenient  i can have no objections my dear jack said etherington following him with a thrill of conscious feeling somewhat perhaps like that of the spider when he perceives his deceitful web is threatened with injury and sits balanced in the centre watching every point and uncertain which he may be called upon first to defend such is one part and not the slightest part of the penance which never fails to wait on those who abandoning the fair play of the world endeavour to work out their purposes by a process of deception and intrigue  my lord said mowbray when they had entered a little apartment in which the latter kept his guns fishingtackle and other implements of sport you have played on the square with me nay morei am bound to allow you have given me great odds i am therefore not entitled to hear any reports to the prejudice of your lordships character without instantly communicating them there is an anonymous letter which i have just received perhaps your lordship may know the hand and thus be enabled to detect the writer  i do know the hand said the earl as he received the note from mowbray and allow me to say it is the only one which could have dared to frame any calumny to my prejudice i hope mr mowbray it is impossible for you to consider this infamous charge as any thing but a falsehood  my placing it in your lordships hands without farther enquiry is a sufficient proof that i hold it such my lord at the same time that i cannot doubt for a moment that your lordship has it in your power to overthrow so frail a calumny by the most satisfactory evidence  unquestionably i can mr mowbray said the earl for besides my being in full possession of the estate and title of my father the late earl of etherington i have my fathers contract of marriage my own certificate of baptism and the evidence of the whole country to establish my right all these shall be produced with the least delay possible you will not think it surprising that one does not travel with this sort of documents in ones postchaise  certainly not my lord said mowbray it is sufficient they are forthcoming when called for but may i enquire my lord who the writer of this letter is and whether he has any particular spleen to gratify by this very impudent assertion which is so easily capable of being disproved  he is said etherington or at least has the reputation of being i am sorry to say a neara very near relation of my ownin fact a brother by the fathers side but illegitimatemy father was fond of himi loved him also for he has uncommonly fine parts and is accounted highly accomplished but there is a strain of something irregular in his minda vein in short of madness which breaks out in the usual manner rendering the poor young man a dupe to vain imaginations of his own dignity and grandeur which is perhaps the most ordinary effect of insanity and inspiring the deepest aversion against his nearest relatives and against myself in particular he is a man extremely plausible both in speech and manners so much so that many of my friends think there is more vice than insanity in the irregularities which he commits but i may i hope be forgiven if i have formed a milder judgment of one supposed to be my fathers son indeed i cannot help being sorry for poor frank who might have made a very distinguished figure in the world  may i ask the gentlemans name my lord said mowbray  my fathers indulgence gave him our family name of tyrrel with his own christian name francis but his proper name to which alone he has a right is martigny  francis tyrrel exclaimed mowbray why that is the name of the very person who made some disturbance at the well just before your lordship arrivedyou may have seen an advertisementa sort of placard  i have mr mowbray said the earl spare me on that subject if you pleaseit has formed a strong reason why i did not mention my connexion with this unhappy man before but it is no unusual thing for persons whose imaginations are excited to rush into causeless quarrels and then to make discreditable retreats from them  or said mr mowbray he may have after all been prevented from reaching the place of rendezvousit was that very day on which your lordship i think received your wound and if i mistake not you hit the man from whom you got the hurt  mowbray said lord etherington lowering his voice and taking him by the arm it is true that i did soand truly glad i am to observe that whatever might have been the consequences of such an accident they cannot have been seriousit struck me afterwards that the man by whom i was so strangely assaulted had some resemblance to the unfortunate tyrrelbut i had not seen him for yearsat any rate he cannot have been much hurt since he is now able to resume his intrigues to the prejudice of my character  your lordship views the thing with a firm eye said mowbray firmer than i think most people would be able to command who had so narrow a chance of a scrape so uncomfortable  why i am in the first place by no means sure that the risk existed said the earl of etherington for as i have often told you i had but a very transient glimpse of the ruffian and in the second place i am sure that no permanent bad consequences have ensued i am too old a foxhunter to be afraid of a leap after it is cleared as they tell of the fellow who fainted in the morning at the sight of the precipice he had clambered over when he was drunk on the night before the man who wrote that letter touching it with his finger is alive and able to threaten me and if he did come to any hurt from my hand it was in the act of attempting my life of which i shall carry the mark to my grave  nay i am far from blaming your lordship said mowbray for what you did in selfdefence but the circumstance might have turned out very unpleasantmay i ask what you intend to do with this unfortunate gentleman who is in all probability in the neighbourhood  i must first discover the place of his retreat said lord etherington and then consider what is to be done both for his safety poor fellow and my own it is probable too that he may find sharpers to prey upon what fortune he still possesses which i assure you is sufficient to attract a set of folk who may ruin while they humour himmay i beg that you too will be on the outlook and let me know if you hear or see more of him  i shall most certainly my lord answered mowbray but the only one of his haunts which i know is the old cleikum inn where he chose to take up his residence he has now left it but perhaps the old crabfish of a landlady may know something of him  i will not fail to enquire said lord etherington and with these words he took a kind farewell of mowbray mounted his horse and rode up the avenue  a cool fellow said mowbray as he looked after him a dd cool fellow this brotherinlaw of mine that is to betakes a shot at his fathers son with as little remorse as at a blackcockwhat would he do with me were we to quarrelwell i can snuff a candle and strike out the ace of hearts and so should things go wrong he has no jack raw to deal with but jack mowbray  meanwhile the earl of etherington hastened home to his own apartments at the hotel and not entirely pleased with the events of the day commenced a letter to his correspondent agent and confidant captain jekyl which we have fortunately the means of presenting to our readers      friend harrythey say a falling house is best known by the rats     leaving ita falling state by the desertion of confederates and     alliesand a falling man by the desertion of his friends if this     be true augury your last letter may be considered as ominous of my     breaking down methinks you have gone far enough and shared deep     enough with me to have some confidence in my savoir fairesome     little faith both in my means and management what crossgrained     fiend has at once inspired you with what i suppose you wish me to     call politic doubts and scruples of conscience but which i can only     regard as symptoms of fear and disaffection you can have no idea of     duels betwixt relations so nearly connectedand the affair seems     very delicate and intricateand again the matter has never been     fully explained to youand moreover if you are expected to take     an active part in the business it must be when you are honoured     with my full and unreserved confidence otherwise how could you be     of the use to me which i might require such are your expressions      now as to scruples of conscience about near relations and so     forth all that has blown by without much mischief and certainly is     not likely to occur againbesides did you never hear of friends     quarrelling before and are they not to exercise the usual     privileges of gentlemen when they do moreover how am i to know     that this plaguy fellow is actually related to methey say it is     a wise child knows its own father and i cannot be expected wise     enough to know to a certainty my fathers sonso much for     relationshipthen as to full and unreserved confidencewhy     harry this is just as if i were to ask you to look at a watch and     tell what it was oclock and you were to reply that truly you     could not inform me because you had not examined the springs the     counterbalances the wheels and the whole internal machinery of     the little timepiecebut the upshot of the whole is this harry     jekyl who is as sharp a fellow as any other thinks he has his     friend lord etherington at a dead lock and that he knows already so     much of the said noble lords history as to oblige his lordship to     tell him the whole and perhaps he not unreasonably concludes that     the custody of a whole secret is more creditable and probably more     lucrative than that of a half one and in shorthe is resolved     to make the most of the cards in his hand another mine honest     harry would take the trouble to recall to your mind past times and     circumstances and conclude with expressing a humble opinion that     if harry jekyl were asked now to do any service for the noble lord     aforesaid harry had got his reward in his pocket aforehand but i     do not argue thus because i would rather be leagued with a friend     who assists me with a view to future profit than from respect to     benefits already received the first lies like the foxs scent when     on his last legs increasing every moment the other is a     backscent growing colder the longer you follow it until at last     it becomes impossible to puzzle it out i will therefore submit to     circumstances and tell you the whole story though somewhat     tedious in hopes that i can conclude with such a trail as you will     open upon breasthigh      thus then it wasfrancis fifth earl of etherington and my     muchhonoured father was what is called a very eccentric manthat     is he was neither a wise man nor a foolhad too much sense to walk     into a well and yet in some of the furious fits which he was     visited with i have seen him quite mad enough to throw any one     else into itmen said there was a lurking insanitybut it is an     ill bird c and i will say no more about it this shatterbrained     peer was in other respects a handsome accomplished man with an     expression somewhat haughty yet singularly pleasing when he chose     ita man in short who might push his fortune with the fair sex      lord etherington such as i have described him being upon his     travels in france formed an attachment of the heartay and some     have pretended of the hand also with a certain beautiful orphan     marie de martigny of this union is said to have sprung for i am     determined not to be certain on that point that most incommodious     person francis tyrrel as he calls himself but as i would rather     call him francis martigny the latter suiting my views as perhaps     the former name agrees better with his pretensions now i am too     good a son to subscribe to the alleged regularity of the marriage     between my right honourable and very good lord father because my     said right honourable and very good lord did on his return to     england become wedded in the face of the church to my very     affectionate and wellendowed mother ann bulmer of bulmerhall     from which happy union sprung i francis valentine bulmer tyrrel     lawful inheritor of my father and mothers joint estates as i was     the proud possessor of their ancient names but the noble and     wealthy pair though blessed with such a pledge of love as myself     lived mighty ill together and the rather when my right honourable     father sending for this other sosia this unlucky francis tyrrel     senior from france insisted in the face of propriety that he     should reside in his house and share in all respects in the     opportunities of education by which the real sosia francis     valentine bulmer tyrrel then commonly called lord oakendale hath     profited in such an uncommon degree      various were the matrimonial quarrels which arose between the     honoured lord and lady in consequence of this unseemly conjunction     of the legitimate and illegitimate and to these we the subjects     of the dispute were sometimes very properly as well as decorously     made the witnesses on one occasion my right honourable mother who     was a freespoken lady found the language of her own rank quite     inadequate to express the strength of her generous feelings and     borrowing from the vulgar two emphatic words applied them to marie     de martigny and her son francis tyrrel never did earl that ever     wore coronet fly into a pitch of more uncontrollable rage than did     my right honourable father and in the ardour of his reply he     adopted my mothers phraseology to inform her that if there was     a whore and bastard connected with his house it was herself and her     brat      i was even then a sharp little fellow and was incredibly struck     with the communication which in this hour of ungovernable     irritation had escaped my right honourable father it is true he     instantly gathered himself up again and he perhaps recollecting     such a word as bigamy and my mother on her side considering the     consequences of such a thing as a descent from the countess of     etherington into mrs bulmer neither wife maid nor widow there     was an apparent reconciliation between them which lasted for some     time but the speech remained deeply imprinted on my remembrance     the more so that once when i was exerting over my friend francis     tyrrel the authority of a legitimate brother and lord oakendale     old cecil my fathers confidential valet was so much scandalized     as to intimate a possibility that we might one day change     conditions these two accidental communications seemed to me a key     to certain long lectures with which my father used to regale us     boys but me in particular upon the extreme mutability of human     affairsthe disappointment of the bestgrounded hopes and     expectationsand the necessity of being so accomplished in all     useful branches of knowledge as might in case of accidents supply     any defalcation in our rank and fortuneas if any art or science     could make amends for the loss of an earldom and twelve thousand     ayear all this prosing seemed to my anxious mind designed to     prepare me for some unfortunate change and when i was old enough to     make such private enquiries as lay in my power i became still more     persuaded that my right honourable father nourished some thoughts of     making an honest woman of marie de martigny and a legitimate elder     brother of francis after his death at least if not during his     life i was the more convinced of this when a little affair which     i chanced to have with the daughter of my tu drew down my     fathers wrath upon me in great abundance and occasioned my being     banished to scotland along with my brother under a very poor     allowance without introductions except to one steady or call it     rusty old professor and with the charge that i should not assume     the title of lord oakendale but content myself with my maternal     grandfathers name of valentine bulmer that of francis tyrrel being     preoccupied      upon this occasion notwithstanding the fear which i entertained of     my fathers passionate temper i did venture to say that since i     was to resign my title i thought i had a right to keep my family     name and that my brother might take his mothers i wish you had     seen the look of rage with which my father regarded me when i gave     him this spirited hint thou art he said and paused as if to     find out the bitterest epithet to supply the blankthou art thy     mothers child and her perfect picturethis seemed the severest     reproach that occurred to himbear her name then and bear it     with patience and in secrecy or i here give you my word you shall     never bear another the whole days of your life this sealed my     mouth with a witness and then in allusion to my flirtation with     the daughter of my tu aforesaid he enlarged on the folly and     iniquity of private marriages warned me that in the country i was     going to the matrimonial noose often lies hid under flowers and     that folks find it twitched round their neck when they least expect     such a cravat assured me that he had very particular views for     settling francis and me in life and that he would forgive neither     of us who should by any such rash entanglements render them     unavailing      this last minatory admonition was the more tolerable that my rival     had his share of it and so we were bundled off to scotland coupled     up like two pointers in a dogcart andi can speak for one at     leastwith much the same uncordial feelings towards each other i     often indeed detected francis looking at me with a singular     expression as of pity and anxiety and once or twice he seemed     disposed to enter on something respecting the situation in which we     stood towards each other but i felt no desire to encourage his     confidence meantime as we were called by our fathers directions     not brothers but cousins so we came to bear towards each other the     habits of companionship though scarcely of friendship what francis     thought i know not for my part i must confess that i lay by on     the watch for some opportunity when i might mend my own situation     with my father though at the prejudice of my rival and fortune     while she seemed to prevent such an opportunity involved us both in     one of the strangest and most entangled mazes that her capricious     divinityship ever wove and out of which i am even now struggling     by sleight or force to extricate myself i can hardly help     wondering even yet at the odd conjunction which has produced such     an intricacy of complicated incidents      my father was a great sportsman and francis and i had both     inherited his taste for fieldsports but i in a keener and more     ecstatic degree edinburgh which is a tolerable residence in winter     and spring becomes disagreeable in summer and in autumn is the     most melancholy sejour that ever poor mortals were condemned to     no public places are open no inhabitant of any consideration     remains in the town those who cannot get away hide themselves in     obscure corners as if ashamed to be seen in the streets the gentry     go to their countryhousesthe citizens to their seabathing     quartersthe lawyers to their circuitsthe writers to visit their     country clientsand all the world to the moors to shoot grouse we     who felt the indignity of remaining in town during this deserted     season obtained with some difficulty permission from the earl to     betake ourselves to any obscure corner and shoot grouse if we     could get leave to do so on our general character of english     students at the university of edinburgh without quoting any thing     more      the first year of our banishment we went to the neighbourhood of     the highlands but finding our sport interrupted by gamekeepers and     their gillies on the second occasion we established ourselves at     this little village of st ronans where there were then no spa no     fine people no card tables no quizzes excepting the old quiz of a     landlady with whom we lodged we found the place much to our mind     the old landlady had interest with some old fellow agent of a     nonresiding nobleman who gave us permission to sport over his     moors of which i availed myself keenly and francis with more     moderation he was indeed of a grave musing sort of habit and     often preferred solitary walks in the wild and beautiful scenery     with which the village is surrounded to the use of the gun he was     attached to fishing moreover that dullest of human amusements and     this also tended to keep us considerably apart this gave me rather     pleasure than concernnot that i hated francis at that time nay     not that i greatly disliked his society but merely because it was     unpleasant to be always with one whose fortunes i looked upon as     standing in direct opposition to my own i also rather despised the     indifference about sport which indeed seemed to grow upon him but     my gentleman had better taste than i was aware of if he sought no     grouse on the hill he had flushed a pheasant in the wood      clara mowbray daughter of the lord of the more picturesque than     wealthy domain of st ronans was at that time scarce sixteen years     old and as wild and beautiful a woodland nymph as the imagination     can fancysimple as a child in all that concerned the world and its     ways acute as a needle in every point of knowledge which she had     found an opportunity of becoming acquainted with fearing harm from     no one and with a lively and natural strain of wit which brought     amusement and gaiety wherever she came her motions were under no     restraint save that of her own inclination for her father though     a cross peevish old man was confined to his chair with the gout     and her only companion a girl of somewhat inferior caste bred up     in the utmost deference to miss mowbrays fancies served for     company indeed in her strolls through the wild country on foot and     on horseback but never thought of interfering with her will and     pleasure      the extreme loneliness of the country at that time and the     simplicity of its inhabitants seemed to render these excursions     perfectly safe francis happy dog became the companion of the     damsels on such occasions through the following accident miss     mowbray had dressed herself and her companion like country wenches     with a view to surprise the family of one of their better sort of     farmers they had accomplished their purpose greatly to their     satisfaction and were hying home after sunset when they were     encountered by a country fellowa sort of harry jekyl in his     waywho being equipped with a glass or two of whisky saw not the     nobility of blood through her disguise and accosted the daughter of     a hundred sires as he would have done a ewemilker miss mowbray     remonstratedher companion screamedup came cousin francis with a     fowlingpiece on his shoulder and soon put the sylvan to flight      this was the beginning of an acquaintance which had gone great     lengths before i found it out the fair clara it seems found it     safer to roam in the woods with an escort than alone and my     studious and sentimental relative was almost her constant companion     at their age it was likely that some time might pass ere they came     to understand each other but full confidence and intimacy was     established between them ere i heard of their amour      and here harry i must pause till next morning and send you the     conclusion under a separate cover the rap which i had over the     elbow the other day is still tingling at the end of my fingers and     you must not be critical with my manuscript      chapter vii  letter continued      must i then ravel out     my weavedup follies  shakspeare       i resume my pen harry to mention without attempting to describe     my surprise that francis compelled by circumstances made me the     confidant of his loveintrigue my grave cousin in love and very     much in the mind of approaching the perilous verge of clandestine     marriagehe who used every now and then not much to the     improvement of our cordial regard to lecture me upon filial duty     just upon the point of slipping the bridle himself i could not for     my life tell whether surprise or a feeling of mischievous     satisfaction was predominant i tried to talk to him as he used to     talk to me but i had not the gift of persuasion or he the power of     understanding the words of wisdom he insisted our situation was     differentthat his unhappy birth as he termed it freed him at     least from dependence on his fathers absolute willthat he had by     bequest from some relative of his mother a moderate competence     which miss mowbray had consented to share with him in fine that he     desired not my counsel but my assistance a moments consideration     convinced me that i should be unkind not to him only but to     myself unless i gave him all the backing i could in this his most     dutiful scheme i recollected our right honourable fathers     denunciations against scottish marriages and secret marriages of     all sortsdenunciations perhaps not the less vehement that he     might feel some secret prick of conscience on the subject himself i     remembered that my grave brother had always been a favourite and i     forgot nothow was it possible i could forgetthose ominous     expressions which intimated a possibility of the hereditary estate     and honours being transferred to the elder instead of the younger     son now it required no conjurer to foresee that should francis     commit this inexpiable crime of secretly allying himself with a     scottish beauty our sire would lose all wish to accomplish such a     transference in his favour and while my brothers merits were     altogether obscured by such an unpardonable act of disobedience my     own no longer overshadowed by prejudice or partiality would shine     forth in all their natural brilliancy these considerations which     flashed on me with the rapidity of lightning induced me to consent     to hold franks backhand during the perilous game he proposed to     play i had only to take care that my own share in the matter should     not be so prominent as to attract my fathers attention and this i     was little afraid of for his wrath was usually of that vehement and     forcible character which like lightning is attracted to one     single point there bursting with violence as undivided as it was     uncontrollable      i soon found the lovers needed my assistance more than i could have     supposed for they were absolute novices in any sort of intrigue     which to me seemed as easy and natural as lying francis had been     detected by some tattling spy in his walks with clara and the news     had been carried to old mowbray who was greatly incensed at his     daughter though little knowing that her crime was greater than     admitting an unknown english student to form a personal acquaintance     with her he prohibited farther intercourseresolved in     justiceofpeace phrase to rid the country of us and prudently     sinking all mention of his daughters delinquency commenced an     action against francis under pretext of punishing him as an     encroacher upon his game but in reality to scare him from the     neighbourhood his person was particularly described to all the     keepers and satellites about shawscastle and any personal     intercourse betwixt him and clara became impossible except under     the most desperate risks nay such was their alarm that master     francis thought it prudent for miss mowbrays sake to withdraw as     far as a town called marchthorn and there to conceal himself     maintaining his intercourse with clara only by letter      it was then i became the sheetanchor of the hope of the lovers it     was then my early dexterity and powers of contrivance were first put     to the test and it would be too long to tell you in how many     shapes and by how many contrivances i acted as agent     lettercarrier and gobetween to maintain the intercourse of these     separated turtles i have had a good deal of trouble in that way on     my own account but never half so much as i took on account of this     brace of lovers i scaled walls and swam rivers set bloodhounds     quarterstaves and blunderbusses at defiance and excepting the     distant prospect of selfinterest which i have hinted at i was     neither to have honour nor reward for my pains i will own to you     that clara mowbray was so very beautifulso absolutely confiding in     her lovers friendand thrown into such close intercourse with me     that there were times when i thought that in conscience she ought     not to have scrupled to have contributed a mite to reward the     faithful labourer but then she looked like purity itself and i     was such a novice at that time of day that i did not know how it     might have been possible for me to retreat if i had made too bold     an advanceand in short i thought it best to content myself with     assisting true love to run smooth in the hope that its course     would assure me in the longrun an earls title and an earls     fortune      nothing was therefore ventured on my part which could raise     suspicion and as the confidential friend of the lovers i prepared     every thing for their secret marriage the pastor of the parish     agreed to perform the ceremony prevailed upon by an argument which     i used to him and which clara had she guessed it would have     little thanked me for i led the honest man to believe that in     declining to do his office he might prevent a too successful lover     from doing justice to a betrayed maiden and the parson who i     found had a spice of romance in his disposition resolved under     such pressing circumstances to do them the kind office of binding     them together although the consequence might be a charge of     irregularity against himself old mowbray was much confined to his     room his daughter less watched since frank had removed from the     neighbourhoodthe brother which by the by i should have said     before not then in the countryand it was settled that the lovers     should meet at the old kirk of saint ronans when the twilight     became deep and go off in a chaise for england so soon as the     ceremony was performed      when all this was arranged save the actual appointment of the day     you cannot conceive the happiness and the gratitude of my sage     brother he looked upon himself as approaching to the seventh     heaven instead of losing his chance of a good fortune and     encumbering himself at nineteen with a wife and all the     probabilities of narrow circumstances and an increasing family     though so much younger myself i could not help wondering at his     extreme want of knowledge of the world and feeling ashamed that i     had ever allowed him to take the airs of a tutor with me and this     conscious superiority supported me against the thrill of jealousy     which always seized me when i thought of his carrying off the     beautiful prize which without my address he could never have     made his ownbut at this important crisis i had a letter from my     father which by some accident had long lain at our lodgings in     edinburgh and then visited our former quarters in the highlands     again returned to edinburgh and at length reached me at marchthorn     in a most critical time      it was in reply to a letter of mine in which among other matters     such as good boys send to their papas descriptions of the country     accounts of studies exercises and so forth i had to fill up the     sheet to a dutiful length thrown in something about the family of     st ronans in the neighbourhood of which i was writing i had no     idea what an effect the name would produce on the mind of my right     honourable father but his letter sufficiently expressed it he     charged me to cultivate the acquaintance of mr mowbray as fast and     as intimately as possible and if need were to inform him candidly     of our real character and situation in life wisely considering at     the same time that his filial admonition might be neglected if not     backed by some sufficient motive his lordship frankly let me into     the secret of my granduncle by the mothers side mr s mowbray of     nettlewoods last will and testament by which i saw to my     astonishment and alarm that a large and fair estate was bequeathed     to the eldest son and heir of the earl of etherington on condition     of his forming a matrimonial alliance with a lady of the house of     mowbray of st ronansmercy of heaven how i stared here had i     been making every preparation for wedding francis to the very girl     whose hand would insure to myself wealth and independenceand even     the first loss though great was not likely to be the last my     father spoke of the marriage like a landsurveyor but of the estate     of nettlewood like an impassioned lover he seemed to dote on every     acre of it and dwelt on its contiguity to his own domains as a     circumstance which rendered the union of the estates not desirable     merely but constituted an arrangement pointed out by the hand of     nature and although he observed that on account of the youth of     the parties treaty of marriage could not be immediately undertaken     it was yet clear he would approve at heart of any bold stroke which     would abolish the interval of time that might otherwise intervene     ere oakendale and nettlewood became one property      here then were shipwrecked my fair hopes it was clear as     sunshine that a private marriage unpardonable in the abstract     would become venial nay highly laudable in my fathers eyes if     it united his heir with clara mowbray and if he really had as my     fears suggested the means of establishing legitimacy on my     brothers part nothing was so likely to tempt him to use them as     the certainty that by his doing so nettlewood and oakendale would     be united into one the very catastrophe which i had prepared as     sure to exclude my rival from his fathers favour was thus likely     unless it could be prevented to become a strong motive and argument     for the earl placing his rights above mine      i shut myself up in my bedroom locked the door read and again     read my fathers letter and instead of giving way to idle passion     beware of that harry even in the most desperate circumstances i     considered with keen investigation whether some remedy could not     yet be foundto break off the match for the time would have been     easya little private information to mr mowbray would have done     that with a vengeancebut then the treaty might be renewed under my     fathers auspicesat all events the share which i had taken in     the intrigue between clara and my brother rendered it almost     impossible for me to become a suitor in my own personamid these     perplexities it suddenly occurred to my adventurous heart and     contriving brainwhat if i should personate the bridegroomthis     strange thought you will recollect occurred to a very youthful     brainit was banishedit returnedreturned again and againwas     viewed under every different shapebecame familiarwas     adoptedit was easy to fix the appointment with clara and the     clergyman for i managed the whole correspondencethe resemblance     between francis and me in stature and in proportionthe disguise     which we were to assumethe darkness of the churchthe hurry of     the momentmight i trusted prevent clara from recognising me to     the minister i had only to say that though i had hitherto talked of     a friend i myself was the happy man my first name was francis as     well as his and i had found clara so gentle so confiding so     flatteringly cordial in her intercourse with me that once within     my power and prevented from receding by shame and a thousand     contradictory feelings i had with the vanity of an amoureux de     seize ans the confidence to believe i could reconcile the fair     lady to the exchange      there certainly never came such a thought into a madcaps brain     and what is more extraordinarybut that you already knowit was     so far successful that the marriage ceremony was performed between     us in the presence of a servant of mine claras accommodating     companion and the priestwe got into the carriage and were a     mile from the church when my unlucky or lucky brother stopped the     chaise by forcethrough what means he had obtained knowledge of my     little trick i never have been able to learn solmes has been     faithful to me in too many instances that i should suspect him in     this important crisis i jumped out of the carriage pitched     fraternity to the devil and betwixt desperation and something very     like shame began to cut away with a couteau de chasse which i had     provided in case of necessityall was in vaini was hustled down     under the wheel of the carriage and the horses taking fright it     went over my body      here ends my narrative for i neither heard not saw more until i     found myself stretched on a sickbed many miles from the scene of     action and solmes engaged in attending on me in answer to my     passionate enquiries he briefly informed me that master francis     had sent back the young lady to her own dwelling and that she     appeared to be extremely ill in consequence of the alarm she had     sustained my own health he assured me was considered as very     precarious and added that tyrrel who was in the same house was     in the utmost perturbation on my account the very mention of his     name brought on a crisis in which i brought up much blood and it is     singular that the physician who attended mea grave gentleman with     a wigconsidered that this was of service to me i know it     frightened me heartily and prepared me for a visit from master     frank which i endured with a tameness he would not have     experienced had the usual current of blood flowed in my veins but     sickness and the lancet make one very tolerant of sermonizingat     last in consideration of being relieved from his accursed presence     and the sound of his infernally calm voice i slowly and reluctantly     acquiesced in an arrangement by which he proposed that we should     for ever bid adieu to each other and to clara mowbray i would have     hesitated at this last stipulation she was i said my wife and     i was entitled to claim her as such      this drew down a shower of most moral reproaches and an assurance     that clara disowned and detested my alliance and that where there     had been an essential error in the person the mere ceremony could     never be accounted binding by the law of any christian country i     wonder this had not occurred to me but my ideas of marriage were     much founded on plays and novels where such devices as i had     practised are often resorted to for winding up the plot without any     hint of their illegality besides i had confided as i mentioned     before a little too rashly perhaps in my own powers of persuading     so young a bride as clara to be contented with one handsome fellow     instead of another      solmes took up the argument when francis released me by leaving     the room he spoke of my fathers resentment should this enterprise     reach his earsof the revenge of mowbray of st ronans whose     nature was both haughty and ruggedof risk from the laws of the     country and god knows what bugbears besides which at a more     advanced age i would have laughed at in a word i sealed the     capitulation vowed perpetual absence and banished myself as they     say in this country forth of scotland      and here harry observe and respect my genius every circumstance     was against me in this negotiation i had been the aggressor in the     war i was wounded and it might be said a prisoner in my     antagonists hands yet i could so far avail myself of monsieur     martignys greater eagerness for peace that i clogged the treaty     with a condition highly advantageous to myself and equally     unfavourable to himsaid mr francis martigny was to take upon     himself the burden of my right honourable fathers displeasure and     our separation which was certain to give immense offence was to be     represented as his work not as mine i insisted tenderhearted     dutiful soul as i was that i would consent to no measure which was     to bring down papas displeasure this was a sine qua non in our     negotiation          voila ce que cest davoir des talens      monsieur francis would i suppose have taken the world on his     shoulders to have placed an eternal separation betwixt his     turtledove and the falcon who had made so bold a pounce at     herwhat he wrote to my father i know not as for myself in all     duty i represented the bad state of my health from an accident and     that my brother and companion having been suddenly called from me     by some cause which he had not explained i had thought it necessary     to get to london for the best advice and only waited his lordships     permission to return to the paternal mansion this i soon received     and found as i expected that he was in towering wrath against my     brother for his disobedience and after some time i even had     reason to think as how could it be otherwise harry that on     becoming better acquainted with the merits and amiable manners of     his apparent heir he lost any desire which he might formerly have     entertained of accomplishing any change in my circumstances in     relation to the world perhaps the old peer turned a little ashamed     of his own conduct and dared not aver to the congregation of the     righteous for he became saintly in his latter days the very     pretty frolics which he seems to have been guilty of in his youth     perhaps also the death of my right honourable mother operated in     my favour since while she lived my chance was the worsethere is     no saying what a man will do to spite his wifeenough he     diedslept with his right honourable fathers and i became without     opposition right honourable in his stead      how i have borne my new honours thou harry and our merry set     know full well newmarket and tattersals may tell the rest i think     i have been as lucky as most men where luck is most prized and so i     shall say no more on that subject      and now harry i will suppose thee in a moralizing mood that is     i will fancy the dice have run wrongor your doublebarrel has hung     fireor a certain lady has looked crossor any such weighty cause     of gravity has occurred and you give me the benefit of your     seriousnessmy dear etherington say you pithily you are a     precious foolhere you are stirring up a business rather     scandalous in itself and fraught with mischief to all concerneda     business which might sleep for ever if you let it alone but which     is sure like a seacoal fire to burst into a flame if you go on     poking it i would like to ask your lordship only two     questionssay you with your usual graceful attitude of adjusting     your perpendicular shirtcollar and passing your hand over the knot     of your cravat which deserves a peculiar place in the     tietaniaiiaii5only two questionsthat is whether you do     not repent the past and whether you do not fear the future very     comprehensive queries these of yours harry for they respect both     the time past and the time to comeones whole life in short     however i shall endeavour to answer them as well as i may      repent the past said youyes harry i think i do repent the     pastthat is not quite in the parsons style of repentance which     resembles yours when you have a headache but as i would repent a     hand at cards which i had played on false principles i should have     begun with the young ladyavailed myself in a very different manner     of monsieur martignys absence and my own intimacy with her and     thus superseded him if possible in the damsels affections the     scheme i adopted though there was i think both boldness and     dexterity in it was that of a novice of premature genius who could     not calculate chances so much for repentancedo i not fear the     futureharry i will not cut your throat for supposing you to have     put the question but calmly assure you that i never feared any     thing in my life i was born without the sensation i believe at     least it is perfectly unknown to me when i felt that cursed wheel     pass across my breast when i felt the pistolball benumb my arm i     felt no more agitation than at the bounce of a champagnecork but i     would not have you think that i am fool enough to risk plague     trouble and danger all of which besides considerable expense i     am now prepared to encounter without some adequate motiveand     here it is      from various quarters hints rumours and surmises have reached     me that an attack will be made on my rank and status in society     which can only be in behalf of this fellow martigny for i will not     call him by his stolen name of tyrrel now this i hold to be a     breach of the paction betwixt us by whichthat is by that which i     am determined to esteem its true meaning and purporthe was to     leave my right honourable father and me to settle our own matters     without his interference which amounted to a virtual resignation of     his rights if the scoundrel ever had any can he expect i am to     resign my wife and what is a better thing old scrogie mowbrays     estate of nettlewood to gratify the humour of a fellow who sets up     claims to my title and whole property no by  if he assails me     in a point so important i will retaliate upon him in one where he     will feel as keenly and that he may depend uponand now     methinks you come upon me with a second edition of your grave     remonstrances about family feuds unnatural rencontres offence to     all the feelings of all the world et cetera et cetera which you     might usher in most delectably with the old stave about brethren     dwelling together in unity i will not stop to enquire whether all     these delicate apprehensions are on account of the earl of     etherington his safety and his reputation or whether my friend     harry jekyl be not considering how far his own interference with     such a naughty business will be well taken at headquarters and so     without pausing on that question i shall barely and briefly say     that you cannot be more sensible than i am of the madness of     bringing matters to such an extremityi have no such intention i     assure you and it is with no such purpose that i invite you     herewere i to challenge martigny he would refuse me the     meeting and all less ceremonious ways of arranging such an affair     are quite oldfashioned      it is true at our first meeting i was betrayed into the scrape i     told you ofjust as you may have shot or shot at for i think     you are no downright hitter a henpheasant when flushed within     distance by a sort of instinctive movement without reflecting on     the enormity you are about to commit the truth is there is an     ignis fatuus influence which seems to govern our houseit poured     its wildfire through my fathers veinsit has descended to me in     full vigour and every now and then its impulse is irresistible     there was my enemy and here were my pistols was all i had time to     think about the matter but i will be on my guard in future the     more surety as i cannot receive any provocation from him on the     contrary if i must confess the truth though i was willing to gloss     it a little in my first account of the matter like the gazette     when recording a defeat i am certain he would never voluntarily     have fired at me and that his pistol went off as he fell you know     me well enough to be assured that i will never be again in the     scrape of attacking an unresisting antagonist were he ten times my     brother      then as to this long tirade about hating my brotherharry i do     not hate him more than the firstborn of egypt are in general hated     by those whom they exclude from entailed estates and so forthnot     one lauded man in twenty of us that is not hated by his younger     brothers to the extent of wishing him quiet in his grave as an     abominable stumblingblock in their path of life and so far only do     i hate monsieur martigny but for the rest i rather like him as     otherwise and would he but die would give my frank consent to his     being canonized and while he lives i am not desirous that he     should be exposed to any temptation from rank and riches those     main obstacles to the selfdenying course of life by which the     odour of sanctity is attained      here again you break in with your impertinent queriesif i have no     purpose of quarrelling personally with martigny why do i come into     collision with him at allwhy not abide by the treaty of     marchthorn and remain in england without again approaching saint     ronans or claiming my maiden bride      have i not told you i want him to cease all threatened attempts     upon my fortune and dignity have i not told you that i want to     claim my wife clara mowbray and my estate of nettlewood fairly     won by marrying herand to let you into the whole secret though     clara is a very pretty woman yet she goes for so little in the     transaction with me her animpassioned bridegroom that i hope to     make some relaxation of my rights over her the means of obtaining     the concessions which i think most important      i will not deny that an aversion to awakening bustle and     encountering reproach has made me so slow in looking after my     interest that the period will shortly expire within which i ought     by old scrog mowbrays will to qualify myself for becoming his     heir by being the accepted husband of miss mowbray of st ronans     time wastime isand if i catch it not by the forelock as it     passes time will be no morenettlewood will be forfeitedand if i     have in addition a lawsuit for my title and for oakendale i run a     risk of being altogether capotted i must therefore act at all     risks and act with vigourand this is the general plan of my     campaign subject always to be altered according to circumstances i     have obtainedi may say purchasedmowbrays consent to address his     sister i have this advantage that if she agrees to take me she     will for ever put a stop to all disagreeable reports and     recollections founded on her former conduct in that case i secure     the nettlewood property and am ready to wage war for my paternal     estate indeed i firmly believe that should this happy     consummation take place monsieur martigny will be too much     heartbroken to make further fight but will een throw helve after     hatchet and run to hide himself after the fashion of a true lover     in some desert beyond seas      but supposing the lady has the bad taste to be obstinate and will     none of me i still think that her happiness or her peace of mind     will be as dear to martigny as gibraltar is to the spaniards and     that he will sacrifice a great deal to induce me to give up my     pretensions now i shall want some one to act as my agent in     communicating with this fellow for i will not deny that my old     appetite for cutting his throat may awaken suddenly were i to hold     personal intercourse with him come thou therefore without delay     and hold my backhandcome for you know me and that i never left     a kindness unrewarded to be specific you shall have means to pay     off a certain inconvenient mortgage without troubling the tribe of     issachar if you will be but true to me in this mattercome     therefore without further apologies or further delay there shall     i give you my word neither be risk or offence in the part of the     drama which i intend to commit to your charge      talking of the drama we had a miserable attempt at a sort of     bastard theatricals at mowbrays ratgnawed mansion there were two     things worth noticingone that i lost all the courage on which i     pique myself and fairly fled from the pit rather than present     myself before miss clara mowbray when it came to the push and upon     this i pray you to remark that i am a person of singular delicacy     and modesty instead of being the drawcansir and daredevil that you     would make of me the other memorabile is of a more delicate nature     respecting the conduct of a certain fair lady who seemed determined     to fling herself at my head there is a wonderful degree of     freemasonry among us folk of spirit and it is astonishing how soon     we can place ourselves on a footing with neglected wives and     discontented daughters if you come not soon one of the rewards     held out to you in my former letter will certainly not be     forthcoming no schoolboy keeps gingerbread for his comrade     without feeling a desire to nibble at it so if you appear not to     look after your own interest say you had fair warning for my own     part i am rather embarrassed than gratified by the prospect of such     an affair when i have on the tapis another of a different nature     this enigma i will explain at meeting      thus finishes my long communication if my motives of action do not     appear explicit think in what a maze fortune has involved me and     how much must necessarily depend on the chapter of accidents      yesterday i may be said to have opened my siege for i presented     myself before clara i had no very flattering receptionthat was of     little consequence for i did not expect one by alarming her fears     i made an impression thus far that she acquiesces in my appearing     before her as her brothers guest and this is no small point     gained she will become accustomed to look on me and will remember     with less bitterness the trick which i played her formerly while i     on the other hand by a similar force of habit will get over     certain awkward feelings with which i have been compunctiously     visited whenever i look upon heradieu health and brotherhood      thine         etherington  footnote  ii5 see editors notes at the end of the volume wherever a similar reference occurs the reader will understand that the same direction applies     chapter viii  the reply      thou bearst a precious burden gentle post     nitre and sulphursee that it explode not  old play       i have received your two long letters my dear etherington with     equal surprise and interest for what i knew of your scottish     adventures before was by no means sufficient to prepare me for a     statement so perversely complicated the ignis fatuus which you     say governed your father seems to have ruled the fortunes of your     whole house there is so much eccentricity in all that you have told     me but nimporte etherington you were my friendyou held me up     when i was completely broken down and whatever you may think my     services are at your command much more from reflections on the past     than hopes for the future i am no speechmaker but this you may     rely on while i continue to be harry jekyl you have deserved some     love at my hands etherington and you have it      perhaps i love you the better since your perplexities have become     known to me for my dear etherington you were before too much an     object of envy to be entirely an object of affection what a happy     fellow was the song of all who named you bank and a fortune to     maintain itluck sufficient to repair all the waste that you could     make in your income and skill to back that luck or supply it     should it for a moment fail youthe cards turning up as if to     your wishthe dice rolling it almost seemed at your winkit was     rather your look than the touch of your cue that sent the ball into     the pocket you seemed to have fortune in chains and a man of less     honour would have been almost suspected of helping his luck by a     little artyou won every bet and the instant that you were     interested one might have named the winning horseit was always     that which you were to gain most byyou never held out your piece     but the game went downand then the womenwith face manners     person and above all your tonguewhat wild work have you made     among themgood heaven and have you had the old sword hanging     over your head by a horsehair all this whilehas your rank been     doubtfulyour fortune unsettledand your luck so constant in     every thing else has that as well as your predominant influence     with the women failed you when you wished to form a connexion for     life and when the care of your fortune required you to do     soetherington i am astonishedthe mowbray scrape i always     thought an inconvenient one as well as the quarrel with this same     tyrrel or martigny but i was far from guessing the complicated     nature of your perplexities      but i must not run on in a manner which though it relieves my own     marvelling mind cannot be very pleasant to you enough i look on     my obligations to you as more light to be borne now i have some     chance of repaying them to a certain extent but even were the full     debt paid i would remain as much attached to you as ever it is     your friend who speaks etherington and if he offers his advice in     somewhat plain language do not i entreat you suppose that your     confidence has encouraged an offensive familiarity but consider me     as one who in a weighty matter writes plainly to avoid the least     chance of misconstruction      etherington your conduct hitherto has resembled anything rather     than the coolness and judgment which are so peculiarly your own     when you choose to display them i pass over the masquerade of your     marriageit was a boys trick which could hardly have availed you     much even if successful for what sort of a wife would you have     acquired had this same clara mowbray proved willing to have     accepted the change which you had put upon her and transferred     herself without repugnance from one bridegroom to anotherpoor     as i am i know that neither nettlewood nor oakendale should have     bribed me to marry such a  i cannot decorously fill up the     blank      neither my dear etherington can i forgive you the trick you put     on the clergyman in whose eyes you destroyed the poor girls     character to induce him to consent to perform the ceremony and have     thereby perhaps fixed an indelible stain on her for lifethis was     not a fair ruse de guerreas it is you have taken little by     your stratagemunless indeed it should be difficult for the young     lady to prove the imposition put upon herfor that being admitted     the marriage certainly goes for nothing at least the only use you     can make of it would be to drive her into a more formal union for     fear of having this whole unpleasant discussion brought into a court     of law and in this with all the advantages you possess joined to     your own arts of persuasion and her brothers influence i should     think you very likely to succeed all women are necessarily the     slaves of their reputation i have known some who have given up     their virtue to preserve their character which is after all only     the shadow of it i therefore would not conceive it difficult for     clara mowbray to persuade herself to become a countess rather than     be the topic of conversation for all britain while a lawsuit     betwixt you is in dependence and that may be for the greater part     of both your lives      but in miss mowbrays state of mind it may require time to bring     her to such a conclusion and i fear you will be thwarted in your     operations by your rivali will not offend you by calling him your     brother now it is here that i think with pleasure i may be of some     use to youunder this special condition that there shall be no     thoughts of farther violence taking place between you however you     may have smoothed over your rencontre to yourself there is no doubt     that the public would have regarded any accident which might have     befallen on that occasion as a crime of the deepest dye and that     the law would have followed it with the most severe punishment and     for all that i have said of my serviceable disposition i would fain     stop short on this side of the gallowsmy neck is too long already     without a jest etherington you must be ruled by counsel in this     matter i detect your hatred to this man in every line of your     letter even when you write with the greatest coolness even where     there is an affectation of gaiety i read your sentiments on this     subject and they are such asi will not preach to youi will not     say a good manbut such as every wise manevery man who wishes to     live on fair terms with the world and to escape general     malediction and perhaps a violent death where all men will clap     their hands and rejoice at the punishment of the fratricidewould     with all possible speed eradicate from his breast my services     therefore if they are worth your acceptance are offered on the     condition that this unholy hatred be subdued with the utmost force     of your powerful mind and that you avoid every thing which can     possibly lead to such a catastrophe as you have twice narrowly     escaped i do not ask you to like this man for i know well the deep     root which your prejudices hold in your mind i merely ask you to     avoid him and to think of him as one who if you do meet him can     never be the object of personal resentment      on these conditions i will instantly join you at your spa and     wait but your answer to throw myself into the postchaise i will     seek out this martigny for you and i have the vanity to think i     shall be able to persuade him to take the course which his own true     interest as well as yours so plainly points outand that is to     depart and make us free of him you must not grudge a round sum of     money should that prove necessarywe must make wings for him to     fly with and i must be empowered by you to that purpose i cannot     think you have any thing serious to fear from a lawsuit your father     threw out this sinister hint at a moment when he was enraged at his     wife and irritated by his son and i have little doubt that his     expressions were merely flashes of anger at the moment though i see     they have made a deep impression on you at all events he spoke of     a preference to his illegitimate son as something which it was in     his own power to give or to withhold and he has died without     bestowing it the family seem addicted to irregular matrimony and     some lefthanded marriage there may have been used to propitiate the     modesty and save the conscience of the french lady but that any     thing of the nature of a serious and legal ceremony took place     nothing but the strongest proof can make me believe      i repeat then that i have little doubt that the claims of     martigny whatever they are may be easily compounded and england     made clear of him this will be more easily done if he really     entertains such a romantic passion as you describe for miss clara     mowbray it would be easy to show him that whether she is disposed     to accept your lordships hand or not her quiet and peace of mind     must depend on his leaving the country rely on it i shall find out     the way to smooth him down and whether distance or the grave divide     martigny and you is very little to the purpose unless in so far as     the one point can be attained with honour and safety and the other     if attempted would only make all concerned the subject of general     execration and deserved punishmentspeak the word and i attend     you as your truly grateful and devoted      henry jekyl  to this admonitory epistle the writer received in the course of post the following answer      my truly grateful and devoted henry jekyl has adopted a tone which     seems to be exalted without any occasion why thou suspicious     monitor have i not repeated a hundred times that i repent sincerely     of the foolish rencontre and am determined to curb my temper and     be on my guard in futureand what need you come upon me with your     long lesson about execration and punishment and fratricide and so     forthyou deal with an argument as a boy does with the first hare     he shoots which he never thinks dead till he has fired the second     barrel into her what a fellow you would have been for a lawyer how     long you would have held forth upon the plainest cause until the     poor bothered judge was almost willing to decide against justice     that he might be revenged on you if i must repeat what i have said     twenty times i tell you i have no thoughts of proceeding with this     fellow as i would with another if my fathers blood be in his     veins it shall save the skin his mother gave him and so come     without more parade either of stipulation or argument thou art     indeed a curious animal one would think to read your     communication that you had yourself discovered the propriety of     acting as a negotiator and the reasons which might in the course     of such a treaty be urged with advantage to induce this fellow to     leave the countrywhy this is the very course chalked out in my     last letter you are bolder than the boldest gipsy for you not only     steal my ideas and disfigure them that they may pass for yours but     you have the assurance to come abegging with them to the door of     the original parent no man like you for stealing other mens     inventions and cooking them up in your own way however harry     bating a little selfconceit and assumption thou art as honest a     fellow as ever man put faith inclever too in your own style     though not quite the genius you would fain pass forcome on thine     own terms and come as speedily as thou canst i do not reckon the     promise i made the less binding that you very generously make no     allusion to it      thine         etherington      ps one single caution i must adddo not mention my name to any     one at harrowgate or your prospect of meeting me or the route     which you are about to take on the purpose of your journey it is     unnecessary to recommend silence i know not whether such doubts are     natural to all who have secret measures to pursue or whether nature     has given me an unusual share of anxious suspicion but i cannot     divest myself of the idea that i am closely watched by some one     whom i cannot discover although i concealed my purpose of coming     hither from all mankind but you whom i do not for an instant     suspect of blabbing yet it was known to this martigny and he is     down here before me again i said not a wordgave not a hint to     any one of my views towards clara yet the tattling people here had     spread a report of a marriage depending between us even before i     could make the motion to her brother to be sure in such society     there is nothing talked of but marrying and giving in marriage and     this which alarms me as connected with my own private purposes     may be a bare rumour arising out of the gossip of the placeyet i     feel like the poor woman in the old story who felt herself watched     by an eye that glared upon her from behind the tapestry      i should have told you in my last that i had been recognised at a     public entertainment by the old clergyman who pronounced the     matrimonial blessing on clara and me nearly eight years ago he     insisted upon addressing me by the name of valentine bulmer under     which i was then best known it did not suit me at present to put     him into my confidence so i cut him harry as i would an old     pencil the task was the less difficult that i had to do with one     of the most absent men that ever dreamed with his eyes open i     verily believe he might be persuaded that the whole transaction was     a vision and that he had never in reality seen me before your     pious rebuke therefore about what i told him formerly concerning     the lovers is quite thrown away after all if what i said was not     accurately true as i certainly believe it was an exaggeration it     was all saint francis of martignys fault i suppose i am sure he     had love and opportunity on his side      here you have a postscript harry longer than the letter but it     must conclude with the same burdencome and come quickly     chapter ix  the fright      as shakes the bough of trembling leaf       when sudden whirlwinds rise     as stands aghast the warrior chief       when his base army flies              it had been settled by all who took the matter into consideration that the fidgety fiery old nabob would soon quarrel with his landlady mrs dods and become impatient of his residence at st ronans a man so kind to himself and so inquisitive about the affairs of others could have it was supposed a limited sphere for gratification either of his tastes or of his curiosity in the aultoun of st ronans and many a time the precise day and hour of his departure were fixed by the idlers at the spa but still old touchwood appeared amongst them when the weather permitted with his nutbrown visage his throat carefully wrapped up in an immense indian kerchief and his goldheaded cane which he never failed to carry over his shoulder his short but stout limbs and his active step showing plainly that he bore it rather as a badge of dignity than a means of support there he stood answering shortly and gruffly to all questions proposed to him and making his remarks aloud upon the company with great indifference as to the offence which plight be taken and as soon as the ancient priestess had handed him his glass of the salutiferous water turned on his heel with a brief goodmorning and either marched back to hide himself in the manse with his crony mr cargill or to engage in some hobbyhorsical pursuit connected with his neighbours in the aultoun  the truth was that the honest gentleman having so far as mrs dods would permit put matters to rights within her residence wisely abstained from pushing his innovations any farther aware that it is not every stone which is capable of receiving the last degree of polish he next set himself about putting mr cargills house into order and without leave asked or given by that reverend gentleman he actually accomplished as wonderful a reformation in the manse as could have been effected by a benevolent brownie the floors were sometimes sweptthe carpets were sometimes shakenthe plates and dishes were cleanerthere was tea and sugar in the teachest and a joint of meat at proper times was to be found in the larder the elder maidservant wore a good stuff gownthe younger snooded up her hair and now went about the house a damsel so trig and neat that some said she was too handsome for the service of a bachelor divine and others that they saw no business so old a fool as the nabob had to be meddling with a lassies busking but for such evil bruits mr touchwood cared not even if he happened to hear of them which was very doubtful add to all these changes that the garden was weeded and the glebe was regularly laboured  the talisman by which all this desirable alteration was wrought consisted partly in small presents partly in constant attention the liberality of the singular old gentleman gave him a perfect right to scold when he saw things wrong the domestics who had fallen into total sloth and indifference began to exert themselves under mr touchwoods new system of rewards and surveillance and the minister half unconscious of the cause reaped the advantage of the exertions of his busy friend sometimes he lifted his head when he heard workmen thumping and bouncing in the neighbourhood of his study and demanded the meaning of the clatter which annoyed him but on receiving for answer that it was by order of mr touchwood he resumed his labours under the persuasion that all was well  but even the augean task of putting the manse in order did not satisfy the gigantic activity of mr touchwood he aspired to universal dominion in the aultoun of st ronans and like most men of an ardent temper he contrived in a great measure to possess himself of the authority which he longed after then was there war waged by him with all the petty but perpetual nuisances which infest a scottish town of the old stampthen was the hereditary dunghill which had reeked before the window of the cottage for fourscore years transported behind the housethen was the broken wheelbarrow or unserviceable cart removed out of the footpaththe old hat or blue petticoat taken from the window into which it had been stuffed to expel the winters flaw was consigned to the gutter and its place supplied by good perspicuous glass the means by which such reformation was effected were the same as resorted to in the mansemoney and admonition the latter given alone would have met little attentionperhaps would have provoked oppositionbut softened and sweetened by a little present to assist the reform recommended it sunk into the hearts of the hearers and in general overcame their objections besides an opinion of the nabobs wealth was high among the villagers and an idea prevailed amongst them that notwithstanding his keeping no servants or equipage he was able to purchase if he pleased half the land in the country it was not grand carriages and fine liveries that made heavy purses they rather helped to lighten them and they said who pretended to know what they were talking about that old turnpenny and mr bindloose to boot would tell down more money on mr touchwoods mere word than upon the joint bond of half the fine folk at the well such an opinion smoothed every thing before the path of one who showed himself neither averse to give nor to lend and it by no means diminished the reputation of his wealth that in transactions of business he was not carelessly negligent of his interest but plainly showed he understood the value of what he was parting with few therefore cared to withstand the humours of a whimsical old gentleman who had both the will and the means of obliging those disposed to comply with his fancies and thus the singular stranger contrived in the course of a brief space of days or weeks to place the villagers more absolutely at his devotion than they had been to the pleasure of any individual since their ancient lords had left the aultoun the power of the baronbailie himself though the office was vested in the person of old meiklewham was a subordinate jurisdiction compared to the voluntary allegiance which the inhabitants paid to mr touchwood  there were however recusants who declined the authority thus set up amongst them and with the characteristic obstinacy of their countrymen refused to hearken to the words of the stranger whether they were for good or for evil these mens dunghills were not removed nor the stumblingblocks taken from the footpath where it passed the front of their houses and it befell that while mr touchwood was most eager in abating the nuisances of the village he had very nearly experienced a frequent fate of great reformersthat of losing his life by means of one of those enormities which as yet had subsisted in spite of all his efforts  the nabob finding his time after dinner hang somewhat heavy on his hand and the moon being tolerably bright had one harvest evening sought his usual remedy for dispelling ennui by a walk to the manse where he was sure that if he could not succeed in engaging the minister himself in some disputation he would at least find something in the establishment to animadvert upon and to restore to order  accordingly he had taken the opportunity to lecture the younger of the ministers lasses upon the duty of wearing shoes and stockings and as his advice came fortified by a present of six pair of white cotton hose and two pair of stout leathern shoes it was received not with respect only but with gratitude and the chuck under the chin that rounded up the oration while she opened the outer door for his honour was acknowledged with a blush and a giggle nay so far did grizzy carry her sense of mr touchwoods kindness that observing the moon was behind a cloud she very carefully offered to escort him to the cleikum inn with a lantern in case he should come to some harm by the gate this the travellers independent spirit scorned to listen to and having briefly assured her that he had walked the streets of paris and of madrid whole nights without such an accommodation he stoutly strode off on his return to his lodgings  an accident however befell him which unless the police of madrid and paris be belied might have happened in either of those two splendid capitals as well as in the miserable aultoun of st ronans before the door of saunders jaup a feuar of some importance who held his land free and caredna a bodle for any one yawned that odoriferous gulf ycleped in scottish phrase the jawhole in other words an uncovered common sewer the local situation of this receptacle of filth was well known to mr touchwood for saunders jaup was at the very head of those who held out for the practices of their fathers and still maintained those ancient and unsavoury customs which our traveller had in so many instances succeeded in abating guided therefore by his nose the nabob made a considerable circuit to avoid the displeasure and danger of passing this filthy puddle at the nearest and by that means fell upon scylla as he sought to avoid charybdis in plain language he approached so near the bank of a little rivulet which in that place passed betwixt the footpath and the horseroad that he lost his footing and fell into the channel of the streamlet from a height of three or four feet it was thought that the noise of his fall or at least his call for assistance must have been heard in the house of saunders jaup but that honest person was according to his own account at that time engaged in the exercise of the evening an excuse which passed current although saunders was privately heard to allege that the town would have been the quieter if the auld meddling busybody had bidden still in the burn for gude and a  but fortune had provided better for poor touchwood whose foibles as they arose out of the most excellent motives would have ill deserved so severe a fate a passenger who heard him shout for help ventured cautiously to the side of the bank down which he had fallen and after ascertaining the nature of the ground as carefully as the darkness permitted was at length and not without some effort enabled to assist him out of the channel of the rivulet  are you hurt materially said this good samaritan to the object of his care  nonodn itno said touchwood extremely angry at his disaster and the cause of it do you think i who have been at the summit of mount athos where the precipice sinks a thousand feet on the sea care a farthing about such a fall as this is  but as he spoke he reeled and his kind assistant caught him by the arm to prevent his falling  i fear you are more hurt than you suppose sir said the stranger permit me to go home along with you  with all my heart said touchwood for though it is impossible i can need help in such a foolish matter yet i am equally obliged to you friend and if the cleikum inn be not out of your road i will take your arm so far and thank you to the boot  it is much at your service sir said the stranger indeed i was thinking to lodge there for the night  i am glad to hear it resumed touchwood you shall be my guest and i will make them look after you in proper fashionyou seem to be a very civil sort of fellow and i do not find your arm inconvenientit is the rheumatism makes me walk so illthe pest of all that have been in hot climates when they settle among these dd fogs  lean as hard and walk as slow as you will sir said the benevolent assistantthis is a rough street  yes sirand why is it rough answered touchwood why because the old pigheaded fool saunders jaup will not allow it to be made smooth there he sits sir and obstructs all rational improvement and if a man would not fall into his infernal putrid gutter and so become an abomination to himself and odious to others for his whole life to come he runs the risk of breaking his neck as i have done tonight  i am afraid sir said his companion you have fallen on the most dangerous sideyou remember swifts proverb the more dirt the less hurt  but why should there be either dirt or hurt in a wellregulated place answered touchwoodwhy should not men be able to go about their affairs at night in such a hamlet as this without either endangering necks or nosesour scottish magistrates are worth nothing sirnothing at all oh for a turkish cadi now to trounce the scoundrelor the mayor of calcutta to bring him into his courtor were it but an english justice of the peace that is newly

nowi must have lost much blood  i hope you are still mistaken said the stranger but here lies the way to the kitchenwe shall find light there since no one chooses to bring it to us  illustration  he assisted the old gentleman into the kitchen where a lamp as well as a bright fire was burning by the light of which he could easily discern that the supposed blood was only water of the rivulet and indeed none of the cleanest although much more so than the sufferer would have found it a little lower where the stream is joined by the superfluities of saunders jaups palladium relieved by his new friends repeated assurances that such was the case the senior began to bustle up a little and his companion desirous to render him every assistance went to the door of the kitchen to call for a basin and water just as he was about to open the door the voice of mrs dods was heard as she descended the stairs in a tone of indignation by no means unusual to her yet mingled at the same time with a few notes that sounded like unto the quaverings of consternation  idle limmerssilly slutsill warrant nane o ye will ever see ony thing waur than yoursell ye silly tawpiesghaist indeedill warrant its some

brandishing a pair of tongs while the two maids like troops not to be much trusted after their recent defeat followed cowering in the rear but notwithstanding this admirable disposition no sooner had the stranger shown his face and pronounced the words mrs dods than a panic seized the whole array the advanced guard recoiled in consternation the ostler upsetting mrs dods in the confusion of his retreat while she grappling with him in her terror secured him by the ears and hair and they joined their cries together in hideous chorus the two maidens resumed their former flight and took refuge in the darksome den entitled their bedroom while the humpbacked postilion fled like the wind into the stable and with professional instinct began in the extremity of his terror to saddle a horse  meanwhile the guest whose appearance had caused this combustion plucked the roaring ostler from above mrs dods and pushing him away with a hearty slap on the shoulder proceeded to raise and encourage the fallen landlady enquiring at the same time what in the devils name was the cause of all this senseless confusion  and what is the reason in heavens name answered the matron keeping her eyes firmly shut and still shrewish in her expostulation though in the very extremity of terror what is the reason that you should come and frighten a decent house where you met naething when ye was in the body but the height of civility  and why should i frighten you mrs dods or in one word what is the meaning of all this nonsensical terror  are not you said mrs dods opening her eyes a little as she spoke the ghaist of francis tirl  i am francis tyrrel unquestionably my old friend  i kend it i kend it answered the honest woman relapsing into her agony and i think ye might be ashamed of yourself that are a ghaist and have nae better to do than to frighten a puir auld alewife  on my word i am no ghost but a living man answered tyrrel  were ye no murdered than demanded mrs dods still in an uncertain voice and only partially opening her eyesare ye very sure ye werena murdered  why not that ever i heard of certainly dame replied tyrrel  but i shall be murdered presently said old touchwood from the kitchen where he had hitherto remained a mute auditor of this extraordinary scenei shall be murdered unless you fetch me some water without delay  coming sir coming answered dame dods her professional reply being as familiar to her as that of poor franciss anon anon sir as i live by honest reckonings said she fully collecting herself and giving a glance of more composed temper at tyrrel i believe it is yoursell maister frank in blood and body after aand see if i dinna gie a proper sorting to yon twa silly jauds that gard me mak a bogle of you and a fule of mysellghaists my certie i sall ghaist

house naebody need fear bogles that has a conscience void of offencebut i am blithe that macturk hasna murdered ye when a is done maister francie  come this way mother dods if you would not have me do a mischief exclaimed touchwood grasping a plate which stood on the dresser as if he were about to heave it at the landlady by way of recalling her attention  for the love of heaven dinna break it exclaimed the alarmed landlady knowing that touchwoods effervescence of impatience sometimes expended itself at the expense of her crockery though it was afterwards liberally atoned for lord sir are ye out of your witsit breaks a set ye kengodsake put doun the cheeny plate and try your hand on the delfwareit will just make as good a jinglebut lord haud a grip o us now i look at ye what can hae come ower ye and what sort of a plight are ye inwait till i fetch water and a towel  in fact the miserable guise of her new lodger now overcame the dames curiosity to enquire after the fate of her earlier acquaintance and she gave her instant and exclusive attention to mr touchwood with many exclamations while aiding him to perform the task of ablution and abstersion her two fugitive handmaidens had by this time returned to the kitchen and endeavoured to suppress a smuggled laugh at the recollection of their mistresss panic by acting very officiously in mr touchwoods service by dint of washing and drying the token of the sable stains was at length removed and the veteran became with some difficulty satisfied that he had been more dirtied and frightened than hurt  tyrrel in the meantime stood looking on with wonder imagining that he beheld in the features which emerged from a mask of mud the countenance of an old friend after the operation was ended he could not help addressing himself to mr touchwood to demand whether he had not the pleasure to see a friend to whom he had been obliged when at smyrna for some kindness respecting his money matters  not worth speaking ofnot worth speaking of said touchwood hastily glad to see you thoughglad to see youyes here i am you will find me the same goodnatured old fool that i was at smyrnanever look how i am to get in money againalways laying it out never mindit was written in my forehead as the turk saysi will go up now and change my dressyou will sup with me when i come backmrs dods will toss us up somethinga brandered fowl will be best mrs dods with some mushrooms and get us a jug of mulled wineplottie as you call itto put the recollection of the old presbyterians common sewer out of my head  so saying up stairs marched the traveller to his own apartment while tyrrel seizing upon a candle was about to do the same  mr touchwood is in the blue room mrs dods i suppose i may take possession of the yellow one  suppose naething about the matter maister francis tirl till ye tell me downright where ye have been a this time and whether ye hae been murdered or no  i think you may be pretty well satisfied of that mrs dods  trot and so i am in a sense and yet it gars me grue to look upon ye sae mony days and weeks it has been since i thought ye were rotten in the moulds and now to see ye standing before me hale and feir and crying for a bedroom like ither folk  one would almost suppose my good friend said tyrrel that you were sorry at my having come alive again  its no for that replied mrs dods who was peculiarly ingenious in the mode of framing and stating what she conceived to be her grievances but is it no a queer thing for a decent man like yoursell maister tirl to be leaving your lodgings without a word spoken and me put to a these charges in seeking for your dead body and very near taking my business out of honest maister bindlooses hands because he kend the cantrips of the like of you better than i didand than they hae putten up an advertisement down at the waal yonder wi a their names at it setting ye forth maister francie as are of the greatest blackguards unhanged and wha div ye think is to keep ye in a creditable house if thats the character ye get  you may leave that to me mrs dodsi assure you that matter shall be put to rights to your satisfaction and i think so long as we have known each other you may take my word that i am not undeserving the shelter of your roof for a single night i shall ask it no longer until my character is sufficiently cleared it was for that purpose chiefly i came back again  came back again said mrs dodsi profess ye made me start maister tirl and you looking sae pale toobut i think she added straining after a joke if ye were a ghaist seeing we are such auld acquaintance ye wadna wish to spoil my custom but would just walk decently up and down the auld castle was or maybe down at the kirk yonderthere have been awfu things done in that kirk and kirkyardi whiles dinna like to look that way maister francie  i am much of your mind mistress said tyrrel with a sigh and indeed i do in one resemble the apparitions you talk of for like them and to as little purpose i stalk about scenes where my happiness departedbut i speak riddles to you mrs dodsthe plain truth is that i met with an accident on the day i last left your house the effects of which detained me at some distance from st ronans till this very day  hegh sirs and ye were sparing of your trouble that wadna write a bit line or send a bit messageye might hae thought folk wad hae been vexed eneugh about ye forby undertaking journeys and hiring folk to seek for your dead body  i shall willingly pay all reasonable charges which my disappearance may have occasioned answered her guest and i assure you once for all that my remaining for some time quiet at marchthorn arose partly from illness and partly from business of a very pressing and particular nature  at marchthorn exclaimed dame dods heard ever man the like o thatand where did ye put up in marchthorn an ane may mak bauld to speer  at the black bull replied tyrrel  ay thats auld tam lowriesa very decent man thamasand a douce creditable housenane of your fliskmahoysi am glad ye made choice of sic gude quarters neighbour for i am beginning to think ye are but a queer aneye look as if butter wadna melt in your mouth but i sall warrant cheese no choke yebut ill thank ye to gang your ways into the parlour for i am no like to get muckle mair out o ye its like and ye are standing here just in the gate when we hae the supper to dish  tyrrel glad to be released from the examination to which his landladys curiosity had without ceremony subjected him walked into the parlour where he was presently joined by mr touchwood newly attired and in high spirits  here comes our supper he exclaimedsit ye down and let us see what mrs dods has done for usi profess mistress your plottie is excellent ever since i taught you to mix the spices in the right proportion  i am glad the plottie pleases ye sirbut i think i kend gay weel how to make it before i saw your honourmaister tirl can tell that for mony a browst of it i hae brewed lang syne for him and the callant valentine bulmer  this illtimed observation extorted a groan from tyrrel but the traveller running on with his own recollections did not appear to notice his emotion  you are a conceited old woman said mr touchwood how the devil should any one know how to mix spices so well as he who has been where they growi have seen the sun ripening nutmegs and cloves and here it can hardly fill a peasecod by jupiter ah tyrrel the merry nights we have had at smyrnagad i think the gammon and the good wine taste all the better in a land where folks hold them to be sinful indulgencesgad i believe many a good moslem is of the same opinionthat same prohibition of their prophets gives a flavour to the ham and a relish to the cyprusdo you remember old cogia hassein with his green turbani once played him a trick and put a pint of brandy into his sherbet egad the old fellow took care never to discover the cheat until he had got to the bottom of the flagon and then he strokes his long white beard and says ullah kerimthat is heaven is merciful mrs dods mr tyrrel knows the meaning of itullah kerim says he after he had drunk about a gallon of brandypunchullah kerim says the hypocritical old rogue as if he had done the finest thing in the world  and what for no what for shouldna the honest man say a blessing after his drap punch demanded mrs dods it was better i ween than blasting and blawing and swearing as if folks shouldna be thankful for the creature comforts  well said old dame dods replied the traveller that is a right hostesss maxim and worthy of mrs quickly herself here is to thee and i pray ye to pledge me before ye leave the room  troth ill pledge naebody the night maister touchwood for what wi the upcast and terror that i got a wee while syne and what wi the bit taste that i behoved to take of the plottie while i was making it my head is sair eneugh distressed the night alreadymaister tirl the yellow room is ready for ye when ye like and gentlemen as the morn is the sabbath i canna be keeping the servant queans out of their beds to wait on ye ony langer for they will mak it an excuse for lying till aught oclock on the lords day so when your plottie is done ill be muckle obliged to ye to light the bedroom candles and put out the double moulds and een show yoursells to your beds for douce folks sic as the like of you should set an example by ordinaryand so gudenight to ye baith  by my faith said touchwood as she withdrew our dame turns as obstinate as a pacha with three tailswe have her gracious permission to finish our mug however so here is to your health once more mr tyrrel wishing you a hearty welcome to your own country  i thank you mr touchwood answered tyrrel and i return you the same good wishes with as i sincerely hope a much greater chance of their being realizedyou relieved me sir at a time when the villainy of an agent prompted as i have reason to think by an active and powerful enemy occasioned my being for a time pressed for fundsi made remittances to the ragion you dealt with to acquit myself at least of the pecuniary part of my obligation but the bills were returned because it was stated you had left smyrna  very truevery trueleft smyrna and here i am in scotlandas for the bills we will speak of them another timesomething due for picking me out of the gutter  i shall make no deduction on that account said tyrrel smiling though in no jocose mood and i beg you not to mistake me the circumstances of embarrassment under which you found me at smyrna were merely temporaryi am most able and willing to pay my debt and let me add i am most desirous to do so  another timeanother time said mr touchwoodtime enough before us mr tyrrelbesides at smyrna you talked of a lawsuitlaw is a lickpenny mr tyrrelno counsellor like the pound in purse  for my lawsuit said tyrrel i am fully provided  but have you good advicehave you good advice said touchwood answer me that  i have advised with my lawyers answered tyrrel internally vexed to find that his friend was much disposed to make his generosity upon the former occasion a pretext for prying farther into his affairs now than he thought polite or convenient  with your counsel learned in the laweh my dear boy but the advice you should take is of some travelled friend well acquainted with mankind and the worldsome one that has lived double your years and is maybe looking out for some bare young fellow that he may do a little good toone that might be willing to help you farther than i can pretend to guessfor as to your lawyer you get just your guineas worth from himnot even so much as the bakers bargain thirteen to the dozen  i think i should not trouble myself to go far in search of a friend such as you describe said tyrrel who could not affect to misunderstand the seniors drift when i was near mr peregrine touchwood but the truth is my affairs are at present so much complicated with those of others whose secrets i have no right to communicate that i cannot have the advantage of consulting you or any other friend it is possible i may be soon obliged to lay aside this reserve and vindicate myself before the whole public i will not fail when that time shall arrive to take an early opportunity of confidential communication with you  that is rightconfidential is the wordno person ever made a confidant of me who repented itthink what the pacha might have made of it had he taken my advice and cut through the isthmus of suezturk and christian men of all tongues and countries used to consult old touchwood from the building of a mosque down to the settling of an agiobut comegoodnightgoodnight  so saying he took up his bedroom light and extinguished one of those which stood on the table nodded to tyrrel to discharge his share of the duty imposed by mrs dods with the same punctuality and they withdrew to their several apartments entertaining very different sentiments of each other  a troublesome inquisitive old gentleman said tyrrel to himself i remember him narrowly escaping the bastinado at smyrna for thrusting his advice on the turkish cadiand then i lie under a considerable obligation to him giving him a sort of right to annoy mewell i must parry his impertinence as i can  a shy cock this frank tyrrel thought the traveller a very complete dodgerbut no matteri shall wind him were he to double like a foxi am resolved to make his matters my own and if i cannot carry him through i know not who can  having formed this philanthropic resolution mr touchwood threw himself into bed which luckily declined exactly at the right angle and full of selfcomplacency consigned himself to slumber     chapter x  mediation      so begone     we will not now be troubled with reply     we offer fair take it advisedly  king henry iv part i   it had been the purpose of tyrrel by rising and breakfasting early to avoid again meeting mr touchwood having upon his hands a matter in which that officious gentlemans interference was likely to prove troublesome his character he was aware had been assailed at the spa in the most public manner and in the most public manner he was resolved to demand redress conscious that whatever other important concerns had brought him to scotland must necessarily be postponed to the vindication of his honour he was determined for this purpose to go down to the rooms when the company was assembled at the breakfast hour and had just taken his hat to set out when he was interrupted by mrs dods who announcing a gentleman that was speering for him ushered into the chamber a very fashionable young man in a military surtout covered with silk lace and fur and wearing a foragingcap a dress now too familiar to be distinguished but which at that time was used only by geniuses of a superior order the stranger was neither handsome nor plain but had in his appearance a good deal of pretension and the cool easy superiority which belongs to high breeding on his part he surveyed tyrrel and as his appearance differed perhaps from that for which the exterior of the cleikum inn had prepared him he abated something of the air with which he had entered the room and politely announced himself as captain jekyl of the  guards presenting at the same time his ticket  he presumed he spoke to mr martigny  to mr francis tyrrel sir replied tyrrel drawing himself upmartigny was my mothers namei have never borne it  i am not here for the purpose of disputing that point mr tyrrel though i am not entitled to admit what my principals information leads him to doubt  your principal i presume is sir bingo binks said tyrrel i have not forgotten that there is an unfortunate affair between us  i have not the honour to know sir bingo binks said captain jekyl i come on the part of the earl of etherington  tyrrel stood silent for a moment and then said i am at a loss to know what the gentleman who calls himself earl of etherington can have to say to me through the medium of such a messenger as yourself captain jekyl i should have supposed that considering our unhappy relationship and the terms on which we stand towards each other the lawyers were the fitter negotiators between us  sir said captain jekyl you are misunderstanding my errand i am come on no message of hostile import from lord etheringtoni am aware of the connexion betwixt you which would render such an office altogether contradictory to common sense and the laws of nature and i assure you i would lay down my life rather than be concerned in an affair so unnatural i would act if possible as a mediator betwixt you  they had hitherto remained standing mr tyrrel now offered his guest a seat and having assumed one himself he broke the awkward pause which ensued by observing i should be happy after experiencing such a long course of injustice and persecution from your friend to learn even at this late period captain jekyl any thing which can make me think better either of him or of his purpose towards me and towards others  mr tyrrel said captain jekyl you must allow me to speak with candour there is too great a stake betwixt your brother and you to permit you to be friends but i do not see it is necessary that you should therefore be mortal enemies  i am not my brothers enemy captain jekyl said tyrreli have never been sohis friend i cannot be and he knows but too well the insurmountable barrier which his own conduct has placed between us  i am aware said captain jekyl slowly and expressively generally at least of the particulars of your unfortunate disagreement  if so said tyrrel colouring you must be also aware with what extreme pain i feel myself compelled to enter on such a subject with a total strangera stranger too the friend and confidant of one whobut i will not hurt your feelings captain jekyl but rather endeavour to suppress my own in one word i beg to be favoured with the import of your communication as i am obliged to go down to the spa this morning in order to put to rights some matters there which concern me nearly  if you mean the cause of your absence from an appointment with sir bingo binks said captain jekyl the matter has been already completely explained i pulled down the offensive placard with my own hand and rendered myself responsible for your honour to any one who should presume to hold it in future doubt  sir said tyrrel very much surprised i am obliged to you for your intention the more so as i am ignorant how i have merited such interference it is not however quite satisfactory to me because i am accustomed to be the guardian of my own honour  an easy task i presume in all cases mr tyrrel answered jekyl but peculiarly so in the present when you will find no one so hardy as to assail itmy interference indeed would have been unjustifiably officious had i not been at the moment undertaking a commission implying confidential intercourse with you for the sake of my own character it became necessary to establish yours i know the truth of the whole affair from my friend the earl of etherington who ought to thank heaven so long as he lives that saved him on that occasion from the commission of a very great crime  your friend sir has had in the course of his life much to thank heaven for but more for which to ask gods forgiveness  i am no divine sir replied captain jekyl with spirit but i have been told that the same may be said of most men alive  i at least cannot dispute it said tyrrel but to proceedhave you found yourself at liberty captain jekyl to deliver to the public the whole particulars of a rencontre so singular as that which took place between your friend and me  i have not sir said jekyli judged it a matter of great delicacy and which each of you had the like interest to preserve secret  may i beg to know then said tyrrel how it was possible for you to vindicate my absence from sir bingos rendezvous otherwise  it was only necessary sir to pledge my word as a gentleman and a man of honour characters in which i am pretty well known to the world that to my certain personal knowledge you were hurt in an affair with a friend of mine the further particulars of which prudence required should be sunk into oblivion i think no one will venture to dispute my word or to require more than my assuranceif there should be any one very hard of faith on the occasion i shall find a way to satisfy him in the meanwhile your outlawry has been rescinded in the most honourable manner and sir bingo in consideration of his share in giving rise to reports so injurious to you is desirous to drop all further proceedings in his original quarrel and hopes the whole matter will be forgot and forgiven on all sides  upon my word captain jekyl answered tyrrel you lay me under the necessity of acknowledging obligation to you you have cut a knot which i should have found it very difficult to unloose for i frankly confess that while i was determined not to remain under the stigma put upon me i should have had great difficulty in clearing myself without mentioning circumstances which were it only for the sake of my fathers memory should be buried in eternal oblivion i hope your friend feels no continued inconvenience from his hurt  his lordship is nearly quite recovered said jekyl  and i trust he did me the justice to own that so far as my will was concerned i am totally guiltless of the purpose of hurting him  he does you full justice in that and every thing else replied jekyl regrets the impetuosity of his own temper and is determined to be on his guard against it in future  that said tyrrel is so far well and now may i ask once more what communication you have to make to me on the part of your friendwere it from any one but him whom i have found so uniformly false and treacherous your own fairness and candour would induce me to hope that this unnatural quarrel might be in some sort ended by your mediation  i then proceed sir under more favourable auspices than i expected said captain jekyl to enter on my commissionyou are about to commence a lawsuit mr tyrrel if fame does not wrong you for the purpose of depriving your brother of his estate and title  the case is not fairly stated captain jekyl replied tyrrel i commence a lawsuit when i do commence it for the sake of ascertaining my own just rights  it comes to the same thing eventually said the mediator i am not called upon to decide upon the justice of your claims but they are you will allow newly started the late countess of etherington died in possessionopen and undoubted possessionof her rank in society  if she had no real claim to it sir replied tyrrel she had more than justice who enjoyed it so long and the injured lady whose claims were postponed had just so much lessbut this is no point for you and me to discuss between usit must be tried elsewhere  proofs sir of the strongest kind will be necessary to overthrow a right so well established in public opinion as that of the present possessor of the title of etherington  tyrrel took a paper from his pocketbook and handing it to captain jekyl only answered i have no thoughts of asking you to give up the cause of your friend but methinks the documents of which i give you a list may shake your opinion of it  captain jekyl read muttering to himself certificate of marriage by the rev zadock kemp chaplain to the british embassy at paris between marie de bellroche comptesse de martigny and the right honourable john lord oakendaleletters between john earl of etherington and his lady under the title of madame de martignycertificate of baptismdeclaration of the earl of etherington on his deathbedall this is very wellbut may i ask you mr tyrrel if it is really your purpose to go to extremity with your brother  he has forgot that he is onehe has lifted his hand against my life  you have shed his bloodtwice shed it said jekyl the world will not ask which brother gave the offence but which received which inflicted the severest wound  your friend has inflicted one on me sir said tyrrel that will bleed while i have the power of memory  i understand you sir said captain jekyl you mean the affair of miss mowbray  spare me on that subject sir said tyrrel hitherto i have disputed my most important rightsrights which involved my rank in society my fortune the honour of my motherwith something like composure but do not say more on the topic you have touched upon unless you would have before you a madmanis it possible for you sir to have heard even the outline of this story and to imagine that i can ever reflect on the coldblooded and most inhuman stratagem which this friend of yours prepared for two unfortunates withouthe started up and walked impetuously to and fro since the fiend himself interrupted the happiness of perfect innocence there was never such an act of treacherynever such schemes of happiness destroyednever such inevitable misery prepared for two wretches who had the idiocy to repose perfect confidence in himhad there been passion in his conduct it had been the act of a mana wicked man indeed but still a human creature acting under the influence of human feelingsbut his was the deed of a calm cold calculating demon actuated by the basest and most sordid motives of selfinterest joined as i firmly believe to an early and inveterate hatred of one whose claims he considered as at variance with his own  i am sorry to see you in such a temper said captain jekyl calmly lord etherington i trust acted on very different motives than those you impute to him and if you will but listen to me perhaps something may be struck out which may accommodate these unhappy disputes  sir said tyrrel sitting down again i will listen to you with calmness as i would remain calm under the probe of a surgeon tenting a festered wound but when you touch me to the quick when you prick the very nerve you cannot expect me to endure without wincing  i will endeavour then to be as brief in the operation as i can replied captain jekyl who possessed the advantage of the most admirable composure during the whole conference i conclude mr tyrrel that the peace happiness and honour of miss mowbray are dear to you  who dare impeach her honour said tyrrel fiercely then checking himself added in a more moderate tone but one of deep feeling they are dear to me sir as my eyesight  my friend holds them in equal regard said the captain and has come to the resolution of doing her the most ample justice  he can do her justice no otherwise than by ceasing to haunt this neighbourhood to think to speak even to dream of her  lord etherington thinks otherwise said captain jekyl he believes that if miss mowbray has sustained any wrong at his hands which of course i am not called upon to admit it will be best repaired by the offer to share with her his title his rank and his fortune  his title rank and fortune sir are as much a falsehood as he is himself said tyrrel with violencemarry clara mowbray never  my friends fortune you will observe replied jekyl does not rest entirely upon the event of the lawsuit with which you mr tyrrel now threaten himdeprive him if you can of the oakendale estate he has still a large patrimony by his mother and besides as to his marriage with clara mowbray he conceives that unless it should be the ladys wish to have the ceremony repeated to which he is most desirous to defer his own opinion they have only to declare that it has already passed between them  a trick sir said tyrrel a vile infamous trick of which the lowest wretch in newgate would be ashamedthe imposition of one person for another  of that mr tyrrel i have seen no evidence whatever the clergymans certificate is clearfrancis tyrrel is united to clara mowbray in the holy bands of wedlocksuch is the tenorthere is a copynay stop one instant if you please sir you say there was an imposition in the casei have no doubt but you speak what you believe and what miss mowbray told you she was surprisedforced in some measure from the husband she had just marriedashamed to meet her former lover to whom doubtless she had made many a vow of love and neer a true onewhat wonder that unsupported by her bridegroom she should have changed her tone and thrown all the blame of her own inconstancy on the absent swaina woman at a pinch so critical will make the most improbable excuse rather than be found guilty on her own confession  there must be no jesting in this case said tyrrel his cheek becoming pale and his voice altered with passion  i am quite serious sir replied jekyl and there is no law court in britain that would take the ladys wordall she has to offer and that in her own causeagainst a whole body of evidence direct and circumstantial showing that she was by her own free consent married to the gentleman who now claims her handforgive me siri see you are much agitatedi do not mean to dispute your right of believing what you think is most crediblei only use the freedom of pointing out to you the impression which the evidence is likely to make on the minds of indifferent persons  your friend answered tyrrel affecting a composure which however he was far from possessing may think by such arguments to screen his villainy but it cannot avail himthe truth is known to heavenit is known to meand there is besides one indifferent witness upon earth who can testify that the most abominable imposition was practised on miss mowbray  you mean her cousinhannah irwin i think is her name answered jekyl you see i am fully acquainted with all the circumstances of the case but where is hannah irwin to be found  she will appear doubtless in heavens good time and to the confusion of him who now imagines the only witness of his treacherythe only one who could tell the truth of this complicated mysteryeither no longer lives or at least cannot be brought forward against him to the ruin of his schemes yes sir that slight observation of yours has more than explained to me why your friend or to call him by his true name mr valentine bulmer has not commenced his machinations sooner and also why he has commenced them now he thinks himself certain that hannah irwin is not now in britain or to be produced in a court of justicehe may find himself mistaken  my friend seems perfectly confident of the issue of his cause answered jekyl but for the ladys sake he is most unwilling to prosecute a suit which must be attended with so many circumstances of painful exposure  exposure indeed answered tyrrel thanks to the traitor who laid a mine so fearful and who now affects to be reluctant to fire itoh how i am bound to curse that affinity that restrains my hands i would be content to be the meanest and vilest of society for one hour of vengeance on this unexampled hypocriteone thing is certain siryour friend will have no living victim his persecution will kill clara mowbray and fill up the cup of his crimes with the murder of one of the sweetesti shall grow a woman if i say more on the subject  my friend said jekyl since you like best to have him so defined is as desirous as you can be to spare the ladys feelings and with that view not reverting to former passages he has laid before her brother a proposal of alliance with which mr mowbray is highly pleased  ha said tyrrel startingand the lady  and the lady so far proved favourable as to consent that lord etherington shall visit shawscastle  her consent must have been extorted exclaimed tyrrel  it was given voluntarily said jekyl as i am led to understand unless perhaps in so far as the desire to veil these very unpleasing transactions may have operated i think naturally enough to induce her to sink them in eternal secrecy by accepting lord etheringtons handi see sir i give you pain and am sorry for iti have no title to call upon you for any exertion of generosity but should such be miss mowbrays sentiments is it too much to expect of you that you will not compromise the ladys honour by insisting upon former claims and opening up disreputable transactions so long past  captain jekyl said tyrrel solemnly i have no claims whatever i might have had were cancelled by the act of treachery through which your friend endeavoured too successfully to supplant me were clara mowbray as free from her pretended marriage as law could pronounce her still with meme at least of all men in the worldthe obstacle must ever remain that the nuptial benediction has been pronounced over her and the man whom i must for once call brotherhe stopped at that word as if it had cost him agony to pronounce it and then resumedno sir i have no views of personal advantage in this matterthey have been long annihilatedbut i will not permit clara mowbray to become the wife of a villaini will watch over her with thoughts as spotless as those of her guardian angel i first persuaded her to quit the path of dutyiibi of all men who live am bound to protect her from the miseryfrom the guiltwhich must attach to her as this mans wife i will never believe that she wishes iti will never believe that in calm mind and sober reason she can be brought to listen to such a guilty proposalbut her mindalasis not of the firm texture it once could boast and your friend knows well how to press on the spring of every passion that can agitate and alarm her threats of exposure may extort her consent to this most unfitting match if they do not indeed drive her to suicide which i think the most likely termination i will therefore be strong where she is weakyour friend sir must at least strip his proposals of their fine gilding i will satisfy mr mowbray of st ronans of his false pretences both to rank and fortune and i rather think he will protect his sister against the claim of a needy profligate though he might be dazzled with the alliance of a wealthy peer  your cause sir is not yet won answered jekyl and when it is your brother will retain property enough to entitle him to marry a greater match than miss mowbray besides the large estate of nettlewood to which that alliance must give him right but i would wish to make some accommodation between you if it were possible you profess mr tyrrel to lay aside all selfish wishes and views in this matter and to look entirely to miss mowbrays safety and happiness  such upon my honour is the exclusive purpose of my interferencei would give all i am worth to procure her an hour of quietfor happiness she will never know again  your anticipations of miss mowbrays distress said jekyl are i understand founded upon the character of my friend you think him a man of light principle and because he overreached you in a juvenile intrigue you conclude that now in his more steady and advanced years the happiness of the lady in whom you are so much interested ought not to be trusted to him  there may be other grounds said tyrrel hastily but you may argue upon those you have named as sufficient to warrant my interference  how then if i should propose some accommodation of this nature lord etherington does not pretend to the ardour of a passionate lover he lives much in the world and has no desire to quit it miss mowbrays health is delicateher spirits variableand retirement would most probably be her choicesupposei am barely putting a suppositionsuppose that a marriage between two persons so circumstanced were rendered necessary or advantageous to bothsuppose that such a marriage were to secure to one party a large estatewere to insure the other against all the consequences of an unpleasant exposurestill both ends might be obtained by the mere ceremony of marriage passing between them there might be a previous contract of separation with suitable provisions for the lady and stipulations by which the husband should renounce all claim to her society such things happen every season if not on the very marriage day yet before the honeymoon is overwealth and freedom would be the ladys and as much rank as you sir supposing your claims just may think proper to leave them  there was a long pause during which tyrrel underwent many changes of countenance which jekyl watched carefully without pressing him for an answer at length he replied there is much in your proposal captain jekyl which i might be tempted to accede to as one manner of unloosing this gordian knot and a compromise by which miss mowbrays future tranquillity would be in some degree provided for but i would rather trust a fanged adder than your friend unless i saw him fettered by the strongest ties of interest besides i am certain the unhappy lady could never survive the being connected with him in this manner though but for the single moment when they should appear together at the altar there are other objections  he checked himself paused and then proceeded in a calm and selfpossessed tone you think perhaps even yet that i have some selfish and interested views in this business and probably you may feel yourself entitled to entertain the same suspicion towards me which i avowedly harbour respecting every proposition which originates with your friendi cannot help iti can but meet these disadvantageous impressions with plain dealing and honesty and it is in the spirit of both that i make a proposition to youyour friend is attached to rank fortune and worldly advantages in the usual proportion at least in which they are pursued by men of the worldthis you must admit and i will not offend you by supposing more  i know few people who do not desire such advantages answered captain jekyl and i frankly own that he affects no particular degree of philosophic indifference respecting them  be it so answered tyrrel indeed the proposal you have just made indicates that his pretended claim on this young ladys hand is entirely or almost entirely dictated by motives of interest since you are of opinion that he would be contented to separate from her society on the very marriage day provided that in doing so he was assured of the nettlewood property  my proposition was unauthorized by my principal answered jekyl but it is needless to deny that its very tenor implies an idea on my part that lord etherington is no passionate lover  well then answered tyrrel consider sir and let him consider well that the estate and rank he now assumes depend upon my will and pleasurethat if i prosecute the claims of which that scroll makes you aware he must descend from the rank of an earl into that of a commoner stripped of by much the better half of his fortunea diminution which would be far from compensated by the estate of nettlewood even if he could obtain it which could only be by means of a lawsuit precarious in the issue and most dishonourable in its very essence  well sir replied jekyl i perceive your argumentwhat is your proposal  that i will abstain from prosecuting my claim on those honours and that propertythat i will leave valentine bulmer in possession of his usurped title and illdeserved wealththat i will bind myself under the strongest penalties never to disturb his possession of the earldom of etherington and estates belonging to iton condition that he allows the woman whose peace of mind he has ruined for ever to walk through the world in her wretchedness undisturbed either by his marriagesuit or by any claim founded upon his own most treacherous conductin short that he forbear to molest clara mowbray either by his presence word letter or through the intervention of a third party and be to her in future as if he did not exist  this is a singular offer said the captain may i ask if you are serious in making it  i am neither surprised nor offended at the question said tyrrel i am a man sir like others and affect no superiority to that which all men desire the possession ofa certain consideration and station in society i am no romantic fool to undervalue the sacrifice i am about to make i renounce a rank which is and ought to be the more valuable to me because it involves he blushed as he spoke the fame of an honoured motherbecause in failing to claim it i disobey the commands of a dying father who wished that by doing so i should declare to the world the penitence which hurried him perhaps to the grave and the making which public he considered might be some atonement for his errors from an honoured place in the land i descend voluntarily to become a nameless exile for once certain that clara mowbrays peace is assured britain no longer holds meall this i do sir not in any idle strain of overheated feeling but seeing and knowing and dearly valuing every advantage which i renounceyet i do it and do it willingly rather than be the cause of farther evil to one on whom i have already brought tootoo much  his voice in spite of his exertions faltered as he concluded the sentence and a big drop which rose to his eye required him for the moment to turn towards the window  i am ashamed of this childishness he said turning again to captain jekyl if it excites your ridicule sir let it be at least a proof of my sincerity  i am far from entertaining such sentiments said jekyl respectfullyfor in a long train of fashionable follies his heart had not been utterly hardenedvery far indeed to a proposal so singular as yours i cannot be expected to answerexcept thus farthe character of the peerage is i believe indelible and cannot be resigned or assumed at pleasure if you are really earl of etherington i cannot see how your resigning the right may avail my friend  you sir it might not avail said tyrrel gravely because you perhaps might scorn to exercise a right or hold a title that was not legally yours but your friend will have no such compunctious visitings if he can act the earl to the eye of the world he has already shown that his honour and conscience will be easily satisfied  may i take a copy of the memorandum containing this list of documents said captain jekyl for the information of my constituent  the paper is at your pleasure sir replied tyrrel it is itself but a copybut captain jekyl he added with a sarcastic expression is it would seem but imperfectly let into his friends confidencehe may be assured his principal is completely acquainted with the contents of this paper and has accurate copies of the deeds to which it refers  i think it scarce possible said jekyl angrily  possible and certain answered tyrrel my father shortly preceding his death sent mewith a most affecting confession of his errorsthis list of papers and acquainted me that he had made a similar communication to your friend that he did so i have no doubt however mr bulmer may have thought proper to disguise the circumstance in communication with you one circumstance among others stamps at once his character and confirms me of the danger he apprehended by my return to britain he found means through a scoundrelly agent who had made me the usual remittances from my father while alive to withhold those which were necessary for my return from the levant and i was obliged to borrow from a friend  indeed replied jekyl it is the first time i have heard of these papersmay i enquire where the originals are and in whose custody  i was in the east answered tyrrel during my fathers last illness and these papers were by him deposited with a respectable commercial house with which he was connected they were enclosed in a cover directed to me and that again in an envelope addressed to the principal person in their firm  you must be sensible said captain jekyl that i can scarcely decide on the extraordinary offer which you have been pleased to make of resigning the claim founded on these documents unless i had a previous opportunity of examining them  you shall have that opportunityi will write to have them sent down by the postthey lie but in small compass  this then said the captain sums up all that can be said at presentsupposing these proofs to be of unexceptionable authenticity i certainly would advise my friend etherington to put to sleep a claim so important as yours even at the expense of resigning his matrimonial speculationi presume you design to abide by your offer  i am not in the habit of altering my mindstill less of retracting my word said tyrrel somewhat haughtily  we part friends i hope said jekyl rising and taking his leave  not enemies certainly captain jekyl i will own to you i owe you my thanks for extricating me from that foolish affair at the wellnothing could have put me to more inconvenience than the necessity of following to extremity a frivolous quarrel at the present moment  you will come down among us then said jekyl  i certainly shall not wish to appear to hide myself answered tyrrel it is a circumstance might be turned against methere is a party who will avail himself of every advantage i have but one path captain jekylthat of truth and honour  captain jekyl bowed and took his leave so soon as he was gone tyrrel locked the door of the apartment and drawing from his bosom a portrait gazed on it with a mixture of sorrow and tenderness until the tears dropped from his eye  it was the picture of clara mowbray such as he had known her in the days of their youthful love and taken by himself whose early turn for painting had already developed itself the features of the blooming girl might be yet traced in the fine countenance of the more matured original but what was now become of the glow which had shaded her cheekwhat of the arch yet subdued pleasantry which lurked in the eyewhat of the joyous content which composed every feature to the expression of an euphrosynealas these were long fledsorrow had laid his hand upon herthe purple light of youth was quenchedthe glance of innocent gaiety was exchanged for looks now moody with illconcealed care now animated by a spirit of reckless and satirical observation  what a wreck what a wreck exclaimed tyrrel and all of one wretchs makingcan i put the last hand to the work and be her murderer outright i cannoti cannoti will be strong in the resolve i have formedi will sacrifice allrankstationfortuneand fame revengerevenge itself the last good left merevenge itself i will sacrifice to obtain for her such tranquillity as she may be yet capable to enjoy  in this resolution he sat down and wrote a letter to the commercial house with whom the documents of his birth and other relative papers were deposited requesting that the packet containing them should be forwarded to him through the postoffice  tyrrel was neither unambitious nor without those sentiments respecting personal consideration which are usually united with deep feeling and an ardent mind it was with a trembling hand and a watery eye but with a heart firmly resolved that he sealed and dispatched the letter a step towards the resignation in favour of his mortal enemy of that rank and condition in life which was his own by right of inheritance but had so long hung in doubt betwixt them     chapter xi  intrusion       by my troth i will go with thee to the lanesendi am a kind of      burri shall stick  measure for measure   it was now far advanced in autumn the dew lay thick on the long grass where it was touched by the sun but where the sward lay in shadow it was covered with hoar frost and crisped under jekyls foot as he returned through the woods of st ronans the leaves of the ashtrees detached themselves from the branches and without an air of wind fell spontaneously on the path the mists still lay lazily upon the heights and the huge old tower of st ronans was entirely shrouded with vapour except where a sunbeam struggling with the mist penetrated into its wreath so far as to show a projecting turret upon one of the angles of the old fortress which long a favourite haunt of the raven was popularly called the corbies tower beneath the scene was open and lightsome and the robin redbreast was chirping his best to atone for the absence of all other choristers the fine foliage of autumn was seen in many a glade running up the sides of each little ravine russethued and goldenspecked and tinged frequently with the red hues of the mountainash while here and there a huge old fir the native growth of the soil flung his broad shadow over the rest of the trees and seemed to exult in the permanence of his dusky livery over the more showy but transitory brilliance by which he was surrounded  such is the scene which so often described in prose and in poetry yet seldom loses its effect upon the ear or upon the eye and through which we wander with a strain of mind congenial to the decline of the year there are few who do not feel the impression and even jekyl though bred to far different pursuits than those most favourable to such contemplation relaxed his pace to admire the uncommon beauty of the landscape  perhaps also he was in no hurry to rejoin the earl of etherington towards whose service he felt himself more disinclined since his interview with tyrrel it was clear that that nobleman had not fully reposed in his friend the confidence promised he had not made him aware of the existence of those important documents of proof on which the whole fate of his negotiation appeared now to hinge and in so far had deceived him yet when he pulled from his pocket and reread lord etheringtons explanatory letter jekyl could not help being more sensible than he had been on the first perusal how much the present possessor of that title felt alarmed at his brothers claims and he had some compassion for the natural feeling that must have rendered him shy of communicating at once the very worst view of his case even to his most confidential friend upon the whole he remembered that lord etherington had been his benefactor to an unusual extent that in return he had promised the young nobleman his active and devoted assistance in extricating him from the difficulties with which he seemed at present surrounded that in quality of his confidant he had become acquainted with the most secret transactions of his life and that it could only be some very strong cause indeed which could justify breaking off from him at this moment yet he could not help wishing either that his own obligations had been less his friends cause better or at least the friend himself more worthy of assistance  a beautiful morning sir for such a foggy dd climate as this said a voice close by jekyls ear which made him at once start out of his contemplation he turned half round and beside him stood our honest friend touchwood his throat muffled in his large indian handkerchief huge gouty shoes thrust upon his feet his bobwig well powdered and the goldheaded cane in his hand carried upright as a sergeants halberd one glance of contemptuous survey entitled jekyl according to his modish ideas to rank the old gentleman as a regularbuilt quiz and to treat him as the young gentlemen of his majestys guards think themselves entitled to use every unfashionable variety of the human species a slight inclination of a bow and a very cold you have the advantage of me sir dropped as it were unconsciously from his tongue were meant to repress the old gentlemans advances and moderate his ambition to be hail fellow well met with his betters but mr touchwood was callous to the intended rebuke he had lived too much at large upon the world and was far too confident of his own merits to take a repulse easily or to permit his modesty to interfere with any purpose which he had formed  advantage of you sir he replied i have lived too long in the world not to keep all the advantages i have and get all i canand i reckon it one that i have overtaken you and shall have the pleasure of your company to the well  i should but interrupt your worthier meditations sir said the other besides i am a modest young man and think myself fit for no better company than my ownmoreover i walk slowvery slowgood morning to you mr aai believe my treacherous memory has let slip your name sir  my namewhy your memory must have been like pat murtoughs greyhound that let the hare go before he caught it you never heard my name in your life touchwood is my name what dye think of it now you know it  i am really no connoisseur in surnames answered jekyl and it is quite the same to me whether you call yourself touchwood or touchstone dont let me keep you from walking on sir you will find breakfast far advanced at the well sir and your walk has probably given you an appetite  which will serve me to luncheontime i promise you said touchwood i always drink my coffee as soon as my feet are in my pabouchesits the way all over the east never trust my breakfast to their scalding milkandwater at the well i assure you and for walking slow i have had a touch of the gout  have you said jekyl i am sorry for that because if you have no mind to breakfast i haveand so mr touchstone goodmorrow to you  but although the young soldier went off at double quick time his pertinacious attendant kept close by his side displaying an activity which seemed inconsistent with his make and his years and talking away the whole time so as to show that his lungs were not in the least degree incommoded by the unusual rapidity of motion  nay young gentleman if you are for a good smart walk i am for you and the gout may be dd you are a lucky fellow to have youth on your side but yet so far as between the aultoun and the well i think i could walk you for your sum barring runningall heel and toeequal weight and i would match barclay himself for a mile  upon my word you are a gay old gentleman said jekyl relaxing his pace and if we must be fellowtravellers though i can see no great occasion for it i must even shorten sail for you  so saying and as if another means of deliverance had occurred to him he slackened his pace took out a morocco case of cigars and lighting one with his briquet said while he walked on and bestowed as much of its fragrance as he could upon the face of his intrusive companion vergeben sie mein herrich bin erzogen in kaiserlicher dienstmuss rauchen ein kleine wenigii6  rauchen sie immer fort said touchwood producing a huge meerschaum which suspended by a chain from his neck lurked in the bosom of his coat habe auch mein pfeichensehen sie den lieben topfii7 and he began to return the smoke if not the fire of his companion in full volumes and with interest  the devil take the twaddle said jekyl to himself he is too old and too fat to be treated after the manner of professor jackson and on my life i cannot tell what to make of himhe is a residenter tooi must tip him the cold shoulder or he will be pestering me eternally  accordingly he walked on sucking his cigar and apparently in as abstracted a mood as mr cargill himself without paying the least attention to touchwood who nevertheless continued talking as if he had been addressing the most attentive listener in scotland whether it were the favourite nephew of a cross old rich bachelor or the aiddecamp of some old rusty firelock of a general who tells stories of the american war  and so sir i can put up with any companion at a pinch for i have travelled in all sorts of ways from a caravan down to a carriers cart but the best society is the best every where and i am happy i have fallen in with a gentleman who suits me so well as youthat grave steady attention of yours reminds me of elfi beyyou might talk to him in english or any thing he understood least ofyou might have read aristotle to elfi and not a muscle would he stirgive him his pipe and he would sit on his cushion with a listening air as if he took in every word of what you said  captain jekyl threw away the remnant of his cigar with a little movement of pettishness and began to whistle an opera air  there again nowthat is just so like the marquis of roccombole another dear friend of mine that whistles all the time you talk to himhe says he learned it in the reign of terror when a man was glad to whistle to show his throat was whole and talking of great folk what do you think of this affair between lord etherington and his brother or cousin as some folk call him  jekyl absolutely started at the question a degree of emotion which had it been witnessed by any of his fashionable friends would for ever have ruined his pretensions to rank in the first order  what affair he asked so soon as he could command a certain degree of composure  why you know the news surely francis tyrrel whom all the company voted a coward the other day turns out as brave a fellow as any of us for instead of having run away to avoid having his own throat cut by sir bingo binks he was at the very moment engaged in a gallant attempt to murder his elder brother or his more lawful brother or his cousin or some such near relation  i believe you are misinformed sir said jekyl dryly and then resumed as deftly as he could his proper character of a pococurante  i am told continued touchwood one jekyl acted as a second to them both on the occasiona proper fellow sirone of those fine gentlemen whom we pay for polishing the pavement in bond street and looking at a thick shoe and a pair of worsted stockings as if the wearer were none of their paymasters however i believe the commanderinchief is like to discard him when he hears what has happened  sir said jekyl fiercelythen recollecting the folly of being angry with an original of his companions description he proceeded more coolly you are misinformedcaptain jekyl knew nothing of any such matter as you refer toyou talk of a person you know nothing ofcaptain jekyl ishere he stopped a little scandalized perhaps at the very idea of vindicating himself to such a personage from such a charge  ay ay said the traveller filling up the chasm in his own way he is not worth our talking of certainlybut i believe he knew as much of the matter as either you or i do for all that  sir this is either a very great mistake or wilful impertinence answered the officer however absurd or intrusive you may be i cannot allow you either in ignorance or incivility to use the name of captain jekyl with disrespecti am captain jekyl sir  very like very like said touchwood with the most provoking indifference i guessed as much before  then sir you may guess what is likely to follow when a gentleman hears himself unwarrantably and unjustly slandered replied captain jekyl surprised and provoked that his annunciation of name and rank seemed to be treated so lightly i advise you sir not to proceed too far upon the immunities of your age and insignificance  i never presume farther than i have good reason to think necessary captain jekyl answered touchwood with great composure i am too old as you say for any such idiotical business as a duel which no nation i know of practises but our silly fools of europeand then as for your switch which you are grasping with so much dignity that is totally out of the question look you young gentleman fourfifths of my life have been spent among men who do not set a mans life at the value of a button on his collarevery person learns in such cases to protect himself as he can and whoever strikes me must stand to the consequences i have always a brace of bulldogs about me which put age and youth on a level so suppose me horsewhipped and pray at the same time suppose yourself shot through the body the same exertion of imagination will serve for both purposes  so saying he exhibited a very handsome highly finished and richlymounted pair of pistols  catch me without my tools said he significantly buttoning his coat over the arms which were concealed in a sidepocket ingeniously contrived for that purpose i see you do not know what to make of me he continued in a familiar and confidential tone but to tell you the truth everybody that has meddled in this st ronans business is a little off the hookssomething of a t√™te exalt√©e in plain words a little crazy or so and i do not affect to be much wiser than other people  sir said jekyl your manners and discourse are so unprecedented that i must ask your meaning plainly and decidedlydo you mean to insult me or no  no insult at all young gentlemanall fair meaning and above boardi only wished to let you know what the world may say that is all  sir said jekyl hastily the world may tell what lies it pleases but i was not present at the rencontre between etherington and mr tyrreli was some hundred miles off  there now said touchwood there was a rencontre between themthe very thing i wanted to know  sir said jekyl aware too late that in his haste to vindicate himself he had committed his friend i desire you will found nothing on an expression hastily used to vindicate myself from a false aspersioni only meant to say if there was an affair such as you talk of i knew nothing of it  never mindnever mindi shall make no bad use of what i have learned said touchwood were you to eat your words with the best fishsauce and that is burgesss i have got all the information from them i wanted  you are strangely pertinacious sir replied jekyl  o a rock a piece of flint for thatwhat i have learned i have learned but i will make no bad use of ithark ye captain i have no malice against your friendperhaps the contrarybut he is in a bad course sirhas kept a false reckoning for as deep as he thinks himself and i tell you so because i hold you your finery out of the question to be as hamlet says indifferent honest but if you were not why necessity is necessity and a man will take a bedouin for his guide in the desert whom he would not trust with an aspar in the cultivated field so i think of reposing some confidence in youhave not made up my mind yet though  on my word sir i am greatly flattered both by your intentions and your hesitation said captain jekyl you were pleased to say just now that every one concerned with these matters was something particular  ay aysomething crazya little mad or so that was what i said and i can prove it  i should be glad to hear the proof said jekyli hope you do not except yourself  oh by no means answered touchwood i am one of the maddest old boys ever slept out of straw or went loose but you can put fishing questions in your turn captain i see thatyou would fain know how much or how little i am in all these secrets well that is as hereafter may be in the meantime here are my proofsold scrogie mowbray was mad to like the sound of mowbray better than that of scrogie young scrogie was mad not to like it as well the old earl of etherington was not sane when he married a french wife in secret and devilish mad indeed when he married an english one in public then for the good folk here mowbray of st ronans is cracked when he wishes to give his sister to he knows not precisely whom she is a fool not to take him because she does know who he is and what has been between them and your friend is maddest of all who seeks her under so heavy a penaltyand you and i captain go mad gratis for companys sake when we mix ourselves with such a mess of folly and frenzy  really sir all that you have said is an absolute riddle to me replied the embarrassed jekyl  riddles may be read said touchwood nodding if you have any desire to read mine pray take notice that this being our first interview i have exerted myself faire les frais du conversation as jack frenchman says if you want another you may come to mrs dodss at the cleikum inn any day before saturday at four precisely when you will find none of your halfstarved longlimbed bundles of bones which you call poultry at the tabledh√¥te but a right chittygong fowli got mrs dods the breed from old ben vandewash the dutch brokerstewed to a minute with rice and mushroomsif you can eat without a silver fork and your appetite serves you you shall be welcomethats allso good morning to you good master lieutenant for a captain of the guards is but a lieutenant after all  so saying and ere jekyl could make any answer the old gentleman turned short off into a path which led to the healing fountain branching away from that which conducted to the hotel  uncertain with whom he had been holding a conversation so strange jekyl remained looking after him until his attention was roused by a little boy who crept out from an adjoining thicket with a switch in his hand which he had been just cuttingprobably against regulations to the contrary effect made and provided for he held himself ready to take cover in the copse again in case any one were in sight who might be interested in chastising his delinquency captain jekyl easily recognised in him one of that hopeful class of imps who pick up a precarious livelihood about places of public resort by going errands brushing shoes doing the grooms and coachmans work in the stables driving donkeys opening gates and so forth for about onetenth part of their time spending the rest in gambling sleeping in the sun and otherwise qualifying themselves to exercise the profession of thieves and pickpockets either separately or in conjunction with those of waiters grooms and postilions the little outcast had an indifferent pair of pantaloons and about half a jacket for like pentapolin with the naked arm he went on action with his right shoulder bare a third part of what had once been a hat covered his hair bleached white with the sun and his face as brown as a berry was illuminated by a pair of eyes which for spying out either peril or profit might have rivalled those of the hawkin a word it was the original puck of the shaws dramaticals  come hither ye unhanged whelp said jekyl and tell me if you know the old gentleman that passed down the walk just nowyonder he is still in sight  it is the naboab said the boy i could swear to his back among all the backs at the waal your honour  what do you call a nabob you varlet  a naboaba naboab answered the scout odd i believe it is ane comes frae foreign parts with mair siller than his pouches can haud and spills it a through the countrythey are as yellow as orangers and maun hae a thing their ain gate  and what is this naboabs name as you call him demanded jekyl  his name is touchwood said his informer ye may see him at the waal every morning  i have not seen him at the ordinary  na na answered the boy he is a queer auld cull he disna frequent wi other folk but lives upby at the cleikumhe gave me halfacrown yince and forbade me to play it awa at pitch and toss  and you disobeyed him of course  na i didna disobeyed himi played it awa at neevieneevienicknack  well there is sixpence for thee lose it to the devil in any way thou thinkst proper  so saying he gave the little galopin his donative and a slight rap on the pate at the same time which sent him scouring from his presence he himself hastened to lord etheringtons apartments and as luck would have it found the earl alone  footnotes  ii6 forgive me sir i was bred in the imperial service and must smoke a little  ii7 smoke as much as you please i have got my pipe toosee what a beautiful head     chapter xii  discussion      i will converse with ironwitted fools     and unrespective boysnone are for me     that look into me with suspicious eyes  richard iii   how now jekyl said lord etherington eagerly what news from the enemyhave you seen him  i have replied jekyl  and in what humour did you find himin none that was very favourable i dare say for you have a baffled and perplexed look that confesses a losing gamei have often warned you how your hangdog look betrays you at bragand then when you would fain brush up your courage and put a good face on a bad game your bold looks always remind me of a standard hoisted only halfmast high and betraying melancholy and dejection instead of triumph and defiance  i am only holding the cards for your lordship at present answered jekyl and i wish to heaven there may be no one looking over the hand  how do you mean by that  why i was beset on returning through the wood by an old bore a nabob as they call him and touchwood by name  i have seen such a quiz about said lord etheringtonwhat of him  nothing answered jekyl except that he seemed to know much more of your affairs than you would wish or are aware of he smoked the truth of the rencontre betwixt tyrrel and you and what is worsei must needs confess the truthhe contrived to wring out of me a sort of confirmation of his suspicions  slife wert thou mad said lord etherington turning pale his is the very tongue to send the story through the whole countryhal you have undone me  i hope not said jekyl i trust in heaven i have nothis knowledge is quite generalonly that there was some scuffle between youdo not look so dismayed about it or i will een go back and cut his throat to secure his secrecy  cursed indiscretion answered the earlhow could you let him fix on you at all  i cannot tell said jekylhe has powers of boring beyond ten of the dullest of all possible doctorsstuck like a limpet to a rocka perfect double of the old man of the sea who i take to have been the greatest bore on record  could you not have turned him on his back like a turtle and left him there said lord etherington  and had an ounce of lead in my body for my pains nonowe have already had footpad work enoughi promise you the old buck was armed as if he meant to bing folks on the low tobyii8  wellwellbut martigny or tyrrel as you call himwhat says he  why tyrrel or martigny as your lordship calls him answered jekyl will by no means listen to your lordships proposition he will not consent that miss mowbrays happiness shall be placed in your lordships keeping nay it did not meet his approbation a bit the more when i hinted at the acknowledgment of the marriage or the repetition of the ceremony attended by an immediate separation which i thought i might venture to propose  and on what grounds does he refuse so reasonable an accommodation said lord etheringtondoes he still seek to marry the girl himself  i believe he thinks the circumstances of the case render that impossible replied his confidant  what then he would play the dog in the mangerneither eat nor let eathe shall find himself mistaken she has used me like a dog jekyl since i saw you and by jove i will have her that i may break her pride and cut him to the liver with the agony of seeing it  nay but holdhold said jekyl perhaps i have something to say on his part that may be a better compromise than all you could have by teasing him he is willing to purchase what he calls miss mowbrays tranquillity at the expense of his resignation of his claims to your fathers honours and estate and he surprised me very much my lord by showing me this list of documents which i am afraid makes his success more than probable if there really are such proofs in existence lord etherington took the paper and seemed to read with much attention while jekyl proceededhe has written to procure these evidences from the person with whom they are deposited  we shall see what like they are when they arrive said lord etheringtonthey come by post i suppose  yes and may be immediately expected answered jekyl  wellhe is my brother on one side of the house at least said lord etherington and i should not much like to have him lagged for forgery which i suppose will be the end of his bolstering up an unsubstantial plea by fabricated documentsi should like to see these same papers he talks of  but my lord replied jekyl tyrrels allegation is that you have seen them and that copies at least were made out for you and are in your possessionsuch is his averment  he lies answered lord etherington so far as he pretends i know of such papers i consider the whole story as frothfoamfudge or whatever is most unsubstantial it will prove such when the papers appear if indeed they ever will appear the whole is a bully from beginning to end and i wonder at thee jekyl for being so thirsty after syllabub that you can swallow such whipt cream as that stuff amounts to no noi know my advantage and shall use it so as to make all their hearts bleed as for these papers i recollect now that my agent talked of copies of some manuscripts having been sent him but the originals were not then forthcoming and ill bet the long odds that they never aremere fabricationsif i thought otherwise would i not tell you  certainly i hope you would my lord said jekyl for i see no chance of my being useful to you unless i have the honour to enjoy your confidence  you doyou do my friend said etherington shaking him by the hand and since i must consider your present negotiation as failed i must devise some other mode of settling with this mad and troublesome fellow  no violence my lord said jekyl once more and with much emphasis  nonenonenone by heavenwhy thou suspicious wretch must i swear to quell your scrupleson the contrary it shall not be my fault if we are not on decent terms  it would be infinitely to the advantage of both your characters if you could bring that to pass answered jekyl and if you are serious in wishing it i will endeavour to prepare tyrrel he comes to the well or to the ordinary today and it would be highly ridiculous to make a scene  true true find him out my dear jekyl and persuade him how foolish it will be to bring our family quarrels out before strangers and for their amusement they shall see the two bears can meet without bitinggogoi will follow you instantlygo and remember you have my full and exclusive confidencego halfbred startling fool he continued the instant jekyl had left the room with just spirits enough to ensure your own ruin by hurrying you into what you are not up tobut he has character in the worldis braveand one of those whose countenance gives a fair face to a doubtful business he is my creature tooi have bought and paid for him and it would be idle extravagance not to make use of himbut as to confidenceno confidence honest hal beyond that which cannot be avoided if i wanted a confidant here comes a better than thou by halfsolmes has no scrupleshe will always give me moneys worth of zeal and secrecy for money  his lordships valet at this moment entered the apartment a grave civillooking man past the middle age with a sallow complexion a dark thoughtful eye slow and sparing of speech and sedulously attentive to all the duties of his situation  solmessaid lord etherington and then stopped short  my lordthere was a pause and when lord etherington had again said solmes and his valet had answered your lordship there was a second pause until the earl as if recollecting himself oh i remember what i wished to sayit was about the course of post here it is not very regular i believe  regular enough my lord so far as concerns this placethe people in the aultoun do not get their letters in course  and why not solmes said his lordship  the old woman who keeps the little inn there my lord is on bad terms with the postmistressthe one will not send for the letters and the other will not dispatch them to the village so betwixt them they are sometimes lost or mislaid or returned to the general postoffice  i wish that may not be the case of a packet which i expect in a few daysit should have been here already or perhaps it may arrive in the beginning of the weekit is from that formal ass trueman the quaker who addresses me by my christian and family name francis tyrrel he is like enough to mistake the inn too and i should be sorry it fell into monsieur martignys handsi suppose you know he is in that neighbourhoodlook after its safety solmesquietly you understand because people might put odd constructions as if i were wanting a letter which was not my own  i understand perfectly my lord said solmes without exhibiting the slightest change in his sallow countenance though entirely comprehending the nature of the service required  and here is a note will pay for postage said the earl putting into his valets hand a bankbill of considerable value and you may keep the balance for occasional expenses  this was also fully understood and solmes too politic and cautious even to look intelligence or acknowledge gratitude made only a bow of acquiescence put the note into his pocketbook and assured his lordship that his commands should be punctually attended to  there goes the agent for my money and for my purpose said lord etherington exultingly no extorting of confidence no demanding of explanations no tearing off the veil with which a delicate manoeuvre is gaz√©all excuses are received as argent comptant provided only that the best excuse of all the argent comptant itself come to recommend themyet i will trust no onei will out like a skilful general and reconnoitre in person  with this resolution lord etherington put on his surtout and cap and sallying from his apartments took the way to the booksellers shop which also served as postoffice and circulating library and being in the very centre of the parade for so is termed the broad terrace walk which leads from the inn to the well it formed a convenient loungingplace for newsmongers and idlers of every description  the earls appearance created as usual a sensation upon the public promenade but whether it was the suggestion of his own alarmed conscience or that there was some real cause for the remark he could not help thinking his reception was of a more doubtful character than usual his fine figure and easy manners produced their usual effect and all whom he spoke to received his attention as an honour but none offered as usual to unite themselves to him or to induce him to join their party he seemed to be looked on rather as an object of observation and attention than as making one of the company and to escape from a distant gaze which became rather embarrassing he turned into the little emporium of news and literature  he entered unobserved just as lady penelope had finished reading some verses and was commenting upon them with all the alacrity of a femme savante in possession of something which no one is to hear repeated oftener than once  copyno indeed these were the snatches which reached lord etheringtons ear from the group of which her ladyship formed the centrehonour brighti must not betray poor chatterlybesides his lordship is my friend and a person of rank you knowso one would notyou have not got the book mr pottyou have not got statiusyou never have any thing one longs to see  very sorry my ladyquite out of copies at presenti expect some in my next monthly parcel  good lack mr pott that is your neverfailing answer said lady penelope i believe if i were to ask you for the last new edition of the alkoran you would tell me it was coming down in your next monthly parcel  cant say my lady really answered mr pott have not seen the work advertised yet but i have no doubt if it is likely to take there will be copies in my next monthly parcel  mr potts supplies are always in the paullo post futurum tense said mr chatterly who was just entering the shop  ah mr chatterly are you there said lady penelope i lay my death at your doori cannot find this thebaid where polynices and his brother  hush my ladyhush for heavens sake said the poetical divine and looked towards lord etherington lady penelope took the hint and was silent but she had said enough to call up the traveller touchwood who raised his head from the newspaper which he was studying and without addressing his discourse to any one in particular ejaculated as if in scorn of lady penelopes geography  polynicespolly peachumthere is no such place in the thebaisthe thebais is in egyptthe mummies come from the thebaisi have been in the catacombscaves very curious indeedwe were lapidated by the nativespebbled to some purpose i give you my word my janizary thrashed a whole village by way of retaliation  while he was thus proceeding lord etherington as if in a listless mood was looking at the letters which stood ranged on the chimneypiece and carrying on a languid dialogue with mrs pott whose person and manners were not ill adapted to her situation for she was goodlooking and vastly fine and affected  number of letters here which dont seem to find owners mrs pott  great number indeed my lordit is a great vexation for we are obliged to return them to the postoffice and the postage is charged against us if they are lost and how can one keep sight of them all  any loveletters among them mrs pott said his lordship lowering his tone  oh fie my lord how should i know answered mrs pott dropping her voice to the same cadence  oh every one can tell a loveletterthat has ever received one that isone knows them without openingthey are always folded hurriedly and sealed carefullyand the direction manifests a kind of tremulous agitation that marks the state of the writers nervesthat nowpointing with his switch to a letter upon the chimneypiece that must be a loveletter  he he he giggled mrs pott i beg pardon for laughing my lordbuthe he hethat is a letter from one bindloose the banker body to the old woman luckie dods as they call her at the changehouse in the aultoun  depend upon it then mrs pott that your neighbour mrs dods has got a lover in mr bindlooseunless the banker has been shaking hands with the palsy why do you not forward her letteryou are very cruel to keep it in durance here  me forward answered mrs pott the cappernoity old girning alewife may wait long enough or i forward itshell not loose the letters that come to her by the kings post and she must go on troking wi the old carrier as if there was no posthouse in the neighbourhood but the solicitor will be about wi her one of these days  oh you are too cruelyou really should send the loveletter consider the older she is the poor soul has the less time to lose  but this was a topic on which mrs pott understood no jesting she was well aware of our matrons inveteracy against her and her establishment and she resented it as a placeman resents the efforts of a radical she answered something sulkily that they that loosed letters should have letters and neither luckie dods nor any of her lodgers should ever see the scrape of a pen from the st ronans office that they did not call for and pay for  it is probable that this declaration contained the essence of the information which lord etherington had designed to extract by his momentary flirtation with mrs pott for when retreating as it were from this sore subject she asked him in a pretty mincing tone to try his skill in pointing out another loveletter he only answered carelessly that in order to do that he must write her one and leaving his confidential station by her little throne he lounged through the narrow shop bowed slightly to lady penelope as he passed and issued forth upon the parade where he saw a spectacle which might well have appalled a man of less selfpossession than himself  just as he left the shop little miss digges entered almost breathless with the emotion of impatience and of curiosity oh la my lady what do you stay here formr tyrrel has just entered the other end of the parade this moment and lord etherington is walking that waythey must meet each othero lord come come away and see them meeti wonder if theyll speaki hope they wont fightoh la do come my lady  i must go with you i find said lady penelope it is the strangest thing my love that curiosity of yours about other folks mattersi wonder what your mamma will say to it  oh never mind mammanobody minds herpapa nor nobodydo come dearest lady pen or i will run away by myselfmr chatterly do make her come  i must come it seems said lady penelope or i shall have a pretty account of you  but notwithstanding this rebuke and forgetting at the same time that people of quality ought never to seem in a hurry lady penelope with such of her satellites as she could hastily collect around her tripped along the parade with unusual haste in sympathy doubtless with miss diggess curiosity as her ladyship declared she had none of her own  our friend the traveller had also caught up miss diggess information and breaking off abruptly an account of the great pyramid which had been naturally introduced by the mention of the thebais and echoing the fair alarmists words hope they wont fight he rushed upon the parade and bustled along as hard as his sturdy supporters could carry him if the gravity of the traveller and the delicacy of lady penelope were surprised into unwonted haste from their eagerness to witness the meeting of tyrrel and lord etherington it may be well supposed that the decorum of the rest of the company was a slender restraint on their curiosity and that they hurried to be present at the expected scene with the alacrity of gentlemen of the fancy hastening to a setto  in truth though the meeting afforded little sport to those who expected dire conclusions it was nevertheless sufficiently interesting to those spectators who are accustomed to read the language of suppressed passion betraying itself at the moment when the parties are most desirous to conceal it  tyrrel had been followed by several loiterers so soon as he entered the public walk and their number was now so much reinforced that he saw himself with pain and displeasure the centre of a sort of crowd who watched his motions sir bingo and captain macturk were the first to bustle through it and to address him with as much politeness as they could command  servant sir mumbled sir bingo extending the right hand of fellowship and reconciliation ungloved servantsorry that anything should have happened between usvery sorry on my word  no more need be said sir replied tyrrel the whole is forgotten  very handsome indeedquite the civil thinghope to meet you often sirand here the knight was silent  meanwhile the more verbose captain proceeded och py cot and it was an awfu mistake and i could draw the penknife across my finger for having written the wordby my sowl and i scratched it till i scratched a hole in the paperoch that i should live to do an uncivil thing by a gentleman that had got himself hit in an honourable affair but you should have written my dear for how the devil could we guess that you were so well provided in quarrels that you had to settle two in one day  i was hurt in an unexpectedan accidental manner captain macturk i did not write because there was something in my circumstances at the moment which required secrecy but i was resolved the instant i recovered to put myself to rights in your good opinion  och and you have done that said the captain nodding sagaciously for captain jekyl who is a fine child has put us all up to your honourable conduct they are pretty boys these guardsmen though they may play a little fine sometimes and think more of themselves than peradventure they need for to do in comparison with us of the linebut he let us know all about itand though he said not a word of a certain fine lord with his footpad and his hurt and what not yet we all knew how to lay that and that togetherand if the law would not right you and there were bad words between you why should not two gentlemen right themselves and as to your being kinsmen why should not kinsmen behave to each other like men of honour only some say you are fathers sons and that is something too neari had once thoughts of calling out my uncle dougal myself for there is no saying where the line should be drawn but i thought on the whole there should be no fighting as there is no marriage within the forbidden degrees as for first cousinswheughthats all fairfire away flaniganbut here is my lord just upon us like a stag of the first head and the whole herd behind him  tyrrel stepped forward a little before his officious companions his complexion rapidly changing into various shades like that of one who forces himself to approach and touch some animal or reptile for which he entertains that deep disgust and abhorrence which was anciently ascribed to constitutional antipathy this appearance of constraint put upon himself with the changes which it produced on his face was calculated to prejudice him somewhat in the opinion of the spectators when compared with the steady stately yet at the same time easy demeanour of the earl of etherington who was equal to any man in england in the difficult art of putting a good countenance on a bad cause he met tyrrel with an air as unembarrassed as it was cold and while he paid the courtesy of a formal and distant salutation he said aloud i presume mr tyrrel de martigny that since you have not thought fit to avoid this awkward meeting you are disposed to remember our family connexion so far as to avoid making sport for the good company  you have nothing to apprehend from my passion mr bulmer replied tyrrel if you can assure yourself against the consequences of your own  i am glad of that said the earl with the same composure but sinking his voice so as only to be heard by tyrrel and as we may not again in a hurry hold any communication together i take the freedom to remind you that i sent you a proposal of accommodation by my friend mr jekyl  it was inadmissible said tyrrelaltogether inadmissibleboth from reasons which you may guess and others which it is needless to detaili sent you a proposition think of it well  i will replied lord etherington when i shall see it supported by those alleged proofs which i do not believe ever had existence  your conscience holds another language from your tongue said tyrrel but i disclaim reproaches and decline altercation i will let captain jekyl know when i have received the papers which you say are essential to your forming an opinion on my proposalin the meanwhile do not think to deceive me i am here for the very purpose of watching and defeating your machinations and while i live be assured they shall never succeedand now siror my lordfor the titles are in your choicefare you well  hold a little said lord etherington since we are condemned to shock each others eyes it is fit the good company should know what they are to think of us you are a philosopher and do not value the opinion of the publica poor worldling like me is desirous to stand fair with itgentlemen he continued raising his voice mr winterblossom captain macturk mrwhat is his name jekylay micklehenyou have i believe all some notion that this gentleman my near relation and i have some undecided claims on each other which prevent our living upon good terms we do not mean however to disturb you with our family quarrels and for my own part while this gentleman mr tyrrel or whatever he may please to call himself remains a member of this company my behaviour to him will be the same as to any stranger who may have that advantagegood morrow to you sirgood morning gentlemenwe all meet at dinner as usualcome jekyl  so saying he took jekyl by the arm and gently extricating himself from the sort of crowd walked off leaving most of the company prepossessed in his favour by the ease and apparent reasonableness of his demeanour sounds of depreciation forming themselves indistinctly into something like the words my eye and betty martin did issue from the neckcloth of sir bingo but they were not much attended to for it had not escaped the observation of the quicksighted gentry at the well that the baronets feelings towards the noble earl were in the inverse ratio of those displayed by lady binks and that though ashamed to testify or perhaps incapable of feeling any anxious degree of jealousy his temper had been for some time considerably upon the fret a circumstance concerning which his fair moiety did not think it necessary to give herself any concern  meanwhile the earl of etherington walked onward with his confidant in the full triumph of successful genius  you see he said jekyl that i can turn a corner with any man in england it was a proper blunder of yours that you must extricate the fellow from the mist which accident had flung around himyou might as well have published the story of our rencontre at once for every one can guess it by laying time place and circumstance together but never trouble your brains for a justification you marked how i assumed my natural superiority over himtowered up in the full pride of legitimacysilenced him even where the good company most do congregate this will go to mowbray through his agent and will put him still madder on my alliance i know he looks jealously on my flirtation with a certain ladythe dasher yondernothing makes a man sensible of the value of an opportunity but the chance of losing it  i wish to heaven you would give up thoughts of miss mowbray said jekyl and take tyrrels offer if he has the means of making it good  ay ifif but i am quite sure he has no such rights as he pretends to and that his papers are all a deceptionwhy do you put your eye upon me as fixed as if you were searching out some wonderful secret  i wish i knew what to think of your real bona fide belief respecting these documents said jekyl not a little puzzled by the steady and unembarrassed air of his friend  why thou most suspicious of coxcombs said etherington what the devil would you have me say to youcan i as the lawyers say prove a negative or is it not very possible that such things may exist though i have never seen or heard of them all i can say is that of all men i am the most interested to deny the existence of such documents and therefore certainly will not admit of it unless i am compelled to do so by their being produced nor then either unless i am at the same time well assured of their authenticity  i cannot blame you for your being hard of faith my lord said jekyl but still i think if you can cut out with your earldom and your noble hereditary estate i would in your case pitch nettlewood to the devil  yes as you pitched your own patrimony jekyl but you took care to have the spending of it firstwhat would you give for such an opportunity of piecing your fortunes by marriageconfess the truth  i might be tempted perhaps said jekyl in my present circumstances but if they were what they have been i should despise an estate that was to be held by petticoat tenure especially when the lady of the manor was a sickly fantastic girl that hated me as this miss mowbray has the bad taste to hate you  umphsicklyno no she is not sicklyshe is as healthy as any one in constitutionand on my word i think her paleness only renders her more interesting the last time i saw her i thought she might have rivalled one of canovas finest statues  yes but she is indifferent to youyou do not love her said jekyl  she is any thing but indifferent to me said the earl she becomes daily more interestingfor her dislike piques me and besides she has the insolence openly to defy and contemn me before her brother and in the eyes of all the world i have a kind of loving hatreda sort of hating love for her in short thinking upon her is like trying to read a riddle and makes one make quite as many blunders and talk just as much nonsense if ever i have the opportunity i will make her pay for all her airs  what airs said jekyl  nay the devil may describe them for i cannot but for examplesince her brother has insisted on her receiving me or i should rather say on her appearing when i visit shawscastle one would think her invention has toiled in discovering different ways of showing want of respect to me and dislike to my presence instead of dressing herself as a lady should especially on such occasions she chooses some fantastic or oldfashioned or negligent bedizening which makes her at least look odd if it cannot make her ridiculoussuch triple tiaras of variouscoloured gauze on her headsuch pieces of old tapestry i think instead of shawls and pelissessuch thicksoled shoessuch tanleather glovesmercy upon us hal the very sight of her equipment would drive mad a whole conclave of milliners then her postures are so strangeshe does so stoop and lollop as the women call it so cross her legs and square her armswere the goddess of grace to look down on her it would put her to flight for ever  and you are willing to make this awkward illdressed unmannered dowdy your countess etherington you for whose critical eye half the town dress themselves said jekyl  it is all a trick halall an assumed character to get rid of me to disgust me to baffle me but i am not to be had so easily the brother is driven to despairhe bites his nails winks coughs makes signs which she always takes up at crosspurposei hope he beats her after i go away there would be a touch of consolation were one but certain of that  a very charitable hope truly and your present feelings might lead the lady to judge what she may expect after wedlock but added jekyl cannot you so skilful in fathoming every mood of the female mind divine some mode of engaging her in conversation  conversation replied the earl why ever since the shock of my first appearance was surmounted she has contrived to vote me a nonentity and that she may annihilate me completely she has chosen of all occupations that of working a stocking from what cursed old antediluvian who lived before the invention of spinningjennies she learned this craft heaven only knows but there she sits with her work pinned to her kneenot the pretty taper silken fabric with which jeannette of amiens coquetted while tristram shandy was observing her progress but a huge worsted bag designed for some flatfooted old pauper with heels like an elephantand there she squats counting all the stitches as she works and refusing to speak or listen or look up under pretence that it disturbs her calculation  an elegant occupation truly and i wonder it does not work a cure upon her noble admirer said jekyl  confound hernoshe shall not trick me and then amid this affectation of vulgar stolidity there break out such sparkles of exultation when she thinks she has succeeded in baffling her brother and in plaguing me that by my faith hal i could not tell were it at my option whether to kiss or to cuff her  you are determined to go on with this strange affair then said jekyl  ononon my boyclara and nettlewood for ever answered the earl besides this brother of hers provokes me toohe does not do for me half what he mightwhat he ought to do he stands on points of honour forsooth this brokendown horsejockey who swallowed my two thousand pounds as a pointer would a pat of butteri can see he wishes to play fast and loosehas some suspicions like you hal upon the strength of my right to my fathers titles and estate as if with the tithe of the nettlewood property alone i would not be too good a match for one of his beggarly family he must scheme forsooth this halfbaked scotch cakehe must hold off and on and be cautious and wait the result and try conclusions with me this lump of oatmeal doughi am much tempted to make an example of him in the course of my proceedings  why this is vengeance horrible and dire said jekyl yet i give up the brother to you he is a conceited coxcomb and deserves a lesson but i would fain intercede for the sister  we shall seereplied the earl and then suddenly i tell you what it is hal her caprices are so diverting that i sometimes think out of mere contradiction i almost love her at least if she would but clear old scores and forget one unlucky prank of mine it should be her own fault if i did not make her a happy woman  footnote  ii8 rob as a footpad     chapter xiii  a deathbed      it comesit wrings me in my parting hour     the longhid crimethe welldisguised guilt     bring me some holy priest to lay the spectre  old play   the general expectation of the company had been disappointed by the pacific termination of the meeting betwixt the earl of etherington and tyrrel the anticipation of which had created so deep a sensation it had been expected that some appalling scene would have taken place instead of which each party seemed to acquiesce in a sullen neutrality and leave the war to be carried on by their lawyers it was generally understood that the cause was removed out of the courts of bellona into that of themis and although the litigants continued to inhabit the same neighbourhood and once or twice met at the public walks or public table they took no notice of each other farther than by exchanging on such occasions a grave and distant bow  in the course of two or three days people ceased to take interest in a feud so coldly conducted and if they thought of it at all it was but to wonder that both the parties should persevere in residing near the spa and in chilling with their unsocial behaviour a party met together for the purposes of health and amusement  but the brothers as the reader is aware however painful their occasional meetings might be had the strongest reasons to remain in each others neighbourhoodlord etherington to conduct his design upon miss mowbray tyrrel to disconcert his plan if possible and both to await the answer which should be returned by the house in london who were depositaries of the papers left by the late earl  jekyl anxious to assist his friend as much as possible made in the meantime a visit to old touchwood at the aultoun expecting to find him as communicative as he had formerly been on the subject of the quarrel betwixt the brothers and trusting to discover by dint of address whence he had derived his information concerning the affairs of the noble house of etherington but the confidence which he had been induced to expect on the part of the old traveller was not reposed ferdinand mendez pinto as the earl called him had changed his mind or was not in the vein of communication the only proof of his confidence worth mentioning was his imparting to the young officer a valuable receipt for concocting currypowder  jekyl was therefore reduced to believe that touchwood who appeared all his life to have been a great intermeddler in other peoples matters had puzzled out the information which he appeared to possess of lord etheringtons affairs through some of those obscure sources whence very important secrets do frequently to the astonishment and confusion of those whom they concern escape to the public he thought this the more likely as touchwood was by no means critically nice in his society but was observed to converse as readily with a gentlemans gentleman as with the gentleman to whom he belonged and with a ladys attendant as with the lady herself he that will stoop to this sort of society who is fond of tattle being at the same time disposed to pay some consideration for gratification of his curiosity and not over scrupulous respecting its accuracy may always command a great quantity of private anecdote captain jekyl naturally enough concluded that this busy old man became in some degree master of other peoples affairs by such correspondences as these and he could himself bear witness to his success in crossexamination as he had been surprised into an avowal of the rencontre between the brothers by an insidious observation of the said touchwood he reported therefore to the earl after this interview that on the whole he thought he had no reason to fear much on the subject of the traveller who though he had become acquainted by some means or other with some leading facts of his remarkable history only possessed them in a broken confused and desultory manner insomuch that he seemed to doubt whether the parties in the expected lawsuit were brothers or cousins and appeared totally ignorant of the facts on which it was to be founded  it was the next day after this √©claircissement on the subject of touchwood that lord etherington dropped as usual into the booksellers shop got his papers and skimming his eye over the shelf on which lay till called for the postponed letters destined for the aultoun saw with a beating heart the smart postmistress toss amongst them with an air of sovereign contempt a pretty large packet addressed to francis tyrrel esq c he withdrew his eyes as if conscious that even to have looked on this important parcel might engender some suspicion of his purpose or intimate the deep interest which he took in the contents of the missive which was so slightly treated by his friend mrs pott at this moment the door of the shop opened and lady penelope penfeather entered with her eternal pendante the little miss digges  have you seen mr mowbrayhas mr mowbray of st ronans been down this morningdo you know any thing of mr mowbray mrs pott were questions which the lettered lady eagerly huddled on the back of each other scarcely giving time to the lady of letters to return a decided negative to all and each of them  mr mowbray was not aboutwas not coming there this morninghis servant had just called for letters and papers and announced as much  good heaven how unfortunate said lady penelope with a deep sigh and sinking down on one of the little sofas in an attitude of shocking desolation which called the instant attention of mr pott and his good woman the first uncorking a small phial of salts for he was a pharmacopolist as well as vender of literature and transmitter of letters and the other hastening for a glass of water a strong temptation thrilled from lord etheringtons eyes to his fingerends two steps might have brought him within armslength of the unwatched packet on the contents of which in all probability rested the hope and claims of his rival in honour and fortune and in the general confusion was it impossible to possess himself of it unobserved but nononothe attempt was too dreadfully dangerous to be risked and passing from one extreme to another he felt as if he was incurring suspicion by suffering lady penelope to play off her airs of affected distress and anxiety without seeming to take that interest in them which her rank at least might be supposed to demand stung with this apprehension he hastened to express himself so anxiously on the subject and to demonstrate so busily his wish to assist her ladyship that he presently stood committed a great deal farther than he had intended lady penelope was infinitely obliged to his lordshipindeed it was her character in general not to permit herself to be overcome by circumstances but something had happened so strange so embarrassing so melancholy that she owned it had quite overcome hernotwithstanding she had at all times piqued herself on supporting her own distresses better than she was able to suppress her emotions in viewing those of others  could he be of any use lord etherington asked she had enquired after mr mowbray of st ronanshis servant was at her ladyships service if she chose to send to command his attendance  oh no no said lady penelope i dare say my dear lord you will answer the purpose a great deal better than mr mowbraythat is provided you are a justice of peace  a justice of peace said lord etherington much surprised i am in the commission unquestionably but not for any scotch county  o that does not signify said lady penelope and if you will trust yourself with me a little way i will explain to you how you can do one of the most charitable and kind and generous things in the world  lord etheringtons delight in the exercise of charity kindness and generosity was not so exuberant as to prevent his devising some means for evading lady penelopes request when looking through the sashdoor he had a distant glance of his servant solmes approaching the postoffice  i have heard of a sheepstealer who had rendered his dog so skilful an accomplice in his nefarious traffic that he used to send him out to commit acts of felony by himself and had even contrived to impress on the poor cur the caution that he should not on such occasions seem even to recognise his master if they met accidentallyii9 apparently lord etherington conducted himself upon a similar principle for he had no sooner a glimpse of his agent than he seemed to feel the necessity of leaving the stage free for his machinations  my servant he said with as much indifference as he could assume will call for my lettersi must attend lady penelope and instantly proffering his services as justice of the peace or in whatever other quality she chose to employ them he hastily presented his arm and scarce gave her ladyship time to recover from her state of languor to the necessary degree of activity ere he hurried her from the shop and with her thin hatchetface chattering close to his ear her yellow and scarlet feathers crossing his nose her lean right honourable arm hooking his elbow he braved the suppressed titters and sneers of all the younger women whom he met as they traversed the parade one glance of intelligence though shot at a distance passed betwixt his lordship and solmes as the former left the public walk under the guidance of lady penelope his limbs indeed obeying her pleasure and his ears dinned with her attempts to explain the business in question but his mind totally indifferent where he was going or ignorant on what purpose and exclusively occupied with the packet in mrs potts heap of postponed letters and its probable fate  at length an effort of recollection made lord etherington sensible that his abstraction must seem strange and as his conscience told him even suspicious in the eyes of his companion putting therefore the necessary degree of constraint upon himself he expressed for the first time curiosity to know where their walk was to terminate it chanced that this was precisely the question which he needed not to have asked if he had paid but the slightest attention to the very voluble communications of her ladyship which had all turned upon this subject  now my dear lord she said i must believe you lords of the creation think us poor simple women the vainest fools alive i have told you how much pain it costs me to speak about my little charities and yet you come to make me tell you the whole story over again but i hope after all your lordship is not surprised at what i have thought it my duty to do in this sad affairperhaps i have listened too much to the dictates of my own heart which are apt to be so deceitful  on the watch to get at something explanatory yet afraid by demanding it directly to show that the previous tide of narrative and pathos had been lost on an inattentive ear lord etherington could only say that lady penelope could not err in acting according to the dictates of her own judgment  still the compliment had not sauce enough for the ladys sated palate so like a true glutton of praise she began to help herself with the soupladle  ah judgmenthow is it you men know us so little that you think we can pause to weigh sentiment in the balance of judgmentthat is expecting rather too much from us poor victims of our feelings so that you must really hold me excused if i forgot the errors of this guilty and unhappy creature when i looked upon her wretchednessnot that i would have my little friend miss digges or your lordship suppose that i am capable of palliating the fault while i pity the poor miserable sinner oh nowalpoles verses express beautifully what one ought to feel on such occasions      for never was the gentle breast       insensible to human woes     feeling though firm it melts distressd       for weaknesses it never knows  most accursed of all pr√©cieuses thought his lordship when wilt thou amidst all thy chatter utter one word sounding like sense or information  but lady penelope went onif you knew my lord how i lament my limited means on those occasions but i have gathered something among the good people at the well i asked that selfish wretch winterblossom to walk down with me to view her distress and the heartless beast told me he was afraid of infectioninfection from a puerpuerperal fever i should not perhaps pronounce the word but science is of no sexhowever i have always used thieves vinegar essence and never have gone farther than the threshold  whatever were etheringtons faults he did not want charity so far as it consists in giving alms  i am sorry he said taking out his purse your ladyship should not have applied to me  pardon me my lord we only beg from our friends and your lordship is so constantly engaged with lady binks that we have rarely the pleasure of seeing you in what i call my little circle  lord etherington without further answer tendered a couple of guineas and observed that the poor woman should have medical attendance  why so i say answered lady penelope and i asked the brute quackleben who i am sure owes me some gratitude to go and see her but the sordid monster answered who was to pay himhe grows every day more intolerable now that he seems sure of marrying that fat blowzy widow he could not i am sure expect that iout of my pittanceand besides my lord is there not a law that the parish or the county or the something or other shall pay for physicking the poor  we will find means to secure the doctors attendance said lord etherington and i believe my best way will be to walk back to the well and send him to wait on the patient i am afraid i can be of little use to a poor woman in a childbed fever  puerperal my lord puerperal said lady penelope in a tone of correction  in a puerperal fever then said lord etherington why what can i do to help her  oh my lord you have forgotten that this anne heggie that i told you of came here with one child in her armsand anotherin short about to become a mother againand settled herself in this miserable hut i told you ofand some people think the minister should have sent her to her own parish but he is a strange softheaded sleepy sort of man not over active in his parochial duties however there she settled and there was something about her quite beyond the style of a common pauper my lordnot at all the disgusting sort of person that you give a sixpence to while you look another waybut some one that seemed to have seen better daysone that as shakspeare says could a tale unfoldthough indeed i have never thoroughly learned her historyonly that today as i called to know how she was and sent my maid into her hut with some trifle not worth mentioning i find there is something hangs about her mind concerning the mowbray family here of st ronansand my woman says the poor creature is dying and is raving either for mr mowbray or for some magistrate to receive a declaration and so i have given you the trouble to come with me that we may get out of the poor creature if possible whatever she has got to sayi hope it is not murderi hope notthough young st ronans has been a strange wild daring thoughtless creaturesgherro insigne as the italian saysbut here is the hut my lordpray walk in  the mention of the st ronans family and of a secret relating to them banished the thoughts which lord etherington began to entertain of leaving lady penelope to execute her works of devoted charity without his assistance it was now with an interest equal to her own that he stood before a most miserable hut where the unfortunate female her distresses not greatly relieved by lady penelopes ostentatious bounty had resided both previous to her confinement and since that event had taken place with an old woman one of the parish poor whose miserable dole the minister had augmented that she might have some means of assisting the stranger  lady penelope lifted the latch and entered after a momentary hesitation which proceeded from a struggle betwixt her fear of infection and her eager curiosity to know something she could not guess what that might affect the mowbrays in their honour or fortunes the latter soon prevailed and she entered followed by lord etherington the lady like other comforters of the cabins of the poor proceeded to rebuke the grumbling old woman for want of order and cleanlinesscensured the food which was provided for the patient and enquired particularly after the wine which she had left to make caudle with the crone was not so dazzled with lady penelopes dignity or bounty as to endure her reprimand with patience they that had their bread to won wi ae arm she said for the other hung powerless by her side had mair to do than to soop hooses if her leddyship wad let her ain idle quean of a lass take the besom she might make the house as clean as she liked and madam wad be a the better of the exercise and wad hae done at least ae turn of wark at the weeks end  do you hear the old hag my lord said lady penelope well the poor are horrid ungrateful wretchesand the wine damethe wine  the winethere was hardly half a mutchkin and puir thin fusionless skink it wasthe wine was drank out ye may swearwe didna fling it ower our shoutherif ever we were to get good ot it was by taking it naked and no wi your sugar and your slaistersi wish for ane i had neer kend the sour smack ot if the bedral hadna gien me a drap of usquebaugh i might een hae died of your leddyships liquor for  lord etherington here interrupted the grumbling crone thrusting some silver into her grasp and at the same time begging her to be silent the hag weighed the crownpiece in her hand and crawled to her chimneycorner muttering as she wentthis is something likethis is something likeno like rinning into the house and out of the house and geeing orders like mistress and mair and than a puir shilling again saturday at een  so saying she sat down to her wheel and seized while she spun her jetblack cutty pipe from which she soon sent such clouds of vile mundungus vapour as must have cleared the premises of lady penelope had she not been strong in purpose to share the expected confession of the invalid as for miss digges she coughed sneezed retched and finally ran out of the cottage declaring she could not live in such a smoke if it were to hear twenty sick womens last speeches and that besides she was sure to know all about it from lady penelope if it was ever so little worth telling over again  lord etherington was now standing beside the miserable flockbed in which lay the poor patient distracted in what seemed to be her dying moments with the peevish clamour of the elder infant to which she could only reply by low moans turning her looks as well as she could from its ceaseless whine to the other side of her wretched couch where lay the unlucky creature to which she had last given birth its shivering limbs imperfectly covered with a blanket its little features already swollen and bloated and its eyes scarce open apparently insensible to the evils of a state from which it seemed about to be speedily released  you are very ill poor woman said lord etherington i am told you desire a magistrate  it was mr mowbray of st ronans whom i desired to seejohn mowbray of st ronansthe lady promised to bring him here  i am not mowbray of st ronans said lord etherington but i am a justice of peace and a member of the legislaturei am moreover mr mowbrays particular friend if i can be of use to you in any of these capacities  the poor woman remained long silent and when she spoke it was doubtfully  is my lady penelope penfeather there she said straining her darkened eyes  her ladyship is present and within hearing said lord etherington  my case is the worse answered the dying woman for so she seemed if i must communicate such a secret as mine to a man of whom i know nothing and a woman of whom i only know that she wants discretion  ii want discretion said lady penelope but at a signal from lord etherington she seemed to restrain herself nor did the sick woman whose powers of observation were greatly impaired seem to be aware of the interruption she spoke notwithstanding her situation with an intelligible and even emphatic voice her manner in a great measure betraying the influence of the fever and her tone and language seeming much superior to her most miserable condition  i am not the abject creature which i seem she said at least i was not born to be so i wish i were that utter abject i wish i were a wretched pauper of the lowest classa starving vagabonda wifeless motherignorance and insensibility would make me bear my lot like the outcast animal that dies patiently on the side of the common where it has been halfstarved during its life but ibut iborn and bred to better things have not lost the memory of them and they make my present conditionmy shamemy povertymy infamythe sight of my dying babesthe sense that my own death is coming fast onthey make these things a foretaste of hell  lady penelopes selfconceit and affectation were broken down by this fearful exordium she sobbed shuddered and for once perhaps in her life felt the real not the assumed necessity of putting her handkerchief to her eyes lord etherington also was moved  good woman he said as far as relieving your personal wants can mitigate your distress i will see that that is fully performed and that your poor children are attended to  may god bless you said the poor woman with a glance at the wretched forms beside her and may you she added after a momentary pause deserve the blessing of god for it is bestowed in vain on those who are unworthy of it  lord etherington felt perhaps a twinge of conscience for he said something hastily pray go on good woman if you really have any thing to communicate to me as a magistrateit is time your condition was somewhat mended and i will cause you to be cared for directly  stop yet a moment she said let me unload my conscience before i go hence for no earthly relief will long avail to prolong my time herei was well born the more my present shame well educated the greater my present guilti was always indeed poor but i felt not of the ills of poverty i only thought of it when my vanity demanded idle and expensive gratifications for real wants i knew none i was companion of a young lady of higher rank than my own my relative however and one of such exquisite kindness of disposition that she treated me as a sister and would have shared with me all that she had on earthi scarce think i can go farther with my storysomething rises to my throat when i recollect how i rewarded her sisterly lovei was elder than clarai should have directed her reading and confirmed her understanding but my own bent led me to peruse only works which though they burlesque nature are seductive to the imagination we read these follies together until we had fashioned out for ourselves a little world of romance and prepared ourselves for a maze of adventures claras imaginations were as pure as those of angels mine werebut it is unnecessary to tell them the fiend always watchful presented a tempter at the moment when it was most dangerous  she paused here as if she found difficulty in expressing herself and lord etherington turning with great appearance of interest to lady penelope began to enquire whether it were quite agreeable to her ladyship to remain any longer an earwitness of this unfortunates confessionit seems to be verging on some thingsthings that it might be unpleasant for your ladyship to hear  i was just forming the same opinion my lord and to say truth was about to propose to your lordship to withdraw and leave me alone with the poor woman my sex will make her necessary communications more frank in your lordships absence  true madam but then i am called here in my capacity of a magistrate  hush said lady penelope she speaks  they say every woman that yields makes herself a slave to her seducer but i sold my liberty not to a man but a demon he made me serve him in his vile schemes against my friend and patronessand oh he found in me an agent too willing from mere envy to destroy the virtue which i had lost myself do not listen to me any morego and leave me to my fate i am the most detestable wretch that ever liveddetestable to myself worst of all because even in my penitence there is a secret whisper that tells me that were i as i have been i would again act over all the wickedness i have done and much worse oh for heavens assistance to crush the wicked thought  she closed her eyes folded her emaciated hands and held them upwards in the attitude of one who prays internally presently the hands separated and fell gently down on the miserable couch but her eyes did not open nor was there the slightest sign of motion in the features lady penelope shrieked faintly hid her eyes and hurried back from the bed while lord etherington his looks darkening with a complication of feelings remained gazing on the poor woman as if eager to discern whether the spark of life was totally extinct her grim old assistant hurried to the bedside with some spirits in a broken glass  have ye no had pennyworths for your charity she said in spiteful scorn ye buy the very life o us wi your shillings and sixpences your groats and your boddlesye hae garrd the puir wretch speak till she swarfs and now ye stand as if ye never saw a woman in a dwam before let me till her wi the drammony words mickle drought ye kenstand out o my gate my leddy if sae be that ye are a leddy there is little use of the like of you when there is death in the pot  lady penelope half affronted but still more frightened by the manners of the old hag now gladly embraced lord etheringtons renewed offer to escort her from the hut he left it not however without bestowing an additional gratuity on the old woman who received it with a whining benediction  the almighty guide your course through the troubles of this wicked warldand the muckle deevil blaw wind in your sails she added in her natural tone as the guests vanished from her miserable threshold a wheen corkheaded barmybrained gowks that wunna let puir folk sae muckle as die in quiet wi their sossings and their soopingsii10  this poor creatures declaration said lord etherington to lady penelope seems to refer to matters which the law has nothing to do with and which perhaps as they seem to implicate the peace of a family of respectability and the character of a young lady we ought to enquire no farther after  i differ from your lordship said lady penelope i differ extremelyi suppose you guess whom her discourse touched upon  indeed your ladyship does my acuteness too much honour  did she not mention a christian name said lady penelope your lordship is strangely dull this morning  a christian nameno none that i heardyes she said something abouta catherine i think it was  catherine answered the lady no my lord it was clararather a rare name in this country and belonging i think to a young lady of whom your lordship should know something unless your evening flirtations with lady binks have blotted entirely out of your memory your morning visits to shawscastle you are a bold man my lord i would advise you to include mrs blower among the objects of your attention and then you will have maid wife and widow upon your list  upon my honour your ladyship is too severe said lord etherington you surround yourself every evening with all that is clever and accomplished among the people here and then you ridicule a poor secluded monster who dare not approach your charmed circle because he seeks for some amusement elsewhere this is to tyrannize and not to reignit is turkish despotism  ah my lord i know you well my lord said lady penelopesorry would your lordship be had you not power to render yourself welcome to any circle which you may please to approach  that is to say answered the lord you will pardon me if i intrude on your ladyships coterie this evening  there is no society which lord etherington can think of frequenting where he will not be a welcome guest  i will plead then at once my pardon and privilege this eveningand now speaking as if he had succeeded in establishing some confidence with her ladyship what do you really think of this blind story  o i must believe it concerns miss mowbray she was always an odd girlsomething about her i could never endurea sort of effronterythat is perhaps a harsh word but a kind of assurancean air of confidenceso that though i kept on a footing with her because she was an orphan girl of good family and because i really knew nothing positively bad of her yet she sometimes absolutely shocked me  your ladyship perhaps would not think it right to give publicity to the story at least till you know exactly what it is said the earl in a tone of suggestion  depend upon it that it is quite the worst the very worstyou heard the woman say that she had exposed clara to ruinand you know she must have meant clara mowbray because she was so anxious to tell the story to her brother st ronans  very truei did not think of that answered lord etherington still it would be hard on the poor girl if it should get abroad  o it will never get abroad for me said lady penelope i would not tell the very wind of it but then i cannot meet miss mowbray as formerlyi have a station in life to maintain my lordand i am under the necessity of being select in my societyit is a duty i owe the public if it were even not my own inclination  certainly my lady penelope said lord etherington but then consider that in a place where all eyes are necessarily observant of your ladyships behaviour the least coldness on your part to miss mowbrayand after all we have nothing like assurance of any thing being wrong therewould ruin her with the company here and with the world at large  oh my lord answered lady penelope as for the truth of the story i have some private reasons of my own for holding the strange tale devoutly true for i had a mysterious hint from a very worthy but a very singular man your lordship knows how i adore originality the clergyman of the parish who made me aware there was something wrong about miss clarasomething thatyour lordship will excuse my speaking more plainlyoh noi feari fear it is all too trueyou know mr cargill i suppose my lord  yesnoii think i have seen him said lord etherington but how came the lady to make the parson her fatherconfessorthey have no auricular confession in the kirkit must have been with the purpose of marriage i presumelet us hope that it took placeperhaps it really was sodid he cargillthe minister i meansay any thing of such a matter  not a wordnot a wordi see where you are my lord you would put a good face ont      they calld it marriage by that specious name     to veil the crime and sanctify the shame  queen dido for that how the clergyman came into the secret i cannot tellhe is a very close man but i know he will not hear of miss mowbray being married to any one unquestionably because he knows that in doing so she would introduce disgrace into some honest familyand truly i am much of his mind my lord  perhaps mr cargill may know the lady is privately married already said the earl i think that is the more natural inference begging your ladyships pardon for presuming to differ in opinion  lady penelope seemed determined not to take this view of the case  no nono i tell you she replied she cannot be married for if she were married how could the poor wretch say that she was ruinedyou know there is a difference betwixt ruin and marriage  some people are said to have found them synonymous lady penelope answered the earl  you are smart on me my lord but still in common parlance when we say a woman is ruined we mean quite the contrary of her being marriedit is impossible for me to be more explicit upon such a topic my lord  i defer to your ladyships better judgment said lord etherington i only entreat you to observe a little caution in this businessi will make the strictest enquiries of this woman and acquaint you with the result and i hope out of regard to the respectable family of st ronans your ladyship will be in no hurry to intimate any thing to miss mowbrays prejudice  i certainly am no person to spread scandal my lord answered the lady drawing herself up at the same time i must say the mowbrays have little claim on me for forbearance i am sure i was the first person to bring this spa into fashion which has been a matter of such consequence to their estate and yet mr mowbray set himself against me my lord in every possible sort of way and encouraged the underbred people about him to behave very strangelythere was the business of building the belvidere which he would not permit to be done out of the stockpurse of the company because i had given the workmen the plan and the ordersand then about the tearoomand the hour for beginning dancingand about the subscription for mr rymours new tale of chivalryin short i owe no consideration to mr mowbray of st ronans  but the poor young lady said lord etherington  oh the poor young ladythe poor young lady can be as saucy as a rich young lady i promise youthere was a business in which she used me scandalously lord etheringtonit was about a very trifling mattera shawl nobody minds dress less than i do my lord i thank heaven my thoughts turn upon very different topicsbut it is in trifles that disrespect and unkindness are shown and i have had a full share of both from miss clara besides a good deal of impertinence from her brother upon the same subject  there is but one way remains thought the earl as they approached the spa and that is to work on the fears of this dd vindictive bluestockingd wildcatyour ladyship he said aloud is aware what severe damages have been awarded in late cases where something approaching to scandal has been traced to ladies of considerationthe privileges of the teatable have been found insufficient to protect some fair critics against the consequences of too frank and liberal animadversion upon the characters of their friends so pray remember that as yet we know very little on this subject  lady penelope loved money and feared the law and this hint fortified by her acquaintance with mowbrays love of his sister and his irritable and revengeful disposition brought her in a moment much nearer the temper in which lord etherington wished to leave her she protested that no one could be more tender than she of the fame of the unfortunate even supposing their guilt was fully provedpromised caution on the subject of the paupers declaration and hoped lord etherington would join her teaparty early in the evening as she wished to make him acquainted with one or two of her proteg√©s whom she was sure his lordship would find deserving of his advice and countenance being by this time at the door of her own apartment her ladyship took leave of the earl with a most gracious smile  footnotes  ii9 note i  ii10 note ii     chapter xiv  disappointment      on the leebeam lies the land boys       see all clear to reef each course     let the foresheet go dont mind boys       though the weather should be worse  the storm   it darkens round me like a tempest thought lord etherington as with slow step folded arms and his white hat slouched over his brows he traversed the short interval of space betwixt his own apartments and those of the lady penelope in a buck of the old school one of congreves men of wit and pleasure about town this would have been a departure from character but the present fine man does not derogate from his quality even by exhibiting all the moody and gentlemanlike solemnity of master stepheniic so lord etherington was at liberty to carry on his reflections without attracting observationi have put a stopper into the mouth of that old vinegarcruet of quality but the acidity of her temper will soon dissolve the charmand what to do  as he looked round him he saw his trusty valet solmes who touching his hat with due respect said as he passed him your lordships letters are in your private dispatchbox  simple as these words were and indifferent the tone in which they were spoken their import made lord etheringtons heart bound as if his fate had depended on the accents he intimated no farther interest in the communication however than to desire solmes to be below in case he should ring and with these words entered his apartment and barred and bolted the door even before he looked on the table where his dispatchbox was placed  lord etherington had as is usual one key to the box which held his letters his confidential servant being intrusted with the other so that under the protection of a patent lock his dispatches escaped all risk of being tampered witha precaution not altogether unnecessary on the part of those who frequent hotels and lodginghouses  by your leave mr bramah said the earl as he applied the key jesting as it were with his own agitation as he would have done with that of a third party the lid was raised and displayed the packet the appearance and superscription of which had attracted his observation but a short while before in the postoffice then he would have given much to be possessed of the opportunity which was now in his power but many pause on the brink of a crime who have contemplated it at a distance without scruple lord etheringtons first impulse had led him to poke the fire and he held in his hand the letter which he was more than half tempted to commit without even breaking the seal to the fiery element but though sufficiently familiarized with guilt he was not as yet acquainted with it in its basest shapeshe had not yet acted with meanness or at least with what the world terms such he had been a duellist the manners of the age authorized ita libertine the world excused it to his youth and conditiona bold and successful gambler for that quality he was admired and envied and a thousand other inaccuracies to which these practices and habits lead were easily slurred over in a man of quality with fortune and spirit to support his rank but his present meditated act was of a different kind tell it not in bond street whisper it not on st jamess pavementit amounted to an act of petty larceny for which the code of honour would admit of no composition  lord etherington under the influence of these recollections stood for a few minutes suspendedbut the devil always finds logic to convince his followers he recollected the wrong done to his mother and to himself her offspring to whom his father had in the face of the whole world imparted the hereditary rights of which he was now by a posthumous deed endeavouring to deprive the memory of the one and the expectations of the other surely the right being his own he had a full title by the most effectual means whatever such means might be to repel all attacks on that right and even destroy if necessary the documents by which his enemies were prosecuting their unjust plans against his honour and interest  this reasoning prevailed and lord etherington again held the devoted packet above the flames when it occurred to him that his resolution being taken he ought to carry it into execution as effectually as possible and to do so it was necessary to know that the packet actually contained the papers which he was desirous to destroy  never did a doubt arise in juster time for no sooner had the seal burst and the envelope rustled under his fingers than he perceived to his utter consternation that he held in his hand only the copies of the deeds for which francis tyrrel had written the originals of which he had too sanguinely concluded would be forwarded according to his requisition a letter from a partner of the house with which they were deposited stated that they had not felt themselves at liberty in the absence of the head of their firm to whom these papers had been committed to part with them even to mr tyrrel though they had proceeded so far as to open the parcel and now transmitted to him formal copies of the papers contained in it which they presumed would serve mr tyrrels purpose for consulting counsel or the like they themselves in a case of so much delicacy and in the absence of their principal partner were determined to retain the originals unless called to produce them in a court of justice  with a solemn imprecation on the formality and absurdity of the writer lord etherington let the letter of advice drop from his hand into the fire and throwing himself into a chair passed his hand across his eyes as if their very power of sight had been blighted by what he had read his title and his paternal fortune which he thought but an instant before might be rendered unchallengeable by a single movement of his hand seemed now on the verge of being lost for ever his rapid recollection failed not to remind him of what was less known to the world that his early and profuse expenditure had greatly dilapidated his maternal fortune and that the estate of nettlewood which five minutes ago he only coveted as a wealthy man desires increase of his store must now be acquired if he would avoid being a poor and embarrassed spendthrift to impede his possessing himself of this property fate had restored to the scene the penitent of the morning who as he had too much reason to believe was returned to this neighbourhood to do justice to clara mowbray and who was not unlikely to put the whole story of the marriage on its right footing she however might be got rid of and it might still be possible to hurry miss mowbray by working on her fears or through the agency of her brother into a union with him while he still preserved the title of lord etherington this therefore he resolved to secure if effort or if intrigue could carry the point nor was it the least consideration that should he succeed he would obtain over tyrrel his successful rival such a triumph as would be sufficient to embitter the tranquillity of his whole life  in a few minutes his rapid and contriving invention had formed a plan for securing the sole advantage which seemed to remain open for him and conscious that he had no time to lose he entered immediately upon the execution  the bell summoned solmes to his lordships apartment when the earl as coolly as if he had hoped to dupe his experienced valet by such an assertion said you have brought me a packet designed for some man at the aultounlet it be sent to himstayi will reseal it first  he accordingly resealed the packet containing all the writings excepting the letter of advice which he had burnt and gave it to the valet with the caution i wish you would not make such blunders in future  i beg your lordships pardoni will take better care againthought it was addressed to your lordship  so answered solmes too knowing to give the least look of intelligence far less to remind the earl that his own directions had occasioned the mistake of which he complained  solmes continued the earl you need not mention your blunder at the postoffice it would only occasion tattle in this idle placebut be sure that the gentleman has his letterand solmes i see mr mowbray walk acrossask him to dine with me today at five i have a headache and cannot face the clamour of the savages who feed at the public tableand let me seemake my compliments to lady penelope penfeatheri will certainly have the honour of waiting on her ladyship this evening to tea agreeably to her very boring invitation receivedwrite her a proper card and word it your own way bespeak dinner for two and see you have some of that batch of burgundy the servant was retiring when his master added stay a momenti have a more important business than i have yet mentionedsolmes you have managed devilish ill about the woman irwin  i my lord answered solmes  yes you sirdid you not tell me she had gone to the west indies with a friend of yours and did not i give them a couple of hundred pounds for passagemoney  yes my lord replied the valet  ay but now it proves no my lord said lord etherington for she has found her way back to this country in miserable plighthalfstarved and no doubt willing to do or say any thing for a livelihoodhow has this happened  biddulph must have taken her cash and turned her loose my lord answered solmes as if he had been speaking of the most commonplace transaction in the world but i know the womans nature so well and am so much master of her history that i can carry her off the country in twentyfour hours and place her where she will never think of returning provided your lordship can spare me so long  about it directlybut i can tell you that you will find the woman in a very penitential humour and very ill in health to boot  i am sure of my game answered solmes with submission to your lordship i think if death and her good angel had hold of one of that womans arms the devil and i could make a shift to lead her away by the other  away and about it then said etherington but hark ye solmes be kind to her and see all her wants relieved i have done her mischief enoughthough nature and the devil had done half the work to my hand  solmes at length was permitted to withdraw to execute his various commissions with an assurance that his services would not be wanted for the next twentyfour hours  soh said the earl as his agent withdrew there is a spring put in motion which well oiled will move the whole machineand here in lucky time comes harry jekyli hear his whistle on the stairsthere is a silly lightness of heart about that fellow which i envy while i despise it but he is welcome now for i want him  jekyl entered accordingly and broke out with i am glad to see one of your fellows laying a cloth for two in your parlour etheringtoni was afraid you were going down among these confounded bores again today  you are not to be one of the two hal answered lord etherington  nothen i may be a third i hope if not second  neither first second nor third captainthe truth is i want a t√™te√†t√™te with mr mowbray of st ronans replied the earl and besides i have to beg the very particular favour of you to go again to that fellow martigny it is time that he should produce his papers if he has anyof which for one i do not believe a word he has had ample time to hear from london and i think i have delayed long enough in an important matter upon his bare assertion  i cannot blame your impatience said jekyl and i will go on your errand instantly as you waited on my advice i am bound to find an end to your suspenseat the same time if the man is not possessed of such papers as he spoke of i must own he is happy in a command of consummate assurance which might set up the whole roll of attorneys  you will be soon able to judge of that said lord etherington and now off with youwhy do you look at me so anxiously  i cannot telli have strange forebodings about this t√™te√†t√™te with mowbray you should spare him etheringtonhe is not your matchwants both judgment and temper  tell him so jekyl answered the earl and his proud scotch stomach will be up in an instant and he will pay you with a shot for your painswhy he thinks himself cock of the walk this strutting bantam notwithstanding the lesson i gave him beforeand what do you thinkhe has the impudence to talk about my attentions to lady binks as inconsistent with the prosecution of my suit to his sister yes halthis awkward scotch laird that has scarce tact enough to make love to a ewemilker or at best to some daggletailed soubrette has the assurance to start himself as my rival  then goodnight to st ronansthis will be a fatal dinner to himetherington i know by that laugh you are bent on mischiefi have a great mind to give him a hint  i wish you would answered the earl it would all turn to my account  do you defy mewell if i meet him i will put him on his guard  the friends parted and it was not long ere jekyl encountered mowbray on one of the public walks  you dine with etherington today said the captainforgive me mr mowbray if i say one single wordbeware  of what should i beware captain jekyl answered mowbray when i dine with a friend of your own and a man of honour  certainly lord etherington is both mr mowbray but he loves play and is too hard for most people  i thank you for your hint captain jekyli am a raw scotchman it is true but yet i know a thing or two fair play is always presumed amongst gentlemen and that taken for granted i have the vanity to think i need no ones caution on the subject not even captain jekyls though his experience must needs be so much superior to mine  in that case sir said jekyl bowing coldly i have no more to say and i hope there is no harm doneconceited coxcomb he added mentally as they parted how truly did etherington judge of him and what an ass was i to intermeddlei hope etherington will strip him of every feather  he pursued his walk in quest of tyrrel and mowbray proceeded to the apartments of the earl in a temper of mind well suited to the purposes of the latter who judged of his disposition accurately when he permitted jekyl to give his wellmeant warning to be supposed by a man of acknowledged fashion so decidedly inferior to his antagonistto be considered as an object of compassion and made the subject of a goodboy warning was gall and bitterness to his proud spirit which the more that he felt a conscious inferiority in the arts which they all cultivated struggled the more to preserve the footing of at least apparent equality  since the first memorable party at piquet mowbray had never hazarded his luck with lord etherington except for trifling stakes but his conceit led him to suppose that he now fully understood his play and agreeably to the practice of those who have habituated themselves to gambling he had every now and then felt a yearning to try for his revenge he wished also to be out of lord etheringtons debt feeling galled under a sense of pecuniary obligation which hindered his speaking his mind to him fully upon the subject of his flirtation with lady binks which he justly considered as an insult to his family considering the footing on which the earl seemed desirous to stand with clara mowbray from these obligations a favourable evening might free him and mowbray was in fact indulging in a waking dream to this purpose when jekyl interrupted him his untimely warning only excited a spirit of contradiction and a determination to show the adviser how little he was qualified to judge of his talents and in this humour his ruin which was the consequence of that afternoon was far from seeming to be the premeditated or even the voluntary work of the earl of etherington  on the contrary the victim himself was the first to propose playdeep playdouble stakes while lord etherington on the other hand often proposed to diminish their game or to break off entirely but it was always with an affectation of superiority which only stimulated mowbray to farther and more desperate risks and at last when mowbray became his debtor to an overwhelming amount his circumstances considered the earl threw down the cards and declared he should be too late for lady penelopes teaparty to which he was positively engaged  will you not give me my revenge said mowbray taking up the cards and shuffling them with fierce anxiety  not now mowbray we have played too long alreadyyou have lost too muchmore than perhaps is convenient for you to pay  mowbray gnashed his teeth in spite of his resolution to maintain an exterior at least of firmness  you can take your time you know said the earl a note of hand will suit me as well as the money  no by g answered mowbray i will not be so taken in a second timei had better have sold myself to the devil than to your lordshipi have never been my own man since  these are not very kind expressions mowbray said the earl you would play and they that will play must expect sometimes to lose  and they who win will expect to be paid said mowbray breaking in i know that as well as you my lord and you shall be paidi will pay youi will pay you by g do you make any doubt that i will pay you my lord  you look as if you thought of paying me in sharp coin said lord etherington and i think that would scarce be consistent with the terms we stand upon towards each other  by my soul my lord said mowbray i cannot tell what these terms are and to be at my wits end at once i should be glad to know you set out upon paying addresses to my sister and with your visits and opportunities at shawscastle i cannot find the matter makes the least progressit keeps moving without advancing like a childs rockinghorse perhaps you think that you have curbed me up so tightly that i dare not stir in the matter but you will find it otherwiseyour lordship may keep a haram if you will but my sister shall not enter it  you are angry and therefore you are unjust said etherington you know well enough it is your sisters fault that there is any delay i am most willingmost desirousto call her lady etheringtonnothing but her unlucky prejudices against me have retarded a union which i have so many reasons for desiring  well replied mowbray that shall be my business i know no reason she can pretend to decline a marriage so honourable to her house and which is approved of by me that houses head that matter shall be arranged in twentyfour hours  it will do me the most sensible pleasure said lord etherington you shall soon see how sincerely i desire your alliance and as for the trifle you have lost  it is no trifle to me my lordit is my ruinbut it shall be paidand let me tell your lordship you may thank your good luck for it more than your good play  we will say no more of it at present if you please said lord etherington tomorrow is a new day and if you will take my advice you will not be too harsh with your sister a little firmness is seldom amiss with young women but severity  i will pray your lordship to spare me your advice on this subject however valuable it may be in other respects i can i take it speak to my own sister in my own way  since you are so causticallydisposed mowbray answered the earl i presume you will not honour her ladyships teatable tonight though i believe it will be the last of the season  and why should you think so my lord answered mowbray whose losses had rendered him testy and contradictory upon every subject that was started why should not i pay my respects to lady penelope or any other tabby of quality i have no title indeed but i suppose that my family  entitles you to become a canon of strasburghiid doubtlessbut you do not seem in a very christian mood for taking orders all i meant to say was that you and lady pen were not used to be on such a good footing  well she sent me a card for her blowout said mowbray and so i am resolved to go when i have been there half an hour i will ride up to shawscastle and you shall hear of my speed in wooing for you tomorrow morning     chapter xv  a teaparty      let fall the curtains wheel the sofa round     and while the bubbling and loudhissing urn     throws up a steamy column and the cups     that cheer but not inebriate wait on each     thus let us welcome peaceful evening in  cowpers task   the approach of the cold and rainy season had now so far thinned the company at the well that in order to secure the necessary degree of crowd upon her teanights lady penelope was obliged to employ some coaxing towards those whom she had considered as much under par in society even the doctor and mrs blower were graciously smiled uponfor their marriage was now an arranged affair and the event was of a nature likely to spread the reputation of the spa among wealthy widows and medical gentlemen of more skill than practice so in they came the doctor smirking gallanting and performing all the bustling parade of settled and arranged courtship with much of that grace wherewith a turkeycock goes through the same ceremony old touchwood had also attended her ladyships summons chiefly it may be supposed from his restless fidgety disposition which seldom suffered him to remain absent even from those places of resort of which he usually professed his detestation there was besides mr winterblossom who in his usual spirit of quiet epicurism and selfindulgence was under the fire of a volley of compliments to lady penelope scheming to secure for himself an early cup of tea there was lady binks also with the wonted degree of sullenness in her beautiful face angry at her husband as usual and not disposed to be pleased with lord etherington for being absent when she desired to excite sir bingos jealousy this she had discovered to be the most effectual way of tormenting the baronet and she rejoiced in it with the savage glee of a hackney coachman who has found a raw where he can make his poor jade feel the whip the rest of the company were also in attendance as usual macturk himself was present notwithstanding that he thought it an egregious waste of hot water to bestow it upon compounding any mixture saving punch he had of late associated himself a good deal with the traveller not that they by any means resembled each other in temper or opinions but rather because there was that degree of difference betwixt them which furnished perpetual subject for dispute and discussion they were not long on the present occasion ere they lighted on a fertile source of controversy  never tell me of your points of honour said touchwood raising his voice altogether above the general tone of polite conversationall humbug captain macturkmere hairtraps to springe woodcocksmen of sense break through them  upon my word sir said the captain and myself is surprised to hear youfor look you sir every mans honour is the breath of his nostrilscot tamn  then let men breathe through their mouths and be dd returned the controversialist i tell you sir that besides its being forbidden both by law and gospel its an idiotical and totally absurd practice that of duelling an honest savage has more sense than to practise ithe takes his bow or his gun as the thing may be and shoots his enemy from behind a bush and a very good way for you see there can in that case be only one mans death between them  saul of my body sir said the captain gin ye promulgate sic doctrines amang the good company its my belief you will bring somebody to the gallows  thank ye captain with all my heart but i stir up no quarrelsi leave war to them that live by it i only say that except our old stupid ancestors in the northwest here i know no country so silly as to harbour this custom of duelling it is unknown in africa among the negroesin america  dont tell me that said the captain a yankee will fight with muskets and buckshot rather than sit still with an affront i should know jonathan i think  altogether unknown among the thousand tribes of india  ill be tamned then said captain macturk was i not in tippoos prison at bangalore and when the joyful day of our liberation came did we not solemnize it with fourteen little affairs whereof we had been laying the foundation in our house of captivity as holy writ has it and never went farther to settle them than the glacis of the fort by my soul you would have thought there was a smart skirmish the firing was so close and did not i captain macturk fight three of them myself without moving my foot from the place i set it on  and pray sir what might be the result of this christian mode of giving thanks for your deliverance demanded mr touchwood  a small list of casualties after all said the captain one killed on the spot one died of his woundstwo wounded severelythree ditto slightly and little duncan macphail reported missing we were out of practice after such long confinement so you see how we manage matters in india my dear friend  you are to understand replied touchwood that i spoke only of the heathen natives who heathen as they are live in the light of their own moral reason and among whom ye shall therefore see better examples of practical morality than among such as yourselves who though calling yourselves christians have no more knowledge of the true acceptation and meaning of your religion than if you had left your christianity at the cape of good hope as they say of you and forgot to take it up when you come back again  py cot and i can tell you sir said the captain elevating at once his voice and his nostrils and snuffing the air with a truculent and indignant visage that i will not permit you or any man to throw any such scandal on my characteri thank cot i can bring good witness that i am as good a christian as another for a poor sinner as the best of us are and i am ready to justify my religion with my swordcot tamncompare my own self with a parcel of black heathen bodies and natives that were never in the inner side of a kirk whilst they lived but go about worshipping stocks and stones and swinging themselves upon bamboos like peasts as they are  an indignant growling in his throat which sounded like the acquiescence of his inward man in the indignant proposition which his external organs thus expressed concluded this haughty speech which however made not the least impression on touchwood who cared as little for angry tones and looks as he did for fine speeches so that it is likely a quarrel between the christian preceptor and the peacemaker might have occurred for the amusement of the company had not the attention of both but particularly that of touchwood been diverted from the topic of debate by the entrance of lord etherington and mowbray  the former was as usual all grace smiles and gentleness yet contrary to his wonted custom which usually was after a few general compliments to attach himself particularly to lady binks the earl on the present occasion avoided the side of the room on which that beautiful but sullen idol held her station and attached himself exclusively to lady penelope penfeather enduring without flinching the strange variety of conceited bavardage which that ladys natural parts and acquired information enabled her to pour forth with unparalleled profusion  an honest heathen one of plutarchs heroes if i mistake notiie dreamed once upon a night that the figure of proserpina whom he had long worshipped visited his slumbers with an angry and vindictive countenance and menaced him with vengeance in resentment of his having neglected her altars with the usual fickleness of a polytheist for those of some more fashionable divinity not that goddess of the infernal regions herself could assume a more haughty or more displeased countenance than that with which lady binks looked from time to time upon lord etherington as if to warn him of the consequence of this departure from the allegiance which the young earl had hitherto manifested towards her and which seemed now she knew not why unless it were for the purpose of public insult to be transferred to her rival perilous as her eyeglances were and much as they menaced lord etherington felt at this moment the importance of soothing lady penelope to silence on the subject of the invalids confession of that morning to be more pressing than that of appeasing the indignation of lady binks the former was a case of the most urgent necessitythe latter if he was at all anxious on the subject might he perhaps thought be trusted to time had the ladies continued on a tolerable footing together he might have endeavoured to conciliate both but the bitterness of their longsuppressed feud had greatly increased now that it was probable the end of the season was to separate them in all likelihood for ever so that lady penelope had no longer any motive for countenancing lady binks or the lady of sir bingo for desiring lady penelopes countenance the wealth and lavish expense of the one was no longer to render more illustrious the suit of her right honourable friend nor was the society of lady penelope likely to be soon again useful or necessary to lady binks so that neither were any longer desirous to suppress symptoms of the mutual contempt and dislike which they had long nourished for each other and whoever should in this decisive hour take part with one had little henceforward to expect from her rival what farther and more private reasons lady binks might have to resent the defection of lord etherington have never come with certainty to our knowledge but it was said there had been high words between them on the floating report that his lordships visits to shawscastle were dictated by the wish to find a bride there  womens wits are said to be quick in spying the surest means of avenging a real or supposed slight after biting her pretty lips and revolving in her mind the readiest means of vengeance fate threw in her way young mowbray of st ronans she looked at him and endeavoured to fix his attention with a nod and gracious smile such as in an ordinary mood would have instantly drawn him to her side on receiving in answer only a vacant glance and a bow she was led to observe him more attentively and was induced to believe from his wavering look varying complexion and unsteady step that he had been drinking unusually deep still his eye was less that of an intoxicated than of a disturbed and desperate man one whose faculties were engrossed by deep and turbid reflection which withdrew him from the passing scene  do you observe how ill mr mowbray looks said she in a loud whisper i hope he has not heard what lady penelope was just now saying of his family  unless he hears it from you my lady answered mr touchwood who upon mowbrays entrance had broken off his discourse with macturk i think there is little chance of his learning it from any other person  what is the matter said mowbray sharply addressing chatterly and winterblossom but the one shrunk nervously from the question protesting he indeed had not been precisely attending to what had been passing among the ladies and winterblossom bowed out of the scrape with quiet and cautious politenesshe really had not given particular attention to what was passingi was negotiating with mrs jones for an additional lump of sugar to my coffeeegad it was so difficult a piece of diplomacy he added sinking his voice that i have an idea her ladyship calculates the west india produce by grains and pennyweights  the innuendo if designed to make mowbray smile was far from succeeding he stepped forward with more than usual stiffness in his air which was never entirely free from selfconsequence and said to lady binks may i request to know of your ladyship what particular respecting my family had the honour to engage the attention of the company  i was only a listener mr mowbray returned lady binks with evident enjoyment of the rising indignation which she read in his countenance not being queen of the night i am not at all disposed to be answerable for the turn of the conversation  mowbray in no humour to bear jesting yet afraid to expose himself by farther enquiry in a company so public darted a fierce look at lady penelope then in close conversation with lord etheringtonadvanced a step or two towards themthen as if checking himself turned on his heel and left the room a few minutes afterwards and when certain satirical nods and winks were circulating among the assembly a waiter slid a piece of paper into mrs joness hand who on looking at the contents seemed about to leave the room  jonesjones exclaimed lady penelope in surprise and displeasure  only the key of the teacaddie your ladyship answered jones i will be back in an instant  jonesjones again exclaimed her mistress here is enoughof tea she would have said but lord etherington was so near her that she was ashamed to complete the sentence and had only hope in joness quickness of apprehension and the prospect that she would be unable to find the key which she went in search of  jones meanwhile tripped off to a sort of housekeepers apartment of which she was locum tenens for the evening for the more ready supply of whatever might be wanted on lady penelopes night as it was called here she found mr mowbray of st ronans whom she instantly began to assail with la now mr mowbray you are such another gentlemani am sure you will make me lose my placeill swear you willwhat can you have to say that you could not as well put off for an hour  i want to know jones answered mowbray in a different tone perhaps from what the damsel expected what your lady was just now saying about my family  pshawwas that all answered mrs jones what should she be sayingnonsensewho minds what she saysi am sure i never do for one  nay but my dear jones said mowbray i insist upon knowingi must know and i will know  la mr mowbray why should i make mischiefas i live i hear some one coming and if you were found speaking with me hereindeed indeed some one is coming  the devil may come if he will said mowbray but we do not part pretty mistress till you tell me what i wish to know  lord sir you frighten me answered jones but all the room heard it as well as iit was about miss mowbrayand that my lady would be shy of her company hereafterfor that she wasshe was  for that my sister was what said mowbray fiercely seizing her arm  lord sir you terrify me said jones beginning to cry at any rate it was not i that said itit was lady penelope  and what was it the old addertongued madwoman dared to say of clara mowbrayspeak out plainly and directly or by heaven ill make you  hold sirhold for gods sakeyou will break my arm answered the terrified handmaiden i am sure i know no harm of miss mowbray only my lady spoke as if she was no better than she ought to belord sir there is some one listening at the doorand making a spring out of his grasp she hastened back to the room in which the company were assembled  mowbray stood petrified at the news he had heard ignorant alike what could be the motive for a calumny so atrocious and uncertain what he were best do to put a stop to the scandal to his farther confusion he was presently convinced of the truth of mrs joness belief that they had been watched for as he went to the door of the apartment he was met by mr touchwood  what has brought you here sir said mowbray sternly  hoitie toitie answered the traveller why how came you here if you go to that squireegad lady penelope is trembling for her souchong so i just took a step here to save her ladyship the trouble of looking after mrs jones in person which i think might have been a worse interruption than mine mr mowbray  pshaw sir you talk nonsense said mowbray the tearoom is so infernally hot that i had sat down here a moment to draw breath when the young woman came in  and you are going to run away now the old gentleman is come in said touchwoodcome sir i am more your friend than you may think  sir you are intrusivei want nothing that you can give me said mowbray  that is a mistake answered the senior for i can supply you with what most young men wantmoney and wisdom  you will do well to keep both till they are wanted said mowbray  why so i would squire only that i have taken something of a fancy for your family and they are supposed to have wanted cash and good counsel for two generations if not for three  sir said mowbray angrily you are too old either to play the buffoon or to get buffoons payment  which is like monkeys allowance i suppose said the traveller more kicks than halfpencewellat least i am not young enough to quarrel with boys for bullying ill convince you however mr mowbray that i know some more of your affairs than what you give me credit for  it may be answered mowbray but you will oblige me more by minding your own  very like meantime your losses tonight to my lord etherington are no trifle and no secret neither  mr touchwood i desire to know where you had your information said mowbray  a matter of very little consequence compared to its truth or falsehood mr mowbray answered the old gentleman  but of the last importance to me sir said mowbray in a word had you such information by or through means of lord etheringtonanswer me this single question and then i shall know better what to think on the subject  upon my honour said touchwood i neither had my information from lord etherington directly nor indirectly i say thus much to give you satisfaction and i now expect you will hear me with patience  forgive me sir interrupted mowbray one farther question i understand something was said in disparagement of my sister just as i entered the tearoom  hemhemhem said touchwood hesitating i am sorry your ears have served you so wellsomething there was said lightly something that can be easily explained i dare sayand now mr mowbray let me speak a few serious words with you  and now mr touchwood we have no more to say to each othergood evening to you  he brushed past the old man who in vain endeavoured to stop him and hurrying to the stable demanded his horse it was ready saddled and waited his orders but even the short time that was necessary to bring it to the door of the stable was exasperating to mowbrays impatience not less exasperating was the constant interceding voice of touchwood who in tones alternately plaintive and snappish kept on a string of expostulations  mr mowbray only five words with youmr mowbray you will repent thisis this a night to ride in mr mowbraymy stars sir if you would but have five minutes patience  curses not loud but deep muttered in the throat of the impatient laird were the only reply until his horse was brought out when staying no farther question he sprung into the saddle the poor horse paid for the delay which could not be laid to his charge mowbray struck him hard with his spurs so soon as he was in his seatthe noble animal reared bolted and sprung forward like a deer over stock and stone the nearest roadand we are aware it was a rough oneto shawscastle there is a sort of instinct by which horses perceive the humour of their riders and are furious and impetuous or dull and sluggish as if to correspond with it and mowbrays gallant steed seemed on this occasion to feel all the stings of his masters internal ferment although not again urged with the spur the ostler stood listening to the clash of the hoofs succeeding each other in thick and close gallop until they died away in the distant woodland  if st ronans reach home this night with his neck unbroken muttered the fellow the devil must have it in keeping  mercy on us said the traveller he rides like a bedouin arab but in the desert there are neither trees to cross the road nor cleughs nor linns nor floods nor fords well i must set to work myself or this gear will get worse than even i can mendhere you ostler let me have your best pair of horses instantly to shawscastle  to shawscastle sir said the man with some surprise  yesdo you not know such a place  in troth sir sae few company go there except on the great ball day that we have had time to forget the road to itbut st ronans was here even now sir  ay what of thathe has ridden on to get supper readyso turn out without loss of time  at your pleasure sir said the fellow and called to the postilion accordingly     chapter xvi  debate      sedet post equitem atra cura      still though the headlong cavalier     oer rough and smooth in wild career       seems racing with the wind     his sad companionghastly pale     and darksome as a widows veil       carekeeps her seat behind  horace   well was it that night for mowbray that he had always piqued himself on his horses and that the animal on which he was then mounted was as surefooted and sagacious as he was mettled and fiery for those who observed next day the print of the hoofs on the broken and rugged track through which the creature had been driven at full speed by his furious master might easily see that in more than a dozen of places the horse and rider had been within a few inches of destruction one bough of a gnarled and stunted oaktree which stretched across the road seemed in particular to have opposed an almost fatal barrier to the horsemans career in striking his head against this impediment the force of the blow had been broken in some measure by a highcrowned hat yet the violence of the shock was sufficient to shiver the branch to pieces fortunately it was already decayed but even in that state it was subject of astonishment to every one that no fatal damage had been sustained in so formidable an encounter mowbray himself was unconscious of the accident  scarcely aware that he had been riding at an unusual rate scarce sensible that he had ridden faster perhaps than ever he followed the hounds mowbray alighted at his stable door and flung the bridle to his groom who held up his hands in astonishment when he beheld the condition of the favourite horse but concluding that his master must be intoxicated he prudently forbore to make any observations  no sooner did the unfortunate traveller suspend that rapid motion by which he seemed to wish to annihilate as far as possible time and space in order to reach the place he had now attained than it seemed to him as if he would have given the world that seas and deserts had lain between him and the house of his fathers as well as that only sister with whom he was now about to have a decisive interview  but the place and the hour are arrived he said biting his lip with anguish this explanation must be decisive and whatever evils may attend it suspense must be ended now at once and for ever  he entered the castle and took the light from the old domestic who hearing the clatter of his horses feet had opened the door to receive him  is my sister in her parlour he asked but in so hollow a voice that the old man only answered the question by another was his honour well  quite well patricknever better in my life said mowbray and turning his back on the old man as if to prevent his observing whether his countenance and his words corresponded he pursued his way to his sisters apartment the sound of his step upon the passage roused clara from a reverie perhaps a sad one and she had trimmed her lamp and stirred her fire so slow did he walk before he at length entered her apartment  you are a good boy brother she said to come thus early home and i have some good news for your reward the groom has fetched back trimmerhe was lying by the dead hare and he had chased him as far as drumlyfordthe shepherd had carried him to the shieling till some one should claim him  i would he had hanged him with all my heart said mowbray  howhang trimmeryour favourite trimmer that has beat the whole countryand it was only this morning you were halfcrying because he was amissing and like to murder man and mothers son  the better i like any living thing answered mowbray the more reason i have for wishing it dead and at rest for neither i nor any thing that i love will ever be happy more  you cannot frighten me john with these flights answered clara trembling although she endeavoured to look unconcernedyou have used me to them too often  it is well for you then you will be ruined without the shock of surprise  so much the betterwe have been said clara      so constantly in poortiths sight     the thoughts ont gie us little fright  so say i with honest robert burns  dn barns and his trash said mowbray with the impatience of a man determined to be angry with every thing but himself who was the real source of the evil  and why damn poor burns said clara composedly it is not his fault if you have not risen a winner for that i suppose is the cause of all this uproar  would it not make any one lose patience said mowbray to hear her quoting the rhapsodies of a hobnaild peasant when a man is speaking of the downfall of an ancient house your ploughman i suppose becoming one degree poorer than he was born to be would only go without his dinner or without his usual potation of ale his comrades would cry poor fellow and let him eat out of their kit and drink out of their bicker without scruple till his own was full again but the poor gentlemanthe downfallen man of rankthe degraded man of birththe disabled and disarmed man of powerit is he that is to be pitied who loses not merely drink and dinner but honour situation credit character and name itself  you are declaiming in this manner in order to terrify me said clara but friend john i know you and your ways and i have made up my mind upon all contingencies that can take place i will tell you morei have stood on this tottering pinnacle of rank and fashion if our situation can be termed such till my head is dizzy with the instability of my eminence and i feel that strange desire of tossing myself down which the devil is said to put into folks heads when they stand on the top of steeplesat least i had rather the plunge were over  be satisfied then if that will satisfy youthe plunge is over and we arewhat they used to call it in scotlandgentle beggarscreatures to whom our second and third and fourth and fifth cousins may if they please give a place at the sidetable and a seat in the carriage with the ladys maid if driving backwards will not make us sick  they may give it to those who will take it said clara but i am determined to eat bread of my own buyingi can do twenty things and i am sure some one or other of them will bring me all the little money i will need i have been trying john for several months how little i can live upon and you would laugh if you heard how low i have brought the account  there is a difference clara between fanciful experiments and real povertythe one is a masquerade which we can end when we please the other is wretchedness for life  methinks brother replied miss mowbray it would be better for you to set me an example how to carry my good resolutions into effect than to ridicule them  why what would you have me do said he fiercelyturn postilion or roughrider or whipperini dont know any thing else that my education as i have used it has fitted me forand then some of my old acquaintances would i dare say give me a crown to drink now and then for old acquaintance sake  this is not the way john that men of sense think or speak of serious misfortunes answered his sister and i do not believe that this is so serious as it is your pleasure to make it  believe the very worst you can think replied he and you will not believe bad enoughyou have neither a guinea nor a house nor a friendpass but a day and it is a chance that you will not have a brother  my dear john you have drunk hardrode hard  yessuch tidings deserved to be carried express especially to a young lady who receives them so well answered mowbray bitterly i suppose now it will make no impression if i were to tell you that you have it in your power to stop all this ruin  by consummating my own i supposebrother i said you could not make me tremble but you have found a way to do it  what you expect i am again to urge you with lord etheringtons courtshipthat might have saved all indeedbut that day of grace is over  i am glad of it with all my spirit said clara may it take with it all that we can quarrel aboutbut till this instant i thought it was for this very point that this long voyage was bound and that you were endeavouring to persuade me of the reality of the danger of the storm in order to reconcile me to the harbour  you are mad i think in earnest said mowbray can you really be so absurd as to rejoice that you have no way left to relieve yourself and me from ruin want and shame  from shame brother said clara no shame in honest poverty i hope  that is according as folks have used their prosperity clarai must speak to the pointthere are strange reports going belowby heaven they are enough to disturb the ashes of the dead were i to mention them i should expect our poor mother to enter the roomclara mowbray can you guess what i mean  it was with the utmost exertion yet in a faltering voice that she was able after an ineffectual effort to utter the monosyllable no  by heaven i am ashamedi am even afraid to express my own meaningclara what is there which makes you so obstinately reject every proposal of marriageis it that you feel yourself unworthy to be the wife of an honest manspeak outevil fame has been busy with your reputationspeak outgive me the right to cram their lies down the throats of the inventors and when i go among them tomorrow i shall know how to treat those who cast reflections on you the fortunes of our house are ruined but no tongue shall slander its honourspeakspeak wretched girl why are you silent  stay at home brother said clara stay at home if you regard our houses honourmurder cannot mend miserystay at home and let them talk of me as they willthey can scarcely say worse of me than i deserveiif  the passions of mowbray at all times ungovernably strong were at present inflamed by wine by his rapid journey and the previously disturbed state of his mind he set his teeth clenched his hands looked on the ground as one that forms some horrid resolution and muttered almost unintelligibly it were charity to kill her  oh nonono exclaimed the terrified girl throwing herself at his feet do not kill me brother i have wished for deaththought of deathprayed for deathbut oh it is frightful to think that he is nearoh not a bloody death brother nor by your hand  she held him close by the knees as she spoke and expressed in her looks and accents the utmost terror it was not indeed without reason for the extreme solitude of the place the violent and inflamed passions of her brother and the desperate circumstances to which he had reduced himself seemed all to concur to render some horrid act of violence not an improbable termination of this strange interview  mowbray folded his arms without unclenching his hands or raising his head while his sister continued on the floor clasping him round the knees with all her strength and begging piteously for her life and for mercy  fool he said at last let me gowho cares for thy worthless lifewho cares if thou live or die live if thou canstand be the hate and scorn of every one else as much as thou art mine  he grasped her by the shoulder with one hand pushed her from him and as she arose from the floor and again pressed to throw her arms around his neck he repulsed her with his arm and hand with a pushor blowit might be termed either one or the otherviolent enough in her weak state to have again extended her on the ground had not a chair received her as she fell he looked at her with ferocity grappled a moment in his pocket then ran to the window and throwing the sash violently up thrust himself as far as he could without falling into the open air terrified and yet her feelings of his unkindness predominating even above her fears clara continued to exclaim  oh brother say you did not mean thisoh say you did not mean to strike meoh whatever i have deserved be not you the executionerit is not manlyit is not naturalthere are but two of us in the world  he returned no answer and observing that he continued to stretch himself from the window which was in the second story of the building and overlooked the court a new cause of apprehension mingled in some measure with her personal fears timidly and with streaming eyes and uplifted hands she approached her angry brother and fearfully yet firmly seized the skirt of his coat as if anxious to preserve him from the effects of that despair which so lately seemed turned against her and now against himself  he felt the pressure of her hold and drawing himself angrily back asked her sternly what she wanted  nothing she said quitting her hold of his coat but whatwhat did he look after so anxiously  after the devil he answered fiercely then drawing in his head and taking her hand by my soul clarait is true if ever there was truth in such a talehe stood by me just now and urged me to murder theewhat else could have put my huntingknife into my thoughtay by god and into my very handat such a momentyonder i could almost fancy i see him fly the wood and the rock and the water gleaming back the darkred furnacelight that is shed on them by his dragon wings by my soul i can hardly suppose it fancyi can hardly think but that i was under the influence of an evil spiritunder an act of fiendish possession but gone as he is gone let him beand thou too ready implement of evil be thou gone after him he drew from his pocket his right hand which had all this time held his huntingknife and threw the implement into the courtyard as he spoke then with a sad quietness and solemnity of manner shut the window and led his sister by the hand to her usual seat which her tottering steps scarce enabled her to reach clara he said after a pause of mournful silence we must think what is to be done without passion or violencethere may be something for us in the dice yet if we do not throw away our game a blot is never a blot till it is hitdishonour concealed is not dishonour in some respectsdost thou attend to me wretched girl he said suddenly and sternly raising his voice  yes brotheryes indeed brother she hastily replied terrified even by delay again to awaken his ferocious and ungovernable temper  thus it must be then he said you must marry this etheringtonthere is no help for it clarayou cannot complain of what your own vice and folly have rendered inevitable  but brothersaid the trembling girl  be silent i know all that you would say you love him not you would say i love him not no more than you nay what is more he loves you not if he did i might scruple to give you to him you being such as you have owned yourself but you shall wed him out of hate claraor for the interest of your familyor for what reason you willbut wed him you shall and must  brotherdearest brotherone single word  not of refusal or expostulationthat time is gone by said her stern censurer when i believed thee what i thought thee this morning i might advise you but i could not compel but since the honour of our family has been disgraced by your means it is but just that if possible its disgrace should be hidden and it shallay if selling you for a slave would tend to conceal it  you do worseyou do worse by me a slave in an open market may be bought by a kind masteryou do not give me that chanceyou wed me to one who  fear him not nor the worst that he can do clara said her brother i know on what terms he marries and being once more your brother as your obedience in this matter will make me he had better tear his flesh from his bones with his own teeth than do thee any displeasure by heaven i hate him so muchfor he has outreached me every waythat methinks it is some consolation that he will not receive in thee the excellent creature i thought theefallen as thou art thou art still too good for him  encouraged by the more gentle and almost affectionate tone in which her brother spoke clara could not help saying although almost in a whisper i trust it will not be soi trust he will consider his own condition honour and happiness better than to share it with me  let him utter such a scruple if he dares said mowbraybut he dares not hesitatehe knows that the instant he recedes from addressing you he signs his own deathwarrant or mine or perhaps that of both and his views too are of a kind that will not be relinquished on a point of scrupulous delicacy merely therefore clara nourish no such thought in your heart as that there is the least possibility of your escaping this marriage the match is bookedswear you will not hesitate  i will not she said almost breathlessly terrified lest he was about to start once more into the fit of unbridled fury which had before seized on him  do not even whisper or hint an objection but submit to your fate for it is inevitable  i willsubmitanswered clara in the same trembling accent  and i he said will spare youat least at presentand it may be for everall enquiry into the guilt which you have confessed rumours there were of misconduct which reached my ears even in england but who could have believed them that looked on you daily and witnessed your late course of lifeon this subject i will be at present silentperhaps may not again touch on itthat is if you do nothing to thwart my pleasure or to avoid the fate which circumstances render unavoidableand now it is lateretire clara to your bedthink on what i have said as what necessity has determined and not my selfish pleasure  he held out his hand and she placed but not without reluctant terror her trembling palm in his in this manner and with a sort of mournful solemnity as if they had been in attendance upon a funeral he handed his sister through a gallery hung with old family pictures at the end of which was claras bedchamber the moon which at this moment looked out through a huge volume of mustering clouds that had long been boding storm fell on the two last descendants of that ancient family as they glided hand in hand more like the ghosts of the deceased than like living persons through the hall and amongst the portraits of their forefathers the same thoughts were in the breast of both but neither attempted to say while they cast a flitting glance on the pallid and decayed representations how little did these anticipate this catastrophe of their house at the door of the bedroom mowbray quitted his sisters hand and said clara you should tonight thank god that saved you from a great danger and me from a deadly sin  i will she answeredi will and as if her terror had been anew excited by this allusion to what had passed she bid her brother hastily goodnight and was no sooner within her apartment than he heard her turn the key in the lock and draw two bolts besides  i understand you clara muttered mowbray between his teeth as he heard one bar drawn after another but if you could earth yourself under ben nevis you could not escape what fate has destined for youyes he said to himself as he walked with slow and moody pace through the moonlight gallery uncertain whether to return to the parlour or to retire to his solitary chamber when his attention was roused by a noise in the courtyard  the night was not indeed very far advanced but it had been so long since shawscastle received a guest that had mowbray not heard the rolling of wheels in the courtyard he might have thought rather of housebreakers than of visitors but as the sound of a carriage and horses was distinctly heard it instantly occurred to him that the guest must be lord etherington come even at this late hour to speak with him on the reports which were current to his sisters prejudice and perhaps to declare his addresses to her were at an end eager to know the worst and to bring matters to a decision he reentered the apartment he had just left where the lights were still burning and calling loudly to patrick whom he heard in communing with the postilion commanded him to show the visitor to miss mowbrays parlour it was not the light step of the young nobleman which came tramping or rather stamping through the long passage and up the two or three steps at the end of it neither was it lord etheringtons graceful figure which was seen when the door opened but the stout square substance of mr peregrine touchwood     chapter xvii  a relative      claimd kindred there and had his claims allowd  deserted village   starting at the unexpected and undesired apparition which presented itself in the manner described at the end of the last chapter mowbray yet felt at the same time a kind of relief that his meeting with lord etherington painfully decisive as that meeting must be was for a time suspended so it was with a mixture of peevishness and internal satisfaction that he demanded what had procured him the honour of a visit from mr touchwood at this late hour  necessity that makes the old wife trot replied touchwood no choice of mine i assure yougad mr mowbray i would rather have crossed saint gothard than run the risk i have done tonight rumbling through your breakneck roads in that dd old wheelbarrowon my word i believe i must be troublesome to your butler for a draught of somethingi am as thirsty as a coalheaver that is working by the piece you have porter i suppose or good old scotch twopenny  with a secret execration on his visitors effrontery mr mowbray ordered the servant to put down wine and water of which touchwood mixed a gobletful and drank it off  we are a small family said his entertainer and i am seldom at homestill more seldom receive guests when i chance to be herei am sorry i have no malt liquor if you prefer it  prefer it said touchwood compounding however another glass of sherry and water and adding a large piece of sugar to correct the hoarseness which he observed his night journey might bring onto be sure i prefer it and so does every body except frenchmen and dandiesno offence mr mowbray but you should order a hogshead from meuxthe brownstout wired down for exportation to the colonies keeps for any length of time and in every climatei have drank it where it must have cost a guinea a quart if interest had been counted  when i expect the honour of a visit from you mr touchwood i will endeavour to be better provided answered mowbray at present your arrival has been without notice and i would be glad to know if it has any particular object  this is what i call coming to the point said mr touchwood thrusting out his stout legs accoutred as they were with the ancient defences called boothose so as to rest his heels upon the fender upon my life the fire turns the best flower in the garden at this season of the yearill take the freedom to throw on a logis it not a strange thing by the by that one never sees a fagot in scotland you have much small wood mr mowbray i wonder you do not get some fellow from the midland counties to teach your people how to make a fagot  did you come all the way to shawscastle asked mowbray rather testily to instruct me in the mystery of fagotmaking  not exactlynot exactly answered the undaunted touchwood but there is a right and a wrong way in every thinga word by the way on any useful subject can never fall amissas for my immediate and more pressing business i can assure you that it is of a nature sufficiently urgent since it brings me to a house in which i am much surprised to find myself  the surprise is mutual sir said mowbray gravely observing that his guest made a pause it is full time you should explain it  well then replied touchwood i must first ask you whether you have never heard of a certain old gentleman called scrogie who took it into what he called his head poor man to be ashamed of the name he bore though owned by many honest and respectable men and chose to join it to your surname of mowbray as having a more chivalrous norman sounding and in a word a gentlemanlike twang with it  i have heard of such a person though only lately said mowbray reginald scrogie mowbray was his name i have reason to consider his alliance with my family as undoubted though you seem to mention it with a sneer sir i believe mr s mowbray regulated his family settlements very much upon the idea that his heir was to intermarry with our house  true true mr mowbray answered touchwood and certainly it is not your business to lay the axe to the root of the genealogical tree that is like to bear golden apples for youha  well well sirproceedproceed answered mowbray  you may also have heard that this old gentleman had a son who would willingly have cut up the said familytree into fagots who thought scrogie sounded as well as mowbray and had no fancy for an imaginary gentility which was to be attained by the change of ones natural name and the disowning as it were of ones actual relations  i think i have heard from lord etherington answered mowbray to whose communications i owe most of my knowledge about these scrogie people that old mr scrogie mowbray was unfortunate in a son who thwarted his father on every occasionwould embrace no opportunity which fortunate chances held out of raising and distinguishing the familyhad imbibed low tastes wandering habits and singular objects of pursuiton account of which his father disinherited him  it is very true mr mowbray proceeded touchwood that this person did happen to fall under his fathers displeasure because he scorned forms and flummeryloved better to make money as an honest merchant than to throw it away as an idle gentlemannever called a coach when walking on foot would serve the turnand liked the royal exchange better than st jamess park in short his father disinherited him because he had the qualities for doubling the estate rather than those for squandering it  all this may be quite correct mr touchwood replied mowbray but pray what has this mr scrogie junior to do with you or me  do with you or me said touchwood as if surprised at the question he has a great deal to do with me at least since i am the very man myself  the devil you are said mowbray opening wide his eyes in turn why mr aayour name is touchwoodp touchwoodpaul i suppose or peteri read it so in the subscription book at the well  peregrine sir peregrinemy mother would have me so christened because peregrine pickle came out during her confinement and my poor foolish father acquiesced because he thought it genteel and derived from the willoughbies i dont like it and i always write p short and you might have remarked an s also before the surnamei use at present p s touchwood i had an old acquaintance in the city who loved his jesthe always called me postscript touchwood  then sir said mowbray if you are really mr scrogie tout court i must suppose the name of touchwood is assumed  what the devil replied mr p s touchwood do you suppose there is no name in the english nation will couple up legitimately with my paternal name of scrogie except your own mr mowbrayi assure you i got the name of touchwood and a pretty spell of money along with it from an old godfather who admired my spirit in sticking by commerce  well sir every one has his tastemany would have thought it better to enjoy a hereditary estate by keeping your fathers name of mowbray than to have gained another by assuming a strangers name of touchwood  who told you mr touchwood was a stranger to me said the traveller for aught i know he had a better title to the duties of a son from me than the poor old man who made such a fool of himself by trying to turn gentleman in his old age he was my grandfathers partner in the great firm of touchwood scrogie and colet me tell you there is as good inheritance in house as in fielda mans partners are his fathers and brothers and a head clerk may be likened to a kind of first cousin  i meant no offence whatever mr touchwood scrogie  scrogie touchwood if you please said the senior the scrog branch first for it must become rotten ere it become touchwoodha ha hayou take me  a singular old fellow this said mowbray to himself and speaks in all the dignity of dollars but i will be civil to him till i can see what he is driving atyou are facetious mr touchwood he proceeded aloud i was only going to say that although you set no value upon your connexion with my family yet i cannot forget that such a circumstance exists and therefore i bid you heartily welcome to shawscastle  thank ye thank ye mr mowbrayi knew you would see the thing right to tell you the truth i should not have cared much to come abegging for your acquaintance and cousinship and so forth but that i thought you would be more tractable in your adversity than was your father in his prosperity  did you know my father sir said mowbray  ay ayi came once down here and was introduced to himsaw your sister and you when you were childrenhad thoughts of making my will then and should have clapped you both in before i set out to double cape horn but gad i wish my poor father had seen the reception i got i did not let the old gentleman mr mowbray of st ronans that was then smoke my moneybagsthat might have made him more tractablenot but that we went on indifferent well for a day or two till i got a hint that my room was wanted for that the duke of devilknowswhat was expected and my bed was to serve his valetdechambreoh damn all gentle cousins said i and off i set on the pad round the world again and thought no more of the mowbrays till a year or so ago  and pray what recalled us to your recollection  why said touchwood i was settled for some time at smyrna for i turn the penny go where i willi have done a little business even since i came herebut being at smyrna as i said i became acquainted with francis tyrrel  the natural brother of lord etherington said mowbray  ay so called answered touchwood but by and by he is more likely to prove the earl of etherington himself and tother fine fellow the bastard  the devil he isyou surprise me mr touchwood  i thought i shouldi thought i shouldfaith i am sometimes surprised myself at the turn things take in this world but the thing is not the less certainthe proofs are lying in the strong chest of our house at london deposited there by the old earl who repented of his roguery to miss martigny long before he died but had not courage enough to do his legitimate son justice till the sexton had housed him  good heaven sir said mowbray and did you know all this while that i was about to bestow the only sister of my house upon an impostor  what was my business with that mr mowbray replied touchwood you would have been very angry had any one suspected you of not being sharp enough to look out for yourself and your sister both besides lord etherington bad enough as he may be in other respects was till very lately no impostor or an innocent one for he only occupied the situation in which his father had placed him and indeed when i understood upon coming to england that he was gone down here and as i conjectured to pay his addresses to your sister to say truth i did not see he could do better here was a poor fellow that was about to cease to be a lord and a wealthy man was it not very reasonable that he should make the most of his dignity while he had it and if by marrying a pretty girl while in possession of his title he could get possession of the good estate of nettlewood why i could see nothing in it but a very pretty way of breaking his fall  very pretty for him indeed and very convenient too said mowbray but pray sir what was to become of the honour of my family  why what was the honour of your family to me said touchwood unless it was to recommend your family to my care that i was disinherited on account of it and if this etherington or bulmer had been a good fellow i would have seen all the mowbrays that ever wore broad cloth at jericho before i had interfered  i am really much indebted to your kindness said mowbray angrily  more than you are aware of answered touchwood for though i thought this bulmer even when declared illegitimate might be a reasonable good match for your sister considering the estate which was to accompany the union of their hands yet now i have discovered him to be a scoundrelevery way a scoundreli would not wish any decent girl to marry him were they to get all yorkshire instead of nettlewood so i have come to put you right  the strangeness of the news which touchwood so bluntly communicated made mowbrays head turn round like that of a man who grows dizzy at finding himself on the verge of a precipice touchwood observed his consternation which he willingly construed into an acknowledgment of his own brilliant genius  take a glass of wine mr mowbray he said complacently take a glass of old sherrynothing like it for clearing the ideasand do not be afraid of me though i come thus suddenly upon you with such surprising tidingsyou will find me a plain simple ordinary man that have my faults and my blunders like other people i acknowledge that much travel and experience have made me sometimes play the busybody because i find i can do things better than other people and i love to see folk stareits a way i have got but after all i am un bon diable as the frenchman says and here i have come four or five hundred miles to lie quiet among you all and put all your little matters to rights just when you think they are most desperate  i thank you for your good intentions said mowbray but i must needs say that they would have been more effectual had you been less cunning in my behalf and frankly told me what you knew of lord etherington as it is the matter has gone fearfully far i have promised him my sisteri have laid myself under personal obligations to himand there are other reasons why i fear i must keep my word to this man earl or no earl  what exclaimed touchwood would you give up your sister to a worthless rascal who is capable of robbing the postoffice and of murdering his brother because you have lost a trifle of money to him are you to let him go off triumphantly because he is a gamester as well as a cheatyou are a pretty fellow mr mowbray of st ronansyou are one of the happy sheep that go out for wool and come home shorn egad you think yourself a millstone and turn out a sack of grainyou flew abroad a hawk and have come home a pigeonyou snarled at the philistines and they have drawn your eyeteeth with a vengeance  this is all very witty mr touchwood replied mowbray but wit will not pay this man etherington or whatever he is so many hundreds as i have lost to him  why then wealth must do what wit cannot said old touchwood i must advance for you that is all look ye sir i do not go afoot for nothingif i have laboured i have reapedand like the fellow in the old play i have enough and can maintain my humourit is not a few hundreds or thousands either can stand betwixt old p s touchwood and his purpose and my present purpose is to make you mr mowbray of st ronans a free man of the forestyou still look grave on it young manwhy i trust you are not such an ass as to think your dignity offended because the plebeian scrogie comes to the assistance of the terribly great and old house of mowbray  i am indeed not such a fool answered mowbray with his eyes still bent on the ground to reject assistance that comes to me like a rope to a drowning manbut there is a circumstancehe stopped short and drank a glass of winea circumstance to which it is most painful to me to alludebut you seem my friendand i cannot intimate to you more strongly my belief in your professions of regard than by saying that the language held by lady penelope penfeather on my sisters account renders it highly proper that she were settled in life and i cannot but fear that the breaking off the affair with this man might be of great prejudice to her at this moment they will have nettlewood and they may live separatehe has offered to make settlements to that effect even on the very day of marriage her condition as a married woman will put her above scandal and above necessity from which i am sorry to say i cannot hope long to preserve her  for shamefor shamefor shame said touchwood accumulating his words thicker than usual on each other would you sell your own flesh and blood to a man like this bulmer whose character is now laid before you merely because a disappointed old maid speaks scandal of her a fine veneration you pay to the honoured name of mowbray if my poor old simple father had known what the owners of these two grand syllables could have stooped to do for merely ensuring subsistence he would have thought as little of the noble mowbrays as of the humble scrogies and i dare say the young lady is just such anothereager to get marriedno matter to whom  excuse me mr touchwood answered mowbray my sister entertains sentiments so very different from what you ascribe to her that she and i parted on the most unpleasant terms in consequence of my pressing this mans suit upon her god knows that i only did so because i saw no other outlet from this most unpleasant dilemma but since you are willing to interfere sir and aid me to disentangle these complicated matters which have i own been made worse by my own rashness i am ready to throw the matter completely into your hands just as if you were my father arisen from the dead nevertheless i must needs express my surprise at the extent of your intelligence in these affairs  you speak very sensibly young man said the traveller and as for my intelligence i have for some time known the finesses of this master bulmer as perfectly as if i had been at his elbow when he was playing all his dogs tricks with this family you would hardly suspect now he continued in a confidential tone that what you were so desirous a while ago should take place has in some sense actually happened and that the marriage ceremony has really passed betwixt your sister and this pretended lord etherington  have a care sir said mowbray fiercely do not abuse my candourthis is no place time or subject for impertinent jesting  as i live by bread i am serious said touchwood mr cargill performed the ceremony and there are two living witnesses who heard them say the words i clara take you francis or whatever the scottish church puts in place of that mystical formula  it is impossible said mowbray cargill dared not have done such a thinga clandestine proceeding such as you speak of would have cost him his living ill bet my soul against a horseshoe it is all an imposition and you come to disturb me sir amid my family distress with legends that have no more truth in them than the alkoran  there are some true things in the alkoran or rather the koran for the al is merely the article prefixed but let that passi will raise your wonder higher before i am done it is very true that your sister was indeed joined in marriage with this same bulmer that calls himself by the title of etherington but it is just as true that the marriage is not worth a maravedi for she believed him at the time to be another personto be in a word francis tyrrel who is actually what the other pretends to be a nobleman of fortune  i cannot understand one word of all this said mowbray i must to my sister instantly and demand of her if there be any real foundation for these wonderful averments  do not go said touchwood detaining him you shall have a full explanation from me and to comfort you under your perplexity i can assure you that cargills consent to celebrate the nuptials was only obtained by an aspersion thrown on your sisters character which induced him to believe that speedy marriage would be the sole means of saving her reputation and i am convinced in my own mind it is only the revival of this report which has furnished the foundation of lady penelopes chattering  if i could think sosaid mowbray if i could but think this is truthand it seems to explain in some degree my sisters mysterious conductif i could but think it true i should fall down and worship you as an angel from heaven  a proper sort of angel said touchwood looking modestly down on his short sturdy supportersdid you ever hear of an angel in boothose or do you suppose angels are sent to wait on brokendown horsejockeys  call me what you will mr touchwood said the young man only make out your story true and my sister innocent  very well spoken sir answered the senior very well spoken but then i understand you are to be guided by my prudence and experience none of your g damme doings siryour duels or your drubbings let me manage the affair for you and i will bring you through with a flowing sail  sir i must feel as a gentlemansaid mowbray  feel as a fool said touchwood for that is the true case nothing would please this bulmer better than to fight through his roguerieshe knows very well that he who can slit a pistolball on the edge of a penknife will always preserve some sort of reputation amidst his scoundrelismbut i shall take care to stop that hole sit downbe a man of sense and listen to the whole of this strange story  mowbray sat down accordingly and touchwood in his own way and with many characteristic interjectional remarks gave him an account of the early loves of clara and tyrrelof the reasons which induced bulmer at first to encourage their correspondence in hopes that his brother would by a clandestine marriage altogether ruin himself with his fatherof the change which took place in his views when he perceived the importance annexed by the old earl to the union of miss mowbray with his apparent heirof the desperate stratagem which he endeavoured to play off by substituting himself in the room of his brotherand all the consequences which it is unnecessary to resume here as they are detailed at length by the perpetrator himself in his correspondence with captain jekyl  when the whole communication was ended mowbray almost stupified by the wonders he had heard remained for some time in a sort of reverie from which he only started to ask what evidence could be produced of a story so strange  the evidence answered touchwood of one who was a deep agent in all these matters from first to lastas complete a rogue i believe as the devil himself with this difference that our mortal fiend does not i believe do evil for the sake of evil but for the sake of the profit which attends it how far this plea will avail him in a court of conscience i cannot tell but his disposition was so far akin to humanity that i have always found my old acquaintance as ready to do good as harm providing he had the same agio upon the transaction  on my soul said mowbray you must mean solmes whom i have long suspected to be a deep villainand now he proves traitor to boot how the devil could you get into his intimacy mr touchwood  the case was particular said touchwood mr solmes too active a member of the community to be satisfied with managing the affairs which his master intrusted to him adventured in a little business on his own account and thinking i suppose that the late earl of etherington had forgotten fully to acknowledge his services as valet to his son he supplied that defect by a small check on our house for l100 in name and bearing the apparent signature of the deceased this small mistake being detected mr solmes porteur of the little billet would have been consigned to the custody of a bowstreet officer but that i found means to relieve him on condition of his making known to me the points of private history which i have just been communicating to you what i had known of tyrrel at smyrna had given me much interest in him and you may guess it was not lessened by the distresses which he had sustained through his brothers treachery by this fellows means i have counterplotted all his masters fine schemes for example as soon as i learned bulmer was coming down here i contrived to give tyrrel an anonymous hint well knowing he would set off like the devil to thwart him and so i should have the whole dramatis person√¶ together and play them all off against each other after my own pleasure  in that case said mr mowbray your expedient brought about the rencontre between the two brothers when both might have fallen  cant deny itcant deny it answered scrogie a little discountenanceda mere accidentno one can guard every pointegad but i had like to have been baffled again for bulmer sent the lad jekyl who is not such a black sheep neither but what there are some white hairs about him upon a treaty with tyrrel that my secret agent was not admitted to gad but i discovered the wholeyou will scarce guess how  probably not easily indeed sir answered mowbray for your sources of intelligence are not the most obvious any more than your mode of acting the most simple or most comprehensible  i would not have it so said touchwood simple men perish in their simplicityi carry my eyeteeth about meand for my source of informationwhy i played the eavesdropper sirlistenedknew my landladys cupboard with the double doorgot into it as she has done many a timesuch a fine gentleman as you would rather cut a mans throat i suppose than listen at a cupboard door though the object were to prevent murder  i cannot say i should have thought of the expedient certainly sir said mowbray  i did though said scrogie and learned enough of what was going on to give jekyl a hint that sickened him of his commission i believeso the game is all in my own hands bulmer has no one to trust to but solmes and solmes tells me every thing  here mowbray could not suppress a movement of impatience  i wish to god sir that since you were so kind as to interest yourself in affairs so intimately concerning my family you had been pleased to act with a little more openness towards me here have i been for weeks the intimate of a damned scoundrel whose throat i ought to have cut for his scandalous conduct to my sister here have i been rendering her and myself miserable and getting myself cheated every night by a swindler whom you if it had been your pleasure could have unmasked by a single word i do all justice to your intentions sir but upon my soul i cannot help wishing you had conducted yourself with more frankness and less mystery and i am truly afraid your love of dexterity has been too much for your ingenuity and that you have suffered matters to run into such a skein of confusion as you yourself will find difficulty in unravelling  touchwood smiled and shook his head in all the conscious pride of superior understanding young man he said when you have seen a little of the world and especially beyond the bounds of this narrow island you will find much more art and dexterity necessary in conducting these businesses to an issue than occurs to a blind john bull or a raw scotchman you will be then no stranger to the policy of life which deals in mining and counterminingnow in making feints now in thrusting with forthright passes i look upon you mr mowbray as a young man spoiled by staying at home and keeping bad company and will make it my business if you submit yourself to my guidance to inform your understanding so as to retrieve your estatedontdont answer me sir because i know too well by experience how young men answer on these subjectsthey are conceited sir as conceited as if they had been in all the four quarters of the world i hate to be answered sir i hate it and to tell you the truth it is because tyrrel has a fancy of answering me that i rather make you my confidant on this occasion than him i would have had him throw himself into my arms and under my directions but he hesitatedhe hesitated mr mowbrayand i despise hesitation if he thinks he has wit enough to manage his own matters let him try itlet him try it not but i will do all i can for him in fitting time and place but i will let him dwell in his perplexities and uncertainties for a little while longer and so mr mowbray you see what sort of an odd fellow i am and you can satisfy me at once whether you mean to come into my measuresonly speak out at once sir for i abhor hesitation  while touchwood thus spoke mowbray was forming his resolution internally he was not so inexperienced as the senior supposed at least he could plainly see that he had to do with an obstinate capricious old man who with the best intentions in the world chose to have every thing in his own way and like most petty politicians was disposed to throw intrigue and mystery over matters which had much better be prosecuted boldly and openly but he perceived at the same time that touchwood as a sort of relation wealthy childless and disposed to become his friend was a person to be conciliated the rather that the traveller himself had frankly owned that it was francis tyrrels want of deference towards him which had forfeited or at least abated his favour mowbray recollected also that the circumstances under which he himself stood did not permit him to trifle with returning gleams of good fortune subduing therefore the haughtiness of temper proper to him as an only son and heir he answered respectfully that in his condition the advice and assistance of mr scrogie touchwood were too important not to be purchased at the price of submitting his own judgment to that of an experienced and sagacious friend  well said mr mowbray replied the senior well said let me once have the management of your affairs and we will brush them up for you without loss of timei must be obliged to you for a bed for the night howeverit is as dark as a wolfs mouth and if you will give orders to keep the poor devil of a postilion and his horses too why i will be the more obliged to you  mowbray applied himself to the bell patrick answered the call and was much surprised when the old gentleman taking the word out of his entertainers mouth desired a bed to be got ready with a little fire in the grate for i take it friend he went on you have not guests here very oftenand see that my sheets be not damp and bid the housemaid take care not to make the bed upon an exact level but let it slope from the pillow to the footposts at a declivity of about eighteen inchesand hark yeget me a jug of barleywater to place by my bedside with the squeeze of a lemonor stay you will make it as sour as beelzebubbring the lemon on a saucer and i will mix it myself  patrick listened like one of sense forlorn his head turning like a mandarin alternately from the speaker to his master as if to ask the latter whether this was all reality the instant that touchwood stopped mowbray added his fiat  let every thing be done to make mr touchwood comfortable in the way he wishes  aweel sir said patrick i shall tell mally to be sure and we maun do our best andbut its unco late  and therefore said touchwood the sooner we get to bed the better my old friend i for one must be stirring earlyi have business of life and deathit concerns you too mr mowbraybut no more of that till tomorrowand let the lad put up his horses and get him a bed somewhere  patrick here thought he had gotten upon firm ground for resistance for which displeased with the dictatorial manner of the stranger he felt considerably inclined  ye may catch us at that if ye can said patrick theres nae post cattle come into our stableswhat do we ken but that they may be glandered as the groom says  we must take the risk tonight patrick said mowbray reluctantly enoughunless mr touchwood will permit the horses to come back early next morning  not i indeed said touchwood safe bind safe findit may be once away and aye away and we shall have enough to do tomorrow morning moreover the poor carrion are tired and the merciful man is merciful to his beastand in a word if the horses go back to st ronans well tonight i go there for company  it often happens owing i suppose to the perversity of human nature that subserviency in trifles is more difficult to a proud mind than compliance in matters of more importance mowbray like other young gentlemen of his class was finically rigid in his stable discipline and even lord etheringtons horses had not been admitted into that sanctum sanctorum into which he now saw himself obliged to induct two wretched posthacks but he submitted with the best grace he could and patrick while he left their presence with liftedup hands and eyes to execute the orders he had received could scarcely help thinking that the old man must be the devil in disguise since he could thus suddenly control his fiery master even in the points which he had hitherto seemed to consider as of most vital importance  the lord in his mercy haud a grip of this puir family for i that was born in it am like to see the end of it thus ejaculated patrick     chapter xviii  the wanderer      tis a naughty night to swim in  king lear   there was a wild uncertainty about mowbrays ideas after he started from a feverish sleep on the morning succeeding this memorable interview that his sister whom he really loved as much as he was capable of loving any thing had dishonoured him and her name and the horrid recollection of their last interview was the first idea which his waking imagination was thrilled with then came touchwoods tale of exculpationand he persuaded himself or strove to do so that clara must have understood the charge he had brought against her as referring to her attachment to tyrrel and its fatal consequences again still he doubted how that could bestill feared that there must be more behind than her reluctance to confess the fraud which had been practised on her by bulmer and then again he strengthened himself in the first and more pleasing opinion by recollecting that averse as she was to espouse the person he proposed to her it must have appeared to her the completion of ruin if he mowbray should obtain knowledge of the clandestine marriage  yeso yes he said to himself she would think that this story would render me more eager in the rascals interest as the best way of hushing up such a discreditable affairfaith and she would have judged right too for had he actually been lord etherington i do not see what else she could have done but not being lord etherington and an anointed scoundrel into the bargain i will content myself with cudgelling him to death so soon as i can get out of the guardianship of this old meddling obstinate selfwilled busybodythen what is to be done for clarathis mock marriage was a mere bubble and both parties must draw stakes she likes this grave don who proves to be the stick of the right tree after allso do not i though there be something lordlike about him i was sure a strolling painter could not have carried it off so she may marry him i suppose if the law is not against itthen she has the earldom and the oaklands and nettlewood all at oncegad we should come in winners after alland i dare say this old boy touchwood is as rich as a jewworth a hundred thousand at leasthe is too peremptory to be cut up for sixpence under a hundred thousandand he talks of putting me to rightsi must not wincemust stand still to be curried a littleonly i wish the law may permit claras being married to this other earla woman cannot marry two brothers that is certainbut then if she is not married to the one of them in good and lawful form there can be no bar to her marrying the other i should thinki hope the lawyers will talk no nonsense about iti hope clara will have no foolish scruplesbut by my word the first thing i have to hope is that the thing is true for it comes through but a suspicious channel ill away to clara instantlyget the truth out of herand consider what is to be done  thus partly thought and partly spoke the young laird of st ronans hastily dressing himself in order to enquire into the strange chaos of events which perplexed his imagination  when he came down to the parlour where they had supped last night and where breakfast was prepared this morning he sent for a girl who acted as his sisters immediate attendant and asked if miss mowbray was yet stirring  the girl answered she had not rung her bell  it is past her usual hour said mowbray but she was disturbed last night go martha tell her to get up instantlysay i have excellent good news for heror if her head aches i will come and tell them to her before she risesgo like lightning  martha went and returned in a minute or two i cannot make my mistress hear sir knock as loud as i will i wish she added with that love of evil presage which is common in the lower ranks that miss clara may be well for i never knew her sleep so sound  mowbray jumped from the chair into which he had thrown himself ran through the gallery and knocked smartly at his sisters door there was no answer clara dear claraanswer me but one wordsay but you are well i frightened you last nighti had been drinking winei was violentforgive mecome do not be sulkyspeak but a single wordsay but you are well  he made the pauses longer betwixt every branch of his address knocked sharper and louder listened more anxiously for an answer at length he attempted to open the door but found it locked or otherwise secured does miss mowbray always lock her door he asked the girl  never knew her to do it before sir she leaves it open that i may call her and open the windowshutters  she had too good reason for precaution last night thought her brother and then remembered having heard her bar the door  come clara he continued greatly agitated do not be silly if you will not open the door i must force it thats all for how can i tell but that you are sick and unable to answerif you are only sullen say soshe returns no answer he said turning to the domestic who was now joined by touchwood  mowbrays anxiety was so great that it prevented his taking any notice of his guest and he proceeded to say without regarding his presence what is to be doneshe may be sickshe may be asleepshe may have swooned if i force the door it may terrify her to death in the present weak state of her nervesclara dear clara do but speak a single word and you shall remain in your own room as long as you please  there was no answer miss mowbrays maid hitherto too much fluttered and alarmed to have much presence of mind now recollected a backstair which communicated with her mistresss room from the garden and suggested she might have gone out that way  gone out said mowbray in great anxiety and looking at the heavy fog or rather small rain which blotted the november morninggone out and in weather like thisbut we may get into her room from the backstair  so saying and leaving his guest to follow or remain as he thought proper he flew rather than walked to the garden and found the private door which led into it from the bottom of the backstair above mentioned was wide open full of vague but fearful apprehensions he rushed up to the door of his sisters apartment which opened from her dressingroom to the landingplace of the stair it was ajar and that which communicated betwixt the bedroom and dressingroom was half open clara clara exclaimed mowbray invoking her name rather in an agony of apprehension than as any longer hoping for a reply and his apprehension was but too prophetic  miss mowbray was not in that apartment and from the order in which it was found it was plain she had neither undressed on the preceding night nor occupied the bed mowbray struck his forehead in an agony of remorse and fear i have terrified her to death he said she has fled into the woods and perished there  under the influence of this apprehension mowbray after another hasty glance around the apartment as if to assure himself that clara was not there rushed again into the dressingroom almost overturning the traveller who in civility had not ventured to enter the inner apartment you are as mad as a hamakoii11 said the traveller let us consult together and i am sure i can contrive  oh dn your contrivance said mowbray forgetting all proposed respect in his natural impatience aggravated by his alarm if you had behaved straightforward and like a man of common sense this would not have happened  god forgive you young man if your reflections are unjust said the traveller quitting the hold he had laid upon mowbrays coat and god forgive me too if i have done wrong while endeavouring to do for the bestbut may not miss mowbray have gone down to the well i will order my horses and set off instantly  do do said mowbray recklessly i thank you i thank you and hastily traversing the garden as if desirous to get rid at once of his visitor and his own thoughts he took the shortest road to a little posterngate which led into the extensive copsewood through some part of which clara had caused a walk to be cut to a little summerhouse built of rough shingles covered with creeping shrubs  as mowbray hastened through the garden he met the old man by whom it was kept a native of the south country and an old dependent on the family have you seen my sister said mowbray hurrying his words on each other with the eagerness of terror  whats your wull st ronans answered the old man at once dull of hearing and slow of apprehension  have you seen miss clara shouted mowbray and muttered an oath or two at the gardeners stupidity  in troth have i replied the gardener deliberately what suld ail me to see miss clara st ronans  when and where eagerly demanded the querist  ou just yestreen after teytimeafore ye cam hame yoursell galloping sae fast said old joseph  i am as stupid as he to put off my time in speaking to such an old cabbagestock said mowbray and hastened on to the posterngate already mentioned leading from the garden into what was usually called miss claras walk two or three domestics whispering to each other and with countenances that showed grief fear and suspicion followed their master desirous to be employed yet afraid to force their services on the fiery young man  at the little postern he found some trace of her he sought the passkey of clara was left in the lock it was then plain that she must have passed that way but at what hour or for what purpose mowbray dared not conjecture the path after running a quarter of a mile or more through an open grove of oaks and sycamores attained the verge of the large brook and became there steep and rocky difficult to the infirm and alarming to the nervous often approaching the brink of a precipitous ledge of rock which in this place overhung the stream in some places brawling and foaming in hasty current and in others seeming to slumber in deep and circular eddies the temptations which this dangerous scene must have offered an excited and desperate spirit came on mowbray like the blight of the simoom and he stood a moment to gather breath and overcome these horrible anticipations ere he was able to proceed his attendants felt the same apprehension puir thingpuir thingo god send she may not have been left to hersellgod send she may have been upholden were whispered by patrick to the maidens and by them to each other  at this moment the old gardener was heard behind them shouting masterst ronansmasteri have fundi have fund  have you found my sister exclaimed the brother with breathless anxiety  the old man did not answer till he came up and then with his usual slowness of delivery he replied to his masters repeated enquiries na i haena fund miss clara but i hae fund something ye wad be wae to loseyour braw huntingknife  he put the implement into the hand of its owner who recollecting the circumstances under which he had flung it from him last night and the now too probable consequences of that interview bestowed on it a deep imprecation and again hurled it from him into the brook the domestics looked at each other and recollecting each at the same time that the knife was a favourite tool of their master who was rather curious in such articles had little doubt that his mind was affected in a temporary way at least by his anxiety on his sisters account he saw their confused and inquisitive looks and assuming as much composure and presence of mind as he could command directed martha and her female companions to return and search the walks on the other side of shawscastle and finally ordered patrick back to ring the bell which he said assuming a confidence that he was far from entertaining might call miss mowbray home from some of her long walks he farther desired his groom and horses might meet him at the clattering brig so called from a noisy cascade which was formed by the brook above which was stretched a small footbridge of planks having thus shaken off his attendants he proceeded himself with all the speed he was capable of exerting to follow out the path in which he was at present engaged which being a favourite walk with his sister she might perhaps have adopted from mere habit when in a state of mind which he had too much reason to fear must have put choice out of the question  he soon reached the summerhouse which was merely a seat covered overhead and on the sides open in front and neatly paved with pebbles this little bower was perched like a hawks nest almost upon the edge of a projecting crag the highest point of the line of rock which we have noticed and had been selected by poor clara on account of the prospect which it commanded down the valley one of her gloves lay on the small rustic table in the summerhouse mowbray caught it eagerly up it was drenched with wetthe preceding day had been dry so that had she forgot it there in the morning or in the course of the day it could not have been in that state she had certainly been there during the night when it rained heavily  mowbray thus assured that clara had been in this place while her passions and fears were so much afloat as they must have been at her flight from her fathers house cast a hurried and terrified glance from the brow of the precipice into the deep stream that eddied below it seemed to him that in the sullen roar of the water he heard the last groans of his sisterthe foamflakes caught his eye as if they were a part of her garments but a closer examination showed that there was no appearance of such a catastrophe descending the path on the other side of the bower he observed a footprint in a place where the clay was moist and tenacious which from the small size and the shape of the shoe it appeared to him must be a trace of her whom he sought he hurried forward therefore with as much speed as yet permitted him to look out keenly for similar impressions of which it seemed to him he remarked several although less perfect than the former being much obliterated by the quantity of rain that had since fallena circumstance seeming to prove that several hours had elapsed since the person had passed  at length through the various turnings and windings of a long and romantic path mowbray found himself without having received any satisfactory intelligence by the side of the brook called st ronans burn at the place where it was crossed by footpassengers by the clattering brig and by horsemen through a ford a little lower at this point the fugitive might have either continued her wanderings through her paternal woods by a path which after winding about a mile returned to shawscastle or she might have crossed the bridge and entered a broken horseway common to the public leading to the aultoun of st ronans  mowbray after a moments consideration concluded that the last was her most probable optionhe mounted his horse which the groom had brought down according to order and commanding the man to return by the footpath which he himself could not examine he proceeded to ride towards the ford the brook was swollen during the night and the groom could not forbear intimating to his master that there was considerable danger in attempting to cross it but mowbrays mind and feelings were too highstrung to permit him to listen to cautious counsel he spurred the snorting and reluctant horse into the torrent though the water rising high on the upper side broke both over the pommel and the croupe of his saddle it was by exertion of great strength and sagacity that the good horse kept the fordway had the stream forced him down among the rocks which lie below the crossingplace the consequences must have been fatal mowbray however reached the opposite side in safety to the joy and admiration of the servant who stood staring at him during the adventure he then rode hastily towards the aultoun determined if he could not hear tidings of his sister in that village that he would spread the alarm and institute a general search after her since her elopement from shawscastle could in that case no longer be concealed we must leave him however in his present state of uncertainty in order to acquaint our readers with the reality of those evils which his foreboding mind and disturbed conscience could only anticipate  footnote  ii11 a fool is so termed in turkey     chapter xix  the catastrophe      what sheeted ghost is wandering through the storm     for never did a maid of middle earth     choose such a time or spot to vent her sorrows  old play   grief shame confusion and terror had contributed to overwhelm the unfortunate clara mowbray at the moment when she parted with her brother after the stormy and dangerous interview which it was our task to record in a former chapter for years her life her whole tenor of thought had been haunted by the terrible apprehension of a discovery and now the thing which she feared had come upon her the extreme violence of her brother which went so far as to menace her personal safety had united with the previous conflict of passions to produce a rapture of fear which probably left her no other free agency than that which she derived from the blind instinct which urges flight as the readiest resource in danger  we have no means of exactly tracing the course of this unhappy young woman it is probable she fled from shawscastle on hearing the arrival of mr touchwoods carriage which she might mistake for that of lord etherington and thus while mowbray was looking forward to the happier prospects which the travellers narrative seemed to open his sister was contending with rain and darkness amidst the difficulties and dangers of the mountain path which we have described these were so great that a young woman more delicately brought up must either have lain down exhausted or have been compelled to turn her steps back to the residence she had abandoned but the solitary wanderings of clara had inured her to fatigue and to nightwalks and the deeper causes of terror which urged her to flight rendered her insensible to the perils of her way she had passed the bower as was evident from her glove remaining there and had crossed the footbridge although it was almost wonderful that in so dark a night she should have followed with such accuracy a track where the missing a single turn by a cubits length might have precipitated her into eternity  it is probable that claras spirits and strength began in some degree to fail her after she had proceeded a little way on the road to the aultoun for she had stopped at the solitary cottage inhabited by the old female pauper who had been for a time the hostess of the penitent and dying hannah irwin here as the inmate of the cottage acknowledged she had made some knocking and she owned she had heard her moan bitterly as she entreated for admission the old hag was one of those whose hearts adversity turns to very stone and obstinately kept her door shut impelled more probably by general hatred to the human race than by the superstitious fears which seized her although she perversely argued that she was startled at the supernatural melody and sweetness of tone with which the benighted wanderer made her supplication she admitted that when she heard the poor petitioner turn from the door her heart was softened and she did intend to open with the purpose of offering her at least a shelter but that before she could hirple to the door and get the bar taken down the unfortunate supplicant was not to be seen which strengthened the old womans opinion that the whole was a delusion of satan  it is conjectured that the repulsed wanderer made no other attempt to awaken pity or obtain shelter until she came to mr cargills manse in the upper room of which a light was still burning owing to a cause which requires some explanation  the reader is aware of the reasons which induced bulmer or the titular lord etherington to withdraw from the country the sole witness as he conceived who could or at least who might choose to bear witness to the fraud which he had practised on the unfortunate clara mowbray of three persons present at the marriage besides the parties the clergyman was completely deceived solmes he conceived to be at his own exclusive devotion and therefore if by his means this hannah irwin could be removed from the scene he argued plausibly that all evidence to the treachery which he had practised would be effectually stifled hence his agent solmes had received a commission as the reader may remember to effect her removal without loss of time and had reported to his master that his efforts had been effectual  but solmes since he had fallen under the influence of touchwood was constantly employed in counteracting the schemes which he seemed most active in forwarding while the traveller enjoyed to him an exquisite gratification the amusement of countermining as fast as bulmer could mine and had in prospect the pleasing anticipation of blowing up the pioneer with his own petard for this purpose as soon as touchwood learned that his house was to be applied to for the original deeds left in charge by the deceased earl of etherington he expedited a letter directing that only the copies should be sent and thus rendered nugatory bulmers desperate design of possessing himself of that evidence for the same reason when solmes announced to him his masters anxious wish to have hannah irwin conveyed out of the country he appointed him to cause the sick woman to be carefully transported to the manse where mr cargill was easily induced to give her temporary refuge  to this good man who might be termed an israelite without guile the distress of the unhappy woman would have proved a sufficient recommendation nor was he likely to have enquired whether her malady might not be infectious or to have made any of those other previous investigations which are sometimes clogs upon the bounty or hospitality of more prudent philanthropists but to interest him yet farther mr touchwood informed him by letter that the patient not otherwise unknown to him was possessed of certain most material information affecting a family of honour and consequence and that he himself with mr mowbray of st ronans in the quality of a magistrate intended to be at the manse that evening to take her declaration upon this important subject such indeed was the travellers purpose which might have been carried into effect but for his own selfimportant love of manoeuvring on the one part and the fiery impatience of mowbray on the other which as the reader knows sent the one at full gallop to shawscastle and obliged the other to follow him post haste this necessity he intimated to the clergyman by a note which he dispatched express as he himself was in the act of stepping into the chaise  he requested that the most particular attention should be paid to the invalidpromised to be at the manse with mr mowbray early on the morrowand with the lingering and inveterate selfconceit which always induced him to conduct every thing with his own hand directed his friend mr cargill not to proceed to take the sick womans declaration or confession until he arrived unless in case of extremity  it had been an easy matter for solmes to transfer the invalid from the wretched cottage to the clergymans manse the first appearance of the associate of much of her guilt had indeed terrified her but he scrupled not to assure her that his penitence was equal to her own and that he was conveying her where their joint deposition would be formally received in order that they might so far as possible atone for the evil of which they had been jointly guilty he also promised her kind usage for herself and support for her children and she willingly accompanied him to the clergymans residence he himself resolving to abide in concealment the issue of the mystery without again facing his master whose star as he well discerned was about to shoot speedily from its exalted sphere  the clergyman visited the unfortunate patient as he had done frequently during her residence in his vicinity and desired that she might be carefully attended during the whole day she seemed better but whether the means of supporting her exhausted frame had been too liberally administered or whether the thoughts which gnawed her conscience had returned with double severity when she was released from the pressure of immediate want it is certain that about midnight the fever began to gain ground and the person placed in attendance on her came to inform the clergyman then deeply engaged with the siege of ptolemais that she doubted if the woman would live till morning and that she had something lay heavy at her heart which she wished as the emissary expressed it to make a clean breast of before she died or lost possession of her senses  awakened by such a crisis mr cargill at once became a man of this world clear in his apprehension and cool in his resolution as he always was when the path of duty lay before him comprehending from the various hints of his friend touchwood that the matter was of the last consequence his own humanity as well as inexperience dictated his sending for skilful assistance his manservant was accordingly dispatched on horseback to the well for dr quackleben while upon the suggestion of one of his maids that mrs dods was an uncommon skeely body about a sickbed the wench was dismissed to supplicate the assistance of the gudewife of the cleikum which she was not indeed wont to refuse whenever it could be useful the male emissary proved in scottish phrase a corbie messengeriig for either he did not find the doctor or he found him better engaged than to attend the sickbed of a pauper at a request which promised such slight remuneration as that of a parish minister but the female ambassador was more successful for though she found our friend luckie dods preparing for bed at an hour unusually late in consequence of some anxiety on account of mr touchwoods unexpected absence the good old dame only growled a little about the ministers fancies in taking puir bodies into his own house and then instantly donning cloak hood and pattens marched down the gate with all the speed of the good samaritan one maid bearing the lantern before her while the other remained to keep the house and to attend to the wants of mr tyrrel who engaged willingly to sit up to receive mr touchwood  but ere dame dods had arrived at the manse the patient had summoned mr cargill to her presence and required him to write her confession while she had life and breath to make it  for i believe she added raising herself in the bed and rolling her eyes wildly around that were i to confess my guilt to one of a less sacred character the evil spirit whose servant i have been would carry away his prey both body and soul before they had severed from each other however short the space that they must remain in partnership  mr cargill would have spoken some ghostly consolation but she answered with pettish impatience waste not wordswaste not wordslet me speak that which i must tell and sign it with my hand and do you as the more immediate servant of god and therefore bound to bear witness to the truth take heed you write that which i tell you and nothing else i desired to have told this to st ronansi have even made some progress in telling it to othersbut i am glad i broke short offfor i know you josiah cargill though you have long forgotten me  it may be so said cargill i have indeed no recollection of you  you once knew hannah irwin though said the sick woman who was companion and relation to miss clara mowbray and who was present with her on that sinful night when she was wedded in the kirk of st ronans  do you mean to say that you are that person said cargill holding the candle so as to throw some light on the face of the sick woman i cannot believe it  no replied the penitent there is indeed a difference between wickedness in the act of carrying through its successful machinations and wickedness surrounded by all the horrors of a deathbed  do not yet despair said cargill grace is omnipotentto doubt this is in itself a great crime  be it soi cannot help itmy heart is hardened mr cargill and there is something here she pressed her bosom which tells me that with prolonged life and renewed health even my present agonies would be forgotten and i should become the same i have been before i have rejected the offer of grace mr cargill and not through ignorance for i have sinned with my eyes open care not for me then who am a mere outcast he again endeavoured to interrupt her but she continued or if you really wish my welfare let me relieve my bosom of that which presses it and it may be that i shall then be better able to listen to you you say you remember me notbut if i tell you how often you refused to perform in secret the office which was required of youhow much you urged that it was against your canonical rulesif i name the argument to which you yieldedand remind you of your purpose to acknowledge your transgression to your brethren in the church courts to plead your excuse and submit to their censure which you said could not be a light oneyou will be then aware that in the voice of the miserable pauper you hear the words of the once artful gay and specious hannah irwin  i allow iti allow it said mr cargill i admit the tokens and believe you to be indeed her whose name you assume  then one painful step is over said she for i would ere now have lightened my conscience by confession saving for the cursed pride of spirit which was ashamed of poverty though it had not shrunk from guiltwellin these arguments which were urged to you by a youth best known to you by the name of francis tyrrel though more properly entitled to that of valentine bulmer we practised on you a base and gross deceptiondid you not hear some one sighi hope there is no one in the roomi trust i shall die when my confession is signed and sealed without my name being dragged through the publici hope ye bring not in your menials to gaze on my abject miseryi cannot brook that  she paused and listened for the ear usually deafened by pain is sometimes on the contrary rendered morbidly acute mr cargill assured her there was no one present but himself but o most unhappy woman he said what does your introduction prepare me to expect  your expectation be it ever so ominous shall be fully satisfiedi was the guilty confidant of the false francis tyrrelclara loved the true onewhen the fatal ceremony passed the bride and the clergyman were deceived alikeand i was the wretchthe fiendwho aiding another yet blacker if blacker could bemainly helped to accomplish this cureless misery  wretch exclaimed the clergyman and had you not then done enoughwhy did you expose the betrothed of one brother to become the wife of another  i acted said the sick woman only as bulmer instructed me but i had to do with a master of the game he contrived by his agent solmes to match me with a husband imposed on me by his devices as a man of fortunea wretch who maltreated meplundered mesold meoh if fiends laugh as i have heard they can what a jubilee of scorn will there be when bulmer and i enter their place of tortureharki am sure of itsome one draws breath as if shuddering  you will distract yourself if you give way to these fancies be calmspeak onbut oh at last and for once speak the truth  i will for it will best gratify my hatred against him who having first robbed me of my virtue made me a sport and a plunder to the basest of the species for that i wandered here to unmask him i had heard he again stirred his suit to clara and i came here to tell young mowbray the wholebut do you wonder that i shrunk from doing so till this last decisive momenti thought of my conduct to clara and how could i face her brotherand yet i hated her not after i learned her utter wretchednessher deep misery verging even upon madnessi hated her not then i was sorry that she was not to fall to the lot of a better man than bulmerand i pitied her after she was rescued by tyrrel and you may remember it was i who prevailed on you to conceal her marriage  i remember it answered cargill and that you alleged as a reason for secrecy danger from her family i did conceal it until reports that she was again to be married reached my ears  well then said the sick woman clara mowbray ought to forgive mesince what ill i have done her was inevitable while the good i did was voluntaryi must see her josiah cargilli must see her before i diei shall never pray till i see heri shall never profit by word of godliness till i see her if i cannot obtain the pardon of a worm like myself how can i hope for that of  she started at these words with a faint scream for slowly and with a feeble hand the curtains of the bed opposite to the side at which cargill sat were opened and the figure of clara mowbray her clothes and long hair drenched and dripping with rain stood in the opening by the bedside the dying woman sat upright her eyes starting from their sockets her lips quivering her face pale her emaciated hands grasping the bedclothes as if to support herself and looking as much aghast as if her confession had called up the apparition of her betrayed friend  hannah irwin said clara with her usual sweetness of tone my early friendmy unprovoked enemybetake thee to him who hath pardon for us all and betake thee with confidencefor i pardon you as freely as if you had never wronged meas freely as i desire my own pardonfarewellfarewell  she retired from the room ere the clergyman could convince himself that it was more than a phantom which he beheld he ran down stairshe summoned assistants but no one could attend his call for the deep ruckling groans of the patient satisfied every one that she was breathing her last and mrs dods with the maidservant ran into the bedroom to witness the death of hannah irwin which shortly after took place  that event had scarcely occurred when the maidservant who had been left in the inn came down in great terror to acquaint her mistress that a lady had entered the house like a ghost and was dying in mr tyrrels room the truth of the story we must tell our own way  in the irregular state of miss mowbrays mind a less violent impulse than that which she had received from her brothers arbitrary violence added to the fatigues dangers and terrors of her nightwalk might have exhausted the powers of her body and alienated those of her mind we have before said that the lights in the clergymans house had probably attracted her attention and in the temporary confusion of a family never remarkable for its regularity she easily mounted the stairs and entered the sick chamber undiscovered and thus overheard hannah irwins confession a tale sufficient to have greatly aggravated her mental malady  illustration  we have no means of knowing whether she actually sought tyrrel or whether it was as in the former case the circumstance of a light still burning where all around was dark that attracted her but her next apparition was close by the side of her unfortunate lover then deeply engaged in writing when something suddenly gleamed on a large oldfashioned mirror which hung on the wall opposite he looked up and saw the figure of clara holding a light which she had taken from the passage in her extended hand he stood for an instant with his eyes fixed on this fearful shadow ere he dared turn round on the substance which was thus reflected when he did so the fixed and pallid countenance almost impressed him with the belief that he saw a vision and he shuddered when stooping beside him she took his hand come away she said in a hurried voicecome away my brother follows to kill us both come tyrrel let us flywe shall easily escape himhannah irwin is on beforebut if we are overtaken i will have no more fightingyou must promise me that we shall notwe have had but too much of thatbut you will be wise in future  clara mowbray exclaimed tyrrel alas is it thusstaydo not go for she turned to make her escapestaystaysit down  i must go she replied i must goi am calledhannah irwin is gone before to tell all and i must follow will you not let me gonay if you will hold me by force i know i must sit downbut you will not be able to keep me for all that  a convulsion fit followed and seemed by its violence to explain that she was indeed bound for the last and darksome journey the maid who at length answered tyrrels earnest and repeated summons fled terrified at the scene she witnessed and carried to the manse the alarm which we before mentioned  the old landlady was compelled to exchange one scene of sorrow for another wondering within herself what fatality could have marked this single night with so much misery when she arrived at home what was her astonishment to find there the daughter of the house which even in their alienation she had never ceased to love in a state little short of distraction and tended by tyrrel whose state of mind seemed scarce more composed than that of the unhappy patient the oddities of mrs dods were merely the rust which had accumulated upon her character but without impairing its native strength and energy and her sympathies were not of a kind acute enough to disable her from thinking and acting as decisively as circumstances required  mr tyrrel she said this is nae sight for men folkye maun rise and gang to another room  i will not stir from her said tyrreli will not remove from her either now or as long as she or i may live  that will be nae lang space maister tyrrel if ye winna be ruled by common sense  tyrrel started up as if half comprehending what she said but remained motionless  come come said the compassionate landlady do not stand looking on a sight sair enough to break a harder heart than yours hinnyyour ain sense tells ye ye canna stay heremiss clara shall be weel cared for and ill bring word to your roomdoor frae halfhour to halfhour how she is  the necessity of the case was undeniable and tyrrel suffered himself to be led to another apartment leaving miss mowbray to the care of the hostess and her female assistants he counted the hours in an agony less by the watch than by the visits which mrs dods faithful to her promise made from interval to interval to tell him that clara was not betterthat she was worseand at last that she did not think she could live over morning it required all the deprecatory influence of the good landlady to restrain tyrrel who calm and cold on common occasions was proportionally fierce and impetuous when his passions were afloat from bursting into the room and ascertaining with his own eyes the state of the beloved patient at length there was a long intervalan interval of hoursso long indeed that tyrrel caught from it the flattering hope that clara slept and that sleep might bring refreshment both to mind and body mrs dods he concluded was prevented from moving for fear of disturbing her patients slumber and as if actuated by the same feeling which he imputed to her he ceased to traverse his apartment as his agitation had hitherto dictated and throwing himself into a chair forbore to move even a finger and withheld his respiration as much as possible just as if he had been seated by the pillow of the patient morning was far advanced when his landlady appeared in his room with a grave and anxious countenance  mr tyrrel she said ye are a christian man  hush hush for heavens sake he replied you will disturb miss mowbray  naething will disturb her puir thing answered mrs dods they have muckle to answer for that brought her to this  they havethey have indeed said tyrrel striking his forehead and i will see her avenged on every one of themcan i see her  better notbetter not said the good woman but he burst from her and rushed into the apartment  is life goneis every spark extinct he exclaimed eagerly to a country surgeon a sensible man who had been summoned from marchthorn in the course of the night the medical man shook his headtyrrel rushed to the bedside and was convinced by his own eyes that the being whose sorrows he had both caused and shared was now insensible to all earthly calamity he raised almost a shriek of despair as he threw himself on the pale hand of the corpse wet it with tears devoured it with kisses and played for a short time the part of a distracted person at length on the repeated expostulation of all present he suffered himself to be again conducted to another apartment the surgeon following anxious to give such sad consolation as the case admitted of  as you are so deeply concerned for the untimely fate of this young lady he said it may be some satisfaction to you though a melancholy one to know that it has been occasioned by a pressure on the brain probably accompanied by a suffusion and i feel authorized in stating from the symptoms that if life had been spared reason would in all probability never have returned in such a case sir the most affectionate relation must own that death in comparison to life is a mercy  mercy answered tyrrel but why then is it denied to mei knowi knowmy life is spared till i revenge her  he started from his seat and hurried eagerly down stairs but as he was about to rush from the door of the inn he was stopped by touchwood who had just alighted from a carriage with an air of stern anxiety imprinted on his features very different from their usual expression whither would ye whither would ye he said laying hold of tyrrel and stopping him by force  for revengefor revenge said tyrrel give way i charge you on your peril  vengeance belongs to god replied the old man and his bolt has fallenthis waythis way he continued dragging tyrrel into the house know he said so soon as he had led or forced him into a chamber that mowbray of st ronans has met bulmer within this half hour and has killed him on the spot  killedwhom answered the bewildered tyrrel  valentine bulmer the titular earl of etherington  you bring tidings of death to the house of death answered tyrrel and there is nothing in this world left that i should live for     chapter xx  conclusion      here come we to our closefor that which follows     is but the tale of dull unvaried misery     steep crags and headlong linns may court the pencil     like sudden haps dark plots and strange adventures     but who would paint the dull and fogwrapt moor     in its long track of sterile desolation  old play   when mowbray crossed the brook as we have already detailed his mind was in that wayward and uncertain state which seeks something whereon to vent the selfengendered rage with which it labours like a volcano before eruption on a sudden a shot or two followed by loud voices and laughter reminded him he had promised at that hour and in that sequestered place to decide a bet respecting pistolshooting to which the titular lord etherington jekyl and captain macturk to whom such a pastime was peculiarly congenial were parties as well as himself the prospect this recollection afforded him of vengeance on the man whom he regarded as the author of his sisters wrongs was in the present state of his mind too tempting to be relinquished and setting spurs to his horse he rushed through the copse to the little glade where he found the other parties who despairing of his arrival had already begun their amusement a jubilee shout was set up as he approached  here comes mowbray dripping by cot like a wateringpan said captain macturk  i fear him not said etherington we may as well still call him so he has ridden too fast to have steady nerves  we shall soon see that my lord etherington or rather mr valentine bulmer said mowbray springing from his horse and throwing the bridle over the bough of a tree  what does this mean mr mowbray said etherington drawing himself up while jekyl and captain macturk looked at each other in surprise  it means sir that you are a rascal and impostor replied mowbray who have assumed a name to which you have no right  that mr mowbray is an insult i cannot carry farther than this spot said etherington  if you had been willing to do so you should have carried with it something still harder to be borne answered mowbray  enough enough my good sir no use in spurring a willing horsejekyl you will have the kindness to stand by me in this matter  certainly my lord said jekyl  and as there seems to be no chance of taking up the matter amicably said the pacific captain macturk i will be most happy so help me to assist my worthy friend mr mowbray of st ronans with my countenance and advicevery goot chance that we were here with the necessary weapons since it would have been an unpleasant thing to have such an affair long upon the stomach any more than to settle it without witnesses  i would fain know first said jekyl what all this sudden heat has arisen about  about nothing said etherington except a mares nest of mr mowbrays discovering he always knew his sister played the madwoman and he has now heard a report i suppose that she has likewise in her time played the  fool  o crimini cried captain macturk my good captain let us pe loading and measuring outfor by my soul if these sweetmeats be passing between them it is only the twa ends of a hankercher than can serve the turncot tamn  with such friendly intentions the ground was hastily meted out each was well known as an excellent shot and the captain offered a bet to jekyl of a mutchkin of glenlivat that both would fall by the first fire the event showed that he was nearly right for the ball of lord etherington grazed mowbrays temple at the very second of time when mowbrays pierced his heart he sprung a yard from the ground and fell down a dead man mowbray stood fixed like a pillar of stone his arm dropped to his side his hand still clenched on the weapon of death reeking at the touchhole and muzzle jekyl ran to raise and support his friend and captain macturk having adjusted his spectacles stooped on one knee to look him in the face we should have had dr quackleben here he said wiping his glasses and returning them to the shagreen case though it would have been only for forms sakefor he is as dead as a toornail poor boybut come mowbray my bairn he said taking him by the arm we must be ganging our ain gait you and me before waur comes of iti have a bit powney here and you have your horse till we get to marchthorncaptain jekyl i wish you a good morning will you have my umbrella back to the inn for i surmeese it is going to rain  mowbray had not ridden a hundred yards with his guide and companion when he drew his bridle and refused to proceed a step farther till he had learned what was become of clara the captain began to find he had a very untractable pupil to manage when while they were arguing together touchwood drove past in his hack chaise as soon as he recognised mowbray he stopped the carriage to inform him that his sister was at the aultoun which he had learned from finding there had been a messenger sent from thence to the well for medical assistance which could not be afforded the esculapius of the place dr quackleben having been privately married to mrs blower on that morning by mr chatterly and having set out on the usual nuptial tour  in return for this intelligence captain macturk communicated the fate of lord etherington the old man earnestly pressed instant flight for which he supplied at the same time ample means engaging to furnish every kind of assistance and support to the unfortunate young lady and representing to mowbray that if he staid in the vicinity a prison would soon separate them mowbray and his companion then departed southward upon the spur reached london in safety and from thence went together to the peninsula where the war was then at the hottest  there remains little more to be told mr touchwood is still alive forming plans which have no object and accumulating a fortune for which he has apparently no heir the old man had endeavoured to fix this character as well as his general patronage upon tyrrel but the attempt only determined the latter to leave the country nor has he been since heard of although the title and estates of etherington lie vacant for his acceptance it is the opinion of many that he has entered into a moravian mission for the use of which he had previously drawn considerable sums  since tyrrels departure no one pretends to guess what old touchwood will do with his money he often talks of his disappointments but can never be made to understand or at least to admit that they were in some measure precipitated by his own talent for intrigue and manoeuvring most people think that mowbray of st ronans will be at last his heir that gentleman has of late shown one quality which usually recommends men to the favour of rich relations namely a close and cautious care of what is already his own captain macturks military ardour having revived when they came within smell of gunpowder the old soldier contrived not only to get himself on full pay but to induce his companion to serve for some time as a volunteer he afterwards obtained a commission and nothing could be more strikingly different than was the conduct of the young laird of st ronans and of lieutenant mowbray the former as we know was gay venturous and prodigal the latter lived on his pay and even within itdenied himself comforts and often decencies when doing so could save a guinea and turned pale with apprehension if on any extraordinary occasion he ventured sixpence a corner at whist this meanness or closeness of disposition prevents his holding the high character to which his bravery and attention to his regimental duties might otherwise entitle him the same close and accurate calculation of pounds shillings and pence marked his communications with his agent meiklewham who might otherwise have had better pickings out of the estate of st ronans which is now at nurse and thriving full fast especially since some debts of rather an usurious character have been paid up by mr touchwood who contented himself with more moderate usage  on the subject of this property mr mowbray generally speaking gave such minute directions for acquiring and saving that his old acquaintance mr winterblossom tapping his morocco snuffbox with the sly look which intimated the coming of a good thing was wont to say that he had reversed the usual order of transformation and was turned into a grub after having been a butterfly after all this narrowness though a more ordinary modification of the spirit of avarice may be founded on the same desire of acquisition which in his earlier days sent him to the gamingtable  but there was one remarkable instance in which mr mowbray departed from the rules of economy by which he was guided in all others having acquired for a large sum of money the ground which he had formerly feued out for the erection of the hotel lodginghouses shops c at st ronans well he sent positive orders for the demolition of the whole nor would he permit the existence of any house of entertainment on his estate except that in the aultoun where mrs dods reigns with undisputed sway her temper by no means improved either by time or her arbitrary disposition by the total absence of competition  why mr mowbray with his acquired habits of frugality thus destroyed a property which might have produced a considerable income no one could pretend to affirm some said that he remembered his own early follies and others that he connected the buildings with the misfortunes of his sister the vulgar reported that lord etheringtons ghost had been seen in the ballroom and the learned talked of the association of ideas but it all ended in this that mr mowbray was independent enough to please himself and that such was mr mowbrays pleasure  the little wateringplace has returned to its primitive obscurity and lions and lionesses with their several jackals blue surtouts and bluer stockings fiddlers and dancers painters and amateurs authors and critics dispersed like pigeons by the demolition of a dovecot have sought other scenes of amusement and rehearsal and have deserted st ronans wellii12  footnote  ii12 note iiimeg dods     authors notes   note i p 202  there were several instances of this dexterity but especially those which occurred in the celebrated case of murdison and millar in 1773 these persons a sheepfarmer and his shepherd settled in the vale of tweed commenced and carried on for some time an extensive system of devastation on the flocks of their neighbours a dog belonging to millar was so well trained that he had only to show him during the day the parcel of sheep which he desired to have and when dismissed at night for the purpose yarrow went right to the pasture where the flock had fed and carried off the quantity shown him he then drove them before him by the most secret paths to murdisons farm where the dishonest master and servant were in readiness to receive the booty two things were remarkable in the first place that if the dog when thus dishonestly employed actually met his master he observed great caution in recognising him as if he had been afraid of bringing him under suspicion secondly that he showed a distinct sense that the illegal transactions in which he was engaged were not of a nature to endure daylight the sheep which he was directed to drive were often reluctant to leave their own pastures and sometimes the intervention of rivers or other obstacles made their progress peculiarly difficult on such occasions yarrow continued his efforts to drive his plunder forward until the day began to dawn a signal which he conceived rendered it necessary for him to desert his spoil and slink homeward by a circuitous road it is generally said this accomplished dog was hanged along with his master but the truth is he survived him long in the service of a man in leithen yet was said afterwards to have shown little of the wonderful instinct exhibited in the employment of millar  another instance of similar sagacity a friend of mine discovered in a beautiful little spaniel which he had purchased from a dealer in the canine race when he entered a shop he was not long in observing that his little companion made it a rule to follow at some interval and to estrange itself from his master so much as to appear totally unconnected with him and when he left the shop it was the dogs custom to remain behind him till it could find an opportunity of seizing a pair of gloves or silk stockings or some similar property which it brought to its master the poor fellow probably saved its life by falling into the hands of an honest man   note ii p 213  the author has made an attempt in this character to draw a picture of what is too often seen a wretched being whose heart becomes hardened and spited at the world in which she is doomed to experience much misery and little sympathy the system of compulsory charity by poors rates of which the absolute necessity can hardly be questioned has connected with it on both sides some of the most odious and malevolent feelings that can agitate humanity the quality of true charity is not strained like that of mercy of which in a large sense it may be accounted a sister virtue it blesses him that gives and him that takes it awakens kindly feelings both in the mind of the donor and in that of the relieved object the giver and receiver are recommended to each other by mutual feelings of goodwill and the pleasurable emotions connected with the consciousness of a good action fix the deed in recollection of the one while a sense of gratitude renders it holy to the other in the legal and compulsory assessment for the proclaimed parish pauper there is nothing of all this the alms are extorted from an unwilling hand and a heart which desires the annihilation rather than the relief of the distressed object the object of charity sensible of the illwill with which the pittance is bestowed seizes on it as his right not as a favour the manner of conferring it being directly calculated to hurt and disgust his feelings he revenges himself by becoming impudent and clamorous a more odious picture or more likely to deprave the feelings of those exposed to its influence can hardly be imagined and yet to such a point have we been brought by an artificial system of society that we must either deny altogether the right of the poor to their just proportion of the fruits of the earth or afford them some means of subsistence out of them by the institution of positive law   note iii p 318  non omnis moriar saint ronans since this veracious history was given to the public has revived

that of hannah irwins confession to josiah cargill  oh most unhappy woman he said what does your introduction prepare me to expect  your expectation be it ever so ominous shall be fully satisfied that bulmer when he told you that a secret marriage was necessary to miss mowbrays honour thought that he was imposing on youbut he told you a fatal truth so far as concerned clara she had indeed fallen but bulmer was not her seducerknew nothing of the truth of what he so strongly asseverated  he was not her lover thenand how came he then to press to marry heror how came you  hear mebut question notbulmer had gained the advantage over me which he pretended to have had over clara from that moment my companions virtue became at once the object of my envy and hatred yet so innocent were the lovers that despite of the various arts which i used to entrap them they remained guiltless until the fatal evening when clara met tyrrel for the last time ere he removed from the neighbourhoodand then the devil and hannah irwin triumphed much there was of remorsemuch of resolutions of separation until the church should unite thembut these only forwarded my machinationsfor i was determined she should wed bulmer not tyrrel  wretch exclaimed the clergyman and had you not then done enough why did you expose the paramour of one brother to become the wife of another  she paused and answered sullenly i had my reasonsbulmer had treated me with scorn he told me plainly that he used me but as a steppingstone to his own purposes and that these finally centred in wedding clara i was resolved he should wed her and take with her infamy and misery to his bed  this is too horrible said cargill endeavouring with a trembling hand to make minutes of her confession  ay said the sick woman but i contended with a master of the game who played me stratagem for stratagem if i destined for him a dishonoured wife he contrived by his agent solmes to match me with a husband imposed on me by his
