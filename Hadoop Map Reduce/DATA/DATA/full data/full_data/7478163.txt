7478163	the butterflys ball and the grasshoppers feast by rm ballantyne    this one of the halfdozen or so little books that ballantyne wrote for young children  many of these and certainly the earlier ones were written under the pseudonym of comus but this one went out under his own name perhaps because by the time it was published in 1874 his own name had become much more celebrated than that of his pseudonym  it was written for very young children and very amusing they must have found it with its characters being the little insects and small mammals of the fields and woods who assemble together for a feast  naturally they must have become vegetarian for the day anyway they put away their warring instincts and had a good time together though one or two incidents caused by the over exuberant during the dancing threatened to cause serious mishaps though all were avoided  its a tiny book perhaps a twentieth of the size of one of ballantynes novels for older children but it is certainly fun    the butterflys ball and the grasshoppers feast by rm ballantyne the butterflys ballby rm ballantyne    chapter one  the butterflys ball and the grasshoppers feast    come take

butterflys ballby rm ballantyne    chapter two  the butterflys ball and the grasshoppers feast    come take up your hats and away let us haste   to the butterflys ball and the grasshoppers feast   for the trumpeter gadfly has summoned his crew   and the revels are now only waiting for you    on the smoothshaven grass by the side of the wood   beneath a broad oak that for ages has stood   see the children of earth and the tenants of air   for an evenings amusement together repair  it was very early one delightful morning in summer when the trumpeter gadfly sounded his horn inviting all the insects in the forest to the butterflys ball and the grasshoppers feast  the sun shone brightly the air was mild and soft and the scent of the wild flowers delicious so that not one of the insects thought of staying at home  butterflies beetles bees wasps snails grasshoppers ants all put on their best coats and frocks all put on their sweetest smiles and all hurried off in little bands to the ball talking and laughing and humming and buzzing by the way as if they were the happiest creatures in the wide world  even the old beetle that had been run over by a cartwheel and squeezed nearly to death got out of bed when he heard what was going on and limped along with the rest though he had been confined to the house for six months before  one or two butterflies that were never known to go out except in the very finest weatherand even then carefully wrapped updetermined to venture  they were long in making up their minds about it  one thought it looked a very little like rain another feared that the light breeze might give them a cold  however they put on a great many cloaks and went  from all directions they came and assembled on a smooth grassy spot under an old oaktree where the revels were to take place  some crawled slowly along the ground some bounded quickly over hill and dale some came running and tumbling jumping and hitting against things in their haste some came swiftly through the air and alighted so suddenly as to tumble head over heels others flew quietly to the scene and fluttered lightly about admiring the gay company they were about to join    and there came the beetle so blind and so black   who carried the emmet his friend on his back   and there came the gnat and the dragonfly too   and all their relations green orange and blue  the black beetle was the first to make his appearance  he carried his dear friend the emmet on his back and a sad journey they had of it to be sure  being very blind the beetle was constantly falling over twigs knocking his shins against the edges of leaves and tumbling into ditches so that the poor emmet had many terrible falls and once the great beetle fell on the top of him and crushed him a good deal  but it was very pleasant to see how cheerful they were under all this  on getting up after a fall the beetle always laughed so boisterously that the tears ran down his cheeks and his black sides nearly cracked while the little emmet said gaily ah my friend accidents will happen not hurt i hope  come get along once more and then he jumped up on his friends back again and away they went as merrily as ever  a gnat and a dragonfly with a great many of their relations arrived about the same time with the beetle  they looked quite charming in their brilliant dresses the colours of which were chiefly green orange and blue  a large bluebottle fly with a very light waistcoat and a hat stuck on one side of his head said that the dragonflies were lovely and that miss gnat was quite killing  this was an odd thing to say but mr bluebottle meant by it that she was very beautiful indeed it was said that he fell in love with miss gnat for he danced with nobody else during the whole afternoon      and there came the moth with her plumage of down   and the hornet with jacket of yellow and brown   who with him the wasp his companion did bring   they promised that evening to lay by their sting  the moth was sound asleep when the gadfly blew his trumpet  she had sat up too late the night before and owing to having indulged this bad habit had overslept herself the following morning  however she tried by her activity to make up for lost time she saw the other insects hurrying past her house in crowds so she threw on her clothes as fast as possible  the moth was prettily dressed in a soft garment of down and as she was a modest creature every one loved her on leaving home she observed the wasp and the hornet passing  they were dressed in rich suits of brown and yellow  at sight of them she was a little frightened and endeavoured to run back to her house until they should pass by but they caught sight of her and immediately gave chase screaming out loudly oh dear mrs moth pray dont be alarmed we have laid by our stings for today and wont hurt you  they soon caught her although she ran as fast as she could  so the wasp and the hornet each offered her an arm and obliged her to walk between them while they danced along shouting and singing and winking waggishly to the friends they passed on the road  the poor moth blushed very much at being seen by all her friends in the company of two such wild creatures a caterpillar and a longlegged beetle besides one or two other insects that chanced to be near laughed very heartily on seeing what had happened  but the moth soon recovered her spirits and when they arrived at the oaktree she was walking along with a sprightly step first talking to the hornet and then chatting to the wasp as if they were her dearest friends      then the sly little dormouse peeped out of his hole   and led to the feast his blind cousin the mole   and the snail with her horns peeping out from her shell   came fatigued with the distance the length of an ell  come along you lazy fellow cried the little dormouse knocking with his ivoryheaded cane at the door of a molehill  ay ay cousin shouted the mole ill be there in a minute  so the dormouse stood impatiently tapping his boots till the mole should be ready  the dormouse was dressed in the height of fashion and thought himself a rather handsome fellow  some people said that he was conceited and indeed a spider that was near at hand plainly told him so but whether this was true or not there is no doubt that he was a very kind little fellow because he came to lead his poor blind cousin to the feast  what a time you have been old boy he said as the mole appeared dusting the earth off his coat and white hat  the mole answered that he had been very busy all morning making a new tunnel between his bedroom and drawingroom  he then took his friends arm and away they went over the green meadows where the cowslips and buttercups grew making the grass look as if it were dotted all over with gold  sometimes the two friends stopped by the way to rest under a buttercup and sip a little morning dew but seeing every one hastening past them while they wasted their time the dormouse jumped up again and cast a sly look at his blind friend as he asked him what he thought of the fine view  dont make jokes about my being blind said the mole pretending to be angry  just at that moment they both ran into a spiders web  oh how stupid of me cried the dormouse i wasnt looking before me at the time  you might as well be without eyes if you dont use them said the mole as they cleared away the threads of the net and making a low bow to the spider went on their way  now all this time the snail had been slowly creeping over the stones and winding round the blades of grass and flowers that strewed her path to the place of meeting  but she was so long of getting there that the guests began to be impatient and said that perhaps she was not coming at all  she lived under the next tree and had only about four feet to walk but she was so very slow that she took a long long time to it and at last the grasshopper whispered to the butterfly that she should go and meet her  away went the butterfly on her gaudy wings and alighting by the snails side began to urge her to make haste  during the butterflys absence the wasp who was always making spiteful remarks said that it was shameful in the snail to keep them waiting but the humblebee who was walking up and down conversing with a midge turned round and said remember you wasp that you have not brought your sting with you today so pray do not give way to your spiteful nature  the poor snail has to carry her house on her back so we should not be angry at her slowness  some of the other insects said that this was no excuse for the snail because she knew that she walked very slowly and should therefore have set out sooner  come come cried a young frog jumping forward no fighting today ladies and gentlemen  we have come here to be happy and here comes the snail at last  as he spoke the butterfly flew towards them and the snail crawled in took off her bonnet put on her spectacles and sat down while the waiters bustled about placed stools for the guests and brought in the repast      a mushroom the table and on it was spread   a waterdock leaf which their tablecloth made   the viands were various to each of their taste   and the bee brought the honey to sweeten the feast  it was perhaps the strangest dinnerparty that ever was seen  there were such a multitude of odd creatures of all shapes and sizes and colours some of whom were by nature bitter enemies and would have fought and killed each other had they met in the woods while taking a walk but were quite civil and polite to one another now that they met as guests in mrs butterflys bower  indeed many of them wished that they could be such good friends at all times as they were then  all the party had now arrived and there was a great deal of talking and buzzing and humming and jesting as they sat round the table and feasted on the good things placed before them  the table was a mushroom covered with a tablecloth of waterdock leaf and on it were placed all the delicious dishes of the woods  the dormouse brought a good deal of wheat oats and barley  the squirrel brought a bagful of nuts  the humblebee brought a quantity of fine honey in the comb which was declared to be most excellent  in short every one brought something or other so that when all was spread out beside the good things supplied by mrs butterfly and mr grasshopper it seemed the grandest feast that ever was heard of  such fun there was to be sure and such a multitude of voices talking all at once  my dear cried the butterfly across the table to the grasshopper i hope you are attending to your friends there  see that you give them enough to eat and plenty of mountaindew to drink  yes yes my love replied the grasshopper as well as he could for laughing at the jokes of a bloated old spider that sat beside him  then the grasshopper called to the butterfly to send him a slice of wheat but as the noise prevented his being heard he jumped over the table at one bound helped himself and bounded back again  two or three young crickets and five or six midges sat at a little side mushroom  they made more noise than all the grownup people put together and the lady butterfly looked round at them with a smile once or twice quite delighted to see them so happy and to hear their merry voices ringing through the woods      with steps more majestic the snail did advance   and he promised the gazers a minuet dance   but they all laughed so loudly he pulled in his head   and went in his own little chamber to bed  after dinner the ball began and it was the strangest ball that ever was seen  the trumpeter gadfly and a number of his relations besides several grasshoppers and bees were the chief musicians  they wanted a bass very much at first but the bullfrog offered his services although he confessed that he was accustomed to sing alone  then the gentlemen drew on their gloves flattened their wings pulled up their collars and coiled away their tails while the ladies tightened their garters ruffled their feathers and put out their feelers  oh how they did dance reels were nothing to it  the greatest difficulty was to keep the grasshoppers in order  they became so excited that they sprang quite out of sight every moment and so lost their partners and ran against everybody in searching for them  then the bullfrog who sang bass got a little too much of the dew and sang so loudly that he quite drowned all the other players  so mrs butterfly put her claws in her ears and running up to him said oh dear mr bullfrog pray do not sing quite so loudly  the poor bullfrog was almost weeping with joy at the merry scene before him but he blushed very green on hearing this and said he had forgotten what he was doing but would try to be more careful  however in five minutes more he was worse than ever so they sent a few hundred bees to sing treble beside him and try to keep him in order  in the middle of all this there was a sudden stop and a snail stepping forward offered to dance a minuet  this was received with such a roar of laughter that the poor snail half frightened half angry drew in his horns and went to bed on the spot and the dance was begun anew  by this time the gnats and midges and some of the other flies had left the ground and retired to enjoy a cool dance in the air two or three spiders mounted up into the oak and fastened threads to some of the branches by which they dropped suddenly down among the dancers and seizing their partners round the waist carried them screaming in among the leaves  so the fun and the noise became louder and louder  on the ground under the bushes among the branches of the trees and in the air the dancers bounded skipped laughed sang shouted and flew in a way that had never been seen or heard of before the merry old bullfrog became quite absurd  he sang and roared like a lion took up all the young insects in his arms and hugged them tumbled over the other musicians and in short did so many wild things that they were at length obliged to tie him to a paddockstool where they left him to enjoy himself      then as evening gave way to the shadows of night   their watchman the glowworm came out with his light   so home let us hasten while yet we can see   for no watchman is waiting for you or for me  the sun went down at last but still the dancers continued their sport under the old oaktree when suddenly a clear beautiful light streamed across the turf  it was the glowworms light  how charming exclaimed the butterfly  it is such a sweet subdued light  rather too much subdued growled the blundering black beetle as he tripped over a twig and pulled his partner a humblebee down with him couldnt you shine a little brightereh  the glowworm shook his head  couldnt give you another ray to save my life he said but if you send for a few of my friends they will be happy to come and help me no doubt  a good suggestion said the black beetle assisting his partner to rise  oh my poor frock cried the humblebee gazing sadly at a long rent in the skirt  never mind lets have at it again cried the beetle seizing her round the waist and blundering on again in a furious gallop of his own invention  whom shall i send for the glowworms relations muttered the butterfly to herself  send the snail said a lively young cricket who had devoted himself to doing mischief during the whole evening  peace little goose replied the butterfly tapping the cricket on the nose with her fan and hastening towards the grasshopper who was still enthralled and convulsed by the bloated old spider  whom should we send my dear said the grasshopper in reply to the butterflys question the fly footman to be sure and pray tell him to be smart about it for ive been run down halfadozen times already by the dancers since the sun set  one lamp is too little for our ballroom  that blind mole has runha there he comes again  look out  as he spoke the mole came bearing down towards them in a furious portuguese waltz with a horrified dragonfly struggling in his arms  the grasshopper made a bound to get out of the way but at that moment the lively young cricket laid hold of his leg and held him fast  the consequence was that the mole tumbled over him fell on the top of the bloated spider and hit his head so violently on the breast of the bullfrog that he stopped his noise immediately  this sudden stoppage of the bass brought the other musicians to a stand and as a matter of course stopped the dancing abruptlywith the exception of a deaf squirrel who had failed to find a partner and who went on revolving slowly by himself as if nothing had happened  dear me exclaimed everybody except the squirrel what has happened  oh nothing worth mentioning said the grasshopper getting up with a limp  you young rascal whatwhythere take that  oh sobbed the young cricket pointing with a look of surprise at the spider what a sight  he might well say so for the bloated old spider had been flattened out by the weight of the mole to nearly twice her size and was apparently quite dead  in great concern the host and hostess ran to raise her  are you hurt dear asked the butterfly anxiously  hurt exclaimed the grasshopper pushing her aside dont you see shes burst  oh me  im so sorry exclaimed the mole wringing his forepaws  at that moment there was a shout of eager expectation for the spider was seen to move  the butterfly knelt at her side and bending down said tenderly  tell me dear has he burst you  nno nnotququite answered the spider faintly im only fflattened  let some of you sqsqueeze mmy sides  immediately a dozen of the young crickets surrounded the old lady and pressed her sides with all their might  this had the effect of raising her back a little and enabling her to draw a good long breath which speedily raised her up to her original size  there im all right now she said in a cheerful voice im used to accidents of that sort and they never leave any bad effects beyond a little stiffness of the lungs  come grasshopper ill finish that story  get on with your dancing good people  nobody inquires after me croaked the bullfrog rubbing his chest i had no idea a moles head was so hard  have some mountaindew said the butterfly gracefully handing him a bluebell filled with the precious liquid  it has been gathered on the scottish hills by a native bee who has just arrived laden with heatherhoney  the bullfrog accepted the goblet and drained it to the bottom  it is strong he said coughing and smacking his lips  oo ay observed the scotch bee its got the credit o bein a wee thing nippy  under the influence of the dew the bullfrog began to sing bass lustily the other musicians chimed in  the dancers seized each other by waist and handor by tail and wing those that happened to have no waists or handsand the ball was about to go on when the grasshopper shouted  stop  your money or your life added the lively young cricket  silence pert monkeylet us wait a few moments my friends for here come our lamps  as she spoke a soft light was seen in the far distance gleaming upon the stems of the trees and steadily advancing  your relations mr glowworm i presume said the butterfly in a sweet silvery voice  it is so very kind of you to send for them and so obliging in them to come  really i cannot find words to express my gratitude  the countenance of the glowworm lighted up with pleasure at these words  as the newcomers drew near they appeared like a great galaxy of minute starsas if a mass of the milkyway had been cut off and hurled down to earth  there were several hundreds of them  as they approached the whole forest lighted up and when at last they descended upon the scene of the ball and ranged themselves in a circle round the gay party it seemed as if the sun himself had risen again to give them lightonly the radiance was softer and more mysteriously tender than that of the sun  strong light has always an enlivening effect on creatures whether human or otherwise  it cheered up the guests of mrs butterfly so much that they gave vent to an irresistible cheer called for the music and went on to dancing with more zest and energy than ever insomuch that the attendant glowworms smiled to each other and nodded their heads  now it happened that every time the glowworms smiled their light increased  the lively young cricket observed this and began to wonder whether their light would increase still more if they were to laugh  ill try to find out said he going up to a small glowworm apparently a young oneand requesting her to step aside with him for a moment  the little glowworm immediately became gravein other words dimand went with him a little way into the woods  now said the lively young cricket stopping can you laugh  what said the little glowworm smiling and of course lighting up  yes thats it smile away but do it harder  i want you to laugh outright  cant you laugh  oh yes when there is anything to laugh at  well do it now  but i cant please  no then ill make you  so saying the young cricket seized the little glowworm round the waist and tickled her  of course she laughed at first and to the crickets delight her face became wonderfully bright for a moment but suddenly it became dim for he hurt her and she began to cry  you rascal exclaimed an angry voice as the grasshopper gave the cricket a kick that sent him head over heels into the grass i felt sure you were after mischief and i was right  oh please dont kick him pleaded the little glowworm  he didnt mean to hurt me  no matter  get up sir and beg her pardon  the young cricket got up at once and did what he was bid for he really did not mean mischief and was sorry he had hurt her and little miss glowworm rewarded him with a smile so radiant that it illuminated the spot where they stood quite brilliantly and sparkled through her tears with rainbow hues  now i would laugh to please you if i could said miss glowworm again smiling  oh never mind my dear  ill make you and all your kindred laugh before the ball is over said the lively young cricket hurrying away and going straight up to the scotch bee who was clad in a tartan plaid and kilt  bee said the cricket can you dance the highland fling  ay she can do that  i could show you a better fling than the highland one said the cricket  ho could ye ye must be verra cliver  wull ye let her seet  yes if youll dance the highland fling first  will you do it if mrs butterfly asks you  the scotch bee goodnaturedly agreed  of course the cricket had no difficulty in persuading the hostess to ask him  the musicians could not play a reel but this mattered not for the bee could hum to himself  great was the delight and surprise of the company when they beheld the scotch bee twirling his legs snapping his fingers and humming the reel of tulloch while the tartans fluttered round him like shreds of a shattered rainbow  the dance waxed more and more furious and the plaudits of the company grew louder when suddenly the lively young cricket ran in between the bees legs tripped him up and sent him sprawling on the grass  a wild shout of laughter burst from the companyglowworms includedand the ballroom brightened up for a few moments as if it had been set on fire  thats the fling i spoke of cried the cricket leaping up and running away  the scotch bee sprang up drew his dirk and gave chase but mr grasshopper caught him by the arm and dragged him off  ho friendssuppersupper  this way  dont sheathe your dirk  i have a haggis ready for you to sheathe it in  come along give your arm to that bloated old spider there  shell keep you in spirits  the bee was mollified  he gave his arm to the spider then all the company went off to sup in a neighbouring glade  shall we describe the supper  we think not  it was beyond description delightful  just as it was finished the moon rose from behind a cloud so the company knew that it was time to go home  before going away they all assembled at the foot of the oak and shook claws with lady butterfly and mr grasshopper saying that they were charmed with the delightful evening they had spent and that they hoped to be soon invited again  in a few minutes they were all gone  the sounds of their laughing voices as they returned home died gradually away and the shadows of night spread over the quiet forest and the happy little creatures that slumbered there
