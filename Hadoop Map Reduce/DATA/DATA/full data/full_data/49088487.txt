49088487	a christmas sermon  by  robert louis stevenson  new york  1900        a christmas sermon   by the time this paper appears i shall have been talking for twelve months1 and it is thought i should take my leave in a formal and seasonable manner valedictory eloquence is rare and deathbed sayings have not often hit the mark of the occasion charles second wit and sceptic a man whose life had been one long lesson in human incredulity an easygoing comrade a manoeuvring kingremembered and embodied all his wit and scepticism along with more than his usual good humour in the famous i am afraid gentlemen i am an unconscionable time adying  footnote 1 ie in the pages of scribners magazine 1888     i   an unconscionable time adyingthere is the picture i am afraid gentlemen of your life and of mine the sands run out and the hours are numbered and imputed and the days go by and when the last of these finds us we have been a long time dying and what else the very length is something if we reach that hour of separation undishonoured and to have lived at all is doubtless in the soldierly expression to have served there is a tale in tacitus of how the veterans mutinied in the german wilderness of how they mobbed germanicus clamouring to go home and of how seizing their generals hand these old warworn exiles passed his finger along their toothless gums sunt lacrymae rerum this was the most eloquent of the songs of simeon and when a man has lived to a fair age he bears his marks of service he may have never been remarked upon the breach at the head of the army at least he shall have lost his teeth on the camp bread  the idealism of serious people in this age of ours is of a noble character it never seems to them that they have served enough they have a fine impatience of their virtues it were perhaps more modest to be singly thankful that we are no worse it is not only our enemies those desperate charactersit is we ourselves who know not what we dothence springs the glimmering hope that perhaps we do better than we think that to scramble through this random business with hands reasonably clean to have played the part of a man or woman with some reasonable fulness to have often resisted the diabolic and at the end to be still resisting it is for the poor human soldier to have done right well to ask to see some fruit of our endeavour is but a transcendental way of serving for reward and what we take to be contempt of self is only greed of hire  and again if we require so much of ourselves shall we not require much of others if we do not genially judge our own deficiencies is it not to be feared we shall be even stern to the trespasses of others and he who looking back upon his own life can see no more than that he has been unconscionably long adying will he not be tempted to think his neighbour unconscionably long of getting hanged it is probable that nearly all who think of conduct at all think of it too much it is certain we all think too much of sin we are not damned for doing wrong but for not doing right christ would never hear of negative morality thou shalt was ever his word with which he superseded thou shalt not to make our idea of morality centre on forbidden acts is to defile the imagination and to introduce into our judgments of our fellowmen a secret element of gusto if a thing is wrong for us we should not dwell upon the thought of it or we shall soon dwell upon it with inverted pleasure if we cannot drive it from our mindsone thing of two either our creed is in the wrong and we must more indulgently remodel it or else if our morality be in the right we are criminal lunatics and should place our persons in restraint a mark of such unwholesomely divided minds is the passion for interference with others the fox without the tail was of this breed but had if his biographer is to be trusted a certain antique civility now out of date a man may have a flaw a weakness that unfits him for the duties of life that spoils his temper that threatens his integrity or that betrays him into cruelty it has to be conquered but it must never be suffered to engross his thoughts the true duties lie all upon the farther side and must be attended to with a whole mind so soon as this preliminary clearing of the decks has been effected in order that he may be kind and honest it may be needful he should become a total abstainer let him become so then and the next day let him forget the circumstance trying to be kind and honest will require all his thoughts a mortified appetite is never a wise companion in so far as he has had to mortify an appetite he will still be the worse man and of such an one a great deal of cheerfulness will be required in judging life and a great deal of humility in judging others  it may be argued again that dissatisfaction with our lifes endeavour springs in some degree from dulness we require higher tasks because we do not recognise the height of those we have trying to be kind and honest seems an affair too simple and too inconsequential for gentlemen of our heroic mould we had rather set ourselves to something bold arduous and conclusive we had rather found a schism or suppress a heresy cut off a hand or mortify an appetite but the task before us which is to coendure with our existence is rather one of microscopic fineness and the heroism required is that of patience there is no cutting of the gordian knots of life each must be smilingly unravelled  to be honest to be kindto earn a little and to spend a little less to make upon the whole a family happier for his presence to renounce when that shall be necessary and not be embittered to keep a few friends but these without capitulationabove all on the same grim condition to keep friends with himselfhere is a task for all that a man has of fortitude and delicacy he has an ambitious soul who would ask more he has a hopeful spirit who should look in such an enterprise to be successful there is indeed one element in human destiny that not blindness itself can controvert whatever else we are intended to do we are not intended to succeed failure is the fate allotted it is so in every art and study it is so above all in the continent art of living well here is a pleasant thought for the years end or for the end of life only selfdeception will be satisfied and there need be no despair for the despairer     ii   but christmas is not only the milemark of another year moving us to thoughts of selfexamination it is a season from all its associations whether domestic or religious suggesting thoughts of joy a man dissatisfied with his endeavours is a man tempted to sadness and in the midst of the winter when his life runs lowest and he is reminded of the empty chairs of his beloved it is well he should be condemned to this fashion of the smiling face noble disappointment noble selfdenial are not to be admired not even to be pardoned if they bring bitterness it is one thing to enter the kingdom of heaven maim another to maim yourself and stay without and the kingdom of heaven is of the childlike of those who are easy to please who love and who give pleasure mighty men of their hands the smiters and the builders and the judges have lived long and done sternly and yet preserved this lovely character and among our carpet interests and twopenny concerns the shame were indelible if we should lose it gentleness and cheerfulness these come before all morality they are the perfect duties and it is the trouble with moral men that they have neither one nor other it was the moral man the pharisee whom christ could not away with if your morals make you dreary depend upon it they are wrong i do not say give them up for they may be all you have but conceal them like a vice lest they should spoil the lives of better and simpler people  a strange temptation attends upon man to keep his eye on pleasures even when he will not share in them to aim all his morals against them this very year a lady singular iconoclast proclaimed a crusade against dolls and the racy sermon against lust is a feature of the age i venture to call such moralists insincere at any excess or perversion of a natural appetite their lyre sounds of itself with relishing denunciations but for all displays of the truly diabolicenvy malice the mean lie the mean silence the calumnious truth the backbiter the petty tyrant the peevish poisoner of family lifetheir standard is quite different these are wrong they will admit yet somehow not so wrong there is no zeal in their assault on them no secret element of gusto warms up the sermon it is for things not wrong in themselves that they reserve the choicest of their indignation a man may naturally disclaim all moral kinship with the reverend mr zola or the hobgoblin old lady of the dolls for these are gross and naked instances and yet in each of us some similar element resides the sight of a pleasure in which we cannot or else will not share moves us to a particular impatience it may be because we are envious or because we are sad or because we dislike noise and rompingbeing so refined or becausebeing so philosophicwe have an overweighing sense of lifes gravity at least as we go on in years we are all tempted to frown upon our neighbours pleasures people are nowadays so fond of resisting temptations here is one to be resisted they are fond of selfdenial here is a propensity that cannot be too peremptorily denied there is an idea abroad among moral people that they should make their neighbours good one person i have to make good myself but my duty to my neighbour is much more nearly expressed by saying that i have to make him happyif i may     iii   happiness and goodness according to canting moralists stand in the relation of effect and cause there was never anything less proved or less probable our happiness is never in our own hands we inherit our constitution we stand buffet among friends and enemies we may be so built as to feel a sneer or an aspersion with unusual keenness and so circumstanced as to be unusually exposed to them we may have nerves very sensitive to pain and be afflicted with a disease very painful virtue will not help us and it is not meant to help us it is not even its own reward except for the selfcentred andi had almost saidthe unamiable no man can pacify his conscience if quiet be what he want he shall do better to let that organ perish from disuse and to avoid the penalties of the law and the minor capitis diminutio of social ostracism is an affair of wisdomof cunning if you willand not of virtue  in his own life then a man is not to expect happiness only to profit by it gladly when it shall arise he is on duty here he knows not how or why and does not need to know he knows not for what hire and must not ask somehow or other though he does not know what goodness is he must try to be good somehow or other though he cannot tell what will do it he must try to give happiness to others and no doubt there comes in here a frequent clash of duties how far is he to make his neighbour happy how far must he respect that smiling face so easy to cloud so hard to brighten again and how far on the other side is he bound to be his brothers keeper and the prophet of his own morality how far must he resent evil  the difficulty is that we have little guidance christs sayings on the point being hard to reconcile with each other and the most of them hard to accept but the truth of his teaching would seem to be this in our own person and fortune we should be ready to accept and to pardon all it is our cheek we are to turn r coat that we are to give away to the man who has taken our cloak but when anothers face is buffeted perhaps a little of the lion will become us best that we are to suffer others to be injured and stand by is not conceivable and surely not desirable revenge says bacon is a kind of wild justice its judgments at least are delivered by an insane judge and in our own quarrel we can see nothing truly and do nothing wisely but in the quarrel of our neighbour let us be more bold one persons happiness is as sacred as anothers when we cannot defend both let us defend one with a stout heart it is only in so far as we are doing this that we have any right to interfere the defence of b is our only ground of action against a a has as good a right to go to the devil as we to go to glory and neither knows what he does  the truth is that all these interventions and denunciations and militant mongerings of moral halftruths though they be sometimes needful though they are often enjoyable do yet belong to an inferior grade of duties illtemper and envy and revenge find here an arsenal of pious disguises this is the playground of inverted lusts with a little more patience and a little less temper a gentler and wiser method might be found in almost every case and the knot that we cut by some fine heady quarrelscene in private life or in public affairs by some denunciatory act against what we are pleased to call our neighbours vices might yet have been unwoven by the hand of sympathy     iv   to look back upon the past year and see how little we have striven and to what small purpose and how often we have been cowardly and hung back or temerarious and rushed unwisely in and how every day and all day long we have transgressed the law of kindnessit may seem a paradox but in the bitterness of these discoveries a certain consolation resides life is not designed to minister to a mans vanity he goes upon his long business most of the time with a hanging head and all the time like a blind child full of rewards and pleasures as it isso that to see the day break or the moon rise or to meet a friend or to hear the dinnercall when he is hungry fills him with surprising joysthis world is yet for him no abiding city friendships fall through health fails weariness assails him year after year he must thumb the hardly varying record of his own weakness and folly it is a friendly process of detachment when the time comes that he should go there need be few illusions left about himself here lies one who meant well tried a little failed muchsurely that may be his epitaph of which he need not be ashamed nor will he complain at the summons which calls a defeated soldier from the field defeated ay if he were paul or marcus aureliusbut if there is still one inch of fight in his old spirit undishonoured the faith which sustained him in his lifelong blindness and lifelong disappointment will scarce even be required in this last formality of laying down his arms give him a march with his old bones there out of the glorious suncoloured earth out of the day and the dust and the ecstasythere goes another faithful failure  from a recent book of verse where there is more than one such beautiful and manly poem i take this memorial piece it says better than i can what i love to think let it be our parting word      a late lark twitters from the quiet skies     and from the west     where the sun his days work ended     lingers as in content     there falls on the old gray city     an influence luminous and serene     a shining peace      the smoke ascends     in a rosyandgolden haze the spires     shine and are changed in the valley     shadows rise the lark sings on the sun     closing his benediction     sinks and the darkening air     thrills with a sense of the triumphing night     night with her train of stars     and her great gift of sleep      so be my passing     my task accomplished and the long day done     my wages taken and in my heart     some late lark singing     let me be gathered to the quiet west     the sundown splendid and serene     death2  1888  footnote
