97178014	the bridgebuilders   by rudyard kipling     the least that findlayson of the public works department expected was a cie he dreamed of a csi indeed his friends told him that he deserved more for three years he had endured heat and cold disappointment discomfort danger and disease with responsibility almost to topheavy for one pair of shoulders and day by day through that time the great kashi bridge over the ganges had grown under his charge now in less than three months if all went well his excellency the viceroy would open the bridge in state an archbishop would bless it and the first trainload of soldiers would come over it and there would be speeches  findlayson c e sat in his trolley on a construction line that ran along one of the main revetmentsthe huge stonefaced banks that flared away north and south for three miles on either side of the river and permitted himself to think of the end with its approaches his work was one mile and threequarters in length a latticegirder bridge trussed with the findlayson truss standing on sevenandtwenty brick piers each one of those piers was twentyfour feet in diameter capped with red agra stone and sunk eighty feet below the shifting sand of the ganges bed above them was a railwayline fifteen feet broad above that again a cartroad of eighteen feet flanked with footpaths at either end rose towers of red brick loopholed for musketry and pierced for big guns and the ramp of the road was being pushed forward to their haunches the raw earthends were crawling and alive with hundreds upon hundreds of tiny asses climbing out of the yawning borrowpit below with sackfuls of stuff and the hot afternoon air was filled with the noise of hooves the rattle of the drivers sticks and the swish and rolldown of the dirt the river was very low and on the dazzling white sand between the three centre piers stood squat cribs of railwaysleepers filled within and daubed without with mud to support the last of the girders as those were riveted up in the little deep water left by the drought an overhead crane travelled to and fro along its spilepier jerking sections of iron into place snorting and backing and grunting as an elephant grunts in the timberyard riveters by the hundred swarmed about the lattice sidework and the iron roof of the railway line hung from invisible staging under the bellies of the girders clustered round the throats of the piers and rode on the overhang of the footpathstanchions their firepots and the spurts of flame that answered each hammerstroke showing no more than pale yellow in the suns glare east and west and north and south the constructiontrains rattled and shrieked up and down the embankments the piled trucks of brown and white stone banging behind them till the sideboards were unpinned and with a roar and a grumble a few thousand tons more material were flung out to hold the river in place  findlayson c e turned on his trolley and looked over the face of the country that he had changed for seven miles around looked back on the humming village of five thousand workmen up stream and down along the vista of spurs and sand across the river to the far piers lessening in the haze overhead to the guardtowersand only he knew how strong those wereand with a sigh of contentment saw that his work was good there stood his bridge before him in the sunlight lacking only a few weeks work on the girders of the three middle piershis bridge raw and ugly as original sin but pukkapermanentto endure when all memory of the builder yea even of the splendid findlayson truss has perished practically the thing was done  hitchcock his assistant cantered along the line on a little switchtailed kabuli pony who through long practice could have trotted securely over trestle and nodded to his chief  all but said he with a smile  ive been thinking about it the senior answered not half a bad job for two men is it  oneand a half gad what a coopers hill cub i was when i came on the works hitchcock felt very old in the crowded experiences of the past three years that had taught him power and responsibility  you were rather a colt said findlayson i wonder how youll like going back to officework when this jobs over  i shall hate it said the young man and as he went on his eye followed findlaysons and he muttered isnt it damned good  i think well go up the service together findlayson said to himself youre too good a youngster to waste on another man cub thou wast assistant thou art personal assistant and at simla thou shalt be if any credit comes to me out of the business  indeed the burden of the work had fallen altogether on findlayson and his assistant the young man whom he had chosen because of his rawness to break to his own needs there were labour contractors by the halfhundredfitters and riveters european borrowed from the railway workshops with perhaps twenty white and halfcaste subordinates to direct under direction the bevies of workmenbut none knew better than these two who trusted each other how the underlings were not to be trusted they had been tried many times in sudden crisesby slipping of booms by breaking of tackle failure of cranes and the wrath of the riverbut no stress had brought to light any man among men whom findlayson and hitchcock would have honoured by working as remorselessly as they worked themselves findlayson thought it over from the beginning the months of officework destroyed at a blow when the government of india at the last moment added two feet to the width of the bridge under the impression that bridges were cut out of paper and so brought to ruin at least half an acre of calculationsand hitchcock new to disappointment buried his head in his arms and wept the heartbreaking delays over the filling of the contracts in england the futile correspondences hinting at great wealth of commissions if one only one rather doubtful consignment were passed the war that followed the refusal the careful polite obstruction at the other end that followed the war till young hitchcock putting one months leave to another month and borrowing ten days from findlayson spent his poor little savings of a year in a wild dash to london and there as his own tongue asserted and the later consignments proved put the fear of god into a man so great that he feared only parliament and said so till hitchcock wrought with him across his own dinner table andhe feared the kashi bridge and all who spoke in its name then there was the cholera that came in the night to the village by the bridge works and after the cholera smote the smallpox the fever they had always with them hitchcock had been appointed a magistrate of the third class with whipping powers for the better government of the community and findlayson watched him wield his powers temperately learning what to overlook and what to look after it was a long long reverie and it covered storm sudden freshets death in every manner and shape violent and awful rage against red tape half frenzying a mind that knows it should be busy on other things drought sanitation finance birth wedding burial and riot in the village of twenty warring castes argument expostulation persuasion and the blank despair that a man goes to bed upon thankful that his rifle is all in pieces in the guncase behind everything rose the black frame of the kashi bridgeplate by plate girder by girder span by spanand each pier of it recalled hitchcock the allround man who had stood by his chief without failing from the very first to this last  so the bridge was two mens workunless one counted peroo as peroo certainly counted himself he was a lascar a kharva from bulsar familiar with every port between rockhampton and london who had risen to the rank of serang on the british india boats but wearying of routine musters and clean clothes had thrown up the service and gone inland where men of his calibre were sure of employment for his knowledge of tackle and the handling of heavy weights peroo was worth almost any price he might have chosen to put upon his services but custom decreed the wage of the overheadmen and peroo was not within many silver pieces of his proper value neither running water nor extreme heights made him afraid and as an exserang he knew how to hold authority no piece of iron was so big or so badly placed that peroo could not devise a tackle to lift ita looseended sagging arrangement rigged with a scandalous amount of talking but perfectly equal to the work in hand it was peroo who had saved the girder of number seven pier from destruction when the new wirerope jammed in the eye of the crane and the huge plate tilted in its slings threatening to slide out sideways then the native workmen lost their heads with great shoutings and hitchcocks right arm was broken by a falling tplate and he buttoned it up in his coat and swooned and came to and directed for four hours till peroo from the top of the crane reported alls well and the plate swung home there was no one like peroo serang to lash and guy and hold to control the donkeyengines to hoist a fallen locomotive craftily out of the borrowpit into which it had tumbled to strip and dive if need be to see how the concrete blocks round the piers stood the scouring of mother gunga or to adventure upstream on a monsoon night and report on the state of the embankmentfacings he would interrupt the fieldcouncils of findlayson and hitchcock without fear till his wonderful english or his still more wonderful linguafranca half portuguese and half malay ran out and he was forced to take string and show the knots that he would recommend he controlled his own gang of tackle menmysterious relatives from kutch mandvi gathered month by month and tried to the uttermost no consideration of family or kin allowed peroo to keep weak hands or a giddy head on the payroll my honour is the honour of this bridge he would say to the abouttobedismissed what do i care for your honour go and work on a steamer that is all you are fit for  the little cluster of huts where he and his gang lived centred round the tattered dwelling of a seapriestone who had never set foot on black water but had been chosen as ghostly counsellor by two generations of searovers all unaffected by port missions or those creeds which are thrust upon sailors by agencies along thames bank the priest of the lascars had nothing to do with their caste or indeed with anything at all he ate the offerings of his church and slept and smoked and slept again for said peroo who had haled him a thousand miles inland he is a very holy man he never cares what you eat so long as you do not eat beef and that is good because on land we worship shiva we kharvas but at sea on the kumpanis boats we attend strictly to the orders of the burra malum the first mate and on this bridge we observe what finlinson sahib says  finlinson sahib had that day given orders to clear the scaffolding from the guardtower on the right bank and peroo with his mates was casting loose and lowering down the bamboo poles and planks as swiftly as ever they had whipped the cargo out of a coaster  from his trolley he could hear the whistle of the serangs silver pipe and the creek and clatter of the pulleys peroo was standing on the topmost coping of the tower clad in the blue dungaree of his abandoned service and as findlayson motioned to him to be careful for his was no life to throw away he gripped the last pole and shading his eyes shipfashion answered with the longdrawn wail of the focsle lookout ham dekhta hai i am looking out  findlayson laughed and then sighed it was years since he had seen a steamer and he was sick for home as his trolley passed under the tower peroo descended by a rope apefashion and cried it looks well now sahib our bridge is all but done what think you mother gunga will say when the rail runs over  she has said little so far it was never mother gunga that delayed us  there is always time for her and none the less there has been delay has the sahib forgotten last autumns flood when the stoneboats were sunk without warningor only a halfdays warning  yes but nothing save a big flood could hurt us now the spurs are holding well on the west bank  mother gunga eats great allowances there is always room for more stone on the revetments i tell this to the chota sahibhe meant hitchcockand he laughs  no matter peroo another year thou wilt be able to build a bridge in thine own fashion  the lascar grinned then it will not be in this waywith stonework sunk under water as the qyetta was sunk i like sussuspensheen bridges that fly from bank to bank with one big step like a gangplank then no water can hurt when does the lord sahib come to open the bridge  in three months when the weather is cooler  ho ho he is like the burra malum he sleeps below while the work is being done then he comes upon the quarterdeck and touches with his finger and says this is not clean dam jibboonwallah  but the lord sahib does not call me a dam jibboonwallah peroo  no sahib but he does not come on deck till the work is all finished even the burra malum of the nerbudda said once at tuticorin  bah go i am busy  i also said peroo with an unshaken countenance may i take the light dinghy now and row along the spurs  to hold them with thy hands they are i think sufficiently heavy  nay sahib it is thus at sea on the black water we have room to be blown up and down without care here we have no room at all look you we have put the river into a dock and run her between stone sills  findlayson smiled at the we  we have bitted and bridled her she is not like the sea that can beat against a soft beach she is mother gungain irons his voice fell a little  peroo thou hast been up and down the world more even than i speak true talk now how much dost thou in thy heart believe of mother gunga  all that our priest says london is london sahib sydney is sydney and port darwin is port darwin also mother gunga is mother gunga and when i come back to her banks i know this and worship in london i did poojah to the big temple by the river for the sake of the god within    yes i will not take the cushions in the dinghy  findlayson mounted his horse and trotted to the shed of a bungalow that he shared with his assistant the place had become home to him in the last three years he had grilled in the heat sweated in the rains and shivered with fever under the rude thatch roof the limewash beside the door was covered with rough drawings and formulae and the sentrypath trodden in the matting of the verandah showed where he had walked alone there is no eighthour limit to an engineers work and the evening meal with hitchcock was eaten booted and spurred over their cigars they listened to the hum of the village as the gangs came up from the riverbed and the lights began to twinkle  peroo has gone up the spurs in your dinghy hes taken a couple of nephews with him and hes lolling in the stern like a commodore said hitchcock  thats all right hes got something on his mind youd think that ten years in the british india boats would have knocked most of his religion out of him  so it has said hitchcock chuckling i overheard him the other day in the middle of a most atheistical talk with that fat old guru of theirs peroo denied the efficacy of prayer and wanted the guru to go to sea and watch a gale out with him and see if he could stop a monsoon  all the same if you carried off his guru hed leave us like a shot he was yarning away to me about praying to the dome of st pauls when he was in london  he told me that the first time he went into the engineroom of a steamer when he was a boy he prayed to the lowpressure cylinder  not half a bad thing to pray to either hes propitiating his own gods now and he wants to know what mother gunga will think of a bridge being run across her whos there a shadow darkened the doorway and a telegram was put into hitchcocks hand  she ought to be pretty well used to it by this time only a tar it ought to be rallis answer about the new rivets    great heavens hitchcock jumped to his feet  what is it said the senior and took the form thats what mother gunga thinks is it he said reading keep cool young un weve got all our work cut out for us lets see muir wired half an hour ago floods on the ramgunga look out well that gives usone twonine and a half for the flood to reach melipur ghaut and sevens sixteen and a half to lataolisay fifteen hours before it comes down to us  curse that hillfed sewer of a ramgunga findlayson this is two months before anything could have been expected and the left bank is littered up with stuff still two full months before the time  thats why it comes ive only known indian rivers for fiveandtwenty years and i dont pretend to understand here comes another tar findlayson opened the telegram cockran this time from the ganges canal heavy rains here bad he might have saved the last word well we dont want to know any more weve got to work the gangs all night and clean up the riverbed youll take the east bank and work out to meet me in the middle get everything that floats below the bridge we shall have quite enough rivercraft coming down adrift anyhow without letting the stoneboats ram the piers what have you got on the east bank that needs looking after  pontoonone big pontoon with the overhead crane on it tother overhead crane on the mended pontoon with the cartroad rivets from twenty to twentythree pierstwo construction lines and a turningspur the pilework must take its chance said hitchcock  all right roll up everything you can lay hands on well give the gang fifteen minutes more to eat their grub  close to the verandah stood a big nightgong never used except for flood or fire in the village hitchcock had called for a fresh horse and was off to his side of the bridge when findlayson took the clothbound stick and smote with the rubbing stroke that brings out the full thunder of the metal  long before the last rumble ceased every nightgong in the village had taken up the warning to these were added the hoarse screaming of conches in the little temples the throbbing of drums and tomtoms and from the european quarters where the riveters lived mccartneys bugle a weapon of offence on sundays and festivals brayed desperately calling to stables engine after engine toiling home along the spurs at the end of her days work whistled in answer till the whistles were answered from the far bank then the big gong thundered thrice for a sign that it was flood and not fire conch drum and whistle echoed the call and the village quivered to the sound of bare feet running upon soft earth the order in all cases was to stand by the days work and wait instructions the gangs poured by in the dusk men stopping to knot a loincloth or fasten a sandal gangforemen shouting to their subordinates as they ran or paused by the toolissue sheds for bars and mattocks locomotives creeping down their tracks wheeldeep in the crowd till the brown torrent disappeared into the dusk of the riverbed raced over the pilework swarmed along the lattices clustered by the cranes and stood stilleach man in his place  then the troubled beating of the gong carried the order to take up everything and bear it beyond highwater mark and the flarelamps broke out by the hundred between the webs of dull iron as the riveters began a nights work racing against the flood that was to come the girders of the three centre piersthose that stood on the cribswere all but in position they needed just as many rivets as could be driven into them for the flood would assuredly wash out their supports and the ironwork would settle down on the caps of stone if they were not blocked at the ends a hundred crowbars strained at the sleepers of the temporary line that fed the unfinished piers it was heaved up in lengths loaded into trucks and backed up the bank beyond floodlevel by the groaning locomotives the toolsheds on the sands melted away before the attack of shouting armies and with them went the stacked ranks of government stores ironhound boxes of rivets pliers cutters duplicate parts of the rivetingmachines spare pumps and chains the big crane would be the last to be shifted for she was hoisting all the heavy stuff up to the main structure of the bridge the concrete blocks on the fleet of stoneboats were dropped overside where there was any depth of water to guard the piers and the empty boats themselves were poled under the bridge downstream it was here that peroos pipe shrilled loudest for the first stroke of the big gong had brought the dinghy back at racing speed and peroo and his people were stripped to the waist working for the honour and credit which are better than life  i knew she would speak he cried i knew but the telegraph gives us good warning o sons of unthinkable begettingchildren of unspeakable shameare we here for the look of the thing it was two feet of wirerope frayed at the ends and it did wonders as peroo leaped from gunnel to gunnel shouting the language of the sea  findlayson was more troubled for the stoneboats than anything else mccartney with his gangs was blocking up the ends of the three doubtful spans but boats adrift if the flood chanced to be a high one might endanger the girders and there was a very fleet in the shrunken channel  get them behind the swell of the guardtower he shouted down to peroo it will be deadwater there get them below the bridge  accha very good i know we are mooring them with wirerope was the answer heh listen to the chota sahib he is working hard  from across the river came an almost continuous whistling of locomotives backed by the rumble of stone hitchcock at the last minute was spending a few hundred more trucks of tarakee stone in reinforcing his spurs and embankments  the bridge challenges mother gunga said peroo with a laugh but when she talks i know whose voice will be the loudest  for hours the naked men worked screaming and shouting under the lights it was a hot moonless night the end of it was darkened by clouds and a sudden squall that made findlayson very grave  she moves said peroo just before the dawn mother gunga is awake hear he dipped his hand over the side of a boat and the current mumbled on it a little wave hit the side of a pier with a crisp slap  six hours before her time said findlayson mopping his forehead savagely  now we cant depend on anything wed better clear all hands out of the riverbed  again the big gong beat and a second time there was the rushing of naked feet on earth and ringing iron the clatter of tools ceased in the silence men heard the dry yawn of water crawling over thirsty sand  foreman after foreman shouted to findlayson who had posted himself by the guardtower that his section of the riverbed had been cleaned out and when the last voice dropped findlayson hurried over the bridge till the iron plating of the permanent way gave place to the temporary plankwalk over the three centre piers and there he met hitchcock  all clear your side said findlayson the whisper rang in the box of lattice work  yes and the east channels filling now were utterly out of our reckoning when is this thing down on us  theres no saying shes filling as fast as she can look findlayson pointed to the planks below his feet where the sand burned and defiled by months of work was beginning to whisper and fizz  what orders said hitchcock  call the rollcount stores sit on your hunkersand pray for the bridge thats all i can think of good night dont risk your life trying to fish out anything that may go downstream  oh ill be as prudent as you are night heavens how shes filling heres the rain in earnest  findlayson picked his way back to his bank sweeping the last of mccartneys riveters before him the gangs had spread themselves along the embankments regardless of the cold rain of the dawn and there they waited for the flood only peroo kept his men together behind the swell of the guardtower where the stoneboats lay tied fore and aft with hawsers wirerope and chains  a shrill wail ran along the line growing to a yell half fear and half wonder the face of the river whitened from bank to hank between the stone facings and the faraway spurs went out in spouts of foam mother gunga had come bankhigh in haste and a wall of chocolatecoloured water was her messenger there was a shriek above the roar of the water the complaint of the spans coming down on their blocks as the cribs were whirled out from under their bellies the stoneboats groaned and ground each other in the eddy that swung round the abutment and their clumsy masts rose higher and higher against the dim skyline  before she was shut between these walls we knew what she would do now she is thus cramped god only knows what she will do said peroo watching the furious turmoil round the guardtower ohe fight then fight hard for it is thus that a woman wears herself out  but mother gunga would not fight as peroo desired after the first downstream plunge there came no more walls of water but the river lifted herself bodily as a snake when she drinks in midsummer plucking and fingering along the revetments and banking up behind the piers till even findlayson began to recalculate the strength of his work  when day came the village gasped only last night men said turning to each other it was as a town in the riverbed look now  and they looked and wondered afresh at the deep water the racing water that licked the throat of the piers the farther bank was veiled by rain into which the bridge ran out and vanished the spurs upstream were marked by no more than eddies and spoutings and downstream the pent river once freed of her guidelines had spread like a sea to the horizon then hurried by rolling in the water dead men and oxen together with here and there a patch of thatched roof that melted when it touched a pier  big flood said peroo and findlayson nodded it was as big a flood as he had any wish to watch his bridge would stand what was upon her now but not very much more and if by any of a thousand chances there happened to be a weakness in the embankments mother gunga would carry his honour to the sea with the other raffle worst of all there was nothing to do except to sit still and findlayson sat still under his macintosh till his helmet became pulp on his head and his boots were overankle in mire he took no count of time for the river was marking the hours inch by inch and foot by foot along the embankment and he listened numb and hungry to the straining of the stoneboats the hollow thunder under the piers and the hundred noises that make the full note of a flood once a dripping servant brought him food but he could not eat and once he thought that he heard a faint toot from a locomotive across the river and then he smiled the bridges failure would hurt his assistant not a little but hitchcock was a young man with his big work yet to do for himself the crash meant everythingeverything that made a hard life worth the living they would say the men of his own profession    he remembered the halfpitying things that he himself had said when lockharts new waterworks burst and broke down in brickheaps and sludge and lockharts spirit broke in him and he died he remembered what he himself had said when the sumao bridge went out in the big cyclone by the sea and most he remembered poor hartopps face three weeks later when the shame had marked it his bridge was twice the size of hartopps and it carried the findlayson truss as well as the new piershoethe findlayson bolted shoe there were no excuses in his service government might listen perhaps but his own kind would judge him by his bridge as that stood or fell he went over it in his head plate by plate span by span brick by brick pier by pier remembering comparing estimating and recalculating lest there should be any mistake and through the long hours and through the flights of formulae that danced and wheeled before him a cold fear would come to pinch his heart his side of the sum was beyond question but what man knew mother gungas arithmetic even as he was making all sure by the multiplication table the river might be scooping a pothole to the very bottom of any one of those eightyfoot piers that carried his reputation again a servant came to him with food but his mouth was dry and he could only drink and return to the decimals in his brain and the river was still rising peroo in a mat shelter coat crouched at his feet watching now his face and now the face of the river but saying nothing  at last the lascar rose and floundered through the mud towards the village but he was careful to leave an ally to watch the boats  presently he returned most irreverently driving before him the priest of his creeda fat old man with a grey beard that whipped the wind with the wet cloth that blew over his shoulder never was seen so lamentable a guru  what good are offerings and little kerosene lamps and dry grain shouted peroo if squatting in the mud is all that thou canst do thou hast dealt long with the gods when they were contented and wellwishing now they are angry speak to them  what is a man against the wrath of gods whined the priest cowering as the wind took him let me go to the temple and i will pray there  son of a pig pray here is there no return for salt fish and curry powder and dried onions call aloud tell mother gunga we have had enough bid her be still for the night i cannot pray but i have been serving in the kumpanis boats and when men did not obey my orders i a flourish of the wirerope colt rounded the sentence and the priest breaking free from his disciple fled to the village  fat pig said peroo after all that we have done for him when the flood is down i will see to it that we get a new guru finlinson sahib it darkens for night now and since yesterday nothing has been eaten be wise sahib no man can endure watching and great thinking on an empty belly lie down sahib the river will do what the river will do  the bridge is mine i cannot leave it  wilt thou hold it up with thy hands then said peroo laughing  i was troubled for my boats and sheers before the flood came now we are in the hands of the gods the sahib will not eat and lie down take these then they are meat and good toddy together and they kill all weariness besides the fever that follows the rain i have eaten nothing else today at all  he took a small tin tobaccobox from his sodden waistbelt and thrust it into findlaysons hand saying nay do not be afraid it is no more than opiumclean malwa opium  findlayson shook two or three of the darkbrown pellets into his hand and hardly knowing what he did swallowed them the stuff was at least a good guard against feverthe fever that was creeping upon him out of the wet mudand he had seen what peroo could do in the stewing mists of autumn on the strength of a dose from the tin box  peroo nodded with bright eyes in a littlein a little the sahib will find that he thinks well again i too will he dived into his treasurebox resettled the raincoat over his head and squatted down to watch the boats it was too dark now to see beyond the first pier and the night seemed to have given the river new strength findlayson stood with his chin on his chest thinking there was one point about one of the piersthe sevenththat he had not fully settled in his mind the figures would not shape themselves to the eye except one by one and at enormous intervals of time there was a sound rich and mellow in his ears like the deepest note of a doublebassan entrancing sound upon which he pondered for several hours as it seemed then peroo was at his elbow shouting that a wire hawser had snapped and the stoneboats were loose findlayson saw the fleet open and swing out fanwise to a longdrawn shriek of wire straining across gunnels  a tree hit them they will all go cried peroo the main hawser has parted what does the sahib do  an immensely complex plan had suddenly flashed into findlaysons mind he saw the ropes running from boat to boat in straight lines and angleseach rope a line of white fire but there was one rope which was the master rope he could see that rope if he could pull it once it was absolutely and mathematically certain that the disordered fleet would reassemble itself in the backwater behind the guardtower but why he wondered was peroo clinging so desperately to his waist as he hastened down the bank it was necessary to put the lascar aside gently and slowly because it was necessary to save the boats and further to demonstrate the extreme ease of the problem that looked so difficult and thenbut it was of no conceivable importancea wirerope raced through his hand burning it the high bank disappeared and with it all the slowly dispersing factors of the problem he was sitting in the rainy darknesssitting in a boat that spun like a top and peroo was standing over him  i had forgotten said the lascar slowly that to those fasting and unused the opium is worse than any wine those who die in gunga go to the gods still i have no desire to present myself before such great ones can the sahib swim  what need he can flyfly as swiftly as the wind was the thick answer  he is mad muttered peroo under his breath and he threw me aside like a bundle of dungcakes well he will not know his death the boat cannot live an hour here even if she strike nothing it is not good to look at death with a clear eye  he refreshed himself again from the tin box squatted down in the bows of the reeling pegged and stitched craft staring through the mist at the nothing that was there a warm drowsiness crept over findlayson the chief engineer whose duty was with his bridge the heavy raindrops struck him with a thousand tingling little thrills and the weight of all time since time was made hung heavy on his eyelids he thought and perceived that he was perfectly secure for the water was so solid that a man could surely step out upon it and standing still with his legs apart to keep his balancethis was the most important pointwould be borne with great and easy speed to the shore but yet a better plan came to him it needed only an exertion of will for the soul to hurl the body ashore as wind drives paper to waft it kitefashion to the bank thereafterthe boat spun dizzilysuppose the high wind got under the freed body would it tower up like a kite and pitch headlong on the faraway sands or would it duck about beyond control through all eternity findlayson gripped the gunnel to anchor himself for it seemed that he was on the edge of taking the flight before he had settled all his plans opium has more effect on the white man than the black peroo was only comfortably indifferent to accidents she cannot live he grunted her seams open already if she were even a dinghy with oars we could have ridden it out but a box with holes is no good finlinson sahib she fills  accha i am going away come thou also in his mind findlayson had already escaped from the boat and was circling high in air to find a rest for the sole of his foot his bodyhe was really sorry for its gross helplessnesslay in the stern the water rushing about its knees  how very ridiculous he said to himself from his eyriethatis findlaysonchief of the kashi bridge the poor beast is going to be drowned too drowned when its close to shore imim on shore already why doesnt it come along  to his intense disgust he found his soul back in his body again and that body spluttering and choking in deep water the pain of the reunion was atrocious but it was necessary also to fight for the body he was conscious of grasping wildly at wet sand and striding prodigiously as one strides in a dream to keep foothold in the swirling water till at last he hauled himself clear of the hold of the river and dropped panting on wet earth  not this night said peroo in his ear the gods have protected us the lascar moved his feet cautiously and they rustled among dried stumps this is some island of last years indigocrop he went on we shall find no men here but have great care sahib all the snakes of a hundred miles have been flooded out here comes the lightning on the heels of the wind now we shall be able to look but walk carefully  findlayson was far and far beyond any fear of snakes or indeed any merely human emotion he saw after he had rubbed the water from his eyes with an immense clearness and trod so it seemed to himself with worldencompassing strides somewhere in the night of time he had built a bridgea bridge that spanned illimitable levels of shining seas but the deluge had swept it away leaving this one island under heaven for findlayson and his companion sole survivors of the breed of man  an incessant lightning forked and blue showed all that there was to be seen on the little patch in the flooda clump of thorn a clump of swaying creaking bamboos and a grey gnarled peepul overshadowing a hindoo shrine from whose dome floated a tattered red flag the holy man whose summer restingplace it was had long since abandoned it and the weather had broken the reddaubed image of his god the two men stumbled heavylimbed and heavyeyed over the ashes of a brickset cookingplace and dropped down under the shelter of the branches while the rain and river roared together  the stumps of the indigo crackled and there was a smell of cattle as a huge and dripping brahminee bull shouldered his way under the tree the flashes revealed the trident mark of shiva on his flank the insolence of head and hump the luminous staglike eyes the brow crowned with a wreath of sodden marigold blooms and the silky dewlap that almost swept the ground there was a noise behind him of other beasts coming up from the floodline through the thicket a sound of heavy feet and deep breathing  here be more beside ourselves said findlayson his head against the treepole looking through halfshut eyes wholly at ease  truly said peroo thickly and no small ones  what are they then i do not see clearly  the gods who else look  ah true the gods surelythe gods findlayson smiled as his head fell forward on his chest peroo was eminently right after the flood who should be alive in the land except the gods that made itthe gods to whom his village prayed nightlythe gods who were in all mens mouths and about all mens ways he could not raise his head or stir a finger for the trance that held him and peroo was smiling vacantly at the lightning  the bull paused by the shrine his head lowered to the damp earth a green parrot in the branches preened his wet wings and screamed against the thunder as the circle under the tree filled with the shifting shadows of beasts there was a black buck at the bulls heelssuch a buck as findlayson in his faraway life upon earth might have seen in dreamsa buck with a royal head ebon back silver belly and gleaming straight horns beside him her head bowed to the ground the green eyes burning under the heavy brows with restless tail switching the dead grass paced a tigress fullbellied and deepjowled  the bull crouched beside the shrine and there leaped from the darkness a monstrous grey ape who seated himself manwise in the place of the fallen image and the rain spilled like jewels from the hair of his neck and shoulders other shadows came and went behind the circle among them a drunken man flourishing staff and drinkingbottle then a hoarse bellow broke out from near the ground the flood lessens even now it cried hour by hour the water falls and their bridge still stands  my bridge said findlayson to himself that must be very old work now what have the gods to do with my bridge  his eyes rolled in the darkness following the roar a muggerthe bluntnosed fordhaunting mugger of the gangesdraggled herself before the beasts lashing furiously to right and left with her tail  they have made it too strong for me in all this night i have only torn away a handful of planks the walls stand the towers stand they have chained my flood and the river is not free any more heavenly ones take this yoke away give me clear water between bank and bank it is i mother gunga that speak the justice of the gods deal me the justice of the gods  what said i whispered peroo this is in truth a punchayet of the gods now we know that all the world is dead save you and i sahib  the parrot screamed and fluttered again and the tigress her ears flat to her head snarled wickedly  somewhere in the shadow a great trunk and gleaming tusks swayed to and fro and a low gurgle broke the silence that followed on the snarl  we be here said a deep voice the great ones one only and very many shiv my father is here with indra kali has spoken already hanuman listens also  kashi is without her kotwal tonight shouted the man with the drinkingbottle flinging his staff to the ground while the island rang to the baying of hounds give her the justice of the gods  ye were still when they polluted my waters the great crocodile bellowed ye made no sign when my river was trapped between the walls i had no help save my own strength and that failedthe strength of mother gunga failedbefore their guardtowers what could i do i have done everything finish now heavenly ones  i brought the death i rode the spotted sickness from hut to hut of their workmen and yet they would not cease a noseslitten hideworn ass lame scissorlegged and galled limped forward i cast the death at them out of my nostrils but they would not cease  peroo would have moved but the opium lay heavy upon him  bah he said spitting here is sitala herself matathe smallpox has the sahib a handkerchief to put over his face  little help they fed me the corpses for a month and i flung them out on my sandbars but their work went forward demons they are and sons of demons and ye left mother gunga alone for their firecarriage to make a mock of the justice of the gods on the bridgebuilders  the bull turned the cud in his mouth and answered slowly if the justice of the gods caught all who made a mock of holy things there would be many dark altars in the land mother  but this goes beyond a mock said the tigress darting forward a griping paw thou knowest shiv and ye too heavenly ones ye know that they have defiled gunga surely they must come to the destroyer let indra judge  the buck made no movement as he answered how long has this evil been  three years as men count years said the mugger close pressed to the earth  does mother gunga die then in a year that she is so anxious to see vengeance now the deep sea was where she runs but yesterday and tomorrow the sea shall cover her again as the gods count that which men call time can any say that this their bridge endures till tomorrow said the buck  there was a long hush and in the clearing of the storm the full moon stood up above the dripping trees  judge ye then said the river sullenly i have spoken my shame the flood falls still i can do no more  for my own partit was the voice of the great ape seated within the shrineit pleases me well to watch these men remembering that i also builded no small bridge in the worlds youth  they say too snarled the tiger that these men came of the wreck of thy armies hanuman and therefore thou hast aided  they toil as my armies toiled in lanka and they believe that their toil endures indra is too high but shiv thou knowest how the land is threaded with their firecarriages  yea i know said the bull their gods instructed them in the matter  a laugh ran round the circle  their gods what should their gods know they were born yesterday and those that made them are scarcely yet cold said the mugger tomorrow their gods will die  ho said peroo mother gunga talks good talk i told that to the padresahib who preached on the mombassa and he asked the burra malum to put me in irons for a great rudeness  surely they make these things to please their gods said the bull again  not altogether the elephant rolled forth it is for the profit of my mahajunsmy fat moneylenders that worship me at each new year when they draw my image at the head of the accountbooks i looking over their shoulders by lamplight see that the names in the books are those of men in far placesfor all the towns are drawn together by the firecarriage and the money comes and goes swiftly and the accountbooks grow as fat asmyself and i who am ganesh of good luck i bless my peoples  they have changed the face of the landwhich is my land they have killed and made new towns on my banks said the mugger  it is but the shifting of a little dirt let the dirt dig in the dirt if it pleases the dirt answered the elephant  but afterwards said the tiger afterwards they will see that mother gunga can avenge no insult and they fall away from her first and later from us all one by one in the end ganesh we are left with naked altars  the drunken man staggered to his feet and hiccupped vehemently  kali lies my sister lies also this my stick is the kotwal of kashi and he keeps tally of my pilgrims when the time comes to worship bhaironand it is always timethe firecarriages move one by one and each bears a thousand pilgrims they do not come afoot any more but rolling upon wheels and my honour is increased  gunga i have seen thy bed at pryag black with the pilgrims said the ape leaning forward and but for the firecarriage they would have come slowly and in fewer numbers remember  they come to me always bhairon went on thickly by day and night they pray to me all the common people in the fields and the roads who is like bhairon today what talk is this of changing faiths is my staff kotwal of kashi for nothing he keeps the tally and he says that never were so many altars as today and the firecarriage serves them well bhairon am ibhairon of the common people and the chiefest of the heavenly ones today also my staff says  peace thou lowed the bull the worship of the schools is mine and they talk very wisely asking whether i be one or many as is the delight of my people and ye know what i am kali my wife thou knowest also  yea i know said the tigress with lowered head  greater am i than gunga also for ye know who moved the minds of men that they should count gunga holy among the rivers who die in that waterye know how men saycome to us without punishment and gunga knows that the firecarriage has borne to her scores upon scores of such anxious ones and kali knows that she has held her chiefest festivals among the pilgrimages that are fed by the firecarriage who smote at pooree under the image there her thousands in a day and a night and bound the sickness to the wheels of the firecarriages so that it ran from one end of the land to the other who but kali before the firecarriage came it was a heavy toil the firecarriages have served thee well mother of death but i speak for mine own altars who am not bhairon of the common folk but shiv men go to and fro making words and telling talk of strange gods and i listen faith follows faith among my people in the schools and i have no anger for when all words are said and the new talk is ended to shiv men return at the last  true it is true murmured hanuman to shiv and to the others mother they return i creep from temple to temple in the north where they worship one god and his prophet and presently my image is alone within their shrines  small thanks said the buck turning his head slowly i am that one and his prophet also  even so father said hanuman and to the south i go who am the oldest of the gods as men know the gods and presently i touch the shrines of the new faith and the woman whom we know is hewn twelvearmed and still they call her mary  small thanks brother said the tigress i am that woman  even so sister and i go west among the firecarriages and stand before the bridgebuilders in many shapes and because of me they change their faiths and are very wise ho ho i am the builder of bridges indeedbridges between this and that and each bridge leads surely to us in the end be content gunga neither these men nor those that follow them mock thee at all  am i alone then heavenly ones shall i smooth out my flood lest unhappily i bear away their walls will indra dry my springs in the hills and make me crawl humbly between their wharfs shall i bury me in the sand ere i offend  and all for the sake of a little iron bar with the firecarriage atop truly mother gunga is always young said ganesh the elephant a child had not spoken more foolishly let the dirt dig in the dirt ere it return to the dirt i know only that my people grow rich and praise me shiv has said that the men of the schools do not forget bhairon is content for his crowd of the common people and hanuman laughs  surely i laugh said the ape my altars are few beside those of ganesh or bhairon but the firecarriages bring me new worshippers from beyond the black waterthe men who believe that their god is toil i run before them beckoning and they follow hanuman  give them the toil that they desire then said the river make a bar across my flood and throw the water back upon the bridge once thou wast strong in lanka hanuman stoop and lift my bed  who gives life can take life the ape scratched in the mud with a long forefinger and yet who would profit by the killing very many would die  there came up from the water a snatch of a lovesong such as the boys sing when they watch their cattle in the noon heats of late spring the parrot screamed joyously sidling along his branch with lowered head as the song grew louder and in a patch of clear moonlight stood revealed the young herd the darling of the gopis the idol of dreaming maids and of mothers ere their children are born krishna the wellbeloved he stooped to knot up his long wet hair and the parrot fluttered to his shoulder  fleeting and singing and singing and fleeting hiccupped bhairon those make thee late for the council brother  and then said krishna with a laugh throwing back his head ye can do little without me or karma here he fondled the parrots plumage and laughed again what is this sitting and talking together i heard mother gunga roaring in the dark and so came quickly from a hut where i lay warm and what have ye done to karma that he is so wet and silent and what does mother gunga here are the heavens full that ye must come paddling in the mud beastwise karma what do they do  gunga has prayed for a vengeance on the bridgebuilders and kali is with her now she bids hanuman whelm the bridge that her honour may be made great cried the parrot i waited here knowing that thou wouldst come o my master  and the heavenly ones said nothing did gunga and the mother of sorrows outtalk them did none speak for my people  nay said ganesh moving uneasily from foot to foot i said it was but dirt at play and why should we stamp it flat  i was content to let them toilwell content said hanuman  what had i to do with gungas anger said the bull  i am bhairon of the common folk and this my staff is kotwal of all kashi i spoke for the common people  thou the young gods eyes sparkled  am i not the first of the gods in their mouths today returned bhairon unabashed for the sake of the common people i saidvery many wise things which i have now forgotten but this my staff  krishna turned impatiently saw the mugger at his feet and kneeling slipped an arm round the cold neck mother he said gently get thee to thy flood again the matter is not for thee what harm shall thy honour take of this live dirt thou hast given them their fields new year after year and by thy flood they are made strong they come all to thee at the last what need to slay them now have pity mother for a littleand it is only for a little  if it be only for a little the slow beast began    are they gods then krishna returned with a laugh his eyes looking into the dull eyes of the river be certain that it is only for a little the heavenly ones have heard thee and presently justice will be done go now mother to the flood again men and cattle are thick on the watersthe banks fallthe villages melt because of thee  but the bridgethe bridge stands the mugger turned grunting into the undergrowth as krishna rose  it is ended said the tigress viciously there is no more justice from the heavenly ones ye have made shame and sport of gunga who asked no more than a few score lives  of my peoplewho lie under the leafroofs of the village yonderof the young girls and the young men who sing to them in the darkof the child that will be born next mornof that which was begotten tonight said krishna and when all is done what profit tomorrow sees them at work ay if ye swept the bridge out from end to end they would begin anew hear me bhairon is drunk always hanuman mocks his people with new riddles  nay but they are very old ones the ape said laughing  shiv hears the talk of the schools and the dreams of the holy men ganesh thinks only of his fat traders but ii live with these my people asking for no gifts and so receiving them hourly  and very tender art thou of thy people said the tigress  they are my own the old women dream of me turning in their sleep the maids look and listen for me when they go to fill their lotahs by the river i walk by the young men waiting without the gates at dusk and i call over my shoulder to the whitebeards ye know heavenly ones that i alone of us all walk upon the earth continually and have no pleasure in our heavens so long as a green blade springs here or there are two voices at twilight in the standing crops wise are ye but ye live far off forgetting whence ye came so do i not forget and the firecarriage feeds your shrines ye say and the firecarriages bring a thousand pilgrims where but ten came in the old years true that is true today  but tomorrow they are dead brother said ganesh  peace said the bull as hanuman leaned forward again and tomorrow belovedwhat of tomorrow  this only a new word creeping from mouth to mouth among the common folka word that neither man nor god can lay hold ofan evil worda little lazy word among the common folk saying and none know who set that word afoot that they weary of ye heavenly ones  the gods laughed together softly and then beloved they said  and to cover that weariness they my people will bring to thee shiv and to thee ganesh at first greater offerings and a louder noise of worship but the word has gone abroad and after they will pay fewer dues to your fat brahmins next they will forget your altars but so slowly that no man can say how his forgetfulness began  i knewi knew i spoke this also but they would not hear said the tigress we should have slainwe should have slain  it is too late now ye should have slain at the beginning when the men from across the water had taught our folk nothing now my people see their work and go away thinking they do not think of the heavenly ones altogether they think of the firecarriage and the other things that the bridgebuilders have done and when your priests thrust forward hands asking alms they give a little unwillingly that is the beginning among one or two or five or tenfor i moving among my people know what is in their hearts  and the end jester of the gods what shall the end be said ganesh  the end shall be as it was in the beginning o slothful son of shiv the flame shall die upon the altars and the prayer upon the tongue till ye become little gods againgods of the junglenames that the hunters of rats and noosers of dogs whisper in the thicket and among the cavesraggods pot godlings of the tree and the villagemark as ye were at the beginning that is the end ganesh for thee and for bhaironbhairon of the common people  it is very far away grunted bhairon also it is a lie  many women have kissed krishna they told him this to cheer their own hearts when the grey hairs came and he has told us the tale said the bull below his breath  their gods came and we changed them i took the woman and made her twelvearmed so shall we twist all their gods said hanuman  their gods this is no question of their godsone or threeman or woman the matter is with the people i move and not the gods of the bridgebuilders said krishna  so be it i have made a man worship the firecarriage as it stood still breathing smoke and he knew not that he worshipped me said hanuman the ape they will only change a little the names of their gods i shall lead the builders of the bridges as of old shiv shall be worshipped in the schools by such as doubt and despise their fellows ganesh shall have his mahajuns and bhairon the donkeydrivers the pilgrims and the sellers of toys beloved they will do no more than change the names and that we have seen a thousand times  surely they will do no more than change the names echoed ganesh but there was an uneasy movement among the gods  they will change more than the names me alone they cannot kill so long as a maiden and a man meet together or the spring follows the winter rains heavenly ones not for nothing have i walked upon the earth my people know not now what they know but i who live with them i read their hearts great kings the beginning of the end is born already the firecarriages shout the names of new gods that are not the old under new names drink now and eat greatly bathe your faces in the smoke of the altars before they grow cold take dues and listen to the cymbals and the drums heavenly ones while yet there are flowers and songs as men count time the end is far off but as we who know reckon it is today i have spoken  the young god ceased and his brethren looked at each other long in silence  this i have not heard before peroo whispered in his companions ear and yet sometimes when i oiled the brasses in the engineroom of the goorkha i have wondered if our priests were so wiseso wise the day is coming sahib they will be gone by the morning  a yellow light broadened in the sky and the tone of the river changed as the darkness withdrew  suddenly the elephant trumpeted aloud as though man had goaded him  let indra judge father of all speak thou what of the things we have heard has krishna lied indeed or  ye know said the buck rising to his feet ye know the riddle of the gods when brahm ceases to dream the heavens and the hells and earth disappear be content brahm dreams still the dreams come and go and the nature of the dreams changes but still brahm dreams krishna has walked too long upon earth and yet i love him the more for the tale he has told the gods change belovedall save one  ay all save one that makes love in the hearts of men said krishna knotting his girdle it is but a little time to wait and ye shall know if i lie truly it is but a little time as thou sayest and we shall know get thee to thy huts again beloved and make sport for the young things for still brahm dreams go my children brahm dreams and till he wakes the gods die not  whither went they said the lascar awestruck shivering a little with the cold  god knows said findlayson the river and the island lay in full daylight now and there was never mark of hoof or pug on the wet earth under the peepul only a parrot screamed in the branches bringing down showers of waterdrops as he fluttered his wings  up we are cramped with cold has the opium died out canst thou move sahib  findlayson staggered to his feet and shook himself his bead swam and ached but the work of the opium was over and as he sluiced his forehead in a pool the chief engineer of the kashi bridge was wondering how he had managed to fall upon the island what chances the day offered of return and above all how his work stood  peroo i have forgotten much i was under the guardtower watching the river and thendid the flood sweep us away  no the boats broke loose sahib and if the sahib had forgotten about the opium decidedly peroo would not remind him in striving to retie them so it seemed to me but it was darka rope caught the sahib and threw him upon a boat considering that we two with hitchcock sahib built as it were that bridge i came also upon the boat which came riding on horseback as it were on the nose of this island and so splitting cast us ashore i made a great cry when the boat left the wharf and without doubt hitchcock sahib will come for us as for the bridge so many have died in the building that it cannot fall a fierce sun that drew out all the smell of the sodden land had followed the storm and in that clear light there was no room for a man to think of the dreams of the dark findlayson stared upstream across the blaze of moving water till his eyes ached there was no sign of any bank to the ganges much less of a bridgeline  we came down far he said it was wonderful that we were not drowned a hundred times  that was the least of the wonder for no man dies before his time i have seen sydney i have seen london and twenty great ports butperoo looked at the damp discoloured shrine under the peepulnever man has seen that we saw here  what  has the sahib forgotten or do we black men only see the gods  there was a fever upon me findlayson was still looking uneasily across the water it seemed that the island was full of beasts and men talking but i do not remember a boat could live in this water now i think  oho then it is true when brahm ceases to dream the gods die now i know indeed what he meant once too the guru said as much to me but then i did not understand now i am wise  what said findlayson over his shoulder  peroo went on as if he were talking to himself sixseventen monsoons since i was watch on the focsle of the rewahthe kumpanis big boatand there was a big tufan green and black water beating and i held fast to the lifelines choking under the waters then i thought of the godsof those whom we saw tonighthe stared curiously at findlaysons back but the white man was looking across the flood yes i say of those whom we saw this night past and i called upon them to protect me and while i prayed still keeping my lookout a big wave came and threw me forward upon the ring of the great black bowanchor and the rewah rose high and high leaning towards the lefthand side and the water drew away from beneath her nose and i lay upon my belly holding the ring and looking down into those great deeps then i thought even in the face of death if i lose hold i die and for me neither the rewah nor my place by the galley where the rice is cooked nor bombay nor calcutta nor even london will be any more for me how shall i be sure i said that the gods to whom i pray will abide at all this i thought and the rewah dropped her nose as a hammer falls and all the sea came in and slid me backwards along the focsle and over the break of the focsle and i very badly bruised my shin against the donkeyengine but i did not die and i have seen the gods they are good for live men but for the dead    they have spoken themselves therefore when i come to the village i will beat the guru for talking riddles which are no riddles when brahm ceases to dream the gods go  look upstream the light blinds is there smoke yonder  peroo shaded his eyes with his hands he is a wise man and quick hitchcock sahib would not trust a rowboat he has borrowed the rao sahibs steamlaunch and comes to look for us i have always said that there should have been a steamlaunch on the bridge works for us  the territory of the rao of baraon lay within ten miles of the bridge and findlayson and hitchcock had spent a fair portion of their scanty leisure in playing billiards and shooting blackbuck with the young man he had been bearded by an english tutor of sporting tastes for some five or six years and was now royally wasting the revenues accumulated during his minority by the indian government his steamlaunch with its silverplated rails striped silk awning and mahogany decks was a new toy which findlayson had found horribly in the way when the rao came to look at the bridge works  its great luck murmured findlayson but he was none the less afraid wondering what news might be of the bridge  the gaudy blueandwhite funnel came downstream swiftly they could see hitchcock in the bows with a pair of operaglasses and his face was unusually white then peroo hailed and the launch made for the tail of the island the rao sahib in tweed shootingsuit and a sevenhued turban waved his royal hand and hitchcock shouted but he need have asked no questions for findlaysons first demand was for his bridge  all serene gad i never expected to see you again findlayson youre seven koss downstream yes theres not a stone shifted anywhere but how are you i borrowed the rao sahibs launch and he was good enough to come along jump in ah finlinson you are very well eh that was most unprecedented calamity last night eh my royal palace too it leaks like the devil and the crops will also be short all about my country now you shall back her out hitchcock ii do not understand steamengines you are wet you are cold finlinson i have some things to eat here and you will take a good drink  im immensely grateful rao sahib i believe youve saved my life how did hitchcock  oho his hair was upon end he rode to me in the middle of the night and woke me up in the arms of morpheus i was most truly concerned finlinson so i came too my headpriest he is very angry just now we will go quick mister hitchcock i am due to attend at twelve fortyfive in the state temple where we sanctify some new idol if not so i would have asked you to spend the day with me they are dambore these religious ceremonies finlinson eh  peroo well known to the crew had possessed himself of the inlaid wheel and was taking the launch craftily upstream but while he steered he was in his mind handling two feet of partially untwisted wirerope and the back upon which he beat was the back of his guru
