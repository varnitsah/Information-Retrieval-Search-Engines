  lecture i  the pleasures of learning  bertha to osburga   in the short review of the present state of english art given you last year i left necessarily many points untouched and others unexplained the seventh lecture which i did not think it necessary to read aloud furnished you with some of the corrective statements of which whether spoken or not it was extremely desirable that you should estimate the balancing weight these i propose in the present course farther to illustrate and to arrive with you at i hope a justyou would not wish it to be a flatteringestimate of the conditions of our english artistic life past and present in order that with due allowance for them we may determine with some security what those of us who have faculty ought to do and those who have sensibility to admire  2 in thus rightly doing and feeling you will find summed a wider duty and granted a greater power than the moral philosophy at this moment current with you has ever conceived and a prospect opened to you besides of such a future for england as you may both hopefully and proudly labour for with your hands and those of you who are spared to the ordinary term of human life even see with your eyes when all this tumult of vain avarice and idle pleasure into which you have been plunged at birth shall have passed into its appointed perdition  3 i wish that you would read for introduction to the lectures i have this year arranged for you that on the future of england which i gave to the cadets at woolwich in the first year of my professorship here 1869 and which is now placed as the main conclusion of the crown of wild olive and with it very attentively the close of my inaugural lecture given here for the matter no less than the tenor of which i was reproved by all my friends as irrelevant and illjudgedwhich nevertheless is of all the pieces of teaching i have ever given from this chair the most pregnant and essential to whatever studies whether of art or science you may pursue in this place or elsewhere during your lives  the opening words of that passage i will take leave to read to you againfor they must still be the ground of whatever help i can give you worth your acceptance  there is a destiny now possible to usthe highest ever set before a nation to be accepted or refused we are still undegenerate in race a race mingled of the best northern blood we are not yet dissolute in temper but still have the firmness to govern and the grace to obey we have been taught a religion of pure mercy which we must either now finally betray or learn to defend by fulfilling and we are rich in an inheritance of honour bequeathed to us through a thousand years of noble history which it should be our daily thirst to increase with splendid avarice so that englishmen if it be a sin to covet honour should be the most offending souls alive within the last few years we have had the laws of natural science opened to us with a rapidity which has been blinding by its brightness and means of transit and communication given to us which have made but one kingdom of the habitable globe  one kingdombut who is to be its king is there to be no king in it think you and every man to do that which is right in his own eyes or only kings of terror and the obscene empires of mammon and belial or will you youths of england make your country again a royal throne of kings a sceptred isle for all the world a source of light a centre of peace mistress of learning and of the artsfaithful guardian of great memories in the midst of irreverent and ephemeral visionsfaithful servant of timetried principles under temptation from fond experiments and licentious desires and amidst the cruel and clamorous jealousies of the nations worshipped in her strange valour of goodwill towards men  the fifteen years that have passed since i spoke these words must i think have convinced some of my immediate hearers that the need for such an appeal was more pressing than they then imaginedwhile they have also more and more convinced me myself that the ground i took for it was secure and that the youths and girls now entering on the duties of active life are able to accept and fulfil the hope i then held out to them  in which assurance i ask them today to begin the examination with me very earnestly of the question laid before you in that seventh of my last years lectures whether london as it is now be indeed the natural and therefore the heavenappointed outgrowth of the inhabitation these 1800 years of the valley of the thames by a progressively instructed and disciplined people or if not in what measure and manner the aspect and spirit of the great city may be possibly altered by your acts and thoughts  in my introduction to the economist of xenophon i said that every fairly educated european boy or girl ought to learn the history of five citiesathens rome venice florence and london that of london including or at least compelling in parallel study knowledge also of the history of paris  a few words are enough to explain the reasons for this choice the history of athens rightly told includes all that need be known of greek religion and arts that of rome the victory of christianity over paganism those of venice and florence sum the essential facts respecting the christian arts of painting sculpture and music and that of london in her sisterhood with paris the development of christian chivalry and philosophy with their exponent art of gothic architecture  without the presumption of forming a distinct design i yet hoped at the time when this division of study was suggested with the help of my pupils to give the outlines of their several histories during my work in oxford variously disappointed and arrested alike by difficulties of investigation and failure of strength i may yet hope to lay down for you beginning with your own metropolis some of the lines of thought in following out which such a task might be most effectively accomplished  you observe that i speak of architecture as the chief exponent of the feelings both of the french and english races together with it however most important evidence of character is given by the illumination of manuscripts and by some forms of jewellery and metallurgy and my purpose in this course of lectures is to illustrate by all these arts the phases of national character which it is impossible that historians should estimate or even observe with accuracy unless they are cognizant of excellence in the aforesaid modes of structural and ornamental craftsmanship  in one respect as indicated by the title chosen for this course i have varied the treatment of their subject from that adopted in all my former books hitherto i have always endeavoured to illustrate the personal temper and skill of the artist holding the wishes or taste of his spectators at small account and saying of turner you ought to like him and of salvator you ought not etc etc without in the least considering what the genius or instinct of the spectator might otherwise demand or approve but in the now attempted sketch of christian history i have approached every question from the peoples side and examined the nature not of the special faculties by which the work was produced but of the general instinct by which it was asked for and enjoyed therefore i thought the proper heading for these papers should represent them as descriptive of the pleasures of england rather than of its arts  and of these pleasures necessarily the leading one was that of learning in the sense of receiving instructiona pleasure totally separate from that of finding out things for yourselfand an extremely sweet and sacred pleasure when you know how to seek it and receive  on which i am the more disposed and even compelled here to insist because your modern ideas of development imply that you must all turn out what you are to be and find out what you are to know for yourselves by the inevitable operation of your anterior affinities and inner conscienceswhereas the old idea of education was that the baby material of you however accidentally or inevitably born was at least to be by external force and ancestral knowledge bred and treated by its fathers and tutors as a plastic vase to be shaped or mannered as they chose not as it chose and filled when its form was well finished and baked with sweetness of sound doctrine as with hybla honey or arabian spikenard  without debating how far these two modes of acquiring knowledgefinding out and being toldmay severally be good and in perfect instruction combined i have to point out to you that broadly athens rome and florence are selftaught and internally developed while all the gothic races without any exception but especially those of london and paris are afterwards taught by these and had therefore when they chose to accept it the delight of being instructed without trouble or doubt as fast as they could read or imitate and brought forward to the point where their own northern instincts might wholesomely superimpose or graft some national ideas upon these sound instructions read over what i said on this subject in the third of my lectures last year page 79 and simplify that already brief statement further by fastening in your mind carlyles general symbol of the best attainments of northern religious sculpturethree whalecubs combined by boiling and reflecting that the mental history of all northern european art is the modification of that graceful type under the orders of the athena of homer and phidias  and this being quite indisputably the broad fact of the matter i greatly marvel that your historians never so far as i have read think of proposing to you the questionwhat you might have made of yourselves without the help of homer and phidias what sort of beings the saxon and the celt the frank and the dane might have been by this time untouched by the spear of pallas unruled by the rod of agricola and sincerely the native growth pure of root and ungrafted in fruit of the clay of isis rock of dovrefeldt and sands of elbe think of it and think chiefly what form the ideas and images of your natural religion might probably have taken if no roman missionary had ever passed the alps in charity and no english king in pilgrimage  i have been of late indebted more than i can express to the friend who has honoured me by the dedication of his recently published lectures on older england and whose eager enthusiasm and far collected learning have enabled me for the first time to assign their just meaning and value to the ritual and imagery of saxon devotion but while every page of mr hodgetts book and i may gratefully say also every sentence of his teaching has increased and justified the respect in which i have always been by my own feeling disposed to hold the mythologies founded on the love and knowledge of the natural world i have also been led by them to conceive far more forcibly than hitherto the power which the story of christianity possessed first heard through the wreaths of that cloudy superstition in the substitution for its vaporescent allegory of a positive and literal account of a real creation and an instantly present omnipresent and compassionate god  observe there is no question whatever in examining this influence how far christianity itself is true or the transcendental doctrines of it intelligible those who brought you the story of it believed it with all their souls to be trueand the effect of it on the hearts of your ancestors was that of an unquestionable infinitely lucid message straight from god doing away with all difficulties grief and fears for those who willingly received it nor by any except wilfully and obstinately vile persons to be by any possibility denied or refused  and it was precisely observe the vivacity and joy with which the main fact of christs life was accepted which gave the force and wrath to the controversies instantly arising about its nature  those controversies vexed and shook but never undermined the faith they strove to purify and the miraculous presence errorless precept and loving promises of their lord were alike undoubted alike rejoiced in by every nation that heard the word of apostles the pelagians assertion that immortality could be won by mans will and the arians that christ possessed no more than mans nature never for an instantor in any countryhindered the advance of the moral law and intellectual hope of christianity far the contrary the british heresy concerning free will though it brought bishop after bishop into england to extinguish it remained an extremely healthy and active element in the british mind down to the days of john bunyan and the guide great heart and the calmly christian justice and simple human virtue of theodoric were the very roots and first burgeons of the regeneration of italy1 but of the degrees in which it was possible for any barbarous nation to receive during the first five centuries either the spiritual power of christianity itself or the instruction in classic art and science which accompanied it you cannot rightly judge without taking the pains and they will not i think be irksome of noticing carefully and fixing permanently in your minds the separating characteristics of the greater races both in those who learned and those who taught  footnote 1 gibbon in his 37th chapter makes ulphilas also an arian but might have forborne with grace his own definition of orthodoxyand you are to observe generally that at this time the teachers who admitted the inferiority of christ to the father as touching his manhood were often counted among arians but quite falsely christs own words my father is greater than i end that controversy at once arianism consists not in asserting the subjection of the son to the father but in denying the subjected divinity  of the huns and vandals we need not speak they are merely forms of punishment and destruction put them out of your minds altogether and remember only the names of the immortal nations which abide on their native rocks and plough their unconquered plains at this hour  briefly in the northbriton norman frank saxon ostrogoth lombard briefly in the southtuscan roman greek syrian egyptian arabian  now of these races the british i avoid the word celtic because you would expect me to say keltic and i dont mean to lest you should be wanting me next to call the patroness of music st kekilia the british including breton cornish welsh irish scot and pict are i believe of all the northern races the one which has deepest love of external natureand the richest inherent gift of pure music and song as such separated from the intellectual gift which raises song into poetry they are naturally also religious and for some centuries after their own conversion are one of the chief evangelizing powers in christendom but they are neither apprehensive nor receptivethey cannot understand the classic races and learn scarcely anything from them perhaps better so if the classic races had been more careful to understand them  next the norman is scarcely more apprehensive than the celt but he is more constructive and uses to good advantage what he learns from the frank his main characteristic is an energy which never exhausts itself in vain anger desire or sorrow but abides and rules like a living rockwhere he wanders he flows like lava and congeals like granite  next i take in this first sketch the saxon and frank together both preeminently apprehensive both docile exceedingly imaginative in the highest but in life active more than pensive eager in desire swift of invention keenly sensitive to animal beauty but with difficulty rational and rarely for the future wise under the conclusive name of ostrogoth you may class whatever tribes are native to central germany and develope themselves as time goes on into that power of the german cæsars which still asserts itself as an empire against the licence and insolence of modern republicanismof which races though this general name no description can be given in rapid terms  and lastly the lombards who at the time we have to deal with were sternly indocile gloomily imaginativeof almost norman energy and differing from all the other western nations chiefly in this notable particular that while the celt is capable of bright wit and happy play and the norman saxon and frank all alike delight in caricature the lombards like the arabians never jest  these briefly are the six barbaric nations who are to be taught and of whose native arts and faculties before they receive any tutorship from the south i find no wellsifted account in any historybut thus much of them collecting your own thoughts and knowledge you may easily discernthey were all with the exception of the scots practical workers and builders in wood and those of them who had coasts first rate seaboat builders with fine mathematical instincts and practice in that kind far developed necessarily good sailweaving and sound furstitching with stout ironwork of nail and rivet rich copper and some silver work in decorationthe celts developing peculiar gifts in linear design but wholly incapable of drawing animals or figuresthe saxons and franks having enough capacity in that kind but no thought of attempting it the normans and lombards still farther remote from any such skill more and more it seems to me wonderful that under your british blocktemple grimly extant on its pastoral plain or beside the first crosses engraved on the rock at whithornyou english and scots do not oftener consider what you might or could have come to left to yourselves  next let us form the list of your tutor nations in whom it generally pleases you to look at nothing but the corruptions if we could get into the habit of thinking more of our own corruptions and more of their virtues we should have a better chance of learning the true laws alike of art and destiny but the safest way of all is to assure ourselves that true knowledge of any thing or any creature is only of the good of it that its nature and life are in that and that what is diseasedthat is to say unnatural and mortalyou must cut away from it in contemplation as you would in surgery  of the six tutor nations two the tuscan and arab have no effect on early christian england but the roman greek syrian and egyptian act together from the earliest times you are to study the influence of rome upon england in agricola constantius st benedict and st gregory of greece upon england in the artists of byzantium and ravenna of syria and egypt upon england in st jerome st augustine st chrysostom and st athanase  st jerome in central bethlehem st augustine carthaginian by birth in truth a converted tyrian athanase egyptian symmetric and fixed as an egyptian aisle chrysostom golden mouth of all these are indeed every one teachers of all the western world but st augustine especially of lay as distinguished from monastic christianity to the franks and finally to us his rule expanded into the treatise of the city of god is taken for guide of life and policy by charlemagne and becomes certainly the fountain of evangelical christianity distinctively so called and broadly the lay christianity of europe since in the purest form of it that is to say the most merciful charitable variously applicable kindly wise the greatest type of it as far as i know st martin of tours whose character is sketched i think in the main rightly in the bible of amiens and you may bind together your thoughts of its course by remembering that alcuin born at york dies in the abbey of st martin at tours that as st augustine was in his writings charlemagnes evangelist in faith alcuin was in living presence his master in rhetoric logic and astronomy with the other physical sciences  a hundred years later than st augustine comes the rule of st benedictthe monastic rule virtually of european christianity ever sinceand theologically the law of works as distinguished from the law of faith st augustine and all the disciples of st augustine tell christians what they should feel and think st benedict and all the disciples of st benedict tell christians what they should say and do  in the briefest but also the perfectest distinction the disciples of st augustine are those who open the door to christif any man hear my voice but the benedictines those to whom christ opens the doorto him that knocketh it shall be opened  now note broadly the course and action of this rule as it combines with the older one st augustines accepted heartily by clovis and with various degrees of understanding by the kings and queens of the merovingian dynasty makes seemingly little difference in their conduct so that their profession of it remains a scandal to christianity to this day and yet it lives in the true hearts among them down from st clotilde to her great granddaughter bertha who in becoming queen of kent builds under its chalk downs her own little chapel to st martin and is the first effectively and permanently useful missionary to the saxons the beginner of english eruditionthe first laid corner stone of beautiful english character  i think henceforward you will find the memorandum of dates which i have here set down for my own guidance more simply useful than those confused by record of unimportant persons and inconsequent events which form the indices of common history  from the year of the saxon invasion 449 there are exactly 400 years to the birth of alfred 849 you have no difficulty in remembering those cardinal years then you have four great men and great events to remember at the close of the fifth century clovis and the founding of frank kingdom theodoric and the founding of the gothic kingdom justinian and the founding of civil law st benedict and the founding of religious law  of justinian and his work i am not able myself to form any opinionand it is i think unnecessary for students of history to form any until they are able to estimate clearly the benefits and mischief of the civil law of europe in its present state but to clovis theodoric and st benedict without any question we owe more than any english historian has yet ascribedand they are easily held in mind together for clovis ascended the frank throne in the year of st benedicts birth 481 theodoric fought the battle of verona and founded the ostrogothic kingdom in italy twelve years later in 493 and thereupon married the sister of clovis that marriage is always passed in a casual sentence as if a merely political one and while page after page is spent in following the alternations of furious crime and fatal chance in the contests between fredegonde and brunehaut no historian ever considers whether the great ostrogoth who wore in the battle of verona the dress which his mother had woven for him was likely to have chosen a wife without loveor how far the perfectness justice and temperate wisdom of every ordinance of his reign was owing to the sympathy and counsel of his frankish queen  you have to recollect then thus far only three cardinal dates    449 saxon invasion   481 clovis reigns and st benedict is born   493 theodoric conquers at verona  then roughly a hundred years later in 590 ethelbert the fifth from hengist and bertha the third from clotilde are king and queen of kent i cannot find the date of their marriage but the date 590 which you must recollect for cardinal is that of gregorys accession to the pontificate and i believe bertha was then in middle life having persevered in her religion firmly but inoffensively and made herself beloved by her husband and people she in england theodolinda in lombardy and st gregory in romein their hands virtually lay the destiny of europe  then the period from bertha to osburga 590 to 849say 250 yearsis passed by the saxon people in the daily more reverent learning of the christian faith and daily more peaceful and skilful practice of the humane arts and duties which it invented and inculcated  the statement given by sir edward creasy of the result of these 250 years of lesson is with one correction the most simple and just that i can find  a few years before the close of the sixth century the country was little more than a wide battlefield where gallant but rude warriors fought with each other or against the neighbouring welsh or scots unheeding and unheeded by the rest of europe or if they attracted casual attention regarded with dread and disgust as the fiercest of barbarians and the most untameable of pagans in the eighth century england was looked up to with admiration and gratitude as superior to all the other countries of western europe in piety and learning and as the land whence the most zealous and successful saints and teachers came forth to convert and enlighten the still barbarous regions of the continent  this statement is broadly true yet the correction it needs is a very important one englandunder her first alfred of northumberland and under ina of wessex is indeed during these centuries the most learned thoughtful and progressive of european states but she is not a missionary power the missionaries are always to her not from herfor the very reason that she is learning so eagerly she does not take to preaching ina founds his saxon school at rome not to teach rome nor convert the pope but to drink at the source of knowledge and to receive laws from direct and unquestioned authority the missionary power was wholly scotch and irish and that power was wholly one of zeal and faith not of learning i will ask you in the course of my next lecture to regard it attentively today i must rapidly draw to the conclusions i would leave with you  it is more and more wonderful to me as i think of it that no effect whatever was produced on the saxon nor on any other healthy race of the north either by the luxury of rome or by her art whether constructive or imitative the saxon builds no aqueductsdesigns no roads rounds no theatres in imitation of herenvies none of her vile pleasuresadmires so far as i can judge none of her farcarried realistic art i suppose that it needs intelligence of a more advanced kind to see the qualities of complete sculpture and that we may think of the northern intellect as still like that of a child who cares to picture its own thoughts in its own way but does not care for the thoughts of older people or attempt to copy what it feels too difficult this much at least is certain that for one cause or another everything that now at paris or london our painters most care for and try to realize of ancient rome was utterly innocuous and unattractive to the saxon while his mind was frankly open to the direct teaching of greece and to the methods of bright decoration employed in the byzantine empire for these alone seemed to his fancy suggestive of the glories of the brighter world promised by christianity jewellery vessels of gold and silver beautifully written books and music are the gifts of st gregory alike to the saxon and lombard all these beautiful things being used not for the pleasure of the present life but as the symbols of another while the drawings in saxon manuscripts in which better than in any other remains of their life we can read the peoples character are rapid endeavours to express for themselves and convey to others some likeness of the realities of sacred event in which they had been instructed they differ from every archaic school of former design in this evident correspondence with an imagined reality all previous archaic art whatsoever is symbolic and decorativenot realistic the contest of herakles with the hydra on a greek vase is a mere sign that such a contest took place not a picture of it and in drawing that sign the potter is always thinking of the effect of the engraved lines on the curves of his pot and taking care to keep out of the way of the handlebut a saxon monk would scratch his idea of the fall of the angels or the temptation of christ over a whole page of his manuscript in variously explanatory scenes evidently full of inexpressible vision and eager to explain and illustrate all that he felt or believed  of the progress and arrest of these gifts i shall have to speak in my next address but i must regretfully conclude today with some brief warning against the complacency which might lead you to regard them as either at that time entirely original in the saxon race or at the present day as signally characteristic of it that form of complacency is exhibited in its most amiable but therefore most deceptive guise in the passage with which the late dean of westminster concluded his lecture at canterbury in april 1854 on the subject of the landing of augustine i will not spoil the emphasis of the passage by comment as i read but must take leave afterwards to intimate some grounds for abatement in the fervour of its selfgratulatory ecstasy  let any one sit on the hill of the little church of st martin and look on the view which is there spread before his eyes immediately below are the towers of the great abbey of st augustine where christian learning and civilization first struck root in the anglosaxon race and within which now after a lapse of many centuries a new institution has arisen intended to carry far and wide to countries of which gregory and augustine never heard the blessings which they gave to us carry your view onand there rises high above all the magnificent pile of our cathedral equal in splendour and state to any the noblest temple or church that augustine could have seen in ancient rome rising on the very ground which derives its consecration from him and still more than the grandeur of the outward buildings that rose from the little church of augustine and the little palace of ethelbert have been the institutions of all kinds of which these were the earliest cradle from canterbury the first english christian cityfrom kent the first english christian kingdomhas by degrees arisen the whole constitution of church and state in england which now binds together the whole british empire and from the christianity here established in england has flowed by direct consequence first the christianity of germany then after a long interval of north america and lastly we may trust in time of all india and all australasia the view from st martins church is indeed one of the most inspiriting that can be found in the world there is none to which i would more willingly take any one who doubted whether a small beginning could lead to a great and lasting goodnone which carries us more vividly back into the past or more hopefully forward into the future  to this gregorian canticle in praise of the british constitution i grieve but am compelled to take these following historical objections the first missionary to germany was ulphilas and what she owes to these islands she owes to iona not to thanet our missionary offices to america as to africa consist i believe principally in the stealing of land and the extermination of its proprietors by intoxication our rule in india has introduced there paisley instead of cashmere shawls in australasia our christian aid supplies i suppose the pious farmer with convict labour and although when the dean wrote the above passage st augustines and the cathedral werei take it on trust from his descriptionthe principal objects in the prospect from st martins hill i believe even the cheerfullest of my audience would not now think the scene one of the most inspiriting in the world for recent progress has entirely accommodated the architecture of the scene to the convenience of the missionary workers above enumerated to the peculiar necessities of the civilization they have achieved for the sake of which the cathedral the monastery the temple and the tomb of bertha contract themselves in distant or despised subservience under the colossal walls of the county gaol     lecture ii  the pleasures of faith  alfred to the confessor   i was forced in my last lecture to pass by altogether and today can only with momentary definition notice the part taken by scottish missionaries in the christianizing of england and burgundy i would pray you therefore in order to fill the gap which i think it better to leave distinctly than close confusedly to read the histories of st patrick st columba and st columban as they are given you by montalembert in his moines doccident you will find in his pages all the essential facts that are known encircled with a nimbus of enthusiastic sympathy which i hope you will like better to see them through than distorted by blackening fog of contemptuous rationalism but although i ask you thus to make yourselves aware of the greatness of my omission i must also certify you that it does not break the unity of our own immediate subject the influence of celtic passion and art both on northumbria and the continent beneficent in all respects while it lasted expired without any permanent share in the work or emotion of the saxon and frank the book of kells and the bell of st patrick represent sufficiently the peculiar character of celtic design and long since in the first lecture of the two paths i explained both the modes of skill and points of weakness which rendered such design unprogressive perfect in its peculiar manner and exulting in the faultless practice of a narrow skill it remained century after century incapable alike of inner growth or foreign instruction inimitable yet incorrigible marvellous yet despicable to its death despicable i mean only in the limitation of its capacity not in its quality or nature if you make a christian of a lamb or a squirrelwhat can you expect of the lamb but jumpingwhat of the squirrel but pretty spirals traced with his tail he wont steal your nuts any more and hell say his prayers like this2 but you cannot make a beatrices griffin and emblem of all the catholic church out of him  footnote 2 making a sign  you will have observed also that the plan of these lectures does not include any reference to the roman period in england of which you will find all i think necessary to say in the part called valle crucis of our fathers have told us but i must here warn you with reference to it of one gravely false prejudice of montalembert he is entirely blind to the conditions of roman virtue which existed in the midst of the corruptions of the empire forming the characters of such emperors as pertinax carus probus the second claudius aurelian and our own constantius and he denies with abusive violence the power for good of roman law over the gauls and britons  respecting roman national character i will simply beg you to remember that both st benedict and st gregory are roman patricians before they are either monk or pope respecting its influence on britain i think you may rest content with shakespeares estimate of it both lear and cymbeline belong to this time so difficult to our apprehension when the briton accepted both roman laws and roman gods there is indeed the born kentish gentlemans protest against them in kents              now by apollo king   thou swearst thy gods in vain  but both cordelia and imogen are just as thoroughly roman ladies as virgilia or calphurnia  of british christianity and the arthurian legends i shall have a word or two to say in my lecture on fancy in connection with the similar romance which surrounds theodoric and charlemagne only the worst of it is that while both dietrich and karl are themselves more wonderful than the legends of them arthur fades into intangible visionthis much however remains to this day of arthurian blood in us that the richest fighting element in the british army and navy is british nativethat is to say highlander irish welsh and cornish  content therefore means being now given you for filling gaps with the estimates given you in the preceding lecture of the sources of instruction possessed by the saxon capital i pursue today our question originally proposed what london might have been by this time if the nature of the flowers trees and children born at the thamesside had been rightly understood and cultivated  many of my hearers can imagine far better than i the look that london must have had in alfreds and canutes days3 i have not indeed the least idea myself what its buildings were like but certainly the groups of its shipping must have been superb small but entirely seaworthy vessels manned by the best seamen in the then world of course now at chatham and portsmouth we have our ironcladsextremely beautiful and beautifully manageable things no doubtto set against this saxon and danish shipping but the saxon warships lay here at london shorebright with banner and shield and dragon prowinstead of these you may be happier but are not handsomer in having now the coalbarge the penny steamer and the wherry full of shop boys and girls i dwell however for a moment only on the naval aspect of the tidal waters in the days of alfred because i can refer you for all detail on this part of our subject to the wonderful opening chapter of dean stanleys history of westminster abbey where you will find the origin of the name of london given as the city of ships he does not however tell you that there were built then and there the biggest warships in the world i have often said to friends who praised my own books that i would rather have written that chapter than any one of them yet if i had been able to write the historical part of it the conclusions drawn would have been extremely different the dean indeed describes with a poets joy the river of wells which rose from those once consecrated springs which now lie choked in holywell and clerkenwell and the rivulet of ulebrig which crossed the strand under the ivy bridge but it is only in the spirit of a modern citizen of belgravia that he exults in the fact that the great arteries of our crowded streets the vast sewers which cleanse our habitations are fed by the lifeblood of those old and living streams that underneath our tread the tyburn and the holborn and the fleet and the wall brook are still pursuing their ceaseless course still ministering to the good of man though in a far different fashion than when druids drank of their sacred springs and saxons were baptized in their rushing waters ages ago  footnote 3 here alfreds silver penny was shown and commented on thusof what london was like in the days of faith i can show you one piece of artistic evidence it is alfreds silver penny struck in london mint the character of a coinage is quite conclusive evidence in national history and there is no great empire in progress but tells its story in beautiful coins here in alfreds penny a round coin with londinia struck on it you have just the same beauty of design the same enigmatical arrangement of letters as in the early inscription which it is the pride of my life to have discovered at venice this inscription the first words that venice ever speaks aloud is it will be remembered on the church of st giacomo di rialto and runs being interpretedaround this temple let the merchants law be just his weights true and his covenants faithful  whatever sympathy you may feel with these eloquent expressions of that entire complacency in the present past and future which peculiarly animates dean stanleys writings i must in this case pray you to observe that the transmutation of holy wells into sewers has at least destroyed the charm and utility of the thames as a salmon stream and i must ask you to read with attention the succeeding portions of the chapter which record the legends of the river fisheries in their relation to the first abbey of westminster dedicated by its builders to st peter not merely in his office of cornerstone of the church nor even figuratively as a fisher of men but directly as a fisher of fishand which maintained themselves you will see in actual ceremony down to 1382 when a fisherman still annually took his place beside the prior after having brought in a salmon for st peter which was carried in state down the middle of the refectory  but as i refer to this page for the exact word my eye is caught by one of the sentences of londonian4 thought which constantly pervert the wellmeant books of pious england we see also says the dean the union of innocent fiction with worldly craft which marks so many of the legends both of pagan and christian times i might simply reply to this insinuation that times which have no legends differ from the legendary ones merely by uniting guilty instead of innocent fiction with worldly craft but i must farther advise you that the legends of these passionate times are in no wise and in no sense fiction at all but the true record of impressions made on the minds of persons in a state of eager spiritual excitement brought into bright focus by acting steadily and frankly under its impulses i could tell you a great deal more about such things than you would believe and therefore a great deal more than it would do you the least good to hearbut this much any who care to use their common sense modestly cannot but admit that unless they choose to try the rough life of the christian ages they cannot understand its practical consequences you have all been taught by lord macaulay and his school that because you have carpets instead of rushes for your feet and featherbeds instead of fern for your backs and kickshaws instead of beef for your eating and drains instead of holy wells for your drinkingthat therefore you are the cream of creation and every one of you a sevenheaded solomon stay in those pleasant circumstances and convictions if you please but dont accuse your roughly bred and fed fathers of telling lies about the aspect the earth and sky bore to themtill you have trodden the earth as they barefoot and seen the heavens as they face to face if you care to see and to know for yourselves you may do it with little pains you need not do any great thing you neednt keep one eye open and the other shut for ten years over a microscope nor fight your way through icebergs and darkness to knowledge of the celestial pole simply do as much as king after king of the saxons didput rough shoes on your feet and a rough cloak on your shoulders and walk to rome and back sleep by the roadside when it is finein the first outhouse you can find when it is wet and live on bread and water with an onion or two all the way and if the experiences which you will have to relate on your return do not as may well be deserve the name of spiritual at all events you will not be disposed to let other people regard them either as poetry or fiction  footnote 4 not londinian  with this warning presently to be at greater length insisted on i trace for you in dean stanleys words which cannot be bettered except in the collection of their more earnest passages from among his interludes of graceful but dangerous qualificationi trace with only such omission the story he has told us of the foundation of that abbey which he tells you was the mother of london and has ever been the shrine and the throne of english faith and truth  the gradual formation of a monastic body indicated in the charters of offa and edgar marks the spread of the benedictine order throughout england under the influence of dunstan the terror of the spot which had still been its chief characteristic in the charter of the wild offa had in the days of the more peaceful edgar given way to a dubious renown twelve monks is the number traditionally said to have been established by dunstan a few acres further up the river formed their chief property and their monastic character was sufficiently recognized to have given to the old locality of the terrible place the name of the western monastery or minster of the west  the benedictines thentwelve benedictine monksthus begin the building of existent christian london you know i told you the benedictines are the doing people as the disciples of st augustine the sentimental people the benedictines find no terror in their own thoughtsface the terror of placeschange it into beauty of placesmake this terrible place a motherly placemother of london  this first westminster however the dean goes on to say seems to have been overrun by the danes and it would have had no further history but for the combination of circumstances which directed hither the notice of edward the confessor  i havent time to read you all the combination of circumstances the last clinching circumstance was this  there was in the neighbourhood of worcester far from men in the wilderness on the slope of a wood in a cave deep down in the grey rock a holy hermit of great age living on fruits and roots one night when after reading in the scriptures how hard are the pains of hell and how the enduring life of heaven is sweet and to be desired he could neither sleep nor repose st peter appeared to him bright and beautiful like to a clerk and warned him to tell the king that he was released from his vow that on that very day his messengers would return from rome that is the combination of circumstancesbringing popes order to build a church to release the king from his vow of pilgrimage that at thorney two leagues from the city was the spot marked out where in an ancient church situated low he was to establish a perfect benedictine monastery which should be the gate of heaven the ladder of prayer whence those who serve st peter there shall by him be admitted into paradise the hermit writes the account of the vision on parchment seals it with wax and brings it to the king who compares it with the answer of the messengers just arrived from rome and determines on carrying out the design as the apostle had ordered  the ancient church situated low indicated in this vision the one whose attached monastery had been destroyed by the danes but its little church remained and was already dear to the confessor not only from the lovely tradition of its dedication by the spirit of st peter you must read that for yourselves but also because of two miracles happening there to the king himself  the first was the cure of a cripple who sat in the road between the palace and the chapel of st peter which was near and who explained to the chamberlain hugolin that after six pilgrimages to rome in vain st peter had promised his cure if the king would on his own royal neck carry him to the monastery the king immediately consented and amidst the scoffs of the court bore the poor man to the steps of the high altar there the cripple was received by godric the sacristan and walked away on his own restored feet hanging his stool on the wall for a trophy  before that same high altar was also believed to have been seen one of the eucharistical portents so frequent in the middle ages a child pure and bright like a spirit appeared to the king in the sacramental elements leofric earl of mercia who with his famous countess godiva was present saw it also  such as these were the motives of edward under their influence was fixed what has ever since been the local centre of the english monarchy  such as these were the motives of edward says the dean yes certainly but such as these also first were the acts and visions of edward take care that you dont slip away by the help of the glycerine of the word motives into fancying that all these tales are only the after colours and pictorial metaphors of sentimental piety they are either plain truth or black lies take your choicebut dont tickle and treat yourselves with the prettiness or the grotesqueness of them as if they were anderssens fairy tales either the king did carry the beggar on his back or he didnt either godiva rode through coventry or she didnt either the earl leofric saw the vision of the bright child at the altaror he lied like a knave judge as you will but do not doubt  the abbey was fifteen years in building the king spent upon it onetenth of the property of the kingdom it was to be a marvel of its kind as in its origin it bore the traces of the fantastic and childish i must pause to ask you to substitute for these blameful terms fantastic and childish the better ones of imaginative and pure character of the king and of the age in its architecture it bore the stamp of the peculiar position which edward occupied in english history between saxon and norman by birth he was a saxon but in all else he was a foreigner accordingly the church at westminster was a widesweeping innovation on all that had been seen before destroying the old building he says in his charter i have built up a new one from the very foundation its fame as a new style of composition lingered in the minds of men for generations it was the first cruciform church in england from which all the rest of like shape were copiedan expression of the increasing hold which in the tenth century the idea of the crucifixion had laid on the imagination of europe the massive roof and pillars formed a contrast with the rude wooden rafters and beams of the common saxon churches its very sizeoccupying as it did almost the whole area of the present buildingwas in itself portentous the deep foundations of large square blocks of grey stone were duly laid the east end was rounded into an apse a tower rose in the centre crowned by a cupola of wood at the western end were erected two smaller towers with five large bells the hard strong stones were richly sculptured the windows were filled with stained glass the roof was covered with lead the cloisters chapterhouse refectory dormitory the infirmary with its spacious chapel if not completed by edward were all begun and finished in the next generation on the same plan this structure venerable as it would be if it had lasted to our time has almost entirely vanished possibly one vast dark arch in the southern transept certainly the substructures of the dormitory with their huge pillars grand and regal at the bases and capitals the massive lowbrowed passage leading from the great cloister to little deans yard and some portions of the refectory and of the infirmary chapel remain as specimens of the work which astonished the last age of the anglosaxon and the first age of the norman monarchy  hitherto i have read to you with only supplemental comment but in the next following passage with which i close my series of extracts sentence after sentence occurs at which as i read i must raise my hand to mark it for following deprecation or denial  in the centre of westminster abbey thus lies its founder and such is the story of its foundation even apart from the legendary elements in which it is involved it is impossible not to be struck by the fantastic character of all its circumstances we seem to be in a world of poetry i protest no edward is four centuries later than ethelbert and augustine but the origin of canterbury is commonplace and prosaic compared with the origin of westminster yes thats true we can hardly imagine a figure more incongruous to the soberness of later times than the quaint irresolute wayward prince whose chief characteristics have just been described his titles of confessor and saint belong not to the general instincts of christendom but to the most transitory feelings of the age i protest no his opinions his prevailing motives were such as in no part of modern europe would now be shared by any educated teacher or ruler thats true enough but in spite of these irreconcilable differences there was a solid ground for the charm which he exercised over his contemporaries his childish and eccentric fancies have passed away i protest no but his innocent faith and his sympathy with his people are qualities which even in our altered times may still retain their place in the economy of the world westminster abbey so we hear it said sometimes with a cynical sneer sometimes with a timorous scruple has admitted within its walls many who have been great without being good noble with a nobleness of the earth earthy worldly with the wisdom of this world but it is a counterbalancing reflection that the central tomb round which all those famous names have clustered contains the ashes of one who weak and erring as he was rests his claims of interment here not on any act of power or fame but only on his artless piety and simple goodness he towards whose dust was attracted the fierce norman and the proud plantagenet and the grasping tudor and the fickle stuart even the independent oliver the dutch william and the hanoverian george was one whose humble graces are within the reach of every man woman and child of every time if we rightly part the immortal substance from the perishable form  now i have read you these passages from dean stanley as the most accurately investigatory the most generously sympathetic the most reverently acceptant account of these days and their people which you can yet find in any english history but consider now point by point where it leaves you you are told first that you are living in an age of poetry but the days of poetry are those of shakespeare and milton not of bede nay for their especial wealth in melodious theology and beautifully rhythmic and pathetic meditation perhaps the days which have given us hiawatha in memoriam the christian year and the souls diary of george macdonald may be not with disgrace compared with those of caedmon and nothing can be farther different from the temper nothing less conscious of the effort of a poet than any finally authentic document to which you can be referred for the relation of a saxon miracle  i will read you for a perfectly typical example an account of one from bedes life of st cuthbert the passage is a favourite one of my own but i do not in the least anticipate its producing upon you the solemnizing effect which i think i could command from reading instead a piece of marmion manfred or childe harold   he had one day left his cell to give advice to some visitors and when he had finished he said to them i must now go in again but do you as you are inclined to depart first take food and when you have cooked and eaten that goose which is hanging on the wall go on board your vessel in gods name and return home he then uttered a prayer and having blessed them went in but they as he had bidden them took some food but having enough provisions of their own which they had brought with them they did not touch the goose  but when they had refreshed themselves they tried to go on board their vessel but a sudden storm utterly prevented them from putting to sea they were thus detained seven days in the island by the roughness of the waves and yet they could not call to mind what fault they had committed they therefore returned to have an interview with the holy father and to lament to him their detention he exhorted them to be patient and on the seventh day came out to console their sorrow and to give them pious exhortations when however he had entered the house in which they were stopping and saw that the goose was not eaten he reproved their disobedience with mild countenance and in gentle language have you not left the goose still hanging in its place what wonder is it that the storm has prevented your departure put it immediately into the caldron and boil and eat it that the sea may become tranquil and you may return home  they immediately did as he commanded and it happened most wonderfully that the moment the kettle began to boil the wind began to cease and the waves to be still having finished their repast and seeing that the sea was calm they went on board and to their great delight though with shame for their neglect reached home with a fair wind now this as i have related i did not pick up from any chance authority but i had it from one of those who were present a most reverend monk and priest of the same monastery cynemund who still lives known to many in the neighbourhood for his years and the purity of his life                                       i hope that the memory of this story which thinking it myself an extremely pretty one i have given you not only for a type of sincerity and simplicity but for an illustration of obedience may at all events quit you for good and all of the notion that the believers and witnesses of miracle were poetical persons saying no more on the head of that allegation i proceed to the deans second one which i cannot but interpret as also intended to be injuriousthat they were artless and childish ones and that because of this rudeness and puerility their motives and opinions would not be shared by any statesmen of the present day  it is perfectly true that edward the confessor was himself in many respects of really childish temperament not therefore perhaps as i before suggested to you less venerable but the age of which we are examining the progress was by no means represented or governed by men of similar disposition it was eminently productive ofit was altogether governed guided and instructed bymen of the widest and most brilliant faculties whether constructive or speculative that the world till then had seen men whose acts became the romance whose thoughts the wisdom and whose arts the treasure of a thousand years of futurity  i warned you at the close of last lecture against the too agreeable vanity of supposing that the evangelization of the world began at st martins canterbury again and again you will indeed find the stream of the gospel contracting itself into narrow channels and appearing after longconcealed filtration through veins of unmeasured rock with the bright resilience of a mountain spring but you will find it the only candid and therefore the only wise way of research to look in each era of christendom for the minds of culminating power in all its brotherhood of nations and careless of local impulse momentary zeal picturesque incident or vaunted miracle to fasten your attention upon the force of character in the men whom over each newlyconverted race heaven visibly sets for its shepherds and kings to bring forth judgment unto victory of these i will name to you as messengers of god and masters of men five monks and five kings in whose arms during the range of swiftly gainful centuries which we are following the life of the world lay as a nursling babe remember in their successive orderof monks st jerome st augustine st martin st benedict and st gregory of kingsand your national vanity may be surely enough appeased in recognizing two of them for saxontheodoric charlemagne alfred canute and the confessor i will read three passages to you out of the literal words of three of these ten men without saying whose they are that you may compare them with the best and most exalted you have read expressing the philosophy the religion and the policy of todayfrom which i admit with dean stanley but with a far different meaning from his that they are indeed separate for evermore i give you first for an example of philosophy a single sentence containing allso far as i can myself discernthat it is possible for us to know or well for us to believe respecting the world and its laws   of gods universal providence ruling all and comprising all  wherefore the great and mighty god he that made man a reasonable creature of soul and body and he that did neither let him pass unpunished for his sin nor yet excluded him from mercy he that gave both unto good and bad essence with the stones power of production with the trees senses with the beasts of the field and understanding with the angels he from whom is all being beauty form and number weight and measure he from whom all nature mean and excellent all seeds of form all forms of seed all motion both of forms and seeds derive and have being he that gave flesh the original beauty strength propagation form and shape health and symmetry he that gave the unreasonable soul sense memory and appetite the reasonable besides these fantasy understanding and will he i say having left neither heaven nor earth nor angel nor man no nor the most base and contemptible creature neither the birds feather nor the herbs flower nor the trees leaf without the true harmony of their parts and peaceful concord of compositionit is in no way credible that he would leave the kingdoms of men and their bondages and freedom loose and uncomprised in the laws of his eternal providence5  footnote 5 from st augustines citie of god book v ch xi english trans printed by george eld 1610  this for the philosophy6 next i take for example of the religion of our ancestors a prayer personally and passionately offered to the deity conceived as you have this moment heard  footnote 6 here one of the stones of westminster was shown and commented on  o thou who art the father of that son which has awakened us and yet urgeth us out of the sleep of our sins and exhorteth us that we become thine note you that for apprehension of what redemption means against your base and cowardly modern notion of scaping whipping not to take away the punishment of sin but by his resurrection to raise us out of the sleep of sin itself compare the legend at the feet of the lion of the tribe of judah in the golden gospel of charles le chauve7    hic leo surgendo portas confregit averni   qui nunquam dormit nusquam dormitat in Ævum  to thee lord i pray who art the supreme truth for all the truth that is is truth from thee thee i implore o lord who art the highest wisdom through thee are wise all those that are so thou art the true life and through thee are living all those that are so thou art the supreme felicity and from thee all have become happy that are so thou art the highest good and from thee all beauty springs thou art the intellectual light and from thee man derives his understanding  footnote 7 at munich the leaf has been exquisitely drawn and legend communicated to me by professor westwood it is written in gold on purple  to thee o god i call and speak hear o hear me lord for thou art my god and my lord my father and my creator my ruler and my hope my wealth and my honour my house my country my salvation and my life hear hear me o lord few of thy servants comprehend thee but thee alone i love8 indeed above all other things thee i seek thee i will follow thee i am ready to serve under thy power i desire to abide for thou alone art the sovereign of all i pray thee to command me as thou wilt  footnote 8 meaningnot that he is of those few but that without comprehending at least as a dog he can love  you see this prayer is simply the expansion of that clause of the lords prayer which most men eagerly omit from itfiat voluntas tua in being so it sums the christian prayer of all ages see now in the third place how far this kings letter i am going to read to you sums also christian policy      wherefore i render high thanks to almighty god for the happy     accomplishment of all the desires which i have set before me     and for the satisfying of my every wish      now therefore be it known to you all that to almighty god     himself i have on my knees devoted my life to the end that     in all things i may do justice and with justice and rightness     rule the kingdoms and peoples under me throughout everything     preserving an impartial judgment if heretofore i have     through being as young men are impulsive or careless done     anything unjust i mean with gods help to lose no time     in remedying my fault to which end i call to witness my     counsellors to whom i have entrusted the counsels of the     kingdom and i charge them that by no means be it through     fear of me or the favour of any other powerful personage to     consent to any injustice or to suffer any to shoot out in any     part of my kingdom i charge all my viscounts and those set     over my whole kingdom as they wish to keep my friendship or     their own safety to use no unjust force to any man rich or     poor let all men noble and not noble rich and poor alike     be able to obtain their rights under the laws justice and     from that law let there be no deviation either to favour the     king or any powerful person nor to raise money for me i have     no need of money raised by what is unfair i also would have     you know that i go now to make peace and firm treaty by the     counsels of all my subjects with those nations and people who     wished had it been possible for them to do so which it was     not to deprive us alike of kingdom and of life god brought     down their strength to nought and may he of his benign love     preserve us on our throne and in honour lastly when i have     made peace with the neighbouring nations and settled and     pacified all my dominions in the east so that we may nowhere     have any war or enmity to fear i mean to come to england this     summer as soon as i can fit out vessels to sail my reason     however in sending this letter first is to let all the people     of my kingdom share in the joy of my welfare for as you     yourselves know i have never spared myself or my labour nor     will i ever do so where my people are really in want of some     good that i can do them  what think you now in candour and honour you youth of the latter dayswhat think you of these types of the thought devotion and government which not in words but pregnant and perpetual fact animated these which you have been accustomed to call the dark ages  the philosophy is augustines the prayer alfreds and the letter canutes  and whatever you may feel respecting the beauty or wisdom of these sayings be assured of one thing above all that they are sincere and of another less often observed that they are joyful  be assured in the first place that they are sincere the ideas of diplomacy and priestcraft are of recent times no false knight or lying priest ever prospered i believe in any age but certainly not in the dark ones men prospered then only in following openlydeclared purposes and preaching candidly beloved and trusted creeds  and that they did so prosper in the degree in which they accepted and proclaimed the christian gospel may be seen by any of you in your historical reading however partial if only you will admit the idea that it could be so and was likely to be so you are all of you in the habit of supposing that temporal prosperity is owing either to worldly chance or to worldly prudence and is never granted in any visible relation to states of religious temper put that treacherous doubt away from you with disdain take for basis of reasoning the noble postulate that the elements of christian faith are soundinstead of the base one that they are deceptive reread the great story of the world in that light and see what a vividly real yet miraculous tenor it will then bear to you  their faith then i tell you first was sincere i tell you secondly that it was in a degree few of us can now conceive joyful we continually hear of the trials sometimes of the victories of faithbut scarcely ever of its pleasures whereas at this time you will find that the chief delight of all good men was in the recognition of the goodness and wisdom of the master who had come to dwell with them upon earth it is almost impossible for you to conceive the vividness of this sense in them it is totally impossible for you to conceive the comfort peace and force of it in everything that you now do or seek you expose yourselves to countless miseries of shame and disappointment because in your doing you depend on nothing but your own powers and in seeking choose only your own gratification you cannot for the most part conceive of any work but for your own interests or the interests of others about whom you are anxious in the same faithless way everything about which passion is excited in you or skill exerted is some object of material life and the idea of doing anything except for your own praise or profit has narrowed itself into little more than the precentors invitation to the company with little voice and less practice to sing to the praise and glory of god  i have said that you cannot imagine the feeling of the energy of daily life applied in the real meaning of those words you cannot imagine it but you can prove it are any of you willing simply as a philosophical experiment in the greatest of sciences to adopt the principles and feelings of these men of a thousand years ago for a given time say for a year it cannot possibly do you any harm to try and you cannot possibly learn what is true in these things without trying if after a years experience of such method you find yourself no happier than before at least you will be able to support your present opinions at once with more grace and more modesty having conceded the trial it asked for to the opposite side nor in acting temporarily on a faith you do not see to be reasonable do you compromise your own integrity more than in conducting under a chemists directions an experiment of which he foretells inexplicable consequences and you need not doubt the power you possess over your own minds to do this were faith not voluntary it could not be praised and would not be rewarded  if you are minded thus to try begin each day with alfreds prayerfiat voluntas tua resolving that you will stand to it and that nothing that happens in the course of the day shall displease you then set to any work you have in hand with the sifted and purified resolution that ambition shall not mix with it nor love of gain nor desire of pleasure more than is appointed for you and that no anxiety shall touch you as to its issue nor any impatience nor regret if it fail imagine that the thing is being done through you not by you that the good of it may never be known but that at least unless by your rebellion or foolishness there can come no evil into it nor wrong chance to it resolve also with steady industry to do what you can for the help of your country and its honour and the honour of its god and that you will not join hands in its iniquity nor turn aside from its misery and that in all you do and feel you will look frankly for the immediate help and direction and to your own consciences expressed approval of god live thus and believe and with swiftness of answer proportioned to the frankness of the trust most surely the god of hope will fill you with all joy and peace in believing  but if you will not do this if you have not courage nor heart enough to break away the fetters of earth and take up the sensual bed of it and walk if you say that you are bound to win this thing and become the other thing and that the wishes of your friendsand the interests of your familyand the bias of your geniusand the expectations of your collegeand all the rest of the bowwowwow of the wild dogworld must be attended to whether you like it or nothen at least for shame give up talk about being free or independent creatures recognize yourselves for slaves in whom the thoughts are put in ward with their bodies and their hearts manacled with their hands and then at least also for shame if you refuse to believe that ever there were men who gave their souls to godknow and confess how surely there are those who sell them to his adversary     lecture iii  the pleasures of deed  alfred to cŒur de lion   it was my endeavour in the preceding lecture to vindicate the thoughts and arts of our saxon ancestors from whatever scorn might lie couched under the terms applied to them by dean stanleyfantastic and childish today my task must be carried forward first in asserting the grace in fantasy and the force in infancy of the english mind before the conquest against the allegations contained in the final passage of dean stanleys description of the first founded westminster a passage which accepts and asserts more distinctly than any other equally brief statement i have met with the to my mind extremely disputable theory that the norman invasion was in every respect a sanitary moral and intellectual blessing to england and that the arrow which slew her harold was indeed the arrow of the lords deliverance  the abbey itself says dean stanleythe chief work of the confessors lifewas the portent of the mighty future when harold stood beside his sister edith on the day of the dedication and signed his name with hers as witness to the charter of the abbey he might have seen that he was sealing his own doom and preparing for his own destruction the solid pillars the ponderous arches the huge edifice with triple tower and sculptured stones and storied windows that arose in the place and in the midst of the humble wooden churches and wattled tenements of the saxon period might have warned the nobles who were present that the days of their rule were numbered and that the avenging civilizing stimulating hand of another and a mightier race was at work which would change the whole face of their language their manners their church and their commonwealth the abbey so far exceeding the demands of the dull and stagnant minds of our anglosaxon ancestors was founded not only in faith but in hope in the hope that england had yet a glorious career to run that the line of her sovereigns would not be broken even when the race of alfred had ceased to reign  there must surely be some among my hearers who are startled if not offended at being told in the terms which i emphasized in this sentence that the minds of our saxon fathers were although fantastic dull and although childish stagnant that farther in their fantastic stagnation they were savageand in their innocent dullness criminal so that the future character and fortune of the race depended on the critical advent of the didactic and disciplinarian norman baron at once to polish them stimulate and chastise  before i venture to say a word in distinct arrest of this judgment i will give you a chart as clear as the facts observed in the two previous lectures allow of the state and prospects of the saxons when this violent benediction of conquest happened to them and especially i would rescue in the measure that justice bids the memory even of their pagan religion from the general scorn in which i used carlyles description of the idol of ancient prussia as universally exponent of the temper of northern devotion that triglaph or triglyph idol derivation of triglaph wholly unknown to mei use triglyph only for my own handiest epithet last set up on what is now st marys hill in brandenburg in 1023 belonged indeed to a people wonderfully like the saxonsgeographically their close neighboursin habits of life and aspect of native land scarcely distinguishable from themin carlyles words a strongboned iracund herdsman and fisher people highly averse to be interfered with in their religion especially and inhabiting a moory flat country full of lakes and woods but with plenty also of alluvial mud grassy frugiferous apt for the ploughin all things like the saxons except as i read the matter in that aversion to be interfered with which you modern english think an especially saxon character in youbut which is on the contrary you will find on examination by no means saxon but only wendisch czech serbic sclavicother hard names i could easily find for it among the tribes of that vehemently heathen old preussenresolutely worshipful of places of oak trees of wooden or stone idols of bangputtis patkullos and i know not what diabolic dumb blocks your english dislike to be interfered with is in absolute fellowship with these but only gathers itself in its places of stalks or chimneys instead of oak trees round its idols of iron instead of wood diabolically vocal now strident and sibilant instead of dumb  far other than these their neighbour saxons jutes and anglestribes between whom the distinctions are of no moment whatsoever except that an english boy or girl may with grace remember that old england exactly and strictly so called was the small district in the extreme south of denmark totally with its islands estimable at sixty miles square of dead flat land directly south of it the definitely socalled saxons held the western shore of holstein with the estuary of the elbe and the seamark isle heligoland but since the principal temple of saxon worship was close to leipsic9 we may include under our general term saxons the inhabitants of the whole level district of north germany from the gulf of flensburg to the hartz and eastward all the country watered by the elbe as far as saxon switzerland  footnote 9 turner vol i p 223  of the character of this race i will not here speak at any length only note of it this essential point that their religion was at once more practical and more imaginative than that of the norwegian peninsula the norse religion being the conception rather of natural than moral powers but the saxon primarily of moral as the lords of naturaltheir central divine image irminsul10 holding the standard of peace in her right hand a balance in her left such a religion may degenerate into mere slaughter and rapine but it has the making in it of the noblest men  footnote 10 properly plural imagesirminsul and irminsula  more practical at all events whether for good or evil in this trust in a future reward for courage and purity than the mere scandinavian awe of existing earth and cloud the saxon religion was also more imaginative in its nearer conception of human feeling in divine creatures and when this wide hope and high reverence had distinct objects of worship and prayer offered to them by christianity the saxons easily became pure passionate and thoughtful christians while the normans to the last had the greatest difficulty in apprehending the christian teaching of the franks and still deny the power of christianity even when they have become inveterate in its form  quite the deepestthoughted creatures of the then animate world it seems to me these saxon ploughmen of the sand or the sea with their worshipped deity of beauty and justice a red rose on her banner for best of gifts and in her right hand instead of a sword a balance for due doom without wrathof retribution in her left far other than the wends though stubborn enough they too in battle rankseven times rising from defeat against charlemagne and unsubdued but by deathyet by no means in that john bulls manner of yours averse to be interfered with in their opinions or their religion eagerly docile on the contraryjoyfully reverentinstantly and gratefully acceptant of whatever better insight or oversight a stranger could bring them of the things of god or man  and let me here ask you especially to take account of that origin of the true bearing of the flag of england the red rose her own madness defiled afterwards alike the white and red into images of the paleness or the crimson of death but the saxon rose was the symbol of heavenly beauty and peace  i told you in my first lecture that one swift requirement in our school would be to produce a beautiful map of england including old northumberland giving the whole country in its real geography between the frith of forth and straits of dover and with only six sites of habitation given besides those of edinburgh and londonnamely those of canterbury and winchester york and lancaster holy island and melrose the latter instead of iona because as we have seen the influence of st columba expires with the advance of christianity while that of cuthbert of melrose connects itself with the most sacred feelings of the entire northumbrian kingdom and scottish border down to the days of scottwreathing also into its circle many of the legends of arthur will you forgive my connecting the personal memory of having once had a wild rose gathered for me in the glen of thomas the rhymer by the daughter of one of the few remaining catholic houses of scotland with the pleasure i have in reading to you this following true account of the origin of the name of st cuthberts birthplacethe rather because i owe it to friendship of the same date with mr cockburn muir of melrose  to those who have eyes to read it says mr muir the name melrose is written full and fair on the fair face of all this reach of the valley the name is anciently spelt mailros and later malros never mulros mul being the celtic word taken to mean bare ros is rose the forms meal or mol imply great quantity or number thus malros means the place of many roses  this is precisely the notable characteristic of the neighbourhood the wild rose is indigenous there is no nook nor cranny no bank nor brae which is not in the time of roses ablaze with their exuberant loveliness in gardens the cultured rose is so prolific that it spreads literally like a weed but it is worth suggestion that the word may be of the same stock as the hebrew rôsh translated rôs by the septuagint meaning chief principal while it is also the name of some flower but of which flower is now unknown affinities of rôsh are not far to seek sanskrit raja rajani latin rex regina  i leave it to professor max muller to certify or correct for you the details of mr cockburns research11this main head of it i can positively confirm that in old scotchthat of bishop douglasthe word rois stands alike for king and rose  footnote 11 i had not time to quote it fully in the lecture and in my ignorance alike of keltic and hebrew can only submit it here to the readers examination the ancient cognizance of the town confirms this etymology beyond doubt with customary heraldic precision the shield bears a rose with a maul as the exact phonetic equivalent for the expletive if the herald had needed to express bare promontory quite certainly he would have managed it somehow not only this the earls of haddington were first created earls of melrose 1619 and their shield quarterly is charged for melrose in 2nd and 3rd fesse wavy between three roses gu  beyond this ground of certainty we may indulge in a little excursus into lingual affinities of wide range the root mol is clear enough it is of the same stock as the greek mála latin multum and hebrew mla but rose we call her queen of flowers and since before the persian poets made much of her she was everywhere regina florum why should not the name mean simply the queen the chief now so few who know keltic know also hebrew and so few who know hebrew know also keltic that few know the surprising extent of the affinity that existsclear as daybetween the keltic and the hebrew vocabularies that the word rose may be a case in point is not hazardously speculative  summing now the features i have too shortly specified in the saxon characterits imagination its docility its love of knowledge and its love of beauty you will be prepared to accept my conclusive statement that they gave rise to a form of christian faith which appears to me in the present state of my knowledge one of the purest and most intellectual ever attained in christendomnever yet understood partly because of the extreme rudeness of its expression in the art of manuscripts and partly because on account of its very purity it sought no expression in architecture being a religion of daily life and humble lodging for these two practical reasons firstand for this more weighty third that the intellectual character of it is at the same time most truly as dean stanley told you childlike showing itself in swiftness of imaginative apprehension and in the fearlessly candid application of great principles to small things its character in this kind may be instantly felt by any sympathetic and gentle person who will read carefully the book i have already quoted to you the venerable bedes life of st cuthbert and the intensity and sincerity of it in the highest orders of the laity by simply counting the members of saxon royal families who ended their lives in monasteries  now at the very moment when this faith innocence and ingenuity were on the point of springing up into their fruitage comes the northern invasion of the real character of which you can gain a far truer estimate by studying alfreds former resolute contest with and victory over the native norman in his paganism than by your utmost endeavours to conceive the character of the afterwards invading norman disguised but not changed by christianity the norman could not in the nature of him become a christian at all and he never didhe only became at his best the enemy of the saracen what he was and what alone he was capable of being i will try today to explain  and here i must advise you that in all points of history relating to the period between 800 and 1200 you will find m viollet le duc incidentally throughout his dictionary of architecture the bestinformed most intelligent and most thoughtful of guides his knowledge of architecture carried down into the most minutely practical detailswhich are often the most significant and embracing over the entire surface of france the buildings even of the most secluded villages his artistic enthusiasm balanced by the acutest sagacity and his patriotism by the frankest candour render his analysis of history during that active and constructive period the most valuable known to me and certainly in its field exhaustive of the later nationality his account is imperfect owing to his professional interest in the mere science of architecture and comparative insensibility to the power of sculpturebut of the time with which we are now concerned whatever he tells you must be regarded with grateful attention  i introduce therefore the normans to you on their first entering france under his descriptive terms of them12  footnote 12 article architecture vol i p 138  as soon as they were established on the soil these barbarians became the most hardy and active builders within the space of a century and a half they had covered the country on which they had definitely landed with religious monastic and civil edifices of an extent and richness then little common it is difficult to suppose that they had brought from norway the elements of art13 but they were possessed by a persisting and penetrating spirit their brutal force did not want for grandeur conquerors they raised castles to assure their domination they soon recognized the moral force of the clergy and endowed it richly eager always to attain their end when once they saw it they never left one of their enterprises unfinished and in that they differed completely from the southern inhabitants of gaul tenacious extremely they were perhaps the only ones among the barbarians established in france who had ideas of order the only ones who knew how to preserve their conquests and compose a state they found the remains of the carthaginian arts on the territory where they planted themselves they mingled with those their national genius positive grand and yet supple  footnote 13 they had brought some of a variously charybdic serpentine and diabolic characterjr  supple deliécapable of change and play of the mental muscle in the way that savages are not i do not myself grant this suppleness to the norman the less because another sentence of m le ducs occurring incidentally in his account of the archivolt is of extreme countersignificance and wide application the norman arch he says is never derived from traditional classic forms but only from mathematical arrangement of line yes that is true the norman arch is never derived from classic forms the cathedral14 whose aisles you saw or might have seen yesterday interpenetrated with light whose vaults you might have heard prolonging the sweet divisions of majestic sound would have been built in that stately symmetry by norman law though never an arch at rome had risen round her field of bloodthough never her sublician bridge had been petrified by her augustan pontifices but the decoration though not the structure of those arches they owed to another race15 whose words they stole without understanding though three centuries before the saxon understood and used to express the most solemn majesty of his kinghood    ego edgar totivs albionis  not rex that would have meant the king of kent or mercia not of englandno nor imperator that would have meant only the profane power of rome but basilevs meaning a king who reigned with sacred authority given by heaven and christ  footnote 14 of oxford during the afternoon service  footnote 15 see the concluding section of the lecture  with far meaner thoughts both of themselves and their powers the normans set themselves to build impregnable military walls and sublime religious ones in the best possible practical ways but they no more made books of their church fronts than of their bastion flanks and cared in the religion they accepted neither for its sentiments nor its promises but only for its immediate results on national order  as i read them they were men wholly of this world bent on doing the most in it and making the best of it that they couldmen to their death of deed never pausing changing repenting or anticipating more than the completed square ὰνευ ψογου of their battle their keep and their cloister soldiers before and after everything they learned the lockings and bracings of their stones primarily in defence against the batteringram and the projectile and esteemed the pure circular arch for its distributed and equal strength more than for its beauty i believe again says m le duc16 that the feudal castle never arrived at its perfectness till after the norman invasion and that this race of the north was the first to apply a defensive system under unquestionable laws soon followed by the nobles of the continent after they had at their own expense learned their superiority  footnote 16 article château vol iii p 65  the next sentence is a curious one i pray your attention to it the defensive system of the norman is born of a profound sentiment of distrust and cunning foreign to the character of the frank you will find in all my previous notices of the french continual insistance upon their natural franchise and also if you take the least pains in analysis of their literature down to this day that the idea of falseness is to them indeed more hateful than to any other european nation to take a quite cardinal instance if you compare lucians and shakespeares timon with molières alceste you will find the greek and english misanthropes dwell only on mens ingratitude to themselves but alceste on their falsehood to each other  now hear m le duc farther  the castles built between the tenth and twelfth centuries along the loire gironde and seine that is to say along the lines of the norman invasions and in the neighbourhood of their possessions have a peculiar and uniform character which one finds neither in central france nor in burgundy nor can there be any need for us to throw light on faire ressortir the superiority of the warrior spirit of the normans during the later times of the carlovingian epoch over the spirit of the chiefs of frank descent established on the galloroman soil theres a bit of honesty in a frenchman for you  i have just said that they valued religion chiefly for its influence of order in the present world being in this observe as nearly as may be the exact reverse of modern believers or persons who profess to be suchof whom it may be generally alleged too truly that they value religion with respect to their future bliss rather than their present duty and are therefore continually careless of its direct commands with easy excuse to themselves for disobedience to them whereas the norman finding in his own heart an irresistible impulse to action and perceiving himself to be set with entirely strong body brain and will in the midst of a weak and dissolute confusion of all things takes from the bible instantly into his conscience every exhortation to do and to govern and becomes with all his might and understanding a blunt and rough servant knecht or knight of god liable to much misapprehension of course as to the services immediately required of him but supposing since the whole make of him outside and in is a soldiers that god meant him for a soldier and that he is to establish by main force the christian faith and works all over the world so far as he comprehends them not merely with the mahometan indignation against spiritual error but with a sound and honest souls dislike of material error and resolution to extinguish that even if perchance found in the spiritual persons to whom in their office he yet rendered total reverence  which force and faith in him i may best illustrate by merely putting together the broken paragraphs of sismondis account of the founding of the norman kingdom of sicily virtually contemporary with the conquest of england  the normans surpassed all the races of the west in their ardour for pilgrimages they would not to go into the holy land submit to the monotony17 of a long sea voyagethe rather that they found not on the mediterranean the storms or dangers they had rejoiced to encounter on their own sea they traversed by land the whole of france and italy trusting to their swords to procure the necessary subsistence18 if the charity of the faithful did not enough provide for it with alms the towns of naples amalfi gaeta and bari held constant commerce with syria and frequent miracles it was believed illustrated the monte cassino st benedict again on the road of naples and the mount of angels garganus above bari querceta garganiverily laborant now et orant the pilgrims wished to visit during their journey the monasteries built on these two mountains and therefore nearly always either going or returning to the holy land passed through magna græcia  footnote 17 i give sismondis idea as it stands but there was no question in the matter of monotony or of danger the journey was made on foot because it was the most laborious way and the most humble  footnote 18 see farther on p 110 the analogies with english arrangements of the same kind  in one of the earliest years of the eleventh century about forty of these religious travellers having returned from the holy land chanced to have met together in salerno at the moment when a small saracen fleet came to insult the town and demand of it a military contribution the inhabitants of south italy at this time abandoned to the delights of their enchanted climate had lost nearly all military courage the salernitani saw with astonishment forty norman knights after having demanded horses and arms from the prince of salerno order the gates of the town to be opened charge the saracens fearlessly and put them to flight the salernitani followed however the example given them by these brave warriors and those of the mussulmans who escaped their swords were forced to reembark in all haste  the prince of salerno guaimar iii tried in vain to keep the warriorpilgrims at his court but at his solicitation other companies established themselves on the rocks of salerno and amalfi until on christmas day 1041 exactly a quarter of a century before the coronation here at westminster of the conqueror they gathered their scattered forces at aversa19 twelve groups of them under twelve chosen counts and all under the lombard ardoin as commanderinchief be so good as to note thata marvellous keynote of historical fact about the unjesting lombards i cannot find the total norman number the chief contingent under william of the iron arm the son of tancred of hauteville was only of three hundred knights the count of aversas troop of the same number is named as an important part of the little armyadmit it for ten times tancreds three thousand men in all at aversa these three thousand men form coolly on christmas day 1041 the design ofwell i told you they didnt design much only now were here we may as well while were about itoverthrow the greek empire that was their little gamea christmas mumming to purpose the following year the whole of apulia was divided among them  footnote 19 in lombardy south of pavia  i will not spoil by abstracting the magnificent following history of robert guiscard the most wonderful soldier of that or any other time i leave you to finish it for yourselves only asking you to read together with it the sketch in turners history of the anglosaxons of alfreds long previous war with the norman hasting pointing out to you for foci of character in each contest the culminating incidents of naval battle in guiscards struggle with the greeks he encounters for their chief naval force the venetian fleet under the doge domenico selvo the venetians are at this moment undoubted masters in all naval warfare the normans are worsted easily the first daythe second day fighting harder they are defeated again and so disastrously that the venetian doge takes no precautions against them on the third day thinking them utterly disabled guiscard attacks him again on the third day with the mere wreck of his own ships and defeats the tired and amazed italians finally  the seafight between alfreds ships and those of hasting ought to be still more memorable to us alfred as i noticed in last lecture had built war ships nearly twice as long as the normans swifter and steadier on the waves six norman ships were ravaging the isle of wight alfred sent nine of his own to take them the kings fleet found the northmens embayed and three of them aground the three others engaged alfreds nine twice their size two of the viking ships were taken but the third escaped with only five men a nation which verily took its pleasures in its deeds  but before i can illustrate farther either their deeds or their religion i must for an instant meet the objection which i suppose the extreme probity of the nineteenth century must feel acutely against these menthat they all lived by thieving  without venturing to allude to the raison dêtre of the present french and english stock exchanges i will merely ask any of you here whether of saxon or norman blood to define for himself what he means by the possession of india i have no doubt that you all wish to keep india in order and in like manner i have assured you that duke william wished to keep england in order if you will read the lecture on the life of sir herbert edwardes which i hope to give in london after finishing this course20 you will see how a christian british officer can and does verily and with his whole heart keep in order such part of india as may be entrusted to him and in so doing secure our empire but the silent feeling and practice of the nation about india is based on quite other motives than sir herberts every mutiny every danger every terror and every crime occurring under or paralyzing our indian legislation arises directly out of our national desire to live on the loot of india and the notion always entertained by english young gentlemen and ladies of good position falling in love with each other without immediate prospect of establishment in belgrave square that they can find in india instantly on landing a bungalow ready furnished with the loveliest fans china and shawlsices and sherbet at commandfourandtwenty slaves succeeding each other hourly to swing the punkah and a regiment with a beautiful band to keep order outside all round the house  footnote 20 this was prevented by the necessity for the rearrangement of my terminal oxford lectures i am now preparing that on sir herbert for publication in a somewhat expanded form  entreating your pardon for what may seem rude in these personal remarks i will further entreat you to read my account of the death of cœur de lion in the third number of fors clavigeraand also the scenes in ivanhoe between cœur de lion and locksley and commending these few passages to your quiet consideration i proceed to give you another anecdote or two of the normans in italy twelve years later than those given above and therefore only thirteen years before the battle of hastings  their division of south italy among them especially and their defeat of venice had alarmed everybody considerablyespecially the pope leo ix who did not understand this manifestation of their piety he sent to henry iii of germany to whom he owed his popedom for some german knights and got five hundred spears gathered out of all apulia campania and the march of ancona what greek and latin troops were to be had to join his own army of the patrimony of st peter and the holy pontiff with this numerous army but no general began the campaign by a pilgrimage with all his troops to monte cassino in order to obtain if it might be st benedict for general  against the popes collected masses with st benedict their contemplative but at first inactive general stood the little army of normanscertainly not more than the third of their numberbut with robert guiscard for captain and under him his brother humphrey of hauteville and richard of aversa not in fear but in devotion they prayed the pope avec instanceto say on what conditions they could appease his anger and live in peace under him but the pope would hear of nothing but their evacuation of italy whereupon they had to settle the question in the norman manner  the two armies met in front of civitella on waterloo day 18th june thirteen years as i said before the battle of hastings the german knights were the heart of the popes army but they were only five hundred the normans surrounded them first and slew them nearly to a manand then made extremely short work with the italians and greeks the pope with the wreck of them fled into civitella but the townspeople dared not defend their walls and thrust the pope himself out of their gatesto meet alone the norman army  he met it not alone st benedict being with him now when he had no longer the strength of man to trust in  the normans as they approached him threw themselves on their kneescovered themselves with dust and implored his pardon and his blessing  theres a bit of poetryif you likebut a piece of steelclad fact also compared to which the battle of hastings and waterloo both were mere boys squabbles  you dont suppose you british schoolboys that you overthrew napoleonyou your prime minister folded up the map of europe at the thought of him not you but the snows of heaven and the hand of him who dasheth in pieces with a rod of iron he casteth forth his ice like morselswho can stand before his cold  but so far as you have indeed the right to trust in the courage of your own hearts remember alsoit is not in norman nor saxon but in celtic race that your real strength lies the battles both of waterloo and alma were won by irish and scotsby the terrible scots greys and by sir colins highlanders your thin red line was kept steady at alma only by colonel yeas swearing at them  but the old pope alone against a norman army wanted nobody to swear at him steady enough he having somebody to bless him instead of swear at him st benedict namely whose memory shall we say helped him now at his pinch in a singular mannerfor the normans having got the old mans forgiveness vowed themselves his feudal servants and for seven centuries afterwards the whole kingdom of naples remained a fief of st peterwon for him thus by a single man unarmed against three thousand norman knights captained by robert guiscard  a day of deeds gentlemen to some purposethat 18th of june anyhow  here in the historical account of norman character i must unwillingly stop for todaybecause as you choose to spend your university money in building ballrooms instead of lecturerooms i dare not keep you much longer in this black hole with its nineteenth century ventilation i try your patienceand tax your breathonly for a few minutes more in drawing the necessary corollaries respecting norman art21  footnote 21 given at much greater length in the lecture with diagrams from iffley and poictiers without which the text of them would be unintelligible the sum of what i said was a strong assertion of the incapacity of the normans for any but the rudest and most grotesque sculpturepoictiers being on the contrary examined and praised as gallicfrenchnot norman  how far the existing british nation owes its military prowess to the blood of normandy and anjou i have never examined its genealogy enough to tell youbut this i can tell you positively that whatever constitutional order or personal valour the normans enforced or taught among the nations they conquered they did not at first attempt with their own hands to rival them in any of their finer arts but used both greek and saxon sculptors either as slaves or hired workmen and more or less therefore chilled and degraded the hearts of the men thus set to servile or at best hireling labour  in 1874 i went to see etna scylla charybdis and the tombs of the norman kings at palermo surprised as you may imagine to find that there wasnt a stroke nor a notion of norman work in them they are every atom done by greeks and are as pure greek as the temple of Ægina but more rich and refined i drew with accurate care and with measured profile of every moulding the tomb built for roger ii afterwards frederick ii was laid in its dark porphyry and it is a perfect type of the greekchristian form of tombtemple over sarcophagus in which the pediments rise gradually as time goes on into acute anglesget pierced in the gable with foils and their sculptures thrown outside on their flanks and become at last in the fourteenth century the tombs of verona but what is the meaning of the normans employing these greek slaves for their work in sicily within thirty miles of the field of himera well the main meaning is that though the normans could build they couldnt carve and were wise enough not to try to when they couldnt as you do now all over this intensely comic and tragic town but here in england they only employed the saxon with a grudge and therefore being more and more driven to use barren mouldings without sculpture gradually developed the structural forms of archivolt which breaking into the lancet brighten and balance themselves into the symmetry of early english gothic  but even for the first decoration of the archivolt itself they were probably indebted to the greeks in a degree i never apprehended until by pure happy chance a friend gave me the clue to it just as i was writing the last pages of this lecture  in the generalization of ornament attempted in the first volume of the stones of venice i supposed the norman zigzag and with some practical truth to be derived from the angular notches with which the blow of an axe can most easily decorate or at least vary the solid edge of a square fillet my good friend and supporter and for some time back the single trustee of st georges guild mr george baker having come to oxford on guild business i happened to show him the photographs of the front of iffley church which had been collected for this lecture and immediately afterwards in taking him through the schools stopped to show him the athena of Ægina as one of the most important of the greek examples lately obtained for us by professor richmond the statue is rightly so placed that in looking up to it the plait of hair across the forehead is seen in a steeply curved arch why says mr baker pointing to it theres the norman arch of iffley sure enough there it exactly was and a moments reflection showed me how easily and with what instinctive fitness the norman builders looking to the greeks as their absolute masters in sculpture and recognizing also during the crusades the hieroglyphic use of the zigzag for water by the egyptians might have adopted this easily attained decoration at once as the sign of the element over which they reigned and of the power of the greek goddess who ruled both it and them  i do not in the least press your acceptance of such a tradition nor for the rest do i care myself whence any method of ornament is derived if only as a stranger you bid it reverent welcome but much probability is added to the conjecture by the indisputable transition of the greek egg and arrow moulding into the floral cornices of saxon and other twelfth century cathedrals in central france these and other such transitions and exaltations i will give you the materials to study at your leisure after illustrating in my next lecture the forces of religious imagination by which all that was most beautiful in them was inspired     lecture iv  nov 8 1884  the pleasures of fancy  cŒur de lion to elizabeth  1189 to 1558   in using the word fancy for the mental faculties of which i am to speak today i trust you at your leisure to read the introductory note to the second volume of modern painters in the small new edition which gives sufficient reason for practically including under the single term fancy or fantasy all the energies of the imaginationin the terms of the last sentence of that prefacethe healthy voluntary and necessary22 action of the highest powers of the human mind on subjects properly demanding and justifying their exertion  footnote 22 meaning that all healthy minds possess imagination and use it at will under fixed laws of truthful perception and memory  i must farther ask you to read in the same volume the close of the chapter of imagination penetrative pp 120 to 130 of which the gist which i must give as the first principle from which we start in our todays inquiry is that imagination rightly so called has no food no delight no care no perception except of truth it is for ever looking under masks and burning up mists no fairness of form no majesty of seeming will satisfy it the first condition of its existence is incapability of being deceived23 in that sentence which is a part and a very valuable part of the original book i still adopted and used unnecessarily the ordinary distinction between fancy and imaginationfancy concerned with lighter things creating fairies or centaurs and imagination creating men and i was in the habit always of implying by the meaner word fancy a voluntary fallacy as wordsworth does in those lines to his wife making of her a mere lay figure for the drapery of his fancy    such if thou wert in all mens view     an universal show   what would my fancy have to do     my feelings to bestow  but you will at once understand the higher and more universal power which i now wish you to understand by the fancy including all imaginative energy correcting these lines of wordsworths to a more worthy description of a true lovers happiness when a boy falls in love with a girl you say he has taken a fancy for her but if he love her rightly that is to say for her noble qualities you ought to say he has taken an imagination for her for then he is endued with the new light of love which sees and tells of the mind in herand this neither falsely nor vainly his love does not bestow it discovers what is indeed most precious in his mistress and most needful for his own life and happiness day by day as he loves her better he discerns her more truly and it is only the truth of his love that does so falsehood to her would at once disenchant and blind him  footnote 23 vide pp 1245  in my first lecture of this year i pointed out to you with what extreme simplicity and reality the christian faith must have presented itself to the northern pagans mind in its distinction from his former confused and monstrous mythology it was also in that simplicity and tangible reality of conception that this faith became to them and to the other savage nations of europe tutress of the real power of their imagination and it became so only in so far as it indeed conveyed to them statements which however in some respects mysterious were yet most literally and brightly true as compared with their former conceptions so that while the blind cunning of the savage had produced only misshapen logs or scrawls the seeing imagination of the christian painters created for them and for all the world the perfect types of the virgin and of her son which became indeed divine by being with the most affectionate truth human  and the association of this truth in loving conception with the general honesty and truth of the character is again conclusively shown in the feelings of the lover to his mistress which we recognize as first reaching their height in the days of chivalry the truth and faith of the lover and his piety to heaven are the foundation in his character of all the joy in imagination which he can receive from the conception of his ladysnow no more mortalbeauty she is indeed transfigured before him but the truth of the transfiguration is greater than that of the lightless aspect she bears to others when therefore in my next lecture i speak of the pleasures of truth as distinct from those of the imaginationif either the limits or clearness of brief title had permitted me i should have said untransfigured truthmeaning on the one side truth which we have not heart enough to transfigure and on the other truth of the lower kind which is incapable of transfiguration one may look at a girl till one believes she is an angel because in the best of her she is one but one cant look at a cockchafer till one believes it is a girl  with this warning of the connection which exists between the honest intellect and the healthy imagination and using henceforward the shorter word fancy for all inventive vision i proceed to consider with you the meaning and consequences of the frank and eager exertion of the fancy on religious subjects between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries  its first and admittedly most questionable action the promotion of the group of martyr saints of the third century to thrones of uncontested dominion in heaven had better be distinctly understood before we debate of it either with the iconoclast or the rationalist this apotheosis by the imagination is the subject of my present lecture today i only describe itin my next lecture i will discuss it  observe however that in giving such a history of the mental constitution of nascent christianity we have to deal with and carefully to distinguish two entirely different orders in its accepted hierarchyone scarcely founded at all on personal characters or acts but mythic or symbolic often merely the revival the baptized resuscitation of a pagan deity or the personified omnipresence of a christian virtuethe other a senate of patres conscripti of real persons great in genius and perfect humanly speaking in holiness who by their personal force and inspired wisdom wrought the plastic body of the church into such noble form as in each of their epochs it was able to receive and on the right understanding of whose lives nor less of the affectionate traditions which magnified and illumined their memories must absolutely depend the value of every estimate we form whether of the nature of the christian church herself or of the directness of spiritual agency by which she was guided24  footnote 24 if the reader believes in no spiritual agency still his understanding of the first letters in the alphabet of history depends on his comprehending rightly the tempers of the people who did  an important distinction therefore is to be noted at the outset in the objects of this apotheosis according as they are or are not real persons  of these two great orders of saints the first or mythic belongsspeaking broadlyto the southern or greek church alone  the gothic christians once detached from the worship of odin and thor abjure from their hearts all trust in the elements and all worship of ideas they will have their saints in flesh and blood their angels in plume and armour and nothing incorporeal or invisible in all the religious sculpture beside loire and seine you will not find either of the great rivers personified the dress of the highest seraph is of true steel or sound broadcloth neither flecked by hail nor fringed by thunder and while the ideal charity of giotto at padua presents her heart in her hand to god and tramples at the same instant on bags of gold the treasures of the world and gives only corn and flowers that on the west porch of amiens is content to clothe a beggar with a piece of the staple manufacture of the town  on the contrary it is nearly impossible to find in the imagery of the greek church under the former exercise of the imagination a representation either of man or beast which purports to represent only the person or the brute every mortal creature stands for an immortal intelligence or influence a lamb means an apostle a lion an evangelist an angel the eternal justice or benevolence and the most historical and indubitable of saints are compelled to set forth in their vulgarly apparent persons a platonic myth or an athanasian article  i therefore take note first of the mythic saints in succession whom this treatment of them by the byzantine church made afterwards the favourite idols of all christendom  i the most mythic is of course st sophia the shade of the greek athena passing into the wisdom of the jewish proverbs and psalms and the apocryphal wisdom of solomon she always remains understood as a personification only and has no direct influence on the mind of the unlearned multitude of western christendom except as a godmotherin which kindly function she is more and more accepted as times go on her healthy influence being perhaps greater over sweet vicars daughters in wakefieldwhen wakefield wasthan over the prudentest of the rarely prudent empresses of byzantium  ii of st catharine of egypt there are vestiges of personal tradition which may perhaps permit the supposition of her having really once existed as a very lovely witty proud and fanciful girl she afterwards becomes the christian type of the bride in the song of solomon involved with an ideal of all that is purest in the life of a nun and brightest in the death of a martyr it is scarcely possible to overrate the influence of the conceptions formed of her in ennobling the sentiments of christian women of the higher ordersto their practical common sense as the mistresses of a household or a nation her example may have been less conducive  iii st barbara also an egyptian and st catharines contemporary though the most practical of the mythic saints is also after st sophia the least corporeal she vanishes far away into the inclusa danae and her tunis aenea becomes a myth of christian safety of which the scriptural significance may be enough felt by merely looking out the texts under the word tower in your concordance and whose effectual power in the fortitudes alike of matter and spirit was in all probability made impressive enough to all christendom both by the fortifications and persecutions of diocletian i have endeavoured to mark her general relations to st sophia in the little imaginary dialogue between them given in the eighth lecture of the ethics of the dust  afterwards as gothic architecture becomes dominant and at last beyond question the most wonderful of all templebuilding st barbaras tower is of course its perfected symbol and utmost achievement and whether in the coronets of countless battlements worn on the brows of the noblest cities or in the lombard belltower on the mountains and the english spire on sarum plain the geometric majesty of the egyptian maid became glorious in harmony of defence and sacred with precision of symbol  as the buildings which showed her utmost skill were chiefly exposed to lightning she is invoked in defence from it and our petition in the litany against sudden death was written originally to her the blasphemous corruptions of her into a patroness of cannon and gunpowder are among the most ludicrous because precisely contrary to the original tradition as well as the most deadly insolences and stupidities of renaissance art  iv st margaret of antioch was a shepherdess the st geneviève of the east the type of feminine gentleness and simplicity traditions of the resurrection of alcestis perhaps mingle in those of her contest with the dragon but at all events she differs from the other three great mythic saints in expressing the souls victory over temptation or affliction by christs miraculous help and without any special power of its own she is the saint of the meek and of the poor her virtue and her victory are those of all gracious and lowly womanhood and her memory is consecrated among the gentle households of europe no other name except those of jeanne and jeanie seems so gifted with a baptismal fairy power of giving grace and peace  i must be forgiven for thinking even on this canonical ground not only of jeanie deans and margaret of branksome but of megmerrilies my readers will i fear choose rather to think of the more doubtful victory over the dragon won by the great margaret of german literature  v with much more clearness and historic comfort we may approach the shrine of st cecilia and even on the most prosaic and realistic mindssuch as my owna visit to her house in rome has a comforting and establishing effect which reminds one of the carter in harry and lucy who is convinced of the truth of a plaustral catastrophe at first incredible to him as soon as he hears the name of the hill on which it happened the ruling conception of her is deepened gradually by the enlarged study of religious music and is at its best and highest in the thirteenth century when she rather resists than complies with the already tempting and distracting powers of sound and we are told that cantantibus organis cecilia virgo in corde suo soli domino decantabat dicens fiat domine cor meum et corpus meum immaculatum ut non confundar  while the instruments played cecilia the virgin sang in her heart only to the lord saying oh lord be my heart and body made stainless that i be not confounded  this sentence occurs in my great servicebook of the convent of beaupré written in 1290 and it is illustrated with a miniature of cecilia sitting silent at a banquet where all manner of musicians are playing i need not point out to you how the law not of sacred music only so called but of all music is determined by this sentence which means in effect that unless music exalt and purify it is not under st cecilias ordinance and it is not virtually music at all  her confessed power at last expires amidst a hubbub of odes and sonatas and i suppose her presence at a morning popular is as little anticipated as desired unconfessed she is of all the mythic saints for ever the greatest and the child in its nurses arms and every tender and gentle spirit which resolves to purify in itselfas the eye for seeing so the ear for hearingmay still whether behind the temple veil25 or at the fireside and by the wayside hear cecilia sing    footnote 25but standing in the lowest place   and mingled with the workday crowd   a poor man looks with lifted face   and hears the angels cry aloud    he seeks not how each instant flies   one moment is eternity   his spirit with the angels cries   to thee to thee continually    what if isaiahlike he know   his heart be weak his lips unclean   his nature vile his office low   his dwelling and his people mean    to such the angels spake of old   to such of yore the glory came   these altar fires can neer grow cold     then be it his that cleansing flame  these verses part of a very lovely poem to thee all angels cry aloud in the monthly packet for september 1873 are only signed veritas the volume for that year the 16th is well worth getting for the sake of the admirable papers in it by miss sewell on questions of the day by miss ac owen on christian art and the unsigned cameos from english history  it would delay me too long just now to trace in specialty farther the functions of the mythic or as in another sense they may be truly called the universal saints the next greatest of them st ursula is essentially britishand you will find enough about her in fors clavigera the others i will simply give you in entirely authoritative order from the st louis psalter as he read and thought of them  the proper servicebook of the thirteenth century consists first of the pure psalter then of certain essential passages of the old testamentinvariably the song of miriam at the red sea and the last song of mosesordinarily also the 12th of isaiah and the prayer of habakkuk while st louis psalter has also the prayer of hannah and that of hezekiah isaiah xxxviii 1020 the song of the three children then the benedictus the magnificat and the nunc dimittis then follows the athanasian creed and then as in all psalters after their chosen scripture passages the collects to the virgin the te deum and service to christ beginning with the psalm the lord reigneth and then the collects to the greater individual saints closing with the litany or constant prayer for mercy to christ and all saints of whom the order isarchangels patriarchs apostles disciples innocents martyrs confessors monks and virgins of women the magdalen always leads st mary of egypt usually follows but may be the last then the order varies in every place and prayerbook no recognizable supremacy being traceable except in relation to the place or person for whom the book was written in st louis st geneviève the last saint to whom he prayed on his deathbed follows the two maries then comememorable for you best as easiest in this sixfoil groupsaints catharine margaret and scolastica agatha cecilia and agnes and then ten more whom

religion of europe was crystallized by the growth of its own best faculties and the influence of all accessible and credible authorities during the period between the eleventh and fifteenth centuries inclusive its spiritual power is completely represented by the angelic and apostolic dynasties and the womensaints in paradise for of the mensaints beneath the apostles and prophets none but st christopher st nicholas st anthony st james and st george attained anything like the influence of catharine or cecilia for the very curious reason that the mensaints were much more true real and numerous st martin was reverenced all over europe but definitely as a man and the bishop of tours so st ambrose at milan and st gregory at rome and hundreds of good men more all over the world while the really good women remained though not rare inconspicuous the virtues of french clotilde and swiss berthe were painfully borne down in the balance of visible judgment by the guilt of the gonerils regans and lady macbeths whose spectral procession closes only with the figure of eleanor in woodstock maze and in dearth of nearer objects the daily brighter powers of fancy dwelt with more concentrated devotion on the stainless ideals of the earlier maidmartyrs and observe even the loftier fame of the mensaints above named as compared with the rest depends on precisely the same character of indefinite personality and on the representation by each of them of a moral idea which may be embodied and painted in a miraculous legend credible as history even then only to the vulgar but powerful over them nevertheless exactly in proportion to the degree in which it can be pictured and fancied as a living creature consider even yet in these days of mechanism how the dullest john bull cannot with perfect complacency adore himself except under the figure of britannia or the british lion and how the existence of the popular jestbook which might have seemed secure in its necessity to our weekly recreation is yet virtually centred on the imaginary animation of a puppet and the imaginary elevation to reason of a dog but in the middle ages this action of the fancy now distorted and despised was the happy and sacred tutress of every faculty of the body and soul and the works and thoughts of art the joys and toils of men rose and flowed on in the bright air of it with the aspiration of a flame and the beneficence of a fountain  and now in the rest of my lecture i had intended to give you a broad summary of the rise and fall of english art born under this code of theology and this enthusiasm of dutyof its rise from the rude vaults of westminster to the finished majesty of wellsand of its fall from that brief hour of the thirteenth century through the wars of the bolingbroke and the pride of the tudor and the lust of the stewart to expire under the mocking snarl and ruthless blow of the puritan but you know that i have always in my most serious work allowed myself to be influenced by those chances as they are now calledbut to my own feeling and belief guidances and even if rightly understood commandswhich as far as i have read history the best and sincerest men think providential had this lecture been on common principles of art i should have finished it as i intended without fear of its being the worse for my consistency but it deals on the contrary with a subject respecting which every sentence i write or speak is of importance in its issue and i allowed as you heard the momentary observation of a friend to give an entirely new cast to the close of my last lecture much more i feel it incumbent upon me in this one to take advantage of the most opportune help though in an unexpected direction given me by my constant tutor professor westwood i went to dine with him a day or two ago mainlybeing neither of us i am thankful to say blueribandedto drink his health on his recovery from his recent accident whereupon he gave me a feast of good talk old wine and purple manuscripts and having had as much of all as i could well carry just as it came to the goodnight out he brings for a finish this leaf of manuscript in my hand which he has lent me to show youa leaf of the bible of charles the bald  a leaf of it at least as far as you or i could tell for professor westwoods copy is just as good in all the parts finished as the original and for all practical purpose i show you here in my hand a leaf of the bible which your own king alfred saw with his own bright eyes and from which he learned his childfaith in the days of dawning thought  there are few english children who do not know the story of alfred the king letting the cakes burn and being chidden by his peasant hostess how few english childrennay how few perhaps of their educated not to say learned eldersreflect upon if even they know the far different scenes through which he had passed when a child  concerning his father his mother and his own childhood suppose you were to teach your children first these following main facts before you come to the toasting of the muffin  his father educated by helmstan bishop of winchester had been offered the throne of the great saxon kingdom of mercia in his early youth had refused it and entered as a novice under st swithin the monastery at winchester from st swithin he received the monastic habit and was appointed by bishop helmstan one of his subdeacons  the quiet seclusion which ethelwulphs slow26 capacity and meek temper coveted was not permitted to him by fate the death of his elder brother left him the only living representative of the line of the west saxon princes his accession to the throne became the desire of the people he obtained a dispensation from the pope to leave the cloister assumed the crown of egbert and retained egberts prime minister alstan bishop of sherborne who was the minister in peace and war the treasurer and the counsellor of the kings of england over a space from first to last of fifty years  footnote 26 turner quoting william of malmesbury crassioris et hebetis ingeniimeaning that he had neither ardour for war nor ambition for kinghood  alfreds mother osburga must have been married for love she was the daughter of oslac the kings cupbearer extolled for her piety and understanding she bore the king four sons dying before the last alfred was five years old but leaving him st swithin for his tutor how little do any of us think in idle talk of rain or no rain on st swithins day that we speak of the man whom alfreds father obeyed as a monk and whom his mother chose for his guardian  alfred both to father and mother was the best beloved of their children on his mothers death his father sent him being then five years old with a great retinue through france and across the alps to rome and there the pope anointed him king heirapparent to the english throne at the request of his father  think of it you travellers through the alps by tunnels that you may go to balls at rome or hells at monaco here is another manner of journey another goal for it appointed for your little king at twelve he was already the best hunter among the saxon youths be sure he could sit his horse at five fancy the child with his keen genius and holy heart riding with his saxon chiefs beside him by the alpine flowers under velan or sempione and down among the olives to pavia to perugia to rome there like the little fabled virgin ascending the temple steps and consecrated to be king of england by the great leo leo of the leonine city the saviour of rome from the saracen  two years afterwards he rode again to rome beside his father the west saxon king bringing presents to the pope a crown of pure gold weighing four pounds a sword adorned with pure gold two golden images27 four saxon silver dishes and giving a gift of gold to all the roman clergy and nobles28 and of silver to the people  footnote 27 turner book ivnot a vestige of hint from the stupid englishman what the pope wanted with crown sword or image my own guess would be that it meant an offering of the entire household strength in war and peace of the saxon nationtheir crown their sword their household gods irminsul and irminsula their feasting and their robes  footnote 28 again what does this mean gifts of honour to the popes immediate attendantssilver to all rome does the modern reader think this is buying little alfreds consecration too dear or that leo is selling the holy ghost  no idle sacrifices or symbols these gifts of courtesy the saxon king rebuilt on the highest hill that is bathed by tiber the saxon street and school the borgo29 of whose miraculously arrested burning raphaels fresco preserves the story to this day and further he obtained from leo the liberty of all saxon men from bonds in penancea first phase this of magna charta obtained more honourably from a more honourable person than that document by which englishmen of this day suppose they live move and have being  footnote 29 quæ in eorum lingua burgus diciturthe place where it was situated was called the saxon street saxonum vicum anastasius quoted by turner there seems to me some evidence in the scattered passages i have not time to collate that at this time the saxon burg or tower of a village included the idea of its school  how far into alfreds soul at seven years old sank any true image of what rome was and had been of what her lion lord was who had saved her from the saracen and her lion lord had been who had saved her from the hun and what this spiritual dominion was and was to be which could make and unmake kings and save nations and put armies to flight i leave those to say who have learned to reverence childhood this at least is sure that the days of alfred were bound each to each not only by their natural piety but by the actual presence and appeal to his heart of all that was then in the world most noble beautiful and strong against death  in this living book of god he had learned to read thus early and with perhaps nobler ambition than of getting the prize of a gilded psalmbook at his mothers knee as you are commonly told of him what sort of psalmbook it was however you may see from this leaf in my hand for as his father and he returned from rome that year they stayed again at the court of charlemagnes grandson whose daughter the princess judith ethelwolf was wooing for queen of england not queenconsort merely but crowned queen of authority equal to his own from whom alfred was like enough to have had a reading lesson or two out of her fathers bible and like enough the little prince to have stayed her hand at this bright leaf of it the lionleaf bearing the symbol of the lion of the tribe of judah  you cannot of course see anything but the glittering from where you sit nor even if you afterwards look at it near will you find a figure the least admirable or impressive to you it is not like landseers lions in trafalgar square nor like tenniels in punch still less like the real ones in regents park neither do i show it you as admirable in any respect of art other than that of skilfullest illumination i show it you as the most interesting gothic type of the imagination of lion which after the roman eagle possessed the minds of all european warriors until as they themselves grew selfish and cruel the symbols which at first meant heavensent victory or the strength and presence of some divine spirit became to them only the signs of their own pride or rage the victor raven of corvus sinks into the shamed falcon of marmion and the lionheartedness which gave the glory and the peace of the gods to leonidas casts the glory and the might of kinghood to the dust before chalus30  footnote 30 fors clavigera march 1871 p 19 yet read the preceding pages and learn the truth of the lion heart while you mourn its pride note especially his absolute law against usury  that death 6th april 1199 ended the advance of england begun by alfred under the pure law of religious imagination she began already in the thirteenth century to be decoratively instead of vitally religious the history of the religious imagination expressed between alfreds time and that of cœur de lion in this symbol of the lion only has material in it rather for all my seven lectures than for the closing section of one but i must briefly specify to you the main sections of it i will keep clear of my favourite number seven and ask you to recollect the meaning of only five mythic lions  first of all in greek art remember to keep yourselves clear about the difference between the lion and the gorgon  the gorgon is the power of evil in heaven conquered by athena and thenceforward becoming her ægis when she is herself the inflictor of evil her helmet is then the helmet of orcus  but the lion is the power of death on earth conquered by heracles and becoming thenceforward both his helmet and ægis all ordinary architectural lion sculpture is derived from the heraclean  then the christian lions are first the lion of the tribe of judahchrist himself as captain and judge he shall rule the nations with a rod of iron the opposite power of his adversary is rarely intended in sculpture unless in association with the serpentinculcabis supra leonem et aspidem secondly the lion of st mark the power of the gospel going out to conquest thirdly the lion of st jerome the wrath of the brute creation changed into love by the kindness of man and fourthly the lion of the zodiac which is the lion of egypt and of the lombardic pillarsupports in italy these four if you remember with the nemean greek one five altogether will give you broadly interpretation of nearly all lion symbolism in great art how they degenerate into the british door knocker i leave you to determine for yourselves with such assistances as i may be able to suggest to you in my next lecture but as the grotesqueness of human history plans it there is actually a connection between that last degradation of the leonine symbol and its first and noblest significance  you see there are letters round this golden lion of alfreds spellingbook which his princess friend was likely enough to spell for him they are two latin hexameters    hic leo surgendo portas confregit averni   qui nunquam dormit nusquam dormitat in ævum   this lion rising burst the gates of death   this who sleeps not nor shall sleep for ever  now here is the christian change of the heraclean conquest of death into christs resurrection samsons bearing away the gates of gaza is another like symbol and to the mind of alfred taught whether by the pope leo for his schoolmaster or by the greatgranddaughter of charlemagne for his schoolmistress it represented as it did to all the intelligence of christendom christ in his own first and last alpha and omega description of himself  i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive for evermore and have the keys of hell and of death and in his servant st johns description of him  who is the faithful witness and the firstbegotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth  all this assuredly so far as the young child consecrated like david the youngest of his brethren conceived his own new life in earth and heavenhe understood already in the lion symbol but of all this i had no thought31 when i chose the prayer of alfred as the type of the religion of his era in its dwelling not on the deliverance from the punishment of sin but from the poisonous sleep and death of it will you ever learn that prayer againyouths who are to be priests and knights and kings of england in these the latter days when the gospel of eternal death is preached here in oxford to you for the pride of truth and the mountain of the lords house has become a golgotha and the new song before the throne sunk into the rolling thunder of the death rattle of the nations crying o christ where is thy victory  footnote 31 the
