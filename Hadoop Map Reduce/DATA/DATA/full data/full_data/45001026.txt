45001026	the madonna of the future by henry james   we had been talking about the masters who had achieved but a single masterpiecethe artists and poets who but once in their lives had known the divine afflatus and touched the high level of perfection  our host had been showing us a charming little cabinet picture by a painter whose name we had never heard and who after this single spasmodic bid for fame had apparently relapsed into obscurity and mediocrity  there was some discussion as to the frequency of this phenomenon during which i observed h sat silent finishing his cigar with a meditative air and looking at the picture which was being handed round the table  i dont know how common a case it is he said at last but i have seen it  i have known a poor fellow who painted his one masterpiece andhe added with a smilehe didnt even paint that  he made his bid for fame and missed it  we all knew h for a clever man who had seen much of men and manners and had a great stock of reminiscences  some one immediately questioned him further and while i was engrossed with the raptures of my neighbour over the little picture he was induced to tell his tale  if i were to doubt whether it would bear repeating i should only have to remember how that charming woman our hostess who had left the table ventured back in rustling rosecolour to pronounce our lingering a want of gallantry and finding us a listening circle sank into her chair in spite of our cigars and heard the story out so graciously that when the catastrophe was reached she glanced across at me and showed me a tear in each of her beautiful eyes        it relates to my youth and to italy two fine things  h began  i had arrived late in the evening at florence and while i finished my bottle of wine at supper had fancied that tired traveller though i was i might pay the city a finer compliment than by going vulgarly to bed  a narrow passage wandered darkly away out of the little square before my hotel and looked as if it bored into the heart of florence  i followed it and at the end of ten minutes emerged upon a great piazza filled only with the mild autumn moonlight  opposite rose the palazzo vecchio like some huge civic fortress with the great belltower springing from its embattled verge as a mountainpine from the edge of a cliff  at its base in its projected shadow gleamed certain dim sculptures which i wonderingly approached  one of the images on the left of the palace door was a magnificent colossus shining through the dusky air like a sentinel who has taken the alarm  in a moment i recognised him as michael angelos david  i turned with a certain relief from his sinister strength to a slender figure in bronze stationed beneath the high light loggia which opposes the free and elegant span of its arches to the dead masonry of the palace a figure supremely shapely and graceful gentle almost in spite of his holding out with his light nervous arm the snaky head of the slaughtered gorgon  his name is perseus and you may read his story not in the greek mythology but in the memoirs of benvenuto cellini  glancing from one of these fine fellows to the other i probably uttered some irrepressible commonplace of praise for as if provoked by my voice a man rose from the steps of the loggia where he had been sitting in the shadow and addressed me in good englisha small slim personage clad in a sort of black velvet tunic as it seemed and with a mass of auburn hair which gleamed in the moonlight escaping from a little mediaeval birretta  in a tone of the most insinuating deference he asked me for my impressions  he seemed picturesque fantastic slightly unreal  hovering there in this consecrated neighbourhood he might have passed for the genius of aesthetic hospitalityif the genius of aesthetic hospitality were not commonly some shabby little custode flourishing a calico pockethandkerchief and openly resentful of the divided franc  this analogy was made none the less complete by the brilliant tirade with which he greeted my embarrassed silence  i have known florence long sir but i have never known her so lovely as tonight  its as if the ghosts of her past were abroad in the empty streets  the present is sleeping the past hovers about us like a dream made visible  fancy the old florentines strolling up in couples to pass judgment on the last performance of michael of benvenuto  we should come in for a precious lesson if we might overhear what they say  the plainest burgher of them in his cap and gown had a taste in the matter that was the prime of art sir  the sun stood high in heaven and his broad and equal blaze made the darkest places bright and the dullest eyes clear  we live in the evening of time  we grope in the gray dusk carrying each our poor little taper of selfish and painful wisdom holding it up to the great models and to the dim idea and seeing nothing but overwhelming greatness and dimness  the days of illumination are gone  but do you know i fancyi fancyand he grew suddenly almost familiar in this visionary fervouri fancy the light of that time rests upon us here for an hour  i have never seen the david so grand the perseus so fair  even the inferior productions of john of bologna and of baccio bandinelli seem to realise the artists dream  i feel as if the moonlit air were charged with the secrets of the masters and as if standing here in religious attention we mightwe might witness a revelation  perceiving at this moment i suppose my halting comprehension reflected in my puzzled face this interesting rhapsodist paused and blushed  then with a melancholy smile you think me a moonstruck charlatan i suppose  its not my habit to bang about the piazza and pounce upon innocent tourists  but tonight i confess i am under the charm  and then somehow i fancied you too were an artist  i am not an artist i am sorry to say as you must understand the term but pray make no apologies  i am also under the charm your eloquent remarks have only deepened it  if you are not an artist you are worthy to be one he rejoined with an expressive smile  a young man who arrives at florence late in the evening and instead of going prosaically to bed or hanging over the travellers book at his hotel walks forth without loss of time to pay his devoirs to the beautiful is a young man after my own heart  the mystery was suddenly solved my friend was an american  he must have been to take the picturesque so prodigiously to heart  none the less so i trust i answered if the young man is a sordid new yorker  new yorkers have been munificent patrons of art he answered urbanely  for a moment i was alarmed  was this midnight reverie mere yankee enterprise and was he simply a desperate brother of the brush who had posted himself here to extort an order from a sauntering tourist  but i was not called to defend myself  a great brazen note broke suddenly from the faroff summit of the belltower above us and sounded the first stroke of midnight  my companion started apologised for detaining me and prepared to retire  but he seemed to offer so lively a promise of further entertainment that i was indisposed to part with him and suggested that we should stroll homeward together  he cordially assented so we turned out of the piazza passed down before the statued arcade of the uffizi and came out upon the arno  what course we took i hardly remember but we roamed slowly about for an hour my companion delivering by snatches a sort of moontouched aesthetic lecture  i listened in puzzled fascination and wondered who the deuce he was  he confessed with a melancholy but allrespectful headshake to his american origin  we are the disinherited of art he cried  we are condemned to be superficial  we are excluded from the magic circle  the soil of american perception is a poor little barren artificial deposit  yes we are wedded to imperfection  an american to excel has just ten times as much to learn as a european  we lack the deeper sense  we have neither taste nor tact nor power  how should we have them  our crude and garish climate our silent past our deafening present the constant pressure about us of unlovely circumstance are as void of all that nourishes and prompts and inspires the artist as my sad heart is void of bitterness in saying so  we poor aspirants must live in perpetual exile  you seem fairly at home in exile i answered and florence seems to me a very pretty siberia  but do you know my own thought  nothing is so idle as to talk about our want of a nutritive soil of opportunity of inspiration and all the rest of it  the worthy part is to do something fine  there is no law in our glorious constitution against that  invent create achieve  no matter if you have to study fifty times as much as one of these  what else are you an artist for  be you our moses i added laughing and laying my hand on his shoulder and lead us out of the house of bondage  golden wordsgolden words young man he cried with a tender smile invent create achieve  yes thats our business i know it well dont take me in heavens name for one of your barren complainersimpotent cynics who have neither talent nor faith  i am at workand he glanced about him and lowered his voice as if this were a quite peculiar secretim at work night and day  i have undertaken a creation  i am no moses i am only a poor patient artist but it would be a fine thing if i were to cause some slender stream of beauty to flow in our thirsty land  dont think me a monster of conceit he went on as he saw me smile at the avidity with which he adopted my illustration i confess that i am in one of those moods when great things seem possible  this is one of my nervous nightsi dream waking  when the south wind blows over florence at midnight it seems to coax the soul from all the fair things locked away in her churches and galleries it comes into my own little studio with the moonlight and sets my heart beating too deeply for rest  you see i am always adding a thought to my conception  this evening i felt that i couldnt sleep unless i had communed with the genius of buonarotti  he seemed deeply versed in local history and tradition and he expatiated con amore on the charms of florence  i gathered that he was an old resident and that he had taken the lovely city into his heart  i owe her everything he declared  its only since i came here that i have really lived intellectually  one by one all profane desires all mere worldly aims have dropped away from me and left me nothing but my pencil my little notebook and he tapped his breastpocket and the worship of the pure mastersthose who were pure because they were innocent and those who were pure because they were strong  and have you been very productive all this time i asked sympathetically  he was silent a while before replying  not in the vulgar sense he said at last  i have chosen never to manifest myself by imperfection the good in every performance i have reabsorbed into the generative force of new creations the badthere is always plenty of thati have religiously destroyed  i may say with some satisfaction that i have not added a mite to the rubbish of the world  as a proof of my conscientiousnessand he stopped short and eyed me with extraordinary candour as if the proof were to be overwhelmingi have never sold a picture  at least no merchant traffics in my heart  do you remember that divine line in browning  my little studio has never been profaned by superficial feverish mercenary work  its a temple of labour but of leisure  art is long  if we work for ourselves of course we must hurry  if we work for her we must often pause  she can wait  this had brought us to my hotel door somewhat to my relief i confess for i had begun to feel unequal to the society of a genius of this heroic strain  i left him however not without expressing a friendly hope that we should meet again  the next morning my curiosity had not abated i was anxious to see him by common daylight  i counted upon meeting him in one of the many pictorial haunts of florence and i was gratified without delay  i found him in the course of the morning in the tribune of the uffizithat little treasurechamber of worldfamous things  he had turned his back on the venus de medici and with his arms resting on the railmug which protects the pictures and his head buried in his hands he was lost in the contemplation of that superb triptych of andrea mantegnaa work which has neither the material splendour nor the commanding force of some of its neighbours but which glowing there with the loveliness of patient labour suits possibly a more constant need of the soul  i looked at the picture for some time over his shoulder at last with a heavy sigh he turned away and our eyes met  as he recognised me a deep blush rose to his face he fancied perhaps that he had made a fool of himself overnight  but i offered him my hand with a friendliness which assured him i was not a scoffer  i knew him by his ardent chevelure otherwise he was much altered  his midnight mood was over and he looked as haggard as an actor by daylight  he was far older than i had supposed and he had less bravery of costume and gesture  he seemed the quiet poor patient artist he had proclaimed himself and the fact that he had never sold a picture was more obvious than glorious  his velvet coat was threadbare and his short slouched hat of an antique pattern revealed a rustiness which marked it an original and not one of the picturesque reproductions which brethren of his craft affect  his eye was mild and heavy and his expression singularly gentle and acquiescent the more so for a certain pallid leanness of visage which i hardly knew whether to refer to the consuming fire of genius or to a meagre diet  a very little talk however cleared his brow and brought back his eloquence  and this is your first visit to these enchanted halls he cried happy thrice happy youth  and taking me by the arm he prepared to lead me to each of the preeminent works in turn and show me the cream of the gallery  but before we left the mantegna he pressed my arm and gave it a loving look  he was not in a hurry he murmured  he knew nothing of raw haste halfsister to delay  how sound a critic my friend was i am unable to say but he was an extremely amusing one overflowing with opinions theories and sympathies with disquisition and gossip and anecdote  he was a shade too sentimental for my own sympathies and i fancied he was rather too fond of superfine discriminations and of discovering subtle intentions in shallow places at moments too he plunged into the sea of metaphysics and floundered a while in waters too deep for intellectual security  but his abounding knowledge and happy judgment told a touching story of long attentive hours in this worshipful company there was a reproach to my wasteful saunterings in so devoted a culture of opportunity  there are two moods i remember his saying in which we may walk through galleriesthe critical and the ideal  they seize us at their pleasure and we can never tell which is to take its turn  the critical mood oddly is the genial one the friendly the condescending  it relishes the pretty trivialities of art its vulgar cleverness its conscious graces  it has a kindly greeting for anything which looks as if according to his light the painter had enjoyed doing itfor the little dutch cabbages and kettles for the taper fingers and breezy mantles of latecoming madonnas for the little bluehilled pastoral sceptical italian landscapes  then there are the days of fierce fastidious longingsolemn church feasts of the intellectwhen all vulgar effort and all petty success is a weariness and everything but the bestthe best of the bestdisgusts  in these hours we are relentless aristocrats of taste  we will not take michael angelo for granted we will not swallow raphael whole  the gallery of the uffizi is not only rich in its possessions but peculiarly fortunate in that fine architectural accident as one may call it which unites itwith the breadth of river and city between themto those princely chambers of the pitti palace  the louvre and the vatican hardly give you such a sense of sustained inclosure as those long passages projected over street and stream to establish a sort of inviolate transition between the two palaces of art  we passed along the gallery in which those precious drawings by eminent hands hang chaste and gray above the swirl and murmur of the yellow arno and reached the ducal saloons of the pitti  ducal as they are it must be confessed that they are imperfect as showrooms and that with their deepset windows and their massive mouldings it is rather a broken light that reaches the pictured walls  but here the masterpieces hang thick and you seem to see them in a luminous atmosphere of their own  and the great saloons with their superb dim ceilings their outer wall in splendid shadow and the sombre opposite glow of mellow canvas and dusky gilding make themselves almost as fine a picture as the titians and raphaels they imperfectly reveal  we lingered briefly before many a raphael and titian but i saw my friend was impatient and i suffered him at last to lead me directly to the goal of our journeythe most tenderly fair of raphaels virgins the madonna in the chair  of all the fine pictures of the world it seemed to me this is the one with which criticism has least to do  none betrays less effort less of the mechanism of success and of the irrepressible discord between conception and result which shows dimly in so many consummate works  graceful human near to our sympathies as it is it has nothing of manner of method nothing almost of style it blooms there in rounded softness as instinct with harmony as if it were an immediate exhalation of genius  the figure melts away the spectators mind into a sort of passionate tenderness which he knows not whether he has given to heavenly purity or to earthly charm  he is intoxicated with the fragrance of the tenderest blossom of maternity that ever bloomed on earth  thats what i call a fine picture said my companion after we had gazed a while in silence  i have a right to say so for i have copied it so often and so carefully that i could repeat it now with my eyes shut  other works are of raphael this is raphael himself  others you can praise you can qualify you can measure explain account for this you can only love and admire  i dont know in what seeming he walked among men while this divine mood was upon him but after it surely he could do nothing but die this world had nothing more to teach him  think of it a while my friend and you will admit that i am not raving  think of his seeing that spotless image not for a moment for a day in a happy dream or a restless feverfit not as a poet in a five minutes frenzytime to snatch his phrase and scribble his immortal stanza but for days together while the slow labour of the brush went on while the foul vapours of life interposed and the fancy ached with tension fixed radiant distinct as we see it now  what a master certainly  but ah what a seer  dont you imagine i answered that he had a model and that some pretty young woman  as pretty a young woman as you please  it doesnt diminish the miracle he took his hint of course and the young woman possibly sat smiling before his canvas  but meanwhile the painters idea had taken wings no lovely human outline could charm it to vulgar fact  he saw the fair form made perfect he rose to the vision without tremor without effort of wing he communed with it face to face and resolved into finer and lovelier truth the purity which completes it as the fragrance completes the rose  thats what they call idealism the words vastly abused but the thing is good  its my own creed at any rate  lovely madonna model at once and muse i call you to witness that i too am an idealist  an idealist then i said half jocosely wishing to provoke him to further utterance is a gentleman who says to nature in the person of a beautiful girl go to you are all wrong  your fine is coarse your bright is dim your grace is gaucherie  this is the way you should have done it  is not the chance against him  he turned upon me almost angrily but perceiving the genial savour of my sarcasm he smiled gravely  look at that picture he said and cease your irreverent mockery  idealism is that  theres no explaining it one must feel the flame  it says nothing to nature or to any beautiful girl that they will not both forgive  it says to the fair woman accept me as your artist friend lend me your beautiful face trust me help me and your eyes shall be half my masterpiece  no one so loves and respects the rich realities of nature as the artist whose imagination caresses and flatters them  he knows what a fact may hold whether raphael knew you may judge by his portrait behind us there of tommaso inghirami bad his fancy hovers above it as anal hovered above the sleeping prince  there is only one raphael bad an artist may still be an artist  as i said last night the days of illumination are gone visions are rare we have to look long to see them  but in meditation we may still cultivate the ideal round it smooth it perfect it  the resultthe result here his voice faltered suddenly and he fixed his eyes for a moment on the picture when they met my own again they were full of tearsthe result may be less than this but still it may be good it may be great he cried with vehemence  it may hang somewhere in after years in goodly company and keep the artists memory warm  think of being known to mankind after some such fashion as this of hanging here through the slow centuries in the gaze of an altered world living on and on in the cunning of an eye and hand that are part of the dust of ages a delight and a law to remote generations making beauty a force and purity an example  heaven forbid i said smiling that i should take the wind out of your sails  but doesnt it occur to you that besides being strong in his genius raphael was happy in a certain good faith of which we have lost the trick  there are people i know who deny that his spotless madonnas are anything more than pretty blondes of that period enhanced by the raphaelesque touch which they declare is a profane touch  be that as it may peoples religious and aesthetic needs went arm in arm and there was as i may say a demand for the blessed virgin visible and adorable which must have given firmness to the artists hand  i am afraid there is no demand now  my companion seemed painfully puzzled he shivered as it were in this chilling blast of scepticism  then shaking his head with sublime confidencethere is always a demand he cried that ineffable type is one of the eternal needs of mans heart but pious souls long for it in silence almost in shame  let it appear and their faith grows brave how should it appear in this corrupt generation  it cannot be made to order  it could indeed when the order came trumpettoned from the lips of the church herself and was addressed to genius panting with inspiration  but it can spring now only from the soil of passionate labour and culture  do you really fancy that while from time to time a man of complete artistic vision is born into the world that image can perish  the man who paints it has painted everything  the subject admits of every perfectionform colour expression composition  it can be as simple as you please and yet as rich as broad and pure and yet as full of delicate detail  think of the chance for flesh in the little naked nestling child irradiating divinity of the chance for drapery in the chaste and ample garment of the mother think of the great story you compress into that simple theme  think above all of the mothers face and its ineffable suggestiveness of the mingled burden of joy and trouble the tenderness turned to worship and the worship turned to farseeing pity  then look at it all in perfect line and lovely colour breathing truth and beauty and mastery  anch io son pittore i cried  unless i am mistaken you have a masterpiece on the stocks  if you put all that in you will do more than raphael himself did  let me know when your picture is finished and wherever in the wide world i may be i will post back to florence and pay my respects tothe madonna of the future  he blushed vividly and gave a heavy sigh half of protest half of resignation  i dont often mention my picture by name  i detest this modern custom of premature publicity  a great work needs silence privacy mystery even  and then do you know people are so cruel so frivolous so unable to imagine a mans wishing to paint a madonna at this time of day that i have been laughed atlaughed at sir and his blush deepened to crimson  i dont know what has prompted me to be so frank and trustful with you  you look as if you wouldnt laugh at me  my dear young manand he laid his hand on my armi am worthy of respect whatever my talents may be i am honest  there is nothing grotesque in a pure ambition or in a life devoted to it  there was something so sternly sincere in his look and tone that further questions seemed impertinent  i had repeated opportunity to ask them however for after this we spent much time together  daily for a fortnight we met by appointment to see the sights  he knew the city so well he had strolled and lounged so often through its streets and churches and galleries he was so deeply versed in its greater and lesser memories so imbued with the local genius that he was an altogether ideal valet de place and i was glad enough to leave my murray at home and gather facts and opinions alike from his gossiping commentary  he talked of florence like a lover and admitted that it was a very old affair he had lost his heart to her at first sight  its the fashion to talk of all cities as feminine he said but as a rule its a monstrous mistake  is florence of the same sex as new york as chicago she is the sole perfect lady of them all one feels towards her as a lad in his teens feels to some beautiful older woman with a history  she fills you with a sort of aspiring gallantry  this disinterested passion seemed to stand my friend in stead of the common social ties he led a lonely life and cared for nothing but his work  i was duly flattered by his having taken my frivolous self into his favour and by his generous sacrifice of precious hours to my society  we spent many of these hours among those early paintings in which florence is so rich returning ever and anon with restless sympathies to wonder whether these tender blossoms of art had not a vital fragrance and savour more precious than the fullfruited knowledge of the later works  we lingered often in the sepulchral chapel of san lorenzo and watched michael angelos dimvisaged warrior sitting there like some awful genius of doubt and brooding behind his eternal mask upon the mysteries of life  we stood more than once in the little convent chambers where fra angelico wrought as if an angel indeed had held his hand and gathered that sense of scattered dews and early birdnotes which makes an hour among his relics seem like a morning stroll in some monkish garden  we did all this and much morewandered into dark chapels damp courts and dusty palacerooms in quest of lingering hints of fresco and lurking treasures of carving  i was more and more impressed with my companions remarkable singleness of purpose  everything was a pretext for some wildly idealistic rhapsody or reverie  nothing could be seen or said that did not lead him sooner or later to a glowing discourse on the true the beautiful and the good if my friend was not a genius he was certainly a monomaniac and i found as great a fascination in watching the odd lights and shades of his character as if he had been a creature from another planet  he seemed indeed to know very little of this one and lived and moved altogether in his own little province of art  a creature more unsullied by the world it is impossible to conceive and i often thought it a flaw in his artistic character that he had not a harmless vice or two  it amused me greatly at times to think that he was of our shrewd yankee race but after all there could be no better token of his american origin than this high aesthetic fever  the very heat of his devotion was a sign of conversion those born to european opportunity manage better to reconcile enthusiasm with comfort  he had moreover all our native mistrust for intellectual discretion and our native relish for sonorous superlatives as a critic he was very much more generous than just and his mildest terms of approbation were stupendous transcendent and incomparable  the small change of admiration seemed to him no coin for a gentleman to handle and yet frank as he was intellectually he was personally altogether a mystery  his professions somehow were all half professions and his allusions to his work and circumstances left something dimly ambiguous in the background  he was modest and proud and never spoke of his domestic matters  he was evidently poor yet he must have had some slender independence since he could afford to make so merry over the fact that his culture of ideal beauty had never brought him a penny  his poverty i supposed was his motive for neither inviting me to his lodging nor mentioning its whereabouts  we met either in some public place or at my hotel where i entertained him as freely as i might without appearing to be prompted by charity  he seemed always hungry and this was his nearest approach to human grossness  i made a point of asking no impertinent questions but each time we met i ventured to make some respectful allusion to the magnum opus to inquire as it were as to its health and progress  we are getting on with the lords help he would say with a grave smile  we are doing well  you see i have the grand advantage that i lose no time  these hours i spend with you are pure profit  they are suggestive  just as the truly religious soul is always at worship the genuine artist is always in labour  he takes his property wherever he finds it and learns some precious secret from every object that stands up in the light  if you but knew the rapture of observation  i gather with every glance some hint for light for colour or relief  when i get home i pour out my treasures into the lap of toy madonna  oh i am not idle  nulla dies sine linea  i was introduced in florence to an american lady whose drawingroom had long formed an attractive place of reunion for the foreign residents  she lived on a fourth floor and she was not rich but she offered her visitors very good tea little cakes at option and conversation not quite to match  her conversation had mainly an aesthetic flavour for mrs coventry was famously artistic  her apartment was a sort of pitti palace au petit pied  she possessed early masters by the dozena cluster of peruginos in her diningroom a giotto in her boudoir an andrea del sarto over her drawingroom chimneypiece  surrounded by these treasures and by innumerable bronzes mosaics majolica dishes and little wormeaten diptychs covered with angular saints on gilded backgrounds our hostess enjoyed the dignity of a sort of highpriestess of the arts  she always wore on her bosom a huge miniature copy of the madonna della seggiola  gaining her ear quietly one evening i asked her whether she knew that remarkable man mr theobald  know him she exclaimed know poor theobald  all florence knows him his flamecoloured locks his black velvet coat his interminable harangues on the beautiful and his wondrous madonna that mortal eye has never seen and that mortal patience has quite given up expecting  really i cried you dont believe in his madonna  my dear ingenuous youth rejoined my shrewd friend has he made a convert of you  well we all believed in him once he came down upon florence and took the town by storm  another raphael at the very least had been born among men and the poor dear united states were to have the credit of him  hadnt he the very hair of raphael flowing down on his shoulders  the hair alas but not the head  we swallowed him whole however we hung upon his lips and proclaimed his genius on the house tops  the women were all dying to sit to him for their portraits and be made immortal like leonardos joconde  we decided that his manner was a good deal like leonardosmysterious and inscrutable and fascinating mysterious it certainly was mystery was the beginning and the end of it the months passed by and the miracle hung fire our master never produced his masterpiece  he passed hours in the galleries and churches posturing musing and gazing he talked more than ever about the beautiful but he never put brush to canvas  we had all subscribed as it were to the great performance but as it never came off people began to ask for their money again  i was one of the last of the faithful i carried devotion so far as to sit to him for my head  if you could have seen the horrible creature he made of me you would admit that even a woman with no more vanity than will tie her bonnet straight must have cooled off then  the man didnt know the very alphabet of drawing  his strong point he intimated was his sentiment but is it a consolation when one has been painted a fright to know it has been done with peculiar gusto  one by one i confess we fell away from the faith and mr theobald didnt lift his little finger to preserve us  at the first hint that we were tired of waiting and that we should like the show to begin he was off in a huff  great work requires time contemplation privacy mystery  o ye of little faith  we answered that we didnt insist on a great work that the fiveact tragedy might come at his convenience that we merely asked for something to keep us from yawning some inexpensive little lever de rideau  hereupon the poor man took his stand as a genius misconceived and persecuted an ame meconnue and washed his hands of us from that hour  no i believe he does me the honour to consider me the head and front of the conspiracy formed to nip his glory in the buda bud that has taken twenty years to blossom  ask him if he knows me and he will tell you i am a horribly ugly old woman who has vowed his destruction because he wont paint her portrait as a pendant to titians flora  i fancy that since then he has had none but chance followers innocent strangers like yourself who have taken him at his word  the mountain is still in labour i have not heard that the mouse has been born  i pass him once in a while in the galleries and he fixes his great dark eyes on me with a sublimity of indifference as if i were a bad copy of a sassoferrato  it is a long time ago now that i heard that he was making studies for a madonna who was to be a resume of all the other madonnas of the italian schoollike that antique venus who borrowed a nose from one great image and an ankle from another  its certainly a masterly idea  the parts may be fine but when i think of my unhappy portrait i tremble for the whole  he has communicated this striking idea under the pledge of solemn secrecy to fifty chosen spirits to every one he has ever been able to buttonhole for five minutes  i suppose he wants to get an order for it and he is not to blame for heaven knows how he lives  i see by your blush my hostess frankly continued that you have been honoured with his confidence  you neednt be ashamed my dear young man a man of your age is none the worse for a certain generous credulity  only allow me to give you a word of advice keep your credulity out of your pockets  dont pay for the picture till its delivered  you have not been treated to a peep at it i imagine  no more have your fifty predecessors in the faith  there are people who doubt whether there is any picture to be seen  i fancy myself that if one were to get into his studio one would find something very like the picture in that tale of balzacsa mere mass of incoherent scratches and daubs a jumble of dead paint  i listened to this pungent recital in silent wonder  it had a painfully plausible sound and was not inconsistent with certain shy suspicions of my own  my hostess was not only a clever woman but presumably a generous one  i determined to let my judgment wait upon events  possibly she was right but if she was wrong she was cruelly wrong  her version of my friends eccentricities made me impatient to see him again and examine him in the light of public opinion  on our next meeting i immediately asked him if he knew mrs coventry  he laid his hand on my arm and gave me a sad smile  has she taxed your gallantry at last he asked  shes a foolish woman  shes frivolous and heartless and she pretends to be serious and kind  she prattles about giottos second manner and vittoria colonnas liaison with michaelone would think that michael lived across the way and was expected in to take a hand at whistbut she knows as little about art and about the conditions of production as i know about buddhism  she profanes sacred words he added more vehemently after a pause  she cares for you only as some one to band teacups in that horrible mendacious little parlour of hers with its trumpery peruginos  if you cant dash off a new picture every three days and let her hand it round among her guests she tells them in plain english that you are an impostor  this attempt of mine to test mrs coventrys accuracy was made in the course of a late afternoon walk to the quiet old church of san miniato on one of the hilltops which directly overlook the city from whose gates you are guided to it by a stony and cypressbordered walk which seems a very fitting avenue to a shrine  no spot is more propitious to lingering repose than the broad terrace in front of the church where lounging against the parapet you may glance in slow alternation from the black and yellow marbles of the church facade seamed and cracked with time and windsown with a tender flora of its own down to the full domes and slender towers of florence and over to the blue sweep of the wide mouthed cup of mountains into whose hollow the little treasure city has been dropped  i had proposed as a diversion from the painful memories evoked by mrs coventrys name that theobald should go with me the next evening to the opera where some rarelyplayed work was to be given  he declined as i half expected for i observed that he regularly kept his evenings in reserve and never alluded to his manner of passing them you have reminded me before i said smiling of that charming speech of the florentine painter in alfred de mussets lorenzaccio i do no harm to anyone  i pass my days in my studio on sunday i go to the annunziata or to santa mario the monks think i have a voice they dress me in a white gown and a red cap and i take a share in the choruses sometimes i do a little solo these are the only times i go into public in the evening i visit my sweetheart when the night is fine we pass it on her balcony  i dont know whether you have a sweetheart or whether she has a balcony  but if you are so happy its certainly better than trying to find a charm in a thirdrate prima donna  he made no immediate response but at last he turned to me solemnly  can you look upon a beautiful woman with reverent eyes  really i said i dont pretend to be sheepish but i should be sorry to think i was impudent  and i asked him what in the world he meant when at last i had assured him that i could undertake to temper admiration with respect he informed me with an air of religious mystery that it was in his power to introduce me to the most beautiful woman in italya beauty with a soul  upon my word i cried you are extremely fortunate and that is a most attractive description  this womans beauty he went on is a lesson a morality a poem  its my daily study  of course after this i lost no time in reminding him of what before we parted had taken the shape of a promise  i feel somehow he had said as if it were a sort of violation of that privacy in which i have always contemplated her beauty  this is friendship my friend  no hint of her existence has ever fallen from my lips  but with too great a familiarity we are apt to lose a sense of the real value of things and you perhaps will throw some new light upon it and offer a fresher interpretation  we went accordingly by appointment to a certain ancient house in the heart of florencethe precinct of the mercato vecchioand climbed a dark steep staircase to the very summit of the edifice  theobalds beauty seemed as loftily exalted above the line of common vision as his artistic ideal was lifted above the usual practice of men  he passed without knocking into the dark vestibule of a small apartment and flinging open an inner door ushered me into a small saloon  the room seemed mean and sombre though i caught a glimpse of white curtains swaying gently at an open window  at a table near a lamp sat a woman dressed in black working at a piece of embroidery  as theobald entered she looked up calmly with a smile but seeing me she made a movement of surprise and rose with a kind of stately grace  theobald stepped forward took her hand and kissed it with an indescribable air of immemorial usage  as he bent his head she looked at me askance and i thought she blushed  behold the serafina said theobald frankly waving me forward  this is a friend and a lover of the arts he added introducing me  i received a smile a curtsey and a request to be seated  the most beautiful woman in italy was a person of a generous italian type and of a great simplicity of demeanour  seated again at her lamp with her embroidery she seemed to have nothing whatever to say  theobald bending towards her in a sort of platonic ecstasy asked her a dozen paternally tender questions as to her health her state of mind her occupations and the progress of her embroidery which he examined minutely and summoned me to admire  it was some portion of an ecclesiastical vestmentyellow satin wrought with an elaborate design of silver and gold  she made answer in a full rich voice but with a brevity which i hesitated whether to attribute to native reserve or to the profane constraint of my presence  she had been that morning to confession she had also been to market and had bought a chicken for dinner  she felt very happy she had nothing to complain of except that the people for whom she was making her vestment and who furnished her materials should be willing to put such rotten silver thread into the garment as one might say of the lord  from time to time as she took her slow stitches she raised her eyes and covered me with a glance which seemed at first to denote a placid curiosity but in which as i saw it repeated i thought i perceived the dim glimmer of an attempt to establish an understanding with me at the expense of our companion meanwhile as mindful as possible of theobalds injunction of reverence i considered the ladys personal claims to the fine compliment he had paid her  that she was indeed a beautiful woman i perceived after recovering from the surprise of finding her without the freshness of youth  her beauty was of a sort which in losing youth loses little of its essential charm expressed for the most part as it was in form and structure and as theobald would have said in composition  she was broad and ample lowbrowed and largeeyed dark and pale  her thick brown hair hung low beside her cheek and ear and seemed to drape her head with a covering as chaste and formal as the veil of a nun  the poise and carriage of her head were admirably free and noble and they were the more effective that their freedom was at moments discreetly corrected by a little sanctimonious droop which harmonised admirably with the level gaze of her dark and quiet eye  a strong serene physical nature and the placid temper which comes of no nerves and no troubles seemed this ladys comfortable portion  she was dressed in plain dull black save for a sort of dark blue kerchief which was folded across her bosom and exposed a glimpse of her massive throat  over this kerchief was suspended a little silver cross  i admired her greatly and yet with a large reserve  a certain mild intellectual apathy belonged properly to her type of beauty and had always seemed to round and enrich it but this bourgeoise egeria if i viewed her right betrayed a rather vulgar stagnation of mind  there might have been once a dim spiritual light in her face but it had long since begun to wane  and furthermore in plain prose she was growing stout  my disappointment amounted very nearly to complete disenchantment when theobald as if to facilitate my covert inspection declaring that the lamp was very dim and that she would ruin her eyes without more light rose and fetched a couple of candles from the mantelpiece which he placed lighted on the table  in this brighter illumination i perceived that our hostess was decidedly an elderly woman she was neither haggard nor worn nor gray she was simply coarse  the soul which theobald had promised seemed scarcely worth making such a point of it was no deeper mystery than a sort of matronly mildness of lip and brow  i should have been ready even to declare that that sanctified bend of the head was nothing more than the trick of a person constantly working at embroidery  it occurred to me even that it was a trick of a less innocent sort for in spite of the mellow quietude of her wits this stately needlewoman dropped a hint that she took the situation rather less seriously than her friend  when he rose to light the candles she looked across at me with a quick intelligent smile and tapped her forehead with her forefinger then as from a sudden feeling of compassionate loyalty to poor theobald i preserved a blank face she gave a little shrug and resumed her work  what was the relation of this singular couple  was he the most ardent of friends or the most reverent of lovers  did she regard him as an eccentric swain whose benevolent admiration of her beauty she was not ill pleased to humour at this small cost of having him climb into her little parlour and gossip of summer nights  with her decent and sombre dress her simple gravity and that fine piece of priestly needlework she looked like some pious laymember of a sisterhood living by special permission outside her convent walls  or was she maintained here aloft by her friend in comfortable leisure so that he might have before him the perfect eternal type uncorrupted and untarnished by the struggle for existence  her shapely hands i observed wore very fair and white they lacked the traces of what is called honest toil  and the pictures how do they come on she asked of theobald after a long pause  finely finely  i have here a friend whose sympathy and encouragement give me new faith and ardour  our hostess turned to me gazed at me a moment rather inscrutably and then tapping her forehead with the gesture she had used a minute before he has a magnificent genius she said with perfect gravity  i am inclined to think so i answered with a smile  eh why do you smile she cried  if you doubt it you must see the bambino  and she took the lamp and conducted me to the other side of the room where on the wall in a plain black frame hung a large drawing in red chalk  beneath it was fastened a little howl for holy water  the drawing represented a very young child entirely naked half nestling back against his mothers gown but with his two little arms outstretched as if in the act of benediction  it was executed with singular freedom and power and yet seemed vivid with the sacred bloom of infancy  a sort of dimpled elegance and grace mingled with its boldness recalled the touch of correggio  thats what he can do said my hostess  its the blessed little boy whom i lost  its his very image and the signor teobaldo gave it me as a gift  he has given me many things besides  i looked at the picture for some time and admired it immensely  turning back to theobald i assured him that if it were hung among the drawings in the uffizi and labelled with a glorious name it would hold its own  my praise seemed to give him extreme pleasure he pressed my hands and his eyes filled with tears  it moved him apparently with the desire to expatiate on the history of the drawing for he rose and made his adieux to our companion kissing her band with the same mild ardour as before it occurred to me that the offer of a similar piece of gallantry on my own part might help me to know what manner of woman she was  when she perceived my intention she withdrew her hand dropped her eyes solemnly and made me a severe curtsey  theobald took my arm and led me rapidly into the street  and what do you think of the divine serafina he cried with fervour  it is certainly an excellent style of good looks i answered  he eyed me an instant askance and then seemed hurried along by the current of remembrance  you should have seen the mother and the child together seen them as i first saw themthe mother with her head draped in a shawl a divine trouble in her face and the bambino pressed to her bosom  you would have said i think that raphael had found his match in common chance  i was coming in one summer night from a long walk in the country when i met this apparition at the city gate  the woman held out her hand  i hardly knew whether to say what do you want or to fall down and worship  she asked for a little money  i saw that she was beautiful and pale she might have stepped out of the stable of bethlehem  i gave her money and helped her on her way into the town  i had guessed her story  she too was a maiden mother and she had been turned out into the world in her shame  i felt in all my pulses that here was my subject marvellously realised  i felt like one of the old monkish artists who had had a vision  i rescued the poor creatures cherished them watched them as i would have done some precious work of art some lovely fragment of fresco discovered in a mouldering cloister in a monthas if to deepen and sanctify the sadness and sweetness of it allthe poor little child died  when she felt that he was going she held him up to me for ten minutes and i made that sketch  you saw a feverish haste in it i suppose i wanted to spare the poor little mortal the pain of his position  after that i doubly valued the mother  she is the simplest sweetest most natural creature that ever bloomed in this brave old land of italy  she lives in the memory of her child in her gratitude for the scanty kindness i have been able to show her and in her simple religion  she is not even conscious of her beauty my admiration has never made her vain  heaven knows that i have made no secret of it  you must have observed the singular transparency of her expression the lovely modesty of her glance  and was there ever such a truly virginal brow such a natural classic elegance in the wave of the hair and the arch of the forehead  i have studied her i may say i know her  i have absorbed her little by little my mind is stamped and imbued and i have determined now to clinch the impression i shall at last invite her to sit for me  at lastat last i repeated in much amazement  do you mean that she has never done so yet  i have not really hadaa sitting said theobald speaking very slowly  i have taken notes you know i have got my grand fundamental impression  thats the great thing  but i have not actually had her as a model posed and draped and lighted before my easel  what had become for the moment of my perception and my tact i am at a loss to say in their absence i was unable to repress a headlong exclamation  i was destined to regret it  we had stopped at a turning beneath a lamp  my poor friend i exclaimed laying my hand on his shoulder you have dawdled  shes an old old womanfor a madonna  it was as if i had brutally struck him i shall never forget the long slow almost ghastly look of pain with which he answered me  dawdledold old he stammered  are you joking  why my dear fellow i suppose you dont take her for a woman of twenty  he drew a long breath and leaned against a house looking at me with questioning protesting reproachful eyes  at last starting forward and grasping my armanswer me solemnly does she seem to you truly old is she wrinkled is she faded am i blind  then at last i understood the immensity of his illusion how one by one the noiseless years had ebbed away and left him brooding in charmed inaction for ever preparing for a work for ever deferred  it seemed to me almost a kindness now to tell him the plain truth  i should be sorry to say you are blind i answered but i think you are deceived  you have lost time in effortless contemplation  your friend was once young and fresh and virginal but i protest that was some years ago  still she has de beaux restes  by all means make her sit for you i broke down his face was too horribly reproachful  he took off his hat and stood passing his handkerchief mechanically over his forehead  de beaux restes  i thank you for sparing me the plain english  i must make up my madonna out of de beaux restes  what a masterpiece she will be  oldold  oldold he murmured  never mind her age i cried revolted at what i had done never mind my impression of her  you have your memory your notes your genius finish your picture in a month  i pronounce it beforehand a masterpiece and i hereby offer you for it any sum you may choose to ask  he stared but he seemed scarcely to understand me  oldold he kept stupidly repeating  if she is old what am i  if her beauty has faded wherewhere is my strength  has life been a dream  have i worshipped too longhave i loved too well  the charm in truth was broken  that the chord of illusion should have snapped at my light accidental touch showed how it had been weakened by excessive tension  the poor fellows sense of wasted time of vanished opportunity seemed to roll in upon his soul in waves of darkness  he suddenly dropped his head and burst into tears  i led him homeward with all possible tenderness but i attempted neither to check his grief to restore his equanimity nor to unsay the hard truth  when we reached my hotel i tried to induce him to come so  we will drink a glass of wine i said smiling to the completion of the madonna  with a violent effort he held up his head mused for a moment with a formidably sombre frown and then giving me his hand i will finish it he cried in a month  no in a fortnight  after all i have it here  and he tapped his forehead  of course shes old  she can afford to have it said of hera woman who has made twenty years pass like a twelvemonth  oldold  why sir she shall be eternal  i wished to see him safely to his own door but he waved me back and walked away with an air of resolution whistling and swinging his cane  i waited a moment and then followed him at a distance and saw him proceed to cross the santa trinita bridge  when he reached the middle he suddenly paused as if his strength had deserted him and leaned upon the parapet gazing over into the river  i was careful to keep him in sight i confess that i passed ten very nervous minutes  he recovered himself at last and went his way slowly and with hanging head  that i had really startled poor theobald into a bolder use of his long garnered stores of knowledge and taste into the vulgar effort and hazard of production seemed at first reason enough for his continued silence and absence but as day followed day without his either calling or sending me a line and without my meeting him in his customary haunts in the galleries in the chapel at san lorenzo or strolling between the arno side and the great hedgescreen of verdure which along the drive of the cascine throws the fair occupants of barouche and phaeton into such becoming reliefas for more than a week i got neither tidings nor sight of him i began to fear that i had fatally offended him and that instead of giving a wholesome impetus to his talent i had brutally paralysed it  i had a wretched suspicion that i had made him ill  my stay at florence was drawing to a close and it was important that before resuming my journey i should assure myself of the truth theobald to the last had kept his lodging a mystery and i was altogether at a loss where to look for him  the simplest course was to make inquiry of the beauty of the mercato vecchio and i confess that unsatisfied curiosity as to the lady herself counselled it as well perhaps i had done her injustice and she was as immortally fresh and fair as be conceived her  i was at any rate anxious to behold once more the ripe enchantress who had made twenty years pass as a twelvemonth  i repaired accordingly one morning to her abode climbed the interminable staircase and reached her door  it stood ajar and as i hesitated whether to enter a little servingmaid came clattering out with an empty kettle as if she had just performed some savoury errand the inner door too was open so i crossed the little vestibule and entered the room in which i had formerly been received  it had not its evening aspect  the table or one end of it was spread for a late breakfast and before it sat a gentlemanan individual at least of the male sexdoing execution upon a beefsteak and onions and a bottle of wine  at his elbow in friendly proximity was placed the lady of the house  her attitude as i entered was not that of an enchantress  with one hand she held in her lap a plate of smoking maccaroni with the other she had lifted high in air one of the pendulous filaments of this succulent compound and was in the act of slipping it gently down her throat  on the uncovered end of the table facing her companion were ranged half a dozen small statuettes of some snuffcoloured substance resembling terracotta  he brandishing his knife with ardour was apparently descanting on their merits  evidently i darkened the door  my hostess dropped liner maccaroniinto her mouth and rose hastily with a harsh exclamation and a flushed face i immediately perceived that the signora serafinas secret was even better worth knowing than i had supposed and that the way to learn it was to take it for granted  i summoned my best italian i smiled and bowed and apologised for my intrusion and in a moment whether or no i had dispelled the ladys irritation i had at least stimulated her prudence  i was welcome she said i must take a seat  this was another friend of hersalso an artist she declared with a smile which was almost amiable  her companion wiped his moustache and bowed with great civility  i saw at a glance that he was equal to the situation  he was presumably the author of the statuettes on the table and he knew a money spending forestiere when he saw one  he was a small wiry man with a clever impudent tossedup nose a sharp little black eye and waxed ends to his moustache  on the side of his head he wore jauntily a little crimson velvet smokingcap and i observed that his feet were encased in brilliant slippers  on serafinas remarking with dignity that i was the friend of mr theobald he broke out into that fantastic french of which certain italians are so insistently lavish and declared with fervour that mr theobald was a magnificent genius  i am sure i dont know i answered with a shrug  if you are in a position to affirm it you have the advantage of me  i have seen nothing from his hand but the bambino yonder which certainly is fine  he declared that the bambino was a masterpiece a pure corregio  it was only a pity he added with a knowing laugh that the sketch had not been made on some good bit of honeycombed old panel  the stately serafina hereupon protested that mr theobald was the soul of honour and that he would never lend himself to a deceit  i am not a judge of genius she said and i know nothing of pictures  i am but a poor simple widow but i know that the signor teobaldo has the heart of an angel and the virtue of a saint  he is my benefactor she added sententiously  the after glow of the somewhat sinister flush with which she had greeted me still lingered in her cheek and perhaps did not favour her beauty i could not but fancy it a wise custom of theobalds to visit her only by candlelight  she was coarse and her pour adorer was a poet  i have the greatest esteem for him i said it is for this reason that i have been uneasy at not seeing him for ten days  have you seen him  is he perhaps ill  ill  heaven forbid cried serafina with genuine vehemence  her companion uttered a rapid expletive and reproached her with not having been to see him  she hesitated a moment then she simpered the least bit and bridled  he comes to see mewithout reproach  but it would not be the same for me to go to him though indeed you may almost call him a man of holy life  he has the greatest admiration for you i said  he would have been honoured by your visit  she looked at me a moment sharply  more admiration than you  admit that  of course i protested with all the eloquence at my command and my mysterious hostess then confessed that she had taken no fancy to me on my former visit and that theobald not having returned she believed i had poisoned his mind against her  it would be no kindness to the poor gentleman i can tell you that she said  he has come to see me every evening for years  its a long friendship  no one knows him as well as i  i dont pretend to know him or to understand him i said  hes a mystery  nevertheless he seems to me a little  and i touched my forehead and waved my hand in the air  serafina glanced at her companion a moment as if for inspiration  he contented himself with shrugging his shoulders as he filled his glass again  the padrona hereupon gave me a more softly insinuating smile than would have seemed likely to bloom on so candid a brow  its for that that i love him she said  the world has so little kindness for such persons  it laughs at them and despises them and cheats them  he is too good for this wicked life  its his fancy that he finds a little paradise up here in my poor apartment  if he thinks so how can i help it  he has a strange beliefreally i ought to be ashamed to tell youthat i resemble the blessed virgin heaven forgive me  i let him think what he pleases so long as it makes him happy  he was very kind to me once and i am not one that forgets a favour  so i receive him every evening civilly and ask after his health and let him look at me on this side and that  for that matter i may say it without vanity i was worth looking at once  and hes not always amusing poor man  he sits sometimes for an hour without speaking a word or else he talks away without stopping on art and nature and beauty and duty and fifty fine things that are all so much latin to me  i beg you to understand that he has never said a word to me that i mightnt decently listen to he may be a little cracked but hes one of the blessed saints  eh cried the man the blessed saints were all a little cracked  serafina i fancied left part of her story untold but she told enough of it to make poor theobalds own statement seem intensely pathetic in its exalted simplicity  its a strange fortune certainly she went on to have such a friend as this dear mana friend who is less than a lover and more than a friend  i glanced at her companion who preserved an impenetrable smile twisted the end of his moustache and disposed of a copious mouthful  was he less than a lover but what will you have serafina pursued  in this hard world one must not ask too many questions one must take what comes and keep what one gets  i have kept my good friend for twenty years and i do hope that at this time of day signore you have not come to turn him against me  i assured her that i had no such design and that i should vastly regret disturbing mr theobalds habits or convictions  on the contrary i was alarmed about him and i should immediately go in search of him  she gave me his address and a florid account of her sufferings at his non appearance  she had not been to him for various reasons chiefly because she was afraid of displeasing him as he had always made such a mystery of his home  you might have sent this gentleman i ventured to suggest  ah cried the gentleman he admires the signora serafina but he wouldnt admire me  and then confidentially with his finger on his nose hes a purist  i was about to withdraw after having promised that i would inform the signora serafina of my friends condition when her companion who had risen from table and girded his loins apparently for the onset grasped me gently by the arm and led me before the row of statuettes  i perceive by your conversation signore that you are a patron of the arts  allow me to request your honourable attention for these modest products of my own ingenuity  they are brandnew fresh from my atelier and have never been exhibited in public  i have brought them here to receive the verdict of this dear lady who is a good critic for all she may pretend to the contrary  i am the inventor of this peculiar style of statuetteof subject manner material everything  touch them i pray you handle them freelyyou neednt fear  delicate as they look it is impossible they should break  my various creations have met with great success  they are especially admired by americans  i have sent them all over europeto london paris vienna  you may have observed some little specimens in paris on the boulevard in a shop of which they constitute the specialty  there is always a crowd about the window  they form a very pleasing ornament for the mantelshelf of a gay young bachelor for the boudoir of a pretty woman  you couldnt make a prettier present to a person with whom you wished to exchange a harmless joke  it is not classic art signore of course but between ourselves isnt classic art sometimes rather a bore  caricature burlesque la charge as the french say has hitherto been confined to paper to the pen and pencil now it has been my inspiration to introduce it into statuary  for this purpose i have invented a peculiar plastic compound which you will permit me not to divulge  thats my secret signore  its as light you perceive as cork and yet as firm as alabaster  i frankly confess that i really pride myself as much on this little stroke of chemical ingenuity as upon the other element of novelty in my creationsmy types  what do you say to my types signore  the idea is bold does it strike you as happy  cats and monkeysmonkeys and catsall human life is there human life of course i mean viewed with the eye of the satirist  to combine sculpture and satire signore has been my unprecedented ambition  i flatter myself that i have not egregiously failed  as this jaunty juvenal of the chimneypiece delivered himself of his persuasive allocution he took up his little groups successively from the table held them aloft turned them about rapped them with his knuckles and gazed at them lovingly with his head on one side  they consisted each of a cat and a monkey fantastically draped in some preposterously sentimental conjunction  they exhibited a certain sameness of motive and illustrated chiefly the different phases of what in delicate terms may be called gallantry and coquetry but they were strikingly clever and expressive and were at once very perfect cats and monkeys and very natural men and women  i confess however that they failed to amuse me i was doubtless not in a mood to enjoy them for they seemed to me peculiarly cynical and vulgar  their imitative felicity was revolting as i looked askance at the complacent little artist brandishing them between finger and thumb and caressing them with an amorous eye he seemed to me himself little more than an exceptionally intelligent ape  i mustered an admiring grin however and he blew another blast  my figures are studied from life  i have a little menagerie of monkeys whose frolics i contemplate by the hour  as for the cats one has only to look out of ones back window  since i have begun to examine these expressive little brutes i have made many profound observations speaking signore to a man of imagination i may say that my little designs are not without a philosophy of their own  truly i dont know whether the cats and monkeys imitate us or whether its we who imitate them  i congratulated him on his philosophy and he resumed you will do use the honour to admit that i have handled my subjects with delicacy eh it was needed signore  i have been free but not too freeeh  just a hint you know  you may see as much or as little as you please  these little groups however are no measure of my invention  if you will favour me with a call at my studio i think that you will admit that my combinations are really infinite  i likewise execute figures to command you have perhaps some little motivethe fruit of your philosophy of life signorewhich you would like to have interpreted  i can promise to work it up to your satisfaction it shall be as malicious as you please  allow me to present you with my card and to remind you that my prices are moderate  only sixty francs for a little group like that  my statuettes are as durable as bronzeaere perennius signoreand between ourselves i think they are more amusing  as i pocketed his card i glanced at madonna serafina wondering whether she had an eye for contrasts  she had picked up one of the little couples and was tenderly dusting it with a feather broom  what i had just seen and heard had so deepened my compassionate interest in my deluded friend that i took a summary leave making my way directly to the house designated by this remarkable woman  it was in an obscure corner of the opposite side of the town and presented a sombre and squalid appearance  an old woman in the doorway on my inquiring for theobald ushered me in with a mumbled blessing and an expression of relief at the poor gentleman having a friend  his lodging seemed to consist of a single room at the top of the house  on getting no answer to my knock i opened the door supposing that he was absent so that it gave me a certain shock to find him sitting there helpless and dumb  he was seated near the single window facing an easel which supported a large canvas  on my entering he looked up at me blankly without changing his position which was that of absolute lassitude and dejection his arms loosely folded his legs stretched before him his head hanging on his breast  advancing into the room i perceived that his face vividly corresponded with his attitude  he was pale haggard and unshaven and his dull and sunken eye gazed at me without a spark of recognition  i had been afraid that he would greet me with fierce reproaches as the cruelly officious patron who had turned his contentment to bitterness and i was relieved to find that my appearance awakened no visible resentment  dont you know me i asked as i put out my hand  have you already forgotten me  he made no response kept his position stupidly and left me staring about the room  it spoke most plaintively for itself  shabby sordid naked it contained beyond the wretched bed but the scantiest provision for personal comfort  it was bedroom at once and studioa grim ghost of a studio  a few dusty casts and prints on the walls three or four old canvases turned face inward and a rustylooking colourbox formed with the easel at the window the sum of its appurtenances  the place savoured horribly of poverty  its only wealth was the picture on the easel presumably the famous madonna  averted as this was from the door i was unable to see its face but at last sickened by the vacant misery of the spot i passed behind theobald eagerly and tenderly  i can hardly say that i was surprised at what i founda canvas that was a mere dead blank cracked and discoloured by time  this was his immortal work though not surprised i confess i was powerfully moved and i think that for five minutes i could not have trusted myself to speak  at last my silent nearness affected him he stirred and turned and then rose and looked at me with a slowly kindling eye  i murmured some kind ineffective nothings about his being ill and needing advice and care but he seemed absorbed in the effort to recall distinctly what had last passed between us  you were right he said with a pitiful smile i am a dawdler  i am a failure  i shall do nothing more in this world you opened my eyes and though the truth is bitter i bear you no grudge  amen  i have been sitting here for a week face to face with the truth with the past with my weakness and poverty and nullity  i shall never touch a brush  i believe i have neither eaten nor slept look at that canvas he went on as i relieved my emotion in an urgent request that he would come home with me and dine  that was to have contained my masterpiece  isnt it a promising foundation  the elements of it are all here  and he tapped his forehead with that mystic confidence which had marked the gesture before  if i could only transpose them into some brain that has the hand the will  since i have been sitting here taking stock of my intellects i have come to believe that i have the material for a hundred masterpieces  but my hand is paralysed now and they will never be painted  i never began  i waited and waited to be worthier to begin and wasted my life in preparation while i fancied my creation was growing it was dying  i have taken it all too hard  michael angelo didnt when he went at the lorenzo  he did his best at a venture and his venture is immortal  thats mine and he pointed with a gesture i shall never forget at the empty canvas i suppose we are a genus by ourselves in the providential schemewe talents that cant act that cant do nor dare  we take it out in talk in plans and promises in study in visions  but our visions let me tell you he cried with a toss of his head have a way of being brilliant and a man has not lived in vain who has seen the things i have seen  of course you will not believe in them when that bit of wormeaten cloth is all i have to show for them but to convince you to enchant and astound the world i need only the hand of raphael  his brain i already have  a pity you will say that i havent his modesty  ah let me boast and babble now its all i have left  i am the half of a genius where in the wide world is my other half  lodged perhaps in the vulgar soul the cunning ready fingers of some dull copyist or some trivial artisan who turns out by the dozen his easy prodigies of touch  but its not for me to sneer at him he at least does something  hes not a dawdler  well for me if i had been vulgar and clever and reckless if i could have shut my eyes and taken my leap  what to say to the poor fellow what to do for him seemed hard to determine i chiefly felt that i must break the spell of his present inaction and remove him from the haunted atmosphere of the little room it was such a cruel irony to call a studio  i cannot say i persuaded him to come out with me he simply suffered himself to be led and when we began to walk in the open air i was able to appreciate his pitifully weakened condition  nevertheless he seemed in a certain way to revive and murmured at last that he should like to go to the pitti gallery  i shall never forget our melancholy stroll through those gorgeous halls every picture on whose walls seemed even to my own sympathetic vision to glow with a sort of insolent renewal of strength and lustre  the eyes and lips of the great portraits appeared to smile in ineffable scorn of the dejected pretender who had dreamed of competing with their triumphant authors the celestial candour even of the madonna of the chair as we paused in perfect silence before her was tinged with the sinister irony of the women of leonardo  perfect silence indeed marked our whole progressthe silence of a deep farewell for i felt in all my pulses as theobald leaning on my arm dragged one heavy foot after the other that he was looking his last  when we came out he was so exhausted that instead of taking him to my hotel to dine i called a carriage and drove him straight to his own poor lodging  he had sunk into an extraordinary lethargy he lay back in the carriage with his eyes closed as pale as death his faint breathing interrupted at intervals by a sudden gasp like a smothered sob or a vain attempt to speak  with the help of the old woman who had admitted me before and who emerged from a dark back court i contrived to lead him up the long steep staircase and lay him on his wretched bed  to her i gave him in charge while i prepared in all haste to seek a physician  but she followed me out of the room with a pitiful clasping of her hands  poor dear blessed gentleman she murmured is he dying  possibly  how long has he been thus  since a certain night he passed ten days ago  i came up in the morning to make his poor bed and found him sitting up in his clothes before that great canvas he keeps there  poor dear strange man he says his prayers to it  he had not been to bed nor since then properly  what has happened to him  has he found out about the serafina she whispered with a glittering eye and a toothless grin  prove at least that one old woman can be faithful i said and watch him well till i come back  my return was delayed through the absence of the english physician who was away on a round of visits and whom i vainly pursued from house to house before i overtook him  i brought him to theobalds bedside none too soon  a violent fever had seized our patient and the case was evidently grave  a couple of hours later i knew that he had brain fever  from this moment i was with him constantly but i am far from wishing to describe his illness excessively painful to witness it was happily brief  life burned out in delirium  one night in particular that i passed at his pillow listening to his wild snatches of regret of aspiration of rapture and awe at the phantasmal pictures with which his brain seemed to swarm comes back to my memory now like some stray page from a lost masterpiece of tragedy before a week was over we had buried him in the little protestant cemetery on the way to fiesole  the signora serafina whom i had caused to be informed of his illness had come in person i was told to inquire about its progress but she was absent from his funeral which was attended by but a scanty concourse of mourners  half a dozen old florentine sojourners in spite of the prolonged estrangement which had preceded his death had felt the kindly impulse to honour his grave among them was my friend mrs coventry whom i found on my departure waiting in her carriage at the gate of the cemetery  well she said relieving at last with a significant smile the solemnity of our immediate greeting and the great madonna  have you seen her after all  i have seen her i said she is mineby bequest  but i shall never show her to you  and why not pray  my dear mrs coventry you would not understand her  upon my word you are polite  excuse me i am sad and vexed and bitter  and with reprehensible rudeness i marched away  i was excessively impatient to leave florence my friends dark spirit seemed diffused through all things  i had packed my trunk to start for rome that night and meanwhile to beguile my unrest i aimlessly paced the streets  chance led me at last to the church of san lorenzo  remembering poor theobalds phrase about michael angelohe did his best at a venturei went in and turned my steps to the chapel of the tombs  viewing in sadness the sadness of its immortal treasures i fancied while i stood there that they needed no ampler commentary than these simple words  as i passed through the church again to leave it a woman turning away from one of the side altars met me face to face  the black shawl depending from her head draped picturesquely the handsome visage of madonna serafina  she stopped as she recognised me and i saw that she wished to speak  her eye was bright and her ample bosom heaved in a way that seemed to portend a certain sharpness of reproach  but the expression of my own face apparently drew the sting from her resentment and she addressed me in a tone in which bitterness was tempered by a sort of dogged resignation  i know it was you now that separated us she said  it was a pity he ever brought you to see me  of course you couldnt think of me as he did  well the lord gave him the lord has taken him  i have just paid for a nine days mass for his soul  and i can tell you this signorei never deceived him  who put it into his head that i was made to live on holy thoughts and fine phrases  it was his own fancy and it pleased him to think sodid he suffer much she added more softly after a pause  his sufferings were great but they were short  and did he speak of me  she had hesitated and dropped her eyes she raised them with her question and revealed in their sombre stillness a gleam of feminine confidence which for the moment revived and illumined her beauty  poor theobald  whatever name he had given his passion it was still her fine eyes that had charmed him  be contented madam i answered gravely  she dropped her eyes again and was silent  then exhaling a full rich sigh as she gathered her shawl togetherhe was a magnificent genius  i bowed and we separated  passing through a narrow side street on my way back to my hotel i perceived above a doorway a sign which it seemed to me i had read before i suddenly remembered that it was identical with the superscription of a card that i had carried for an hour in my waistcoat pocket  on the threshold stood the ingenious artist whose claims to public favour were thus distinctly signalised smoking a pipe in the evening air and giving the finishing polish with a bit of rag to one of his inimitable combinations  i caught the expressive curl of a couple of tails  he recognised me removed his little red cap with a most obsequious bow and motioned me to enter his studio  i returned his salute and passed on vexed with the apparition  for a week afterwards whenever i was seized among the ruins of triumphant rome with some peculiarly poignant memory of theobalds transcendent illusions and deplorable failure i seemed to hear a fantastic impertinent murmur cats and monkeys monkeys and cats all human life there
