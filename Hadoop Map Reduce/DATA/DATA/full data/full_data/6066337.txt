6066337	the hunting of the snark                            lewis carroll                 the millennium fulcrum edition 12                         the hunting of the snark                      an agony in eight fits                                by                           lewis carroll    preface  ifand the thing is wildly possiblethe charge of writing nonsense were ever brought against the author of this brief but instructive poem it would be based i feel convinced on the line in p4            then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes  in view of this painful possibility i will not as i might appeal indignantly to my other writings as a proof that i am incapable of such a deed i will not as i might point to the strong moral purpose of this poem itself to the arithmetical principles so cautiously inculcated in it or to its noble teachings in natural historyi will take the more prosaic course of simply explaining how it happened  the bellman who was almost morbidly sensitive about appearances used to have the bowsprit unshipped once or twice a week to be revarnished and it more than once happened when the time came for replacing it that no one on board could remember which end of the ship it belonged to they knew it was not of the slightest use to appeal to the bellman about ithe would only refer to his naval code and read out in pathetic tones admiralty instructions which none of them had ever been able to understandso it generally ended in its being fastened on anyhow across the rudder the helmsman used to stand by with tears in his eyes he knew it was all wrong but alas  rule 42 of the code no one shall speak to the man at the helm had been completed by the bellman himself with the words and the man at the helm shall speak to no one  so remonstrance was impossible and no steering could be done till the next varnishing day  during these bewildering intervals the ship usually sailed backwards  as this poem is to some extent connected with the lay of the jabberwock let me take this opportunity of answering a question that has often been asked me how to pronounce slithy toves  the i in slithy is long as in writhe and toves is pronounced so as to rhyme with groves again the first o in borogoves is pronounced like the o in borrow  i have heard people try to give it the sound of the o in worry  such is human perversity  this also seems a fitting occasion to notice the other hard works in that poem  humptydumptys theory of two meanings packed into one word like a portmanteau seems to me the right explanation for all  for instance take the two words fuming and furious  make up your mind that you will say both words but leave it unsettled which you will first  now open your mouth and speak  if your thoughts incline ever so little towards fuming you will say fumingfurious if they turn by even a hairs breadth towards furious you will say furiousfuming but if you have the rarest of gifts a perfectly balanced mind you will say frumious  supposing that when pistol uttered the wellknown words            under which king bezonian  speak or die  justice shallow had felt certain that it was either william or richard but had not been able to settle which so that he could not possibly say either name before the other can it be doubted that rather than die he would have gasped out rilchiam                     fit the first                    the landing        just the place for a snark the bellman cried           as he landed his crew with care      supporting each man on the top of the tide           by a finger entwined in his hair       just the place for a snark  i have said it twice           that alone should encourage the crew      just the place for a snark  i have said it thrice           what i tell you three times is true       the crew was complete it included a boots           a maker of bonnets and hoods      a barrister brought to arrange their disputes           and a broker to value their goods       a billiardmarker whose skill was immense           might perhaps have won more than his share      but a banker engaged at enormous expense           had the whole of their cash in his care       there was also a beaver that paced on the deck           or would sit making lace in the bow      and had often the bellman said saved them from wreck           though none of the sailors knew how       there was one who was famed for the number of things           he forgot when he entered the ship      his umbrella his watch all his jewels and rings           and the clothes he had bought for the trip       he had fortytwo boxes all carefully packed           with his name painted clearly on each      but since he omitted to mention the fact           they were all left behind on the beach       the loss of his clothes hardly mattered because           he had seven coats on when he came      with three pairs of bootsbut the worst of it was           he had wholly forgotten his name       he would answer to hi or to any loud cry           such as fry me or fritter my wig      to whatyoumaycallum or whatwashisname           but especially thingumajig       while for those who preferred a more forcible word           he had different names from these      his intimate friends called him candleends           and his enemies toastedcheese       his form is ungainlyhis intellect small           so the bellman would often remark      but his courage is perfect  and that after all           is the thing that one needs with a snark       he would joke with hyenas returning their stare           with an impudent wag of the head      and he once went a walk pawinpaw with a bear           just to keep up its spirits he said       he came as a baker but owned when too late           and it drove the poor bellman halfmad      he could only bake bridecakefor which i may state           no materials were to be had       the last of the crew needs especial remark           though he looked an incredible dunce      he had just one ideabut that one being snark           the good bellman engaged him at once       he came as a butcher but gravely declared           when the ship had been sailing a week      he could only kill beavers  the bellman looked scared           and was almost too frightened to speak       but at length he explained in a tremulous tone           there was only one beaver on board      and that was a tame one he had of his own           whose death would be deeply deplored       the beaver who happened to hear the remark           protested with tears in its eyes      that not even the rapture of hunting the snark           could atone for that dismal surprise       it strongly advised that the butcher should be           conveyed in a separate ship      but the bellman declared that would never agree           with the plans he had made for the trip       navigation was always a difficult art           though with only one ship and one bell      and he feared he must really decline for his part           undertaking another as well       the beavers best course was no doubt to procure           a secondhand daggerproof coat      so the baker advised itand next to insure           its life in some office of note       this the banker suggested and offered for hire           on moderate terms or for sale      two excellent policies one against fire           and one against damage from hail       yet still ever after that sorrowful day           whenever the butcher was by      the beaver kept looking the opposite way           and appeared unaccountably shy                          fit the second                     the bellmans speech        the bellman himself they all praised to the skies           such a carriage such ease and such grace      such solemnity too  one could see he was wise           the moment one looked in his face       he had bought a large map representing the sea           without the least vestige of land      and the crew were much pleased when they found it to be           a map they could all understand       whats the good of mercators north poles and equators           tropics zones and meridian lines      so the bellman would cry and the crew would reply           they are merely conventional signs       other maps are such shapes with their islands and capes           but weve got our brave captain to thank      so the crew would protest that hes bought us the best           a perfect and absolute blank       this was charming no doubt but they shortly found out           that the captain they trusted so well      had only one notion for crossing the ocean           and that was to tingle his bell       he was thoughtful and gravebut the orders he gave           were enough to bewilder a crew      when he cried steer to starboard but keep her head larboard           what on earth was the helmsman to do       then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes           a thing as the bellman remarked      that frequently happens in tropical climes           when a vessel is so to speak snarked       but the principal failing occurred in the sailing           and the bellman perplexed and distressed      said he had hoped at least when the wind blew due east           that the ship would not travel due west       but the danger was pastthey had landed at last           with their boxes portmanteaus and bags      yet at first sight the crew were not pleased with the view           which consisted of chasms and crags       the bellman perceived that their spirits were low           and repeated in musical tone      some jokes he had kept for a season of woe           but the crew would do nothing but groan       he served out some grog with a liberal hand           and bade them sit down on the beach      and they could not but own that their captain looked grand           as he stood and delivered his speech       friends romans and countrymen lend me your ears           they were all of them fond of quotations      so they drank to his health and they gave him three cheers           while he served out additional rations       we have sailed many months we have sailed many weeks           four weeks to the month you may mark      but never as yet tis your captain who speaks           have we caught the least glimpse of a snark       we have sailed many weeks we have sailed many days           seven days to the week i allow      but a snark on the which we might lovingly gaze           we have never beheld till now       come listen my men while i tell you again           the five unmistakable marks      by which you may know wheresoever you go           the warranted genuine snarks       let us take them in order  the first is the taste           which is meagre and hollow but crisp      like a coat that is rather too tight in the waist           with a flavour of willothewisp       its habit of getting up late youll agree           that it carries too far when i say      that it frequently breakfasts at fiveoclock tea           and dines on the following day       the third is its slowness in taking a jest           should you happen to venture on one      it will sigh like a thing that is deeply distressed           and it always looks grave at a pun       the fourth is its fondness for bathingmachines           which is constantly carries about      and believes that they add to the beauty of scenes           a sentiment open to doubt       the fifth is ambition  it next will be right           to describe each particular batch      distinguishing those that have feathers and bite           and those that have whiskers and scratch       for although common snarks do no manner of harm           yet i feel it my duty to say      some are boojums the bellman broke off in alarm           for the baker had fainted away                          fit the third                       the bakers tale        they roused him with muffinsthey roused him with ice           they roused him with mustard and cress      they roused him with jam and judicious advice           they set him conundrums to guess       when at length he sat up and was able to speak           his sad story he offered to tell      and the bellman cried silence  not even a shriek           and excitedly tingled his bell       there was silence supreme  not a shriek not a scream           scarcely even a howl or a groan      as the man they called ho told his story of woe           in an antediluvian tone       my father and mother were honest though poor           skip all that cried the bellman in haste      if it once becomes dark theres no chance of a snark           we have hardly a minute to waste       i skip forty years said the baker in tears           and proceed without further remark      to the day when you took me aboard of your ship           to help you in hunting the snark       a dear uncle of mine after whom i was named           remarked when i bade him farewell      oh skip your dear uncle the bellman exclaimed           as he angrily tingled his bell       he remarked to me then said that mildest of men           if your snark be a snark that is right      fetch it home by all meansyou may serve it with greens           and its handy for striking a light       you may seek it with thimblesand seek it with care           you may hunt it with forks and hope      you may threaten its life with a railwayshare           you may charm it with smiles and soap       thats exactly the method the bellman bold           in a hasty parenthesis cried      thats exactly the way i have always been told           that the capture of snarks should be tried       but oh beamish nephew beware of the day           if your snark be a boojum  for then      you will softly and suddenly vanish away           and never be met with again       it is this it is this that oppresses my soul           when i think of my uncles last words      and my heart is like nothing so much as a bowl           brimming over with quivering curds       it is this it is this we have had that before           the bellman indignantly said      and the baker replied let me say it once more           it is this it is this that i dread       i engage with the snarkevery night after dark           in a dreamy delirious fight      i serve it with greens in those shadowy scenes           and i use it for striking a light       but if ever i meet with a boojum that day           in a moment of this i am sure      i shall softly and suddenly vanish away           and the notion i cannot endure                          fit the fourth                         the hunting        the bellman looked uffish and wrinkled his brow           if only youd spoken before      its excessively awkward to mention it now           with the snark so to speak at the door       we should all of us grieve as you well may believe           if you never were met with again      but surely my man when the voyage began           you might have suggested it then       its excessively awkward to mention it now           as i think ive already remarked      and the man they called hi replied with a sigh           i informed you the day we embarked       you may charge me with murderor want of sense           we are all of us weak at times      but the slightest approach to a false pretence           was never among my crimes       i said it in hebrewi said it in dutch           i said it in german and greek      but i wholly forgot and it vexes me much           that english is what you speak       tis a pitiful tale said the bellman whose face           had grown longer at every word      but now that youve stated the whole of your case           more debate would be simply absurd       the rest of my speech he explained to his men           you shall hear when ive leisure to speak it      but the snark is at hand let me tell you again           tis your glorious duty to seek it       to seek it with thimbles to seek it with care           to pursue it with forks and hope      to threaten its life with a railwayshare           to charm it with smiles and soap       for the snarks a peculiar creature that wont           be caught in a commonplace way      do all that you know and try all that you dont           not a chance must be wasted today       for england expectsi forbear to proceed           tis a maxim tremendous but trite      and youd best be unpacking the things that you need           to rig yourselves out for the fight       then the banker endorsed a blank cheque which he crossed           and changed his loose silver for notes      the baker with care combed his whiskers and hair           and shook the dust out of his coats       the boots and the broker were sharpening a spade           each working the grindstone in turn      but the beaver went on making lace and displayed           no interest in the concern       though the barrister tried to appeal to its pride           and vainly proceeded to cite      a number of cases in which making laces           had been proved an infringement of right       the maker of bonnets ferociously planned           a novel arrangement of bows      while the billiardmarker with quivering hand           was chalking the tip of his nose       but the butcher turned nervous and dressed himself fine           with yellow kid gloves and a ruff      said he felt it exactly like going to dine           which the bellman declared was all stuff       introduce me now theres a good fellow he said           if we happen to meet it together      and the bellman sagaciously nodding his head           said that must depend on the weather       the beaver went simply galumphing about           at seeing the butcher so shy      and even the baker though stupid and stout           made an effort to wink with one eye       be a man said the bellman in wrath as he heard           the butcher beginning to sob      should we meet with a jubjub that desperate bird           we shall need all our strength for the job                          fit the fifth                     the beavers lesson        they sought it with thimbles they sought it with care           they pursued it with forks and hope      they threatened its life with a railwayshare           they charmed it with smiles and soap       then the butcher contrived an ingenious plan           for making a separate sally      and had fixed on a spot unfrequented by man           a dismal and desolate valley       but the very same plan to the beaver occurred           it had chosen the very same place      yet neither betrayed by a sign or a word           the disgust that appeared in his face       each thought he was thinking of nothing but snark           and the glorious work of the day      and each tried to pretend that he did not remark           that the other was going that way       but the valley grew narrow and narrower still           and the evening got darker and colder      till merely from nervousness not from goodwill           they marched along shoulder to shoulder       then a scream shrill and high rent the shuddering sky           and they knew that some danger was near      the beaver turned pale to the tip of its tail           and even the butcher felt queer       he thought of his childhood left far far behind           that blissful and innocent state      the sound so exactly recalled to his mind           a pencil that squeaks on a slate       tis the voice of the jubjub he suddenly cried           this man that they used to call dunce      as the bellman would tell you he added with pride           i have uttered that sentiment once       tis the note of the jubjub keep count i entreat           you will find i have told it you twice      tis the song of the jubjub the proof is complete           if only ive stated it thrice       the beaver had counted with scrupulous care           attending to every word      but it fairly lost heart and outgrabe in despair           when the third repetition occurred       it felt that in spite of all possible pains           it had somehow contrived to lose count      and the only thing now was to rack its poor brains           by reckoning up the amount       two added to oneif that could but be done           it said with ones fingers and thumbs      recollecting with tears how in earlier years           it had taken no pains with its sums       the thing can be done said the butcher i think           the thing must be done i am sure      the thing shall be done  bring me paper and ink           the best there is time to procure       the beaver brought paper portfolio pens           and ink in unfailing supplies      while strange creepy creatures came out of their dens           and watched them with wondering eyes       so engrossed was the butcher he heeded them not           as he wrote with a pen in each hand      and explained all the while in a popular style           which the beaver could well understand       taking three as the subject to reason about           a convenient number to state      we add seven and ten and then multiply out           by one thousand diminished by eight       the result we proceed to divide as you see           by nine hundred and ninety two      then subtract seventeen and the answer must be           exactly and perfectly true       the method employed i would gladly explain           while i have it so clear in my head      if i had but the time and you had but the brain           but much yet remains to be said       in one moment ive seen what has hitherto been           enveloped in absolute mystery      and without extra charge i will give you at large           a lesson in natural history       in his genial way he proceeded to say           forgetting all laws of propriety      and that giving instruction without introduction           would have caused quite a thrill in society       as to temper the jubjubs a desperate bird           since it lives in perpetual passion      its taste in costume is entirely absurd           it is ages ahead of the fashion       but it knows any friend it has met once before           it never will look at a bribe      and in charitymeetings it stands at the door           and collectsthough it does not subscribe       its flavour when cooked is more exquisite far           than mutton or oysters or eggs      some think it keeps best in an ivory jar           and some in mahogany kegs       you boil it in sawdust you salt it in glue           you condense it with locusts and tape      still keeping one principal object in view           to preserve its symmetrical shape       the butcher would gladly have talked till next day           but he felt that the lesson must end      and he wept with delight in attempting to say           he considered the beaver his friend       while the beaver confessed with affectionate looks           more eloquent even than tears      it had learned in ten minutes far more than all books           would have taught it in seventy years       they returned handinhand and the bellman unmanned           for a moment with noble emotion      said this amply repays all the wearisome days           we have spent on the billowy ocean       such friends as the beaver and butcher became           have seldom if ever been known      in winter or summer twas always the same           you could never meet either alone       and when quarrels aroseas one frequently finds           quarrels will spite of every endeavour      the song of the jubjub recurred to their minds           and cemented their friendship for ever                          fit the sixth                    the barristers dream        they sought it with thimbles they sought it with care           they pursued it with forks and hope      they threatened its life with a railwayshare           they charmed it with smiles and soap       but the barrister weary of proving in vain           that the beavers lacemaking was wrong      fell asleep and in dreams saw the creature quite plain           that his fancy had dwelt on so long       he dreamed that he stood in a shadowy court           where the snark with a glass in its eye      dressed in gown bands and wig was defending a pig           on the charge of deserting its sty       the witnesses proved without error or flaw           that the sty was deserted when found      and the judge kept explaining the state of the law           in a soft undercurrent of sound       the indictment had never been clearly expressed           and it seemed that the snark had begun      and had spoken three hours before any one guessed           what the pig was supposed to have done       the jury had each formed a different view           long before the indictment was read      and they all spoke at once so that none of them knew           one word that the others had said       you must know said the judge but the snark exclaimed fudge           that statute is obsolete quite      let me tell you my friends the whole question depends           on an ancient manorial right       in the matter of treason the pig would appear           to have aided but scarcely abetted      while the charge of insolvency fails it is clear           if you grant the plea never indebted       the fact of desertion i will not dispute           but its guilt as i trust is removed      so far as related to the costs of this suit           by the alibi which has been proved       my poor clients fate now depends on your votes           here the speaker sat down in his place      and directed the judge to refer to his notes           and briefly to sum up the case       but the judge said he never had summed up before           so the snark undertook it instead      and summed it so well that it came to far more           than the witnesses ever had said       when the verdict was called for the jury declined           as the word was so puzzling to spell      but they ventured to hope that the snark wouldnt mind           undertaking that duty as well       so the snark found the verdict although as it owned           it was spent with the toils of the day      when it said the word guilty the jury all groaned           and some of them fainted away       then the snark pronounced sentence the judge being quite           too nervous to utter a word      when it rose to its feet there was silence like night           and the fall of a pin might be heard       transportation for life was the sentence it gave           and then to be fined forty pound      the jury all cheered though the judge said he feared           that the phrase was not legally sound       but their wild exultation was suddenly checked           when the jailer informed them with tears      such a sentence would have not the slightest effect           as the pig had been dead for some years       the judge left the court looking deeply disgusted           but the snark though a little aghast      as the lawyer to whom the defense was entrusted           went bellowing on to the last       thus the barrister dreamed while the bellowing seemed           to grow every moment more clear      till he woke to the knell of a furious bell           which the bellman rang close at his ear                         fit the seventh                      the bankers fate        they sought it with thimbles they sought it with care           they pursued it with forks and hope      they threatened its life with a railwayshare           they charmed it with smiles and soap       and the banker inspired with a courage so new           it was matter for general remark      rushed madly ahead and was lost to their view           in his zeal to discover the snark       but while he was seeking with thimbles and care           a bandersnatch swiftly drew nigh      and grabbed at the banker who shrieked in despair           for he knew it was useless to fly       he offered large discounthe offered a cheque           drawn to bearer for sevenpoundsten      but the bandersnatch merely extended its neck           and grabbed at the banker again       without rest or pausewhile those frumious jaws           went savagely snapping around      he skipped and he hopped and he floundered and flopped           till fainting he fell to the ground       the bandersnatch fled as the others appeared           led on by that fearstricken yell      and the bellman remarked it is just as i feared           and solemnly tolled on his bell       he was black in the face and they scarcely could trace           the least likeness to what he had been      while so great was his fright that his waistcoat turned white           a wonderful thing to be seen       to the horror of all who were present that day           he uprose in full evening dress      and with senseless grimaces endeavoured to say           what his tongue could no longer express       down he sank in a chairran his hands through his hair           and chanted in mimsiest tones      words whose utter inanity proved his insanity           while he rattled a couple of bones       leave him here to his fateit is getting so late           the bellman exclaimed in a fright      we have lost half the day  any further delay           and we shant catch a snark before night                          fit the eighth                        the vanishing        they sought it with thimbles they sought it with care           they pursued it with forks and hope      they threatened its life with a railwayshare           they charmed it with smiles and soap       they shuddered to think that the chase might fail           and the beaver excited at last      went bounding along on the tip of its tail           for the daylight was nearly past       there is thingumbob shouting the bellman said           he is shouting like mad only hark      he is waving his hands he is wagging his head           he has certainly found a snark       they gazed in delight while the butcher exclaimed           he was always a desperate wag      they beheld himtheir bakertheir hero unnamed           on the top of a neighboring crag       erect and sublime for one moment of time           in the next that wild figure they saw      as if stung by a spasm plunge into a chasm           while they waited and listened in awe       its a snark was the sound that first came to their ears           and seemed almost too good to be true      then followed a torrent of laughter and cheers           then the ominous words its a boo       then silence  some fancied they heard in the air           a weary and wandering sigh      then sounded like jum but the others declare           it was only a breeze that went by       they hunted till darkness came on but they found           not a button or feather or mark      by which they could tell that they stood on the ground           where the baker had met with the snark       in the midst of the word he was trying to say           in the midst of his laughter and glee      he had softly and suddenly vanished away           for the snark was a boojum you see
