the hillman                                     i   louise selfengrossed and with a pleasant sense of detachment from the prospective inconveniences of the moment was leaning back among the cushions of the motionless car her eyes lifted upward traveled past the dimly lit hillside with its patchwork of wallenclosed fields up to where the leaning clouds and the unseen heights met in a misty sea of obscurity  the moon had not yet risen but a faint and luminous glow spreading like a halo about the topmost peak of that ragged line of hills heralded its approach louise sat with clasped hands rapt and engrossed in the esthetic appreciation of a beauty which found its way but seldom into her townenslaved life she listened to the sound of a distant sheepbell her eyes swept the hillsides vainly yet without curiosity for any sign of a human dwelling the voices of her chauffeur and her maid who stood talking heatedly together by the bonnet of the car seemed to belong to another world she had the air of one completely yet pleasantly detached from all material surroundings  the maid leaving her discomfited companion with a final burst of reproaches came to the side of the car her voice when she addressed her mistress sank to a lower key but her eyes still flashed with anger  but would madame believe it she exclaimed it is incredible the man charles there who calls himself a chauffeur of experience declares that we are what he calls hung up something unexpected has happened to the magneto there is no spark whose fault can that be i ask but the chauffeurs and such a desert we have reached we have searched the map together we are thirty miles from any town many miles from even a village what a misfortune  louise turned her head regretfully away from the mysterious spaces she listened patiently but without any sort of emotion to her maids flow of distressed words she even smiled very faintly when the girl had finished  something will happen she remarked indifferently there is no need for you to distress yourself there must be a farmhouse or shelter of some sort near if the worst comes to the worst we can spend the night in the car we have plenty of furs and rugs you are not a good traveler aline you lose heart too soon  the girls face was a study  madame speaks of spending the night in the car she exclaimed why one has not eaten since luncheon and of all the country through which we have passed this is the loneliest and dreariest spot  louise leaned forward and called to the chauffeur  charles she asked what has happened are we really stranded here  the mans head emerged from the bonnet he came round to the side of the car  i am very sorry madam he reported but something has gone wrong with the magneto i shall have to take it to pieces before i can tell exactly what is wrong at present i cant get a spark of any sort  there is no hope of any immediate repair then  the chauffeur shook his head dolefully  i shall have to take the magneto down madam he said it will take several hours and it ought to be done by daylight  and in the meantime what do you suggest that we do she asked  the man looked a little helpless his battle of words with aline had depressed him  i heard a dog bark a little while ago he remarked perhaps i had better go and see whether there isnt a farm somewhere near  and leave us here alone aline exclaimed indignantly it is a good suggestion it comes well from the man who has got us into such trouble  her mistress smiled at her reassuringly  what have we to fear you foolish girl for myself i would like better than anything to remain here until the moon comes over the top of that round hill but listen it is just as i told you there is no necessity for charles to leave us  they all turned their heads from some distance behind on the hard narrow road curling like a piece of white tape around the hillside there came faintly at first but more distinctly every moment the sound of horses hoofs  it is as i told you louise said composedly some one approacheson horseback too he will be able to fetch assistance  the chauffeur walked back a few yards prepared to give early warning to the approaching horseman the two women standing up in the car watched the spot where the road hidden for some time in the valley came into sight  louder and louder came the sound of the beating of hoofs louise gave a little cry as a man on horseback appeared in sight at the crest of the hill the narrow strip of road seemed suddenly dwarfed an unreasonable portion of the horizon blotted out in the half light there was something almost awesome in the unusual size of the horse and of the man who rode it  it is a world of goblins this aline her mistress exclaimed softly what is it that comes  it is a human being dieu merci the maid replied with a matteroffact little sigh of content  conscious of the obstruction in the road the rider slackened his speed his horse a great darkcolored animal pricked up his ears when scarcely a dozen yards away from the car stopped short and suddenly bolted out on the open moor there was the sound of a heavy whip a loud masterful voice and a very brief struggle during which the horse once plunged and reared so high that louise watching cried out in fear a few moments later however horse and rider the former quivering and subdued were beside the car  has anything happened the newcomer asked raising his whip to his hat  he addressed louise instinctively conscious even in that dim light that she was the person in authority  she did not at once reply her eyes were fixed upon the face of her questioner there was little enough of him to be seen yet she was aware of an exceptional interest in his dimly revealed personality he was young unusually tall and his voice was cultivated beyond that she could see or divine nothing  he for his part with his attention still largely engaged in keeping his horse under control yet knew in those first few moments that he was looking into the face of a woman who had no kinship with the world in which he had been born and had lived his days those were fugitive thoughts which passed between them only half conceived yet strong enough to remain as first and unforgettable impressions then the commonplace interests of the situation became insistent  i have broken down louise said my chauffeur tells me that it will take hours to effect some necessary repair to the car and meanwhilehere we are  you couldnt have chosen a worse place for a breakdown the young man observed you are miles away from anywhere  you are indeed a comforter louise murmured do you think that you could possibly get down and advise us what to do you look so far away up there  there was another brief struggle between the man and his still frightened horse then the former swung himself down and with the bridle through his arm came and stood by the car  if there is any way in which i can help he ventured i am quite at your service  louise smiled at him she remained unoppressed by any fear of inconvenience or hardship she had the air of one rather enjoying her plight  well you have begun very nicely by doing what i asked you she said really you know to an impressionable person there was something rather terrifying about you when you appeared suddenly from out of the shadows in such a lonely place i was beginning to wonder whether you were altogether real whether one of those black hills there had not opened to let you out you see i know something of the legends of your country although i have never been here before  the young man was less at his ease he stood tapping his boot nervously with his long ridingwhip  i am sorry if i frightened you he said my horse is a little restive and the acetylene light which your chauffeur turned on him was sufficiently alarming  you did not exactly frighten me she assured him but you looked so abnormally large please tell us what you would advise us to do is there a village near or an inn or even a barn or shall we have to spend the night in the car  the nearest village he replied is twelve miles away fortunately my own home is close by i shall be very pleasedi and my brotherif you will honor us i am afraid i cannot offer you very much in the way of entertainment  she rose briskly to her feet and beamed upon him  you are indeed a good samaritan she exclaimed a roof is more than we had dared to hope for although when one looks up at this wonderful sky and breathes this air one wonders perhaps whether a roof after all is such a blessing  it gets very cold toward morning the young man said practically  of course she assented aline you will bring my dressingbag and follow us this gentleman is kind enough to offer us shelter for the night dear me you really are almost as tall as you appeared she added as she stood by his side for the first time in my life you make me feel undersized  he looked down at her a little more at his ease now by reason of the friendliness of her manner although he had still the air of one embarked upon an adventure the outcome of which was to be regarded with some qualms she was of little more than medium height and his first impressions of her were that she was thin and too pale to be goodlooking that her eyes were large and soft with eyebrows more clearly defined than is usual among englishwomen and that she moved without seeming to walk  i suppose i am tall he admitted as they started off along the road one doesnt notice it around here my name is john strangewey and our house is just behind that clump of trees there on the top of the hill we will do our best to make you comfortable he added a little doubtfully but there are only my brother and myself and we have no women servants in the house  a roof of any sort will be a luxury she assured him i only hope that we shall not be a trouble to you in any way  and your name please he asked  she was a little amazed at his directness but she answered him without hesitation  my name she told him is louise  he leaned down toward her a little puzzled  louise but your surname  she laughed softly it occurred to him that nothing like her laugh had ever been heard on that graywalled stretch of mountain road  never mind i am traveling incognito who i am or where i am goingwell what does that matter to anybody perhaps i do not know myself you can imagine if you like that we came from the heart of your hills and that tomorrow they will open again and welcome us back  i dont think there are any motorcars in fairyland he objected  we represent a new edition of fairy lore she told him modern romance you know includes motorcars and even french maids  all the same he protested with masculine bluntness i really dont see how i can introduce you to my brother as louise from fairyland  she evaded the point  tell me about your brother is he as tall as you and is he younger or older  he is nearly twenty years older her companion replied he is about my height but he stoops more than i do and his hair is gray i am afraid that you may find him a little peculiar  her escort paused and swung open a white gate on their lefthand side before them was an ascent which seemed to her in the dim light to be absolutely precipitous  do we have to climb up that she asked ruefully  it isnt so bad as it looks he assured her and i am afraid its the only way up the house is at the bend there barely fifty yards away you can see a light through the trees  you must help me then please she begged  he stooped down toward her she linked her fingers together through his left arm and leaning a little heavily upon him began the ascent he was conscious of some subtle fragrance from her clothes a perfume strangely different from the odor of the ghostlike flowers that bordered the steep path up which they were climbing her arms slight warm things though they were and great though his own strength felt suddenly like a yoke at every step he seemed to feel their weight more insistenta weight not physical solely due to this rush of unexpected emotions  it was he now whose thoughts rushed away to that medley of hill legends of which she had spoken was she indeed a creature of flesh and blood of the same world as the dull people among whom he lived then he remembered the motorcar the chauffeur and the french maid and he gave a little sigh of relief  are we nearly there she asked do tell me if i lean too heavily upon you  it is only a few steps further he replied encouragingly please lean upon me as heavily as you like  she looked around her almost in wonder as her companion paused with his hand upon a little iron gate from behind that jagged stretch of hills in the distance a corner of the moon had now appeared by its light looking backward she could see the road which they had left below the moorland stretching away into misty space an uneasy panorama with its masses of gray boulders its clumps of gorse its hillocks and hollows  before her through the little iron gate which her escort had pushed open was a garden a little austere looking with its prim flowerbeds filled with hyacinths and crocuses bordering the flinty walks the trees were all bent in the same direction fashioned after one pattern by the winds before them was the housea long low building part of it covered with some kind of creeper  as they stepped across the last few yards of lawn the black oak door which they were approaching suddenly opened a tall elderly man stood looking inquiringly out he shaded his eyes with his hands  is that you brother he asked doubtfully  john strangewey ushered his companion into the square oakpaneled hall hung with many trophies of the chase a few oilpaintings here and there some sporting prints it was lighted only with a single lamp which stood upon a round polished table in the center of the whiteflagged floor  this ladys motorcar has broken down stephen john explained turning a little nervously toward his brother i found them in the road just at the bottom of the hill she and her servants will spend the night here i have explained that there is no village or inn for a good many miles  louise turned graciously toward the elder man who was standing grimly apart even in those few seconds her quick sensibilities warned her of the hostility which lurked behind his tightly closed lips and steelgray eyes his bow was stiff and uncordial and he made no movement to offer his hand  we are not used to welcoming ladies at peak hall madam he said i am afraid that you will find us somewhat unprepared for guests  i ask for nothing more than a roof louise assured him  john threw his hat and whip upon the round table and stood in the center of the stone floor she caught a glance which flashed between the two menof appeal from the one of icy resentment from the other  we can at least add to the roof a bed and some supperand a welcome john declared is that not so stephen  the older man turned deliberately away it was as if he had not heard his brothers words  i will go and find jennings he said he must be told about the servants  louise watched the disappearing figure until it was out of sight then she looked up into the face of the younger man who was standing by her side  i am sorry she murmured apologetically i am afraid that your brother is not pleased at this sudden intrusion really we shall give you very little trouble  he answered her with a sudden eager enthusiasm he seemed far more natural then than at any time since he had ridden up from out of the shadows to take his place in her life  i wont apologize for stephen he said he is a little crotchety you must please be kind and not notice you must let me if i can offer you welcome enough for us both                                        ii   louise with a heavy silverplated candlestick in her hand stood upon the uneven floor of the bedroom to which she had been conducted looking up at the oakframed family tree which hung above the broad chimneypiece she examined the coat of arms emblazoned in the corner and peered curiously at the last neatly printed addition which indicated stephen and john strangewey as the sole survivors of a diminishing line when at last she turned away she found the name upon her lips  strangewey she murmured john strangewey the name seems to bring something into my memory have i ever known any one with such a name aline  the maid shook her head  never madame to the best of my belief she declared yet i too seem to have heard it and lately it is perplexing one has seen it somewhere one finds it familiar  louise shrugged her shoulders she stood for a moment looking around her before she laid down the candlestick  the room was of unusual size with two wormeaten beams across the ceiling the windows were casemented with broad seats in each recess the dressing table upon which her belongings were set out was of solid black oak as was also the framework of the huge sofa the mirror and the chairs the ancient fourposter hung with chintz and supported by carved pillars was spread with fine linen and covered with a quilt made of small pieces of silk lavenderperfumed the great wardrobe with its solid mahogany doors seemed ancient enough to have stood in its place since the building of the house itself a log of sweetsmelling wood burned cheerfully in the open fireplace  really louise decided we have been most fortunate this is an adventure aline give me some black silk stockings and some black slippers i will change nothing else  the maid obeyed in somewhat ominous silence her mistress however was living in a little world of her own  john strangewey she murmured to herself glancing across the room at the family tree it is really curious how that name brings with it a sense of familiarity it is so unusual too and what an unusuallooking person do you think aline that you ever saw any one so superbly handsome  the maids little grimace was expressive  never madame she replied and yet to think of ita gentleman a person of intelligence who lives here always outside the world with just a terrible old man servant the only domestic in the house nearly all the cooking is done at the bailiffs a quarter of a mile away  louise nodded thoughtfully  it is very strange she admitted i should like to understand it perhaps she added half to herself some day i shall  she passed across the room and on her way paused before an old chevalglass before which were suspended two silver candlesticks containing lighted wax candles she looked steadfastly at her own reflection a little smile parted her lips in the bedroom of this quaint farmhouse she was looking upon a face and a figure which the illustrated papers and the enterprise of the modern photographer had combined to make familiar to the world  a curious feeling came to her that she was looking at the face of a stranger she gazed earnestly into the mirror with new eyes and a new curiosity she contemplated critically the lines of her slender figure in its neat perfectly tailored skirtthe figure of a girl it seemed notwithstanding her twentyseven years her soft white blouse was open at the neck displaying a beautifully rounded throat her eyes traveled upward and dwelt with an almost passionate interest upon the oval face a little paler at that moment than usual with its earnest brown eyes its faint silky eyebrows its strong yet mobile features its lips a little full perhaps but soft and sensitive at the masses of brown hair drawn low over her ears  this was herself then did she really justify her reputation for beauty or was she just a cult the passing craze of a world a little weary of the ordinary standards or again was it only her art that had focused the admiration of the world upon her  how would she seem to these two men downstairs she asked herselfthe dour grim master of the house and her more youthful rescuer whose coming had somehow touched her fancy they saw so little of her sex they seemed in a sense to be in league against it would they find out that they were entertaining an angel unawares  she thought with a gratified smile of her incognito it was a real trial of her strength this when she turned away from the mirror the smile still lingered upon her lips a soft light of anticipation was shining in her eyes  john met her at the foot of the stairs she noticed with some surprise that he was wearing the dinnerjacket and black tie of civilization  will you come this way please he begged supper is quite ready  he held open the door of one of the rooms on the other side of the hall and she passed into a low dining room dimly lit with shaded lamps the elder brother rose from his chair as they entered although his salutation was even grimmer than his first welcome he was wearing a dresscoat of oldfashioned cut and a black stock and he remained standing without any smile or word of greeting until she had taken her seat behind his chair stood a very ancient man servant in a gray pepperandsalt suit with a white tie whose expression at the entrance of this unexpected guest seemed curiously to reflect the inhospitable instincts of his master  although conscious of this atmosphere of antagonism louise looked around her with frank admiration as she took her place in the highbacked chair which john was holding for her the correctness of the setting appealed strongly to her artistic perceptions the figures and features of the two menstephen tall severe stately john amazingly handsome but of the same type the blackraftered ceiling the jacobean sideboard the huge easy chairs the fine prints upon the walls the pine log which burned upon the open hearthnowhere did there seem to be a single alien or modern note  the table was laid with all manner of cold dishes supplemented by others upon the sideboard there were pots of jam and honey a silver teapot and silver spoons and forks of quaint design strangely cut glass and a great dresden bowl filled with flowers  i am afraid john remarked that you are not used to dining at this hour my brother and i are very oldfashioned in our customs if we had had a little longer notice  i never in my life saw anything that looked so delicious as your cold chicken louise declared may i have someand some ham i believe that you must farm some land yourselves everything looks as if it were homemade or homegrown  we are certainly farmers john admitted with a smile and i dont think there is much here that isnt of our own production  of course one must have some occupation living so far out of the world louise murmured i really am the most fortunate person she continued my car comes to grief in what seems to be a wilderness and i find myself in a very palace of plenty  i am not sure that your maid agrees john laughed she seemed rather horrified when she found that there was no woman servant about the place  aline is spoiled without a doubt her mistress declared but is that really the truth  absolutely  but how do you manage louise went on dont you need dairymaids for instance  the farm buildings are some distance away from the house john explained there is quite a little colony at the back and the woman who superintends the dairy lives there it is only in the house that we are entirely independent of your sex we manage somehow or other with jennings here and two boys  you are not both womanhaters i hope  her younger host flashed a warning glance at louise but it was too late stephen had laid down his knife and fork and was leaning in her direction  madam he intervened since you have asked the question i will confess that i have never known any good come to a man of our family from the friendship or service of women our family history if ever you should come to know it would amply justify my brother and myself for our attitude toward your sex  stephen john remonstrated a slight frown upon his face need you weary our guest with your peculiar views it is scarcely polite to say the least of it  the older man sat for a moment grim and silent  perhaps you are right brother he admitted this lady did not seek our company but it may interest her to know that she is the first woman who has crossed the threshold of peak hall for a matter of six years  louise looked from one to the other half incredulously  do you really mean it is that literally true she asked john  absolutely the young man assured her but please remember that you are none the less heartily welcome here we have few women neighbors and intercourse with them seems to have slipped out of our lives tell me how far have you come today and where did you hope to sleep tonight  louise hesitated for a moment for some reason or other the question seemed to bring with it some unexpected and disturbing thought  i was motoring from edinburgh as regards tonight i had not made up my mind i rather hoped to reach kendal my journey is not at all an interesting matter to talk about she went on tell me about your life here it sounds most delightfully pastoral do you really mean that you produce nearly everything yourselves your honey and preserves and bread and butter for instanceare they all homemade  and our hams the young man laughed and everything else upon the table you underestimate the potentiality of male labor jennings is certainly a better cook than the average woman everything you see was cooked by him we have a sort of secondary kitchen though down at the bailiffs where the preserves are made and some of the other things  and you live here all the year round she asked  my brother john told her has not been further away than the nearest markettown for nearly twenty years  her eyes grew round with astonishment  but you go to london sometimes  i was there eight years ago since then i have not been further away than carlisle or kendal i go into the camp near kendal for three weeks every yearterritorial training you know  but how do you pass your time what do you do with yourself she asked  farm he answered farming is our daily occupation then for amusement we hunt shoot and fish the seasons pass before we know it  she looked appraisingly at john strangewey notwithstanding his suntanned cheeks and the splendid vigor of his form there was nothing in the least agricultural about his manner or his appearance there was humor as well as intelligence in his clear gray eyes she opined that the books which lined one side of the room were at once his property and his hobby  it is a very healthy life no doubt she said but somehow it seems incomprehensible to think of a man like yourself living always in such an outoftheway corner with no desire to see what is going on in the world or to be able to form any estimate of the changes in mens thoughts and habits human life seems to me so much more interesting than anything else does this all sound a little impertinent she wound up naïvely i am so sorry my friends spoil me i believe and i get into the habit of saying things just as they come into my head  johns lips were open to reply but stephen once more intervened  life means a different thing to each of us madam he said sternly there are many born with the lust for cities and the crowded places in their hearts born with the desire to mingle with their fellows to absorb the conventional vices and virtues to become one of the multitude it has been different with us strangeweys  jennings at a sign from his master removed the tea equipage evidently produced in honor of their visitor three tallstemmed glasses were placed upon the table and a decanter of port reverently produced  louise had fallen for a moment or two into a fit of abstraction her eyes were fixed upon the opposite wall from which out of their faded frames a row of grimlooking men and women startlingly like her two hosts seemed to frown down upon her  is that your father she asked moving her head toward one of the portraits  my grandfather john strangewey stephen told her  was he one of the wanderers  he left cumberland only twice during his life he was master of hounds magistrate colonel in the yeomanry of that period and three times he refused to stand for parliament  john strangewey louise repeated softly to herself i was looking at your family tree upstairs she went on it is curious how both my maid and myself were struck with a sense of familiarity about the name as if we had heard or read something about it quite lately  her words were almost carelessly spoken but she was conscious of the somewhat ominous silence which ensued she glanced up wonderingly and intercepted a rapid look passing between the two men more puzzled than ever she turned toward john as if for an explanation he had risen somewhat abruptly to his feet and his hand was upon the back of her chair  will it be disagreeable to you if my brother smokes a pipe he asked i tried to have our little drawingroom prepared for you but the fire has not been lit for so long that the room i am afraid is quite impossible  do let me stay here with you she begged and i hope that both of you will smoke i am quite used to it  john wheeled up an easy chair for her stephen stiff and upright sat on the other side of the hearth he took the tobaccojar and pipe that his brother had brought him and slowly filled the bowl  with your permission then madam he said as he struck a match  louise smiled graciously some instinct prompted her to stifle her own craving for a cigarette and keep her little gold case hidden in her pocket all the time her eyes were wandering around the room suddenly she rose and moving round the table stood once more facing the row of gloomylooking portraits  so that is your grandfather she remarked to john who had followed her is your father not here  he shook his head  my fathers portrait was never painted  tell the truth john stephen enjoined rising in his place and setting down his pipe our fathers portrait is not here madam because he was one of those of whom i have spokenone of those who were drawn into the vortex of the city and who knew only the shallow ways of life listen  with a heavy silver candlestick in either hand stephen crossed the room he raised them high above his head and pointed to the pictures one by one  john robert strangewey our greatgrandfather he began that picture was a presentation from the farmers of cumberland he too was a magistrate and held many public offices in the county  by his side is his brother stephen george strangewey for thirtyfive years he took the chair at the farmers ordinary at market ketton on every saturday at one oclock and there was never a deserving man in this part of the county engaged in agricultural pursuits who at any time sought his aid in vain they always knew where he was to be found and every saturday before dinner was served there would be some one there to seek his aid or advice he lived his life to his own benefit and to the benefit of his neighborsthe life which we are all sent here to lead  two generations before him you see my namesake stephen strangewey it was he who invented the first threshingmachine used in this county he farmed the land that my brother and i own today he was churchwarden at our little church and he too was a magistrate he did his duty in a smaller way but zealously and honestly among the hillmen of this district  there are gaps in your family history louise observed  the gaps madam stephen explained are left by those who have abandoned their natural heritage we strangeweys were hillfolk and farmers by descent and destiny for more than four hundred years our place is here upon the land almost among the clouds and those of us who have realized it have led the lives god meant us to lead there have been some of our race who have been tempted into the lowlands and the cities not one of them brought honor upon our name their pictures are not here they are not worthy to be here  stephen set down the candlesticks and returned to his place louise with her hands clasped behind her back glanced toward john who still stood by her side  tell me she asked him have none of your people who went out into the world done well for themselves  scarcely one he admitted my brothers words seem a little sweeping but they are very near the truth the air of the great cities seems to have poisoned every strangewey  not one stephen interrupted colonel john strangewey died leading his regiment at waterloo an end well enough but reached through many years of evil conduct and loose living  he was a brave soldier john put in quietly  that is true stephen admitted his best friends have claimed no other quality for him madam he went on turning toward louise lest my welcome to you this evening should have seemed inhospitable let me tell you this every strangewey who has left our county and trodden the downward path of failure has done so at the instance of one of your sex that is why those of us who inherit the family spirit look askance upon all strange women that is why no woman is ever welcome within this house  louise resumed her seat in the easy chair  i am so sorry she murmured looking down at her slipper i could not help breaking down here could i  nor could my brother fail to offer you the hospitality of this roof stephen admitted the incident was unfortunate but inevitable it is a matter for regret that we have so little to offer you in the way of entertainment he rose to his feet the door had been opened jennings was standing there with a candlestick upon a massive silver salver behind him was aline you are doubtless fatigued by your journey madam stephen concluded  louise made a little grimace but she rose at once to her feet she understood quite well that she was being sent to bed and she shivered a little when she looked at the hourbarely ten oclock yet it was all in keeping from the doorway she looked back into the room in which nothing seemed to have been touched for centuries she stood upon the threshold to bid her final goodnight fully conscious of the complete anachronism of her presence there  her smile for stephen was respectful and full of dignity as she glanced toward john however something flashed in her eyes and quivered at the corners of her lips something which escaped her control something which made him grip for a moment the back of the chair against which he stood then between the old man servant who insisted upon carrying her candle to her room and her maid who walked behind she crossed the white stone hall and stepped slowly up the broad flight of stairs                                       iii   louise awoke the next morning filled with a curious sense of buoyant expectancy the sunshine was pouring into the room brightening up its most somber corners it lay across the quilt of her bed and seemed to bring out the perfume of lavender from the pillow on which her head reposed  aline hearing her mistress stir hastened at once to the bedside  good morning madame  louise sat up and looked around her with her hands clasped about her knees  tell me everything aline she said have you my breakfast there and what time is it  it is halfpast nine madame aline replied and your breakfast is here the old imbecile from the kitchen has just brought it up  louise looked approvingly at the breakfast tray with the homemade bread and deepyellow butter the brown eggs and clear honey the smell of the coffee was aromatic she breathed a little sigh of content  how delicious everything looks she exclaimed  the homemade things are well enough in their way madame aline agreed but i have never known a household so strange and disagreeable that m jennings who calls himself the butlerhe is a person unspeakable a savage  louises eyes twinkled  i dont think they are fond of women in this household aline she remarked tell me have you seen charles  charles has gone to the nearest blacksmiths forge to get something made for the car madame aline replied he asked me to say that he was afraid he would not be ready to start before midday  that does not matter louise declared as she settled down to her breakfast i do not care how long it is before he is ready i should love to spend a month here  aline held up her hands she was speechless her mistress laughed at her consternation  well she continued there is no fear of their asking us for a month or for an hour longer than they can help the elder mr strangewey it seems has the strongest objection to our sex there is not a woman servant in the house is there  not one madame aline replied i have never been in a household conducted in such a manner it is like the kitchen of a monastery the terrible jennings is speechless if one addresses him he only mumbles the sound of my skirts or my footstep on the stone floor makes him shiver he is worse one would imagine than his master  louise ate and drank reflectively  it is the queerest household one could possibly stumble upon she remarked the young mr strangeweyhe seems different but he falls in with his brothers ways  aline glanced at herself in the mirror she was just out of her mistresss range of vision and she made a little grimace at her reflection  i met him twice this morning in the hall she remarked he wished me good morning the first time the second time he did not speak he did not seem to see me  louise finished her breakfast and strolled presently to the window she gave a little sigh of pleasure as she looked out  but aline she exclaimed how exquisite  the maid glanced over her shoulder and went on preparing her mistresss clothes  it is as madame finds it she replied for myself i like the country for fête days and holidays only and even then i like to find plenty of people there  louise heard nothing she was gazing eagerly out of the casementwindow immediately below was a grassgrown orchard which stretched upward at a precipitous angle toward a belt of freshly plowed field beyond a little chain of rocky hills sheer overhead the trees were pink and white with blossom the petals lay about upon the ground like drifted snowflakes here and there yellow jonquils were growing among the long grass a waft of perfume stole into the room through the window which she had opened  fill my bath quickly aline louise ordered i must go out i want to see whether it is really as beautiful as it looks  aline dressed her mistress in silence it was not until she had finished lacing her shoes that she spoke another word then suddenly she stopped short in the act of crossing the room her eyes had happened to fall upon the emblazoned genealogical record a little exclamation escaped her she swung round toward her mistress and for once there was animation in her face  but madame she exclaimed i have remembered the name strangeweyyou see it thereit was in our minds all the time that we had seen or heard of it quite lately dont you remember  yes yes louise interrupted i know it reminds me of something but of what  yesterday morning aline continued it was you madame who read it out while you took your coffee you spoke of the good fortune of some farmer in the north of england to whom a relative in australia had left a great fortunehundreds and thousands of pounds the name was strangewey the same as that i remember it now  she pointed once more to the family tree louise sat for a moment with parted lips  you are quite right aline i remember it all perfectly now i wonder whether it could possibly be either of these two men  aline shook her head doubtfully  it would be unbelievable madame she decided could any sane human creatures live here with no company but the sheep and the cows if they had moneymoney to live in the cities to buy pleasures to be happy unbelievable madame  louise remained standing before the window she was watching the blossomladen boughs of one of the apple trees bending and swaying in the fresh morning breezewatching the restless shadows which came and went upon the grass beneath  that is just your point of view aline she murmured but happinesswell you would not understand they are strange men these two the young one is different now but as he grows older he will be like his brother he will live a very simple and honorable life he will bewhat is it they call ita county magistrate chairman of many things a judge at agricultural shows when he dies he will be buried up in that windy little churchyard and people will come from a long way off to say how good he was my hat quickly aline if i am not in that orchard in five minutes i shall be miserable  louise found her way without difficulty across a cobbled yard through a postern gate set in a redbrick wall into the orchard very slowly and with her head turned upward toward the trees she made her way toward the boundary wall once with a little exclamation of pleasure she drew down a bough of the soft cool blossom and pressed it against her cheek she stopped for a moment or two to examine the contents of a row of chickencoops and at every few steps she turned around to face the breeze which came sweeping across the moorland from the other side of the house  arrived at the farther end of the orchard she came to a gate against which she rested for a moment leaning her arms upon the topmost bar before her was the little belt of plowed earth the fresh pungent odor of which was a new thing to her a little way to the right the rolling moorland starred with clumps of gorse in front across the field on the other side of the gray stone wall the rockstrewn hills the skyunusually blue it seemed to her and dotted all over with little masses of fleecy white cloudsseemed somehow lower and nearer or was she perhaps higher up  she lingered there absolutely bewildered by the rapid growth in her brain and senses of what surely must be some newly kindled faculty of appreciation there was a beauty in the world which she had not felt before  she turned her head almost lazily at the sound of a mans voice a team of horses straining at a plow were coming round the bend of the field and by their side talking to the laborer who guided them was john strangewey she watched him as he came into sight up the steep rise against the empty background he seemed to lose nothing of the size and strength that had impressed her on the previous night he was bareheaded and she noticed for the first time that his closely cropped fair hair was inclined to curl a little near the ears  he walked in step with the plowman by his side but without any of the laborers mechanical plodwith a spring in his footsteps indeed as if his life and thoughts were full of joyous things he was wearing blackandwhite tweed clothes a little shabby but wellfitting breeches and gaiters thick boots plentifully caked now with mud he was pointing with his stick along the furrow so absorbed in the instructions he was giving that he was almost opposite the gate before he was aware of her presence he promptly abandoned his task and approached her  good morning he called out  she waved her hand  good morning  you have slept well he asked  better i think than ever before in my life she answered differently at any rate and such an awakening  he looked at her a little puzzled the glow upon her face and the sunlight upon her brown hair kept him silent he was content to look at her and wonder  tell me she demanded impetuously is this a little corner of fairyland that you have found does the sun always shine like this does the earth always smell as sweetly and are your trees always in blossom does your wind always taste as if god had breathed the elixir of life into it  he turned around to follow the sweep of her eyes something of the same glow seemed to rest for a moment upon his face  it is good he said to find what you love so much appreciated by some one else  they stood together in a silence almost curiously protracted then the plowman passed again with his team of horses and john called out some instructions to him she followed him down to earth  tell me mr strangewey she inquired where are your farmbuildings  come and i will show you he answered opening the gate to let her through keep close to the hedge until we come to the end of the plow and thenbut no i wont anticipate this way  she walked by his side conscious every now and then of his frankly admiring eyes as he looked down at her she herself felt all the joy of a woman of the world imbibing a new experience she did not even glance toward the dismantled motor in the barn which they passed  i am glad he remarked presently that you look upon us more charitably than your maid  aline is a good girl louise said smiling but hotwater taps and electric lights are more to her than sunshine and hills do you know she went on i feel like a child being led through an undiscovered country a land of real adventures which way are we going and what are we going to see tell me please  wait he begged it is just a queer little corner among the hills that is all  they reached the end of the plowed field and passing through a gate turned abruptly to the left and began to climb a narrow path which bordered the boundary wall and which became steeper every moment as they ascended the orchard and the long low house on the other side seemed to lie almost at their feet the road and the open moorland beyond stretching to the encircling hills came more clearly into sight with every backward glance louise paused at last breathless  i must sit down she insisted it is too beautiful to hurry over  it is only a few steps farther he told her holding out his hand just to where the path winds its way round the hill there but perhaps you are tired  on the contrary she assured him i never felt so vigorous in my life all the exercise i take as a rule is in kensington gardens and look she pointed downward to her absurd little shoes and held out her hand you will have to help me she pleaded  the last few steps were indeed almost precipitous fragments of rock protruding through the grass and bushes served as steps john moved on a little ahead and pulled her easily up even the slight tightening of his fingers seemed to raise her from her feet she looked at him wonderingly  how strong you are  a matter of weight he answered smiling you are like a feather you walk as lightly as the fairies who come out on midsummer nights eve and dance in circles around the gorsebushes there  is it the home of the fairies you are taking me to she asked if you have discovered that no wonder you find us ordinary women outside your lives  he laughed  there are no fairies where we are going he assured her  they were on a roughmade road now which turned abruptly to the right a few yards ahead skirting the side of a deep gorge they took a few steps further and louise stopped short with a cry of wonder  around the abrupt corner an entirely new perspective was revealeda little hamlet built on a shoulder of the mountains and on the right below a steep descent a wide and sunny valley it was like a tiny world of its own hidden in the bosom of the hills there was a long line of farmbuildings built of gray stone and roofed with red tiles there were fifteen or twenty stacks a quaint whitewashed house of considerable size almost covered on the southward side with creepers a row of cottages and a graywalled enclosurestretching with its white tombstones to the very brink of the descentin the midst of which was an ancient church in ruins at the further end partly rebuilt with the stones of the hillside  louise looked around her silent with wonder a couple of sheepdogs had rushed out from the farmhouse and were fawning around her companion in the background a graybearded shepherd with scottish plaid thrown over his shoulder raised his hat  it isnt real is it she asked clinging for a moment to john strangeweys arm  he patted one of the dogs and smiled down at her  why not william elwick there is a very real shepherd i can assure you he has sat on these hills for the last sixtyeight years  she looked at the old man almost with awe  it is like the bible she murmured fancy the sunrises he must have seen and the sunsets the coming and the fading of the stars the spring days the music of the winds in these hollow places booming to him in the nighttime i want to talk to him may i  he shook his head the old man was already shambling off  better not he advised you would be disappointed for william has the family weaknesshe cannot bear the sight of a woman you see he is pretending now that there is something wrong with the hill flock you asked where the land was that we tilled now look down hold my arm if you feel giddy  she followed the wave of his ash stick the valley sheer below them and the lower hills on both sides were parceled out into fields enclosed within stone walls reminding her from the height at which they stood of nothing so much as the quilt upon her bed  thats where all our pasture is he told her and our arable land we grow a great deal of corn in the dip there all the rest of the hillside and the moorlands of course are fit for nothing but grazing but there are eleven hundred acres down there from which we can raise almost anything we choose  her eyes swept this strange tract of country backward and forward she saw the men like specks in the fields the cows grazing in the pasture like toy animals then she turned and looked at the neat row of stacks and the square of farmbuildings  i am trying hard to realize that you are a farmer and that this is your life she said  he swung open the wooden gate of the churchyard by which they were standing there was a row of graves on either side of the prim path  suppose he suggested you tell me about yourself nowabout your own life  the hills parted suddenly as she stood there looking southward through the chasm she seemed to see very clearly the things beyond her own life her own world spread itself outa world of easy triumphs of throbbing emotions always swiftly ministered to always leaving the same dull sensation of discontent a world in which the pathways were broad and smooth but in which the end seemed always the same a world of receding beauties and mocking desires the faces of her friends were theremen and women brilliant her intellectual compeers a little tired offering always the same gifts the same homage  my life and the world in which i live seem far away just now she said quietly i think that it is doing me good to have a rest from them go on talking to me about yourself please  he smiled he was just a little disappointed  we shall very soon reach the end of all that i have to tell you he remarked still if there is anything you would like to know  who were these men and women who have lived and died here she interrupted with a little wave of her hand toward the graves  all our own people he told her laborers shepherds tenantfarmers domestic servants our clergyman comes from the village on the other side of that hill he rides here every sunday on a pony which we have to provide for him  she studied the names upon the tombstones spelling them out slowly  the married people he went on are buried on the south side the single ones and children are nearer the wall tell me he asked after a moments hesitation are you married or single  she gave a little start the abruptness of the question the keen steadfast gaze of his compelling eyes seemed for a moment to paralyze both her nerves and her voice again the hills rolled open but this time it was her own life only that she saw her own life and one mans face which she seemed to see looking at her from some immeasurable distance waiting yet drawing her closer toward him closer and closer till their hands met  she was terrified at this unexpected tumult of emotion it was as if some one had suddenly drawn away one of the stones from the foundation of her life she found herself repeating the words on the tombstone facing her      and of elizabeth for sixtyone years the faithful wife and     helpmate of ezra cummings mother of his children and his     partner in the life everlasting  her knees began to shake there was a momentary darkness before her eyes she felt for the tombstone and sat down                                        iv   the churchyard gate was opened and closed noisily they both glanced up stephen strangewey was coming slowly toward them along the flinty path louise suddenly herself again rose briskly to her feet  here comes your brother she said i wish he wouldnt glower at me so i really am not such a terrible person as he seems to think  john muttered a word or two of polite but unconvincing protest they stood together awaiting his approach stephen had apparently lost none of his dourness of the previous night he was dressed in gray homespun with knickerbockers and stockings of great thickness he wore a flannel shirt and collar and a black wisp of a tie underneath his battered felt hat his weatherbeaten face seemed longer and grimmer than ever his mouth more uncompromising as he looked toward louise there was no mistaking the slow dislike in his steely eyes  your chauffeur madam has just returned he announced he sent word that he will be ready to start at one oclock  louise inspired to battle by the almost provocative hostility of her elder host smiled sweetly upon him  you cant imagine how sorry i am to hear it she said i dont know when in the whole course of my life i have met with such a delightful adventure or spent such a perfect morning  stephen looked at her with level disapproving eyesat her slender form in its perfectly fitting tailored gown at her patent shoes so obviously unsuitable for her surroundings and at the faint vision of silk stockings  if i might say so without appearing inhospitable he remarked with faint sarcasm this would seem to be the fitting moment for your departure a closer examination of our rough life up here might alter your views  she turned toward john and caught the deprecating glance which flashed from him to stephen  your brother is making fun of me she declared he looks at me and judges me just as i believe he would judge most peoplesternly and without mercy after all you know even though i am a daughter of the cities there is another point of viewours can you not believe that the call which prompts men and women to do the things in life which are really worth while is heard as often amid the hubbub of the city as in the solitude of these austere hills  the question is a bootless one stephen answered firmly the city calls to its own as the country holds its children and both do best in their own environment like to like and each bird to his own nest you would be as much out of place here with us madam as my brother and i on the pavements of your city  you may be right she admitted yet you dismiss one of the greatest questions in life with a single turn of your tongue it is given to no one to be infallible it is even possible that you may be wrong  it is possible stephen agreed grimly  the things in life which are worth while she continued looking down into the valley are common to all they do not consist of one thing for one man another for another to whom comes the greater share of themthe dweller in the city or you in your primitive and patriarchal life you rest your brains you make the seasons feed you you work enough to keep your muscles firm and nature does the rest she brings the food to your doors and when your harvest is over your work is done there are possibilities of rust here mr strangewey  stephens smile was almost disdainful  madam he declared you have six or seven million people in london how many of them live by really creative and honorable work how many are there of polyglot racehebrews germans foreigners of every type preying upon one another making false incomes which exist only on paper living in false luxury tasting false joys the signpost of our lives must be our personal inclinations our inclinationsmy brothers inclinations and minelead us as they have led my people for hundreds of years to seek the cleaner things in life and the simpler forms of happiness if i do not have the pleasure madam of seeing you again permit me to wish you farewell  he turned and walked away louise watched him with very real interest  do you know she said to john there is something which i can only describe as biblical about your brother something a little like the prophets of the old testament in the way he sees only one issue and clings to it are you too of his way of thinking  up to a certain point i believe i am he confessed i do not think i could ever have lived in the city i do not think i could ever have been happy in any of the professions  certainly i could not imagine you as a stockbroker or a lawyer i feel it hard to realize you in any of the ordinary walks of life still you know the greatest question of all remains unanswered are you content just to live and flourish and die are there no compelling obligations with which one is born do you never feel crampedin your mind i meanfeel that you want to push your way through the clouds into some other life  i feel nearer the clouds here he answered simply  i suppose you are sure of contentthat is to say if you can keep free from doubts still there is the fighting instinct you know the craving for action dont you feel that sometimes  perhaps he admitted  they were leaving the churchyard now she paused abruptly pointing to a single grave in a part of the churchyard which seemed detached from the rest  whose grave is that she inquired  he hesitated  it is the grave of a young girl he told her quietly  but why is she buried so far off and all alone louise persisted  she was the daughter of one of our shepherds he replied she went into service at carlisle and returned here with a child they are both buried there  because of that her grave is apart from the others  yes he answered it is very seldom i am glad to say that anything of the sort happens among us  for the second time that morning louise was conscious of an unexpected upheaval of emotion she felt that the sunshine had gone that the whole sweetness of the place had suddenly passed away the charm of its simple austerity had perished  and i thought i had found paradise she cried  she moved quickly from john strangeweys side before he could realize her intention she had stepped over the low dividing wall and was on her knees by the side of the plain neglected grave she tore out the spray of appleblossom which she had thrust into the bosom of her gown and placed it reverently at the head of the little mound for a moment her eyes drooped and her lips movedshe herself scarcely knew whether it was in prayer then she turned and came slowly back to her companion  something had gone too from his charm she saw in him now nothing but the coming dourness of his brother her heart was still heavy she shivered a little  come she said let us go back  they commenced the steep descent in silence every now and then john held his companion by the arm to steady her somewhat uncertain footsteps it was he at last who spoke  will you tell me please what is the matter with you and why you placed that sprig of appleblossom where you did  his tone woke her from her lethargy she was a little surprised at its poignant almost challenging note  certainly she replied i placed it there as a womans protest against the injustice of that isolation  i deny that it is unjust  she turned around and waved her hand toward the little gray building  the savior to whom your church is dedicated thought otherwise she reminded him do you play at being lords paramount here over the souls and bodies of your serfs  you judge without knowledge of the facts he assured her calmly the girl could have lived here happily and been married to a respectable young man she chose instead a wandering life she chose further to make it a disreputable one she broke her mothers heart and soured her fathers latter years she brought into the world a nameless child  louises footsteps slackened  you men she sighed are all alike you judge only by what happens you never look inside that is why your justice is so different from a womans all that you have told me is very pitiful but there is another view of the case which you should consider let us sit down upon this boulder for a few moments there is something that i should like to say to you before i go  they sat upon a ledge of rock below them was the house with its walled garden and the blossomladen orchard beyond stretched the moorland brilliant with patches of yellow gorse and the hills blue and melting in the morning sunlight  dont you men sometimes realize she continued earnestly the many many guises in which temptation may come to a woman especially to the young girl so far from home she may be very lonely and she may care and if she cares it is so hard to refuse the man she loves the very sweetness the very generosity of a womans nature prompts her to give give give all the time there are other women similarly circumstanced who think only of themselves of their own safety and happiness and they escape the danger but are they to be praised and respected while she that yields is condemned and cast out i feel that you are not going to agree with me and i do not wish to argue with you but what i so passionately object to is the sweeping judgment you makethe sheep on one side and the goats on the other that is how man judges god looks further every case is different the law by which one should be judged may be poor justice for another  she glanced at him almost appealingly but there was no sign of yielding in his face  laws he reminded her are made for the benefit of the whole human race sometimes an individual may suffer for the benefit of others that is inevitable  and so let the subject pass she concluded but it saddens me to think that one of the great sorrows of the world should be there like a monument to spoil the wonder of this morning now i am going to ask you a question are you the john strangewey who has recently had a fortune left to him  he nodded  you read about it in the newspapers i suppose he said part of the story isnt true it was stated that i had never seen my australian uncle but as a matter of fact he has been over here three or four times it was he who paid for my education at harrow and oxford  what did your brother say to that  he opposed it john confessed and he hated my uncle he detests the thought of any one of us going out of sight of our own hills my uncle had the wanderfever  and you she asked suddenly  i have none of it he asserted  a very faint smile played about her lips  perhaps not before she murmured but now  do you mean because i have inherited the money  she leaned a little toward him her smile now was more evident and there was something in her eyes which was almost like a challenge  naturally  what difference does my money make he demanded  dont you realize the increase of your power as a human being she replied dont you realize the larger possibilities of the life that is open to you you can move if you will in the big world you can take your place in any society you choose meet interesting people who have done things learn everything that is new do everything that is worth doing in life you can travel to the remote countries of the globe you can become a politician a philanthropist or a sportsman you can follow your tastes wherever they lead you andperhaps this is the most important thing of allyou can do everything upon a splendid scale  he smiled down at her  that all sounds very nice he admitted but supposing that i have no taste in any of the directions you have mentioned supposing my life here satisfies me supposing i find all that i expect to find in life here on my own land among my own hills what then  she looked at him with a curiosity which was almost passionate her lips were parted her senses strained  it is not possible she exclaimed that you can mean it  but why not he protested i have not the tortuous brain of the modern politician i hate citiesthe smell of them the atmosphere of them the life in them the desire for travel is only half born in me that may comei cannot tell i love the daily work here i am fond of horses and dogs i know every yard of land we own and i know what it will produce it interests me to try experimentsnew crops a new distribution of crops new machinery sometimes new methods of fertilizing i love to watch the seasons come and reign and pass i love to feel the wind and the sun and even the rain all these things have become a sort of appetite to me i am afraid he wound up a little lamely that this is all very badly expressed but the whole truth of it is you see that i am a man of simple and inherited tastes i feel that my life is here and i live it here and i love it why should i go out like a don quixote and search for vague adventures  because you are a man she answered swiftly you have a brain and a soul too big for your life here you eat and drink and physically you flourish but part of you sleeps because it is shut away from the world of real things dont you sometimes feel it in your very heart that life as we were meant to live it can only be lived among your fellow men  he looked upward over his shoulder at the little cluster of farmbuildings and cottages and the gray stone church  it seems to me he declared simply that the man who tries to live more than one life fails in both there is a little cycle of life here among our thirty or forty souls which revolves around my brother and myself you would think it stupid and humdrum because the people are peasants but i am not sure that you are right the elementary things you know are the greatest and those we have our young people fall in love and marry the joy of birth comes to our mothers and the tragedy of death looms over us all some go out into the world some choose to remain here a passerby may glance upward from the road at our little hamlet and wonder what can ever happen in such an outoftheway corner i think the answer is just what i have told you love and marriage birth and death happen these things make life  her curiosity now had become merged in an immense interest she laid her fingers lightly upon his arm  you speak for your people she said that is well i can understand their simple lives being as absorbing to them as ours are to us i can imagine how here among your hills you can watch as a spectator a cycle of life which contains as you have pointed out every element of tragedy and happiness but you yourself  i am one of them he answered a necessary part of them  how you deceive yourself i am sure you are honest i am sure you believe what you say but will you remember what i am going to tell you the time will come before very long when you will feel doubts  doubts about what  she smiled enigmatically  oh they will assert themselves she assured him and you will recognize them when they come something will whisper to you in your heart that after all you are not of the same clay as these simple folkthat there is a different mission in the world for a man like you than to play the part of feudal lord over a few peasants sooner or later you will come out into the world and the sooner the better i think mr john strangewey or you will grow like your brother here among your granite hills  he moved a little uneasily all the time she was watching him it seemed to her that she could read the thoughts which were stirring in his brain  you would like to say wouldnt you she went on that your brothers is a useful and an upright life so it may be but it is not wide enough or great enough no one should be content with the things which he can reach he should climb a little higher and pluck the riper fruit some day you will feel the desire to climb something will come to youin the night perhaps or on the bosom of that wind you love so much it may be a call of music or it may be a more martial note promise me will you that when you feel the impulse you wont use all that obstinate willpower of yours to crush it you will destroy the best part of yourself if you do you will give it a chance promise  she held out her hand with a little impulsive gesture he took it in his own and held it steadfastly  i will remember he promised  along the narrow streak of road from the southward they both watched the rapid approach of a large motorcar there were two servants upon the front seat and one passengera maninside it swung into the level stretch beneath them a fantasy of gray and silver in the reflected sunshine  louise had been leaning forward her head supported upon her hands as the car slackened speed she rose very slowly to her feet  the chariot of deliverance she murmured  it is the prince of seyre john remarked gazing down with a slight frown upon his forehead  she nodded they had started the descent and she was walking in very leisurely fashion  the prince is a great friend of mine she said i had promised to spend last night or at any rate some portion of the evening at raynham castle on my way to london  he summoned up courage to ask her the question which had been on his lips more than once  as your stay with us is so nearly over wont you abandon your incognito  in the absence of your brother she answered i will risk it my name is louise maurel  louise maurel the actress he repeated wonderingly  i am she louise confessed would your brother she added with a little grimace feel that he had given me a nights lodging under false pretense  john made no immediate reply the world had turned topsyturvy with him louise maurel and a great friend of the prince of seyre he walked on mechanically until she turned and looked at him  well  i am sorry he declared bluntly  why she asked a little startled at his candor  i am sorry first of all that you are a friend of the prince of seyre  and again why  because of his reputation in these parts  what does that mean she asked  i am not a scandalmonger john replied dryly i speak only of what i know his estates near here are systematically neglected he is the worst landlord in the country and the most unscrupulous his tenants both here and in westmoreland have to work themselves to death to provide him with the means of living a disreputable life  are you not forgetting that the prince of seyre is a friend of mine she asked stiffly  i forget nothing he answered you see up here we have not learned the art of evading the truth  she shrugged her shoulders  so much for the prince of seyre then and now why your dislike of my profession  that is another matter he confessed you come from a world of which i know nothing all i can say is that i would rather think of youas something different  she laughed at his somber face and patted his arm lightly  big man of the hills she said when you come down from your frozen heights to look for the flowers i shall try to make you see things differently                                        v   the prince who had just been joined by stephen had descended from his car and was waiting in the road when louise and john approached he came a few paces forward to meet her and held out both his hands  my dear wandering guest he exclaimed so i have found you at last what shall i say to this mishap which has robbed me of so many hours of your visit i am too happy though to know that you have suffered no personal inconvenience  thanks to the great kindness of my hosts louise replied smiling a little mockingly at stephen i have been completely spoiled here prince and i can only regard my accident as a delightful little interlude  the prince bowed and half held out his hand to stephen the latter however appeared not to notice the movement  i shall always remember with gratitude the prince declared the kindness of mr strangewey and his brother to my lost guest i fear he went on regretfully that i do not seem very neighborly i am not often at raynham castle except in august and september i find your northern air somewhat too severe for me  your tenants prince stephen remarked calmly would like to see a little more of you  the prince shrugged his shoulders he was a man of medium height slender with a long and almost colorless face he carried himself with the goodhumored air of the man of the world among strange surroundings toward which he desired to express his toleration his clothes and voice were perfectly english although the latter was unusually slow and soft at first sight there was no apparent evidence of his foreign birth he turned once more toward stephen  my agent mr simon is a very excellent man and i have every confidence in his discretion my tenants here could scarcely feel toward me as they might have done if raynham had come into my possession in the direct line however this year as it happens i have made up my mind to spend more time here my keepers tell me that after four bad seasons the prospects for grouse on my higher moors are excellent i shall hope he added turning to john to have you join us often i must confess that the only time i had ever heard your name before the newspapers advertised your recent good fortune was in connection with shooting they tell me that you are the best shot and the finest horseman in cumberland  you were probably told that at raynham john remarked our people always exaggerate the prowess of their own folk and my brother and i are natives  i trust the prince concluded that you will give me the opportunity of judging for myself and now dear lady he went on turning to louise i am loath to lose another minute of my promised visit i have taken the liberty of telling your maid to place your wraps in my car we can reach raynham in time for a late lunch your own car can follow us and bring your maid  for a moment louise did not reply the prince had moved a few steps away to give some directions to his chauffeur and he saw nothing of the strange look of indecision that had suddenly crept into her face her eyebrows were contracted she had turned and was gazing up the precipitous strip of moorland toward the graywalled church then she glanced at john strangewey and her eyes seemed filled with the questioning of a child it was as if she had abandoned the rôle of mentor as if she herself were seeking for guidance or help  johns unspoken response was prompt and unmistakable and she smiled ever so slightly she no longer thought him narrow and prejudiced an unfair judge of things beyond his comprehension he had helped her in a moment of trial an idea had flashed between them and she acted upon it with amazing promptitude  alas prince she sighed as he turned back toward them i am so sorry but i fear that this little accident must change all my plans as you know mine was to have been only a brief stay at raynham and i fear now that even that is impossible  the prince drew a step nearer something of the calm suavity had suddenly gone from his manner when he spoke his measured words were full of appeal  but my dear friend he begged you will not rob me altogether of this visit to which i have looked forward so eagerly it was to receive you for a few hours that i came from paris and opened raynham castle you yourself shall decide the length of your stay and a special train shall take you back to london the moment you give the word in that way you will both save time and spare meone of the greatest disappointments of my life  she shook her head slowly and very decisively  you cannot imagine how sorry i am prince she said but as it is i must take a special train from kendal if there is not one starting soon after i reach the station i wish to reach london either this evening or very early in the morning  the prince was holding himself in restraint with a visible effort his eyes were fixed upon louises face as if trying to read her thoughts  is the necessity so urgent he asked  judge for yourself she replied henri graillot is there waiting for me you know how impatient he is and all london is clamoring for his play night to him is just the same as day i shall telegraph from kendal the hour of my arrival  the prince sighed  i think he said quietly that i am the most unfortunate man in the world at least then you will permit me to drive you to kendal i gather from your chauffeur that your car although temporarily repaired is not altogether reliable  she answered him only after a slight hesitation for some reason or other his proposition did not seem wholly welcome  that will be very kind of you she assented  if we start at once the prince suggested we shall catch the scotch mail  you will surely lunch firstand you prince john begged  she laid her hand upon his arm  my friend no she replied i am feverishly anxious to get back to london walk with me to the car i will wave my adieus to peak hall when we are up among the hills  she drew him on a few paces ahead  i am going back to london she continued lowering her voice a little with some very strange impressions and some very pleasant memories i feel that your life here is in its way very beautiful and yet the contemplation of your future fills me with an immense curiosity i have not talked to you for very long mr strangewey and you may not be quite the sort of person i think you are but i am seldom mistaken i am an artist you see and we have perceptions i think that even here the time will come when the great unrest will seize you too in its toils though the color may not fade from your hills and though the appleblossom may still glorify your orchard and your flowers bloom and smell as sweetly and your winds bring you the same music i think that the time will come when the note in you which answers to these things and which gives you contentment will fail to respond then i thinki hope perhapsthat we may meet  she spoke very softly almost under her breath and when she had finished there seemed everywhere a strange emptiness of sound the panting of the engine from the motorcar stephens measured words as he walked with his uncongenial companion seemed to come to john from some other world  his voice when he spoke sounded a little harsh although he was denying it fiercely to himself he was filled with a dim harrowing consciousness that the struggle had already begun notwithstanding the unrealized joy of these few hours his last words to louise were almost words of anger his last look from beneath his level closedrawn eyebrows was almost militant  i hope he declared that what you have said may not be true i hope fervently that the time may never come when i shall feel that i need anything more in life than i can find in the home i love in the work which is second nature to me in my books and my sports  the prince escaping gracefully from a companion who remained adamant to all his advances had maneuvered his way to their side the last few steps were taken together in a few moments they were in the car and ready to start stephen with a stiff little bow had already departed louise leaned out from her place with outstretched hands  and now goodby dear mr strangewey your brother would not let me make my little speech to him so you must accept the whole of my thanks and she went on the corners of her mouth twitching a little although her face remained perfectly grave if the time should come when the need of reinvestments or of some new machinery for your farm brings you to london will you promise that you will come and see me  i will promise that with much pleasure john answered  she leaned back and the prince took her place holding out his hand  mr strangewey although your luck has been better than mine and you have robbed me of a visit to which i had looked forward for months i bear you no illwill i trust that you will do me the honor of shooting with me before long my head keeper arranges for the local guns and i shall see that he sends you a list of the days on which we shall shoot may i beg that you will select the most convenient to yourself if you have no car here it will give me additional pleasure to welcome you at raynham as my guest  john struggling against an instinctive dislike of which for many reasons he was a little ashamed murmured a few incoherent words the prince leaned back and the car glided away followed a few minutes later by louises own landaulet with aline in solitary state inside  john watched the little procession until it finally disappeared from sight then he turned on his heel and went into the house stephen who had just filled a pipe was smoking furiously in the hall  have they gone he demanded  john nodded  they are racing into kendal to catch the scotchman for london  the sooner she gets there the better stephen growled  john raised his head the light of battle flashed for a moment in his eyes  she came here unbidden he said and we did no more than our bounden duty in entertaining her for the rest what is there that you can say against her women there must be in the world why do you judge those who come your way so harshly  stephen withdrew the pipe from his mouth and dealt the black oak table in front of him a blow with his great fist even john himself was struck with the sudden likeness of his brothers face to the granite rocks which were piled around their home  ill answer your question john he said ill tell you the truth as i see it and as i know it women there must be to breed mens sons to care for their households even i grant you to be their companions and to lighten the dark days when sorrow comes but she isnt that sort she is as far removed from them as our mountain road is from the scented thoroughfares of bond street or the rue de la paix where she might take her daily exercise ill tell you about her john she is one of those who have sown the hatred of women in my heart do you know what i call them john i call them witchwomen theres something of the devil in their blood they call themselves artists they have the gift of turning the heads and spoiling the lives of sober wellliving men till they make them dance to their bidding along the ways of shame and turn their useful lives into the dotage of a lovesick boy they arent childbearing women that sort they dont want to take their proper place in your household by your side breed sons and daughters for you sink their own lives in the greater duties of motherhood theres generally a drop of devilish foreign blood in their veins as she has our grandmother had it you know the result the empty frame in the lumberroom will tell you  john half angry half staggered by his brothers vehemence was for the moment a little confused  there may be women like that stephen he confessed i am not denying the truth of much that you say but what right have you to class her among them what do you know of her  its written in her face stephen answered fiercely women like her breathe it from their lips when they speak just as it shines out of their eyes when they look at you an actress and a friend of the prince of seyre a woman who thought it worth her while during her few hours stay here john had suddenly straightened himself stephen clenched his teeth curse it thats enough he said shes gone anyway come lets have our lunch                                        vi   once more that long winding stretch of mountain road lay empty under the moonlight three months had passed and none of the mystery of the earlier season in the year remained the hills had lost their canopy of soft gray mist nature had amplified and emphasized herself the whole outline of the country was marvelously distinct the more distant mountains as a rule blurred and uncertain in shape seemed now to pierce with their jagged summits the edge of the starfilled sky  up the long slope where three months before he had ridden to find himself confronted with the adventure of his life john strangewey jogged homeward in his high dogcart the mare scenting her stable broke into a quick trot as they topped the long rise suddenly she felt a hand tighten upon her reins she looked inquiringly around and then stood patiently awaiting her masters bidding  it seemed to john as if he had passed from the partial abstraction of the last few hours into absolute and entire forgetfulness of the present he could see the motorcar drawn up by the side of the road could hear the fretful voice of the maid and the soft pleasant words of greeting from the woman who had seemed from the first as if she were very far removed indeed from any of the small annoyances of their accident  i have broken down can you help  he set his teeth the poignancy of the recollection was a torture to him word by word he lived again through that brief interview he saw her descend from the car felt the touch of her hand on his arm saw the flash of her brown eyes as she drew close to him with that pleasant little air of familiarity shared by no other woman he had ever known  then the little scene faded away and he remembered the tedious present he had spent two dull days at the house of a neighboring landowner playing cricket in the daytime dancing at night with women in whom he was unable to feel the slightest interest always with that faraway feeling in his heart struggling hour by hour with that curious restlessness which seemed to have taken a permanent place in his disposition he was on his way home to peak hall he knew exactly the welcome which was awaiting him he knew exactly the news he would receive he raised his whip and cracked it viciously in the air  stephen was waiting for him as he had expected in the dining room the elder strangewey was seated in his accustomed chair smoking his pipe and reading the paper the table was laid for a meal which jennings was preparing to serve  back again john his brother remarked looking at him fixedly over his newspaper  john picked up one or two letters glanced them over and flung them down upon the table he had examined every envelope for the last few months with the same expectancy and thrown each one down with the same throb of disappointment  as you see  had a good time  not very we were too strong for them they came without a bowler at all  did you get a good knock  a hundred and seven john replied it was just a slog though nothing to eat thank you jennings you can clear the table so far as i am concerned i had supper with the greys have they finished the barleyfields stephen  all in at eight oclock  there was a brief silence then stephen knocked the ashes from his pipe and rose to his feet  john he asked why did you pull up on the road there  there was no immediate answer the slightest of frowns formed itself upon the younger mans face  how did you know that i pulled up  i was sitting with the window open listening for you i came outside to see what had happened and i saw your lights standing still  i had a fancy to stop for a moment john said nothing more  you arent letting your thoughts dwell upon that woman  i have thought about her sometimes john answered almost defiantly whats the harm im still here am i not  stephen crossed the room from the drawer of the old mahogany sideboard he produced an illustrated paper he turned back the frontispiece fiercely and held it up  do you see that john  ive seen it already  stephen threw the paper upon the table  shes going to act in another of those confounded french plays he said translations with all the wit taken out and all the vulgarity left in  we know nothing of her art john declared coldly we shouldnt understand it even if we saw her act therefore it isnt right for us to judge her the world has found her a great actress she is not responsible for the plays she acts in  stephen turned away and lit his pipe anew he smoked for a minute or two furiously his thick eyebrows came closer and closer together he seemed to be turning some thought over in his mind  john he asked is it this cursed money that is making you restless  i never think of it except when some one comes begging i promised a thousand pounds to the infirmary today  then whats wrong with you  john stretched himself out a splendid figure of healthy manhood his cheeks were suntanned his eyes clear and bright  the matter theres nothing on earth the matter with me he declared  it isnt your health i mean there are other things as you well know you do your days work and you take your pleasure and you go through both as if your feet were on a treadmill  your fancy stephen  god grant it ive had an unwelcome visitor in your absence  john turned swiftly around  a visitor he repeated who was it  stephen glowered at him for a moment  it was the prince he said the prince of seyre as he calls himself though he has the right to style himself master of raynham its only his foreign blood which makes him choose what i regard as the lesser title yes he called to ask you to shoot and stay at the castle if you would from the 16th to the 20th of next month  what answer did you give him  i told him that you were your own master you must send word tomorrow  he did not mention the names of any of his other guests i suppose  he mentioned no names at all  john was silent for a moment a bewildering thought had taken hold of him supposing she were to be there  stephen watching him read his thoughts and for a moment lost control of himself  were you thinking about that woman he asked sternly  what woman  the woman whom we sheltered here the woman whose shameless picture is on the cover of that book  john swung round on his heel  stop that stephen he said menacingly  why should i the older man retorted take up that paper if you want to read a sketch of the life of louise maurel see the play she made her name inla gioconda  what about it  stephen held the paper out to his brother john read a few lines and dashed it into a corner of the room  theres this much about it john stephen continued the woman played that part night after nightplayed it to the life mind you she made her reputation in it thats the woman we unknowingly let sleep beneath this roof the barn is the place for her and her sort  johns clenched fists were held firmly to his sides his eyes were blazing  thats enough stephen he cried  no its not enough was the fierce reply the truths been burning in my heart long enough its better out you want to find her a guest at raynham castle do youraynham castle where never a decent woman crosses the threshold if she goes there she goes as his mistress well  an anger that was almost paralyzing a sense of the utter impotence of words drove john in silence from the room he left the house by the back door passed quickly through the orchard where the tangled moonlight lay upon the ground in strange fantastic shadows across the narrow strip of field a field now of golden stubble up the rough ascent across the road and higher still up the hill which looked down upon the farmbuildings and the churchyard  he sat grimly down upon a great boulder filled with a hateful sense of unwreaked passion yet with a queer thankfulness in his heart that he had escaped the miasma of evil thoughts which stephens words seemed to have created the fancy seized him to face these halfveiled suggestions of his brothers so far as they concerned himself and his life during the last few months  stephen was right this woman who had dropped from the clouds for those few brief hours had played strange havoc with johns thoughts and his whole outlook upon life the coming of harvest the care of his people his sports his cricket the early days upon the grouse moors had all suddenly lost their interest for him life had become a task the echo of her halfmocking halfchallenging words was always in his ears  he sat with his head resting upon his hands looking steadfastly across the valley below almost at his feet lay the little church with its graveyard the long line of stacks and barns the laborers cottages the bailiffs house the whole little colony around which his life seemed centered the summer moonlight lay upon the ground almost like snow he could see the sheaves of wheat standing up in the most distant of the cornfields beyond was the dark gorge toward which he had looked so many nights at this hour  across the viaduct there came a blaze of streaming light a serpentlike trail a faintly heard whistlethe scottish express on its way southward toward london his eyes followed it out of sight he found himself thinking of the passengers who would wake the next morning in london he felt himself suddenly acutely conscious of his isolation was there not something almost monastic in the seclusion which had become a passion with stephen and which had its grip too upon hima waste of life a burying of talents  he rose to his feet the halfformed purpose of weeks held him now definite and secure he knew that this pilgrimage of his to the hilltop his rapt contemplation of the little panorama which had become so dear to him was in a sense valedictory                                       after all two more months passed before the end came and it came then without a moments warning it was a little past midday when john drove slowly through the streets of market ketton in his high dogcart exchanging salutations right and left with the tradespeople with farmers brought into town by the market with acquaintances of all sorts and conditions more than one young woman from the shopwindows or the pavements ventured to smile at him and the few greetings he received from the wives and daughters of his neighbors were as gracious as they could possibly be made john almost smiled once in the act of raising his hat as he realized how completely the whole charm of the world for him seemed to lie in one womans eyes  at the crossways where he should have turned up to the inn he paused while a motorcar passed it contained a woman who was talking to her host she was not in the least like louise and yet instinctively he knew that she was of the same world the perfection of her whiteserge costume her hat so smartly worn the halfinsolent smile the little gesture with which she raised her handsomething about her unlocked the floodgates  market ketton had seemed well enough a few minutes ago john had felt a healthy appetite for his midday meal and a certain interest concerning a deal of barley upon which he was about to engage and now another world had him in its grip he flicked the mare with his whip turned away from the inn and galloped up to the station keeping pace with the train whose whistle he had heard standing outside was a local horsedealer of his acquaintance  take the mare back for me to peak hall will you jenkins or send one of your lads he begged i want to catch this train  the man assented with pleasureit paid to do a kindness for a strangewey john passed through the ticketoffice to the platform where the train was waiting threw open the door of a carriage and flung himself into a corner seat the whistle sounded the adventure of his life had begun at last                                       vii   the great french dramatist dark palefaced and corpulent stood upon the extreme edge of the stage brandishing his manuscript in his hand from close at hand the stage manager watched him anxiously for the third time m graillot was within a few inches of the orchestrawell  if you would pardon me m graillot he ventured timidly the footlights are quite unprotected as you see  graillot glanced behind him and promptly abandoned his dangerous position  it is you ladies and gentlemen he declared shaking his manuscript vigorously at the handful of people upon the stage who drive me into forgetfulness and place me in the danger from which our friend here has just rescued me do i not best know the words and the phrases which will carry the messages of my play across the footlights who is to judge ladies and gentlemenyou or i  he banged the palm of his left hand with the rolledup manuscript and looked at them all furiously a slight middleaged man cleanshaven with a single eyeglass and features very well known to the theatergoing world detached himself a little from the others  no one indeed dear m graillot he admitted could possibly know these things so well as you but on the other hand when you write in your study at fontainebleau you write for a quickerminded public than ours the phrase which would find its way at once to the brain of the french audience needs shall i say just a little amplification to carry equal weight across the footlights of my theater i will admit that we are dealing with a translation which is in its way not sufficiently literal but our friend shamus here has pointed out to me the difficulties the fact is m graillot that some of the finest phrases in your work are untranslatable  there are times the dramatist asserted moistening his lips vigorously with his tongue when i regret that i ever suffered mr shamus or anybody else to attempt to translate my inimitable play into a language wholly inadequate to express its charm and subtlety  quite so the actor remarked sympathetically but still since the deed has been done m graillot and since we are going to produce the result in the course of a fortnight or so or lose a great deal of money dont you think that we had all better try our utmost to insure the success of the production  the only success i care for graillot thundered is an artistic success  with miss maurel playing your leading part m graillot the actormanager declared not to speak of a company carefully selected to the best of my judgment i think you may venture to anticipate even that  the dramatist bowed hurriedly to louise  you recall to me a fact he said gallantly which almost reconciles me to this diabolical travesty of some of my lines proceed thenproceed i will be as patient as possible  the stage manager shouted out some directions from his box a gentleman in faultless morning clothes who seemed to have been thoroughly enjoying the interlude suddenly adopted the puppetlike walk of a footman other actors who had been whispering together in the wings came back to their places louise advanced alone a little languidly to the front of the stage at the first sound of her voice m graillot nodding his head vigorously was soothed  her speech was a long one it appeared that she had been arraigned before a company of her relatives assembled to comment upon her misdeeds she wound up with a passionate appeal to her husband mr miles faraday who had made an unexpected appearance m graillots face as she concluded was wreathed in smiles  ah he cried you have lifted us all up now i feel once more the inspiration mademoiselle i kiss your hand he went on it is you who still redeem my play you bring back the spirit of it to me in you i see the embodiment of my thérèse  miles faraday gave a little sigh of relief and glanced gratefully toward louise she nodded back to him and gave her hand to the frenchman who held it to his lips  you flatter me m graillot she said it is simply that i feel the force of your beautiful words thérèse is a wonderful conception as to those disputed passageswell i feel myself in a very difficult position artistically i am entirely in accord with you and yet i understand exactly what mr faraday means from the commercial point of view let us submit the matter to the prince he knows something of both sides of the question  the prince of seyre who was seated in the orchestraleaders chair looked reproachfully toward louise  is this fair he protested remember that i am more than half a frenchman and that i am one of our friends most faithful disciples i realize the delicacy of the situation and i understand mr faradays point of view i tell you frankly that the thought of an empty theater appals me it is not the moneyi am sure you all know thatbut there isnt a single man or woman in the world who can do his best unless he or she plays to a full house somehow or other we must secure our audience  it really comes to this faraday intervened shall we achieve a purely artistic triumph and drive the people away or shall weat the expense i admit of some of the finest passages in m graillots superb dramacompromise the matter and keep our boxoffice open in a more humble way i hope i also may call myself an artist and yet not only must i live myself but i have a staff of employees dependent upon me  graillot waved his hand  so no more he exclaimed grandiloquently the affair is finished my consent is given delete the lines as to the scene laid in the bedroom of madame tonight i shall take up my pen by noon tomorrow i will give you a revision which will puff out the cheeks of the philistines with satisfaction have no fear cher ami faraday mothers shall bring their unmarried daughters to see our play they shall all watch it without a blush if there is anything to make the others think it shall be beneath the surface it shall be for the great artist whom it is my supreme joy to watch he went on bowing to louise to act and express the real truth of my ideas through the music of innocent words  then all is arranged miles faraday concluded briskly we will leave the second act until tomorrow then m graillot will bring us his revision we will proceed now to the next act stand back a little if you please ladies and gentlemen miss maurel will you make your entrance  louise made no movement her eyes were fixed upon a certain shadowy corner of the wings overwrought as she had seemed a few minutes ago with the emotional excitement of her long speech there was now a new and curious expression upon her face she seemed to be looking beyond the gloomy unlit spaces of the theater into some unexpected land  curiously enough the three people there most interested in herthe prince graillot and her friend sophy gerardeach noticed the change the little fairhaired girl who owed her small part in the play to louise quitted her chair to follow the direction of her friends eyes faraday with the frown of an actormanager resenting an intrusion gazed in the same direction  to sophy the newcomer was simply the handsomest young man she had ever seen in her life to faraday he represented nothing more nor less than the unwelcome intruder the prince alone with immovable features but with a slight contraction of his eyebrows gazed with distrust almost with fear unaccountable yet disturbing at the tall hesitating figure that stood just off the stage  louise only knew that she was amazed at herself amazed to find the walls of the theater falling away from her she forgot the little company of her friends by whom she was surrounded she forgot the existence of the famous dramatist who hung upon her words and the close presence of the prince her feet no longer trod the dusty boards of the theater she was almost painfully conscious of the perfume of appleblossom  you she exclaimed stretching out her hands why do you not come and speak to me i am here  john came out upon the stage the french dramatist with his hands behind his back made swift mental notes of an interesting situation he saw the coming of a man who stood like a giant among them sunburnt buoyant with health his eyes bright with the wonder of his unexpected surroundings a man in whose presence every one else seemed to represent an effete and pallid type of humanity  the dramatist and the prince were satisfied however with one single glance at the newcomer afterward their whole regard was focused upon louise the same thought was in the mind of both of themthe same fear                                       viii   those first few sentences spoken in the midst of a curious little crowd of strangers seemed to john when he thought of his long waiting almost piteously inadequate louise recognizing the difficulty of the situation swiftly recovered her composure she was both tactful and gracious  do tell me how you got in here she said no one is allowed to pass the stage door at rehearsal times mr faraday to whom i will introduce you in a moment is a perfect autocrat and mr mullins our stage manager is even worse  i just asked for you john explained the doorkeeper told me that you were engaged but i persuaded him to let me come in  she shook her head  bribery she declared accusingly  i heard your voice and after that it was hard to go away im afraid i ought to have waited outside  louise turned to miles faraday who was looking a little annoyed  mr faraday she said appealingly mr strangewey comes from the countryhe is in fact the most complete countryman i have ever met in my life he comes from cumberland and he oncewell very nearly saved my life he knows nothing about theaters and he hasnt the least idea of the importance of a rehearsal you wont mind if we put him somewhere out of the way till we have finished will you  after such an introduction faraday said in a tone of resignation mr strangewey would be welcome at any time  theres a dear man louise exclaimed let me introduce him quickly mr john strangeweymr miles faraday m graillot miss sophy gerard my particular little friend the prince you already know although you may not recognize him trying to balance himself on that absurd stool  john bowed in various directions and faraday taking him goodnaturedly by the arm led him to a gardenseat at the back of the stage  there he said you are one of the most privileged persons in london you shall hear the finish of our rehearsal there isnt a press man in london id have near the place  very kind of you im sure john replied is this may i ask the play that you are soon going to produce  three weeks from next monday i hope faraday told him dont attempt to judge by anything you hear this afternoon we are just deciding upon some cuts see you later you may smoke if you like  twentyfour hours away from his silent hills john looked out with puzzled eyes from his dusty seat among ropes and pulleys and leaning fragments of scenery what he saw and heard seemed to him for the most part a meaningless tangle of gestures and phrases the men and women in fashionable clothes moving about before that gloomy space of empty auditorium looked more like marionettes than creatures of flesh and blood drawn this way and that at the bidding of the stout masterly frenchman who was continually muttering exclamations and banging the manuscript upon his hand  he kept his eyes fixed upon louise he told himself that he was in her presence at last as the moments passed it became more and more difficult for him to realize the actuality of the scene upon which he was looking it seemed like a dreampicture with unreal men and women moving about aimlessly saying strange words  then there came a moment which brought a tingle into his blood which plunged his senses into hot confusion he rose to his feet faraday was sitting down and louise was resting both her hands upon his shoulders  is there nothing i can be to you then edmund she asked her voice vibrating with a passion which he found it hard to believe was not real  faraday turned slowly in his chair he held out his arms  one thing he murmured  john had moved half a step forward when he felt the princes eyes fixed upon him and was conscious of a sudden sense of ignorance almost of uncouthness it was a play which they were rehearsing of course it was a damnable thing to see louise taken into that cold and obviously unreal embrace but it was only a play it was part of her work  john resumed his seat and folded his arms with the embrace had fallen an imaginary curtain and the rehearsal was over they were all crowded together talking in the center of the stage the prince who had stepped across the footlights made his way to where john was sitting  so you have deserted cumberland for a time he courteously inquired  i came up last night john replied  you are making a long stay  john hesitated he felt that no one knew less of his movements than he himself his eyes had wandered to where louise and graillot were talking  i can scarcely tell yet i have made no plans  london at this season of the year the prince observed is scarcely at its best  john smiled  i am afraid he said that i am not critical it is eight years since i was here last on my way down from oxford  you have been abroad perhaps the prince inquired  i have not been out of cumberland during the whole of that time john confessed  the prince after a moments incredulous stare laughed softly to himself  you are a very wonderful person mr strangewey he declared i have heard of your good fortune if i can be of any service to you during your stay in town he added politely please command me  you are very kind john replied gratefully  louise broke away from the little group and came across toward them  free at last she exclaimed now let us go out and have some tea  they made their way down the little passage and out into the sudden blaze of the sunlit streets two cars were drawn up outside the stage door  the carlton or rumpelmayers asked the prince who had overtaken them upon the pavement  the carlton i think louise decided we can get a quiet table there inside the restaurant you bring sophy will you eugène i am going to take possession of mr strangewey  the prince with a little bow pointed to the door of his limousine which a footman was holding open louise led john to a smaller car which was waiting in the rear  the carlton she told the man as he arranged the rugs and now she added turning to john why have you come to london how long are you going to stay what are you going to do andmost important of allin what spirit have you come  john breathed a little sigh of contentment they were moving slowly down a back street to take their place in the tide of traffic which flooded the main thoroughfares  that sounds so like you he said i came up last night suddenly i have no idea how long i am going to stay i have no idea what i am going to do as for the spirit in which i have comewell i should call it an inquiring one  a very good start louise murmured approvingly but still a little vague  then i will do away with all vagueness i came to see you john confessed bluntly  dear me she exclaimed looking at him with a little smile how downright you are  country methods he reminded her  dont overdo it she begged  the truth he began  has to be handled very carefully she said interrupting him the truth is either beautiful or crude and the people who meddle with such a wonderful thing need a great deal of tact you have come to see me you say very well then i will be just as frank i have been hoping that you would come  you cant imagine how good it is to hear you say that he declared  mind she went on i have been hoping it for more reasons than one you have come to realize i hope that it is your duty to try to see a little more of life than you possibly can leading a patriarchal existence among your flocks and herds  that may be so john assented i have often thought of our conversation i dont know even now whether you were right or wrong i only know that since you went away i have felt something of the unrest with which you threatened me i want to settle the matter one way or the other i want to try for a little time what it is like to live in the crowded places to be near you to see if i may more of you and your way of living  they were silent for several moments  i thought you would come louise said at last and i am glad but even in these first few minutes i want to say something to you if you wish to succeed in your object and really understand the people you meet here and the life they lead dont be like your brothertoo quick to judge do not hug your prejudices too tightly you will come across many problems many situations which will seem strange to you do not make up your mind about anything in a hurry  i will remember that he promised you must remember though that i dont expect ever to become a convert i believe i am a countryman bred and born still there are some things that i want to understand if i can and more than anything elsei want to see you  she faced his direct speech this time with more deliberation  tell me exactly why  if i could tell you that he replied simply i should be able to answer for myself the riddle which has kept me awake at night for weeks and months which has puzzled me more than anything else in life has ever done  you really have thought of me then  didnt you always know that i should  perhaps she admitted anyhow i always felt that we should meet again that you would come to london the problem is she added smiling what to do with you now you are here  i havent come to be a nuisance he assured her i just want a little help from you  she became indiscreet she looked at him with a little smile at the corners of her lips  nothing else she asked almost under her breath  at the end of it all yes he answered simply i want to understand because it is your world i want to feel myself nearer to you i want  she gripped at his arm suddenly she knew well enough that she had deliberately provoked his words but there was a look in her face almost of fear  dont let us be too serious all at once she begged quickly if you have one fault my dear big friend from the country she went on with a swiftly assumed gaiety it is that you are too serious for your years sophy and i between us must try to cure you of that you see we have arrived  he handed her out followed her across the pavement and found himself plunged into what seemed to him to be an absolute vortex of human beings all dressed in very much the same fashion all laughing and talking together very much in the same note all criticising every fresh group of arrivals with very much the same eyes and manner the palmcourt was crowded with little parties seated at the various round tables partaking languidly of the most indolent meal of the day even the broad passageway was full of men and women standing about talking or looking for tables one could scarcely hear the music of the orchestra for the babel of voices  the prince of seyre beckoned to them from the steps he seemed to have been awaiting their arrival therea cold immaculate and considering his lack of height a curiously distinguishedlooking figure  i have a table inside he told them as they approached it is better for conversation the rest of the place is like a beergarden i am not sure if they will dance here today but if they do they will come also into the restaurant  wise man louise declared i too hate the babel outside  they were ushered to a round table directly before the entrance and a couple of attentive waiters stood behind their chairs  we are faced said the prince as he took up the menu with our daily problem what can i order for you  a cup of chocolate louise replied  and miss sophy  tea please  john too preferred tea the prince ordered absinth  a polyglot meal isnt it mr strangewey said louise as the order was executed not in the least what that wonderful old butler of yours would understand by tea we become depraved in our appetites as well as in our sensations we are always seeking for something new sophy put your hat on straight if you want to make a good impression on mr strangewey i am hoping that you two will be great friends  sophy turned toward john with a little grimace  louise is so tactless she said i am sure any idea you might have had of liking me will have gone already has it mr strangewey  on the contrary he replied a little stiffly but without hesitation i was thinking that miss maurel could scarcely have set me a more pleasant task  the girl looked reproachfully across at her friend  you told me he came from the wilds and was quite unsophisticated she exclaimed  the truth john assured them looking with dismay at his little china cup comes very easily to us we are brought up on it in cumberland  positively nourished on it louise agreed my dear sophy what he says is quite true up there a man would tell you that he didnt like the cut of your new blouse or the droop of your hat its a wonderful atmosphere and very austere you ought to meet mr strangeweys brother if you want to know the truth about yourself do go on looking about you mr strangewey and when you have finished tell us just what you are thinking  well just at that moment he replied i was thinking that i ought not to have come here in these clothes  the girl by his side laughed reassuringly  as a matter of fact you couldnt have done anything more successful she declared the one thing up here that every one would like to do if he dared is to be different from his fellows but very few have the necessary courage besides at heart we are all so frightfully hatefully imitative the last great success was the prince when he wore a black stock with a dinnercoat but alas next evening there were forty or fifty of them if you come here to tea tomorrow afternoon i dare say you will find dozens of men wearing gray tweed clothes colored shirts and brown boots i am sure they are most becoming  dont chatter too much child louise said benignly i want to hear some more of mr strangeweys impressions this iswell if not quite a fashionable crowd yet very nearly so what do you think of itthe women for instance  well to me john confessed candidly they all look like dolls or manikins their dresses and their hats overshadow their faces they seem all the time to be wanting to show not themselves but what they have on  they all laughed even the princes lips were parted by the flicker of a smile sophy leaned across the table with a sigh  louise she pleaded you will lend him to me sometimes wont you you wont keep him altogether to yourself there are such a lot of places i want to take him to  i was never greedy louise remarked with an air of selfsatisfaction if you succeed in making a favorable impression upon him i promise you your share  tell us some more of your impressions mr strangewey sophy begged  you want to laugh at me john protested goodhumoredly  on the contrary the prince assured him as he fitted a cigarette into a long amber tube they want to laugh with you you ought to realize your value as a companion in these days you are the only person who can see the truth eyes and tastes blurred with custom perceive so little you are quite right when you say that these women are like manikins that their bodies and faces are lost but one does not notice it until it is pointed out  we will revert louise decided to a more primitive life you and i will inaugurate a missionary enterprise mr strangewey we will judge the world afresh we will reclothe and rehabilitate it  the prince flicked the ash from the end of his cigarette  morally as well as sartorially he asked  there was a moments rather queer silence the music rose above the hubbub of voices and died away again louise rose to her feet  quite an intelligent person really she said moving her head in the direction of the prince his little attacks of cynicism come only with indigestion or after absinth now if you like you shall escort me home mr strangewey i want to show him exactly where i live she explained addressing the others so that he will have no excuse for not coming to pay his respects to me tomorrow afternoon  the prince with a skilful maneuver made his way to her side as they left the restaurant  tomorrow afternoon i think you said he repeated quietly you will be in town then  yes i think so  you have changed your mind then about  m graillot will not listen to my leaving london she interrupted rapidly he declares that it is too near the production of the play my own part may be perfect but he needs me for the sake of the others he puts it like a frenchman of course  they had reached the outer door which was being held open for them by a bowing commissionnaire john and sophy were waiting upon the pavement the prince drew a little back  i understand he murmured                                        ix   the first few minutes that john spent in louises little house were full of acute and vivid interest from the moment of his first meeting with louise upon the moonlit cumberland road during the whole of that next wonderful morning until their parting and afterward through all the long dreaming days and nights that had intervened she had remained a mystery to him it was amazing how little he really knew of her during his journey to town he had sat with folded arms in the corner of his compartment wondering whether in her own environment he would find her easier to understand  he asked himself that question again now as he found himself in her drawingroom in a room entirely redolent of her personality their meeting at the theater had told him nothing she had gratified his sentiment by the pleasure she had shown at his unexpected appearance but his understanding remained unsatisfied  the room that he was so eagerly studying confirmed his cloudy impressions of its owner there was for a womans apartment a curious absence of ornamentation and knickknacks the walls were black and white an idea fantastic in its way yet carried out with extreme lightness in the ceiling and frieze the carpet was white the furniture of which there was very little of the french period before the rococo type graceful in its outline rather heavy in build and covered with oldrose colored chintz there were watercolors upon the wall an etching or two from a parisian studio and some small blackandwhite fantasies puzzling to john who had never even heard the term futurist yet in their way satisfactory  there was a smallsized grand piano which seemed to have found its way almost apologetically into a remote corner a delightful open fireplace with rough white tiles and an oldfashioned brass box in which was piled a little heap of sweetsmelling wood blocks a table drawn up to the side of one of the easy chairs was covered with books and magazines some italian a few english the greater part french and upon a smaller one close at hand stood a white bowl full of pink roses their odor was somehow reminiscent of louise curiously sweet and wholesomean odor which suddenly took him back to the morning when she had come to him from under the canopy of appleblossom  he drew a little sigh of contentment as he rose to his feet and walked to the window the room charmed him it was wonderful that he should find it like this his heart began to beat with pleasure even before the opening of the door announced her presence she came in with sophy who at once seated herself by his side  we have been making plans louise declared for disposing of you for the rest of the day  john smiled happily  youre not sending me away then youre not acting this evening  not until three weeks next monday she replied then if you are good and the production is not postponed you may seat yourself in a box and make all the noise you like after the fall of the curtain these are real holidays for me except for the nuisance of rehearsals you couldnt have come at a better time  sophy glanced at the clock  well she said i must show my respect to that most ancient of adages by taking my departure i feel  you will do nothing of the sort child louise interrupted i want to interest you in the evolution of mr strangewey  i dont feel that i am necessary sophy sighed perhaps i might take him off your hands some evening when you are busy  on this first evening at any rate louise insisted we are going to be a truly harmonious party of three  of course if you really mean it sophy remarked resuming her seat and if i shant make an enemy for life of mr strangewey i should love to come too lets decide what to do with him louise  for a moment the eyes of the two others met louise looked swiftly away and johns heart gave a little leap was it possible that the same thought had been in her mindto spend the evening quietly in that little room had she feared it  we must remember louise said calmly that a heavy responsibility rests upon us it is his first night in london what aspect of it shall we attempt to show him shall we make ourselves resplendent put on our best manners and our most gorgeous gowns and show him the world of starch and form and fashion from the princes box at the opera or shall we transform ourselves into bohemians drink chianti at our beloved antonios eat italian food in soho smoke long cigarettes and take him to the palace dont say a word sophy it is not for us to choose  i am afraid that isnt any choice john declared his face falling i havent any clothes except what you see me in  hooray sophy exclaimed off with your smart gown louise well be splendidly bohemian you shall put on your black frock and a black hat and powder your nose and well all go to guidos first and drink vermuth i cant look the part but i can act it  but tell me louise asked him did you lose your luggage  i brought none he answered  they both looked at himsophy politely curious louise more deeply interested he answered the inquiry in her eyes  youll say perhaps he observed that living that quiet halfburied life up in cumberland one should have no moods i have them sometimes i was in market ketton on my way to the hotel for lunch when i heard the whistle of the london express coming in i just had time to drive to the station leave the horse and dogcart with a man i knew and jump into the train i had no ticket or luggage  they both stared at him  you mean louise demanded that after waiting all these months you started away upon impulse like thatwithout even letting your brother know or bringing any luggage  thats exactly what i did john agreed smiling i had a sovereign in my pocket when i had bought my ticket and by the time i had paid for my dinner on the train and tipped the menwell i hadnt a great deal left to go shopping with i stayed at the st pancras hotel and telephoned to my solicitor before i got up this morning to have him send me some money the joke of it was he went on joining in the girls laughter that mr appleton has been worrying me for months to come up and talk over reinvestments and take control of the money my uncle left me and when i came at last i arrived like a pauper he went out himself and bought my shirt  and a very nice shirt too sophy declared glancing at the pattern do tell us what else happened  well not much more john replied mr appleton stuffed me full of money and made me take a little suite of rooms at what he called a more fashionable hotel he stayed to lunch with me and i have promised to see him on business tomorrow morning  the two girls sat up and wiped their eyes  oh this is a wonderful adventure you have embarked upon louise exclaimed you have come quite in the right spirit now i am going to change my clothes and powder my face and we will go to guidos for a little vermuth dine at antonios and sit side by side at the palace we shall have to take sophy with us but if you show her too much attention i shall send her home it is your first night here mr strangewey so i warn you that sophy is the most irresponsible and capricious of all my friends she has more admirers than she knows what to do with and she disposes of them in the simplest way in the worldby getting new ones  sophy made a grimace  mr strangewey she begged earnestly you wont believe a word she says will you all my life i have been looking for a single and steadfast attachment of course if louise wants to monopolize you i shall fall into the background as i usually do but if you think that i am going to accept hints and let you go out to dinner alone you are very much mistaken tonight at any rate i insist upon coming  louise shook her head  we shall have to put up with her she told john with a little grimace  the door of the room was suddenly opened the parlor maid stood at one side  the prince of seyre madam she announced  louise nodded she was evidently expecting the visit she turned to john  will you come back and call for us heresay at seven oclock mind you are not to bother about your clothes but to come just as you are i cant tell you she added under her breath how much i am looking forward to our evening  sophy sprang to her feet  wont you drop me please mr strangewey she asked then if you will be so kind you can pick me up again on your way here youll have to pass where i live if you are at the milan i must go home and do my little best to compete  louises frown was so slight that even john failed to notice it upon the threshold they encountered the prince who detained john for a moment  i was hoping that i might meet you here mr strangewey he said if you are in town for long it will give me great pleasure if i can be of any service to you you are staying at a hotel  i am staying at the milan john replied  i will do myself the pleasure of calling upon you the prince continued in the meantime if you need any service that a londoner can offer you be sure to let me know you will easily find my house in grosvenor square  it is very kind of you indeed john said gratefully  sophy made a wry face as the prince entered the drawingroom  didnt some old roman once write something about being afraid of greeks who brought gifts she asked as they descended the stairs together  quite right john assented  well be careful she advised him thats all                                       john handed sophy into the taxi and took his place beside her  where shall i put you down he asked  its such a terribly low neighborhood however its quite close to the milanno 10 southampton street  john gave the address to the man and they started off they were blocked in a stream of traffic almost as soon as they reached hyde park corner john leaned forward all the time immensely interested in the stream of passersby  your interest in your fellow creatures she murmured demurely is wonderful but couldnt you concentrate it just a little  he turned quickly around she was smiling at him most alluringly unconsciously he found himself smiling back again a wonderful lightheartedness seemed to have come to him during the last few hours  i suppose i am a perfect idiot he admitted i cannot help it i am used to seeing at the most three or four people together at a time i cant understand these crowds where are they all going fancy every one of them having a home every one of them struggling in some form or another toward happiness  do you know she pronounced severely for a young man of your age you are much too serious please commence your psychological studies tomorrow tonight we are going to have a really frivolous evening you and iand louise if you want to be a great success during the next few hours what you have to do is to imagine that there are only two people in the world beside yourselflouise and i  i think i shall find that very easy he promised smiling  i am quite sure you could be nice if you wanted to she continued how much are you in love with louise  how much am i what  in love with louise she repeated all the men are it is a perfect cult with them and here am i her humble companion and friend absolutely neglected  i dont believe you are neglected at all he replied you are too much too  he turned his head to look at her she was so close to him that their hats collided he was profuse in his apologies  too what she whispered  too attractive he ventured  its nice to hear you say so she sighed well i have to get out here this is where i live up on the fourth floor  how does one get there he inquired  she looked at him quickly there was a little catch in her breath  what do you mean she murmured  didnt you say that i was to come and fetch you and then we could go on to miss maurels together  of course she assented slowly how stupid of me some day ill show you but i know you would lose the way now if you like ill come for youto the milan  if you would really prefer it  i am quite sure that i should she decided there are about seven turns up to my room and i shall have to personally conduct you there three or four times before youll ever be able to find your way i will come as soon as i am ready and then you can give me a cocktail before we set out  she disappeared with a little wave of the hand and john drove on to his destination his rooms at the milan were immensely comfortable and in their way quite homelike john made some small changes to his toilet and was still in his shirtsleeves with hairbrushes in his hands when there came a ring at the bell he answered it at once and found sophy standing outside he gave a little start  i say im awfully sorry  what for you silly person she laughed which way is the sitting room please oh i see now please ring for the waiter and order me a vermuth cocktail and one for yourself of course and i want some cigarettes how clever of you to get rooms looking out upon the embankment i wish they would light the lamps i think the illuminated arcs along the embankment and past the houses of parliament is the most wonderful thing in london dont please look so terrified because you havent got your coat on remember that i have five brothers  i had no idea you would be here so soon he explained or i would have been downstairs waiting for you  dont be stupid she replied please remember that when you are with me at any rate you are in bohemia and not belgravia i dont expect such attentions i rather like coming up to your rooms like this and i always love the milan i really believe that i am your first lady visitor here  you most assuredly are he told her  she turned away from the window and suddenly threw up her arms  oh i love this place she exclaimed i love the sort of evening that we are going to have i feel happy tonight and do you knowi quite like you mr strangewey  she clasped the back of her chair and from behind it looked across at him she was petite and slender with a very dainty figure she wore a black tailormade costume a simple roundblack hat with a long quill set at a provoking angle whitesilk stockings and black patent shoes she was unlike any girl john had ever known her hair was almost golden her eyes a distinct blue yet some trick of the mouth saved her face from any suggestion of insipidity she was looking straight into his eyes and her lips were curled most invitingly  i wish i knew more about certain things he said  she came round from behind the chair and stood a little nearer to him  what things  you know he said i am afraid there is no doubt about it that i am most horribly in love with another woman i have come to london because of her it seems to me that everything in life depends upon how she treats me and yet  and yet what she asked looking up at him a little wistfully  i feel that i want to kiss you he confessed  well if you dont get it done before the waiter brings in those cocktails i shall scream  he took her lightly in his arms for a moment and kissed her then she threw herself down in the easy chair and began to laugh softly  oh why didnt you come before she exclaimed fancy louise never telling me about you  the waiter entered a few minutes later he drew up a small round table between them placed the two wineglasses upon it and departed expeditiously john took one of the glasses over to sophy she accepted it and gave him her fingers to kiss  dear man she sighed i am getting much too fond of you go and sit in your corner drink your cocktail and remember louise i love your rooms and i hope youll ask me to lunch some time  ill have a luncheon party tomorrow if you likethat is if louise will come  she looked up at him quickly  isnt louise going to paris she asked  he set down the glass which he had been in the act of raising to his lips  paris i didnt hear her say anything about it  perhaps it is my mistake then sophy went on hastily i only fancied that i heard her say so  there was a moments silence john had opened his lips to ask a question but quickly closed them again it was a question he suddenly decided which he had better ask of louise herself  if she does go i shall be very sorry he said but i do not wish of course to upset her plans we must talk to her about it tonight i suppose we ought to go now  sophy walked with him to the door and waited while he took his hat and gloves from the hatstand suddenly she laid her hand upon his arm  if louise goes to paris she whispered disconsolately i suppose there will be no luncheonparty  for a single moment he hesitated she was very alluring and the challenge in her eyes was unmistakable  i think he said quietly that if miss maurel goes to paris i shall return to cumberland tomorrow  he opened the door and sophy passed out before him she had dropped her veil                                       they drove down the strand toward knightsbridge for a time there was a significant silence then sophy raised her veil once more and looked toward john  mr strangewey she began you wont mind if i give you just a little word of advice you are such a big strong person but you are rather a child you know in some things  this place does make me feel ignorant he admitted  dont idealize any one here she begged dont concentrate all your hopes upon one object love is wonderful and life is wonderful but there is only one life and there are many loves before one reaches the end people do such silly things sometimes she wound up just because of a little disappointment there are many disappointments to be met with here  he took her hand in his  little girl he said you are very good to me and i think you understand are you going to let me feel that i have found a friend on my first evening in london  if you want me she answered simply i like you and i want you to be happy here and because i want you to be happy i want you to come down from the clouds and remember that you have left your hills behind and that we walk on the pavements here  thank you he whispered and thank you for what you have not said if i am to find sorrow here instead of joy he added a little grimly it is better for me to stumble into the knowledge of it by myself  your hills have taught you just that much of life then sophy murmured                                        x   the prince of seyre handed his hat and stick to the parlor maid and seated himself upon the divan  i should be very sorry he said politely as the maid left the room if my coming has hastened the departure of your visitors  not in the least louise assured him they were leaving when you were announced sophy and i are taking mr strangewey to a bohemian restaurant and a musichall afterward  fortunate mr strangewey the prince sighed but forgive me why not a more dignified form of entertainment for his first evening  the poor man has no clothes louise explained he came to london quite unexpectedly  no clothes the prince repeated it is a long journey to take in such a fashion a matter of urgent business perhaps  louise shrugged her shoulders she had risen to her feet and was busy rearranging some roses in the bowl by her side  mr strangewey has just come into a large fortune as you know she said probably there are many things to be attended to  the prince made no further comment he drew a tortoiseshellandgold cigarettecase from his pocket  it is permitted that one smokes he inquired  it is always permitted to you was the gracious reply  one of my privileges he remarked as he blew out the match in fact almost my only privilege  she glanced up but her eyes fell before his  is that quite fair  i should be grieved to do anything or to say anything to you that was not entirely fair  she crushed one of the roses to pieces suddenly in her hands and shook the petals from her long nervous fingers  today she said this afternoonnowyou have come to me with something in your mind something you wish to say something you are not sure how to say that is you see what henri graillot calls my intuition even you who keep all your feelings under a mask can conceal very little from me  my present feelings the prince declared i do not wish to conceal i would like you to know them but as words are sometimes clumsy i would like if it were possible to let you see into my heart or in these days shall i not say my consciousness i should feel then that without fear of misunderstanding you would know certain things which i would like you to know  she came over and seated herself by his side on the divan she even laid her hand upon his arm  eugène she expostulated we are too old friends to talk always in veiled phrases there is something you have to say to me i am listening  you know what it is he told her  you are displeased because i have changed my mind about that little journey of ours  i am bitterly disappointed he admitted  she looked at him curiously and then down at her rosestained fingers  that does not sound quite like you she said and yet i ought to know that sometimes you do feel things even though you show it so little i am sorry eugène  why are you sorry  because i feel that i cannot take that journey  you mean that you cannot now or that you cannot at any time  i do not know she answered you ask me more than i can tell you sometimes life seems so stable a thing one can make a little chart of and hang up on the wall and put ones finger here and theretoday i will do this tomorrow i will feel thatand the next morning comes and the chart is in the fire i wish i understood myself a little better eugène  selfunderstanding is the rarest of all gifts the prince remarked it is left for those who love us to understand us  and you  i believe that i understand you better far better than you understand yourself he declared that is why i also believe that i am necessary to you i can prevent your making mistakes  then prevent me she begged something has happened and the chart is in the fire today  you have only he said to give your maid her orders to give me this little hand and i will draw out a fresh one which shall direct to the place in life which is best for you it is not too late  she rose from beside him and walked toward the fireplace as if to touch the bell he watched her with steady eyes but expressionless face there was something curious about her walk the spring had gone from her feet her shoulders were a little hunched it was the walk of a woman who goes toward the things she fears  stop he bade her  she turned and faced him quickly almost eagerly there was a look in her face of the prisoner who finds respite  leave the bell alone he directed my own plans are changed i do not wish to leave london this week  her face was suddenly brilliant her eyes shone something electric seemed to quiver through her frame she almost danced back to her place by his side  how foolish she murmured why didnt you say so at once  because he replied they have only been changed during the last few seconds i wanted to discover something which i have discovered  to discover something  that my time has not yet come  she turned away from him she was oppressed with a sense almost of fear a feeling that he was able to read the very thoughts forming in her brain to understand as no one else in the world could understand the things that lived in her heart  i must not keep you he remarked glancing at the clock it was very late for me to call and you will be wanting to join your friends  they are coming here for me she explained there is really no hurry at all we are not changing anything it is to be quite a simple evening sometimes i wish that you cared about things of that sort eugène  he blew through his lips a little cloud of smoke from the cigarette which he had just lit  i do not fancy he replied that i should be much of a success as a fourth in your little expedition  but it is silly of you not to visit bohemia occasionally she declared ignoring the meaning that lay beneath his words it is refreshing to rub shoulders with people who feel and who show freely what they feel to eat their food drink their wine even join in their pleasures  the prince shook his head  i am not of the people he said and i have no sympathy with them i detest the bourgeoisie of every country in the worldmy own more particularly  if you only knew how strangely that sounds she murmured  does it he answered you should read my family history read of the men and women of my race who were butchered at the hands of that drunken lustful mob whom lying historians have glorified i am one of those who do not forget injuries my estates are administered more severely than any others in france no penny of my money has ever been spent in charity i neither forget nor forgive  she laughed a little nervously  what an unsympathetic person you can be eugène  and for that very reason he replied i can be sympathetic because i hate some people i have the power of loving others because it pleases me to deal severely with my enemies it gives me joy to deal generously with my friends that is my conception of life may i wish you a pleasant evening  you are going now she asked a little surprised  he smiled faintly as he raised her fingers to his lips she had made a little movement toward him but he took no advantage of it  i am going now  when shall i see you again she inquired as she came back from ringing the bell  a telephonemessage from your maid a line written with your own fingers he said will bring me to you within a few minutes if i hear nothing i may come uninvited but it will be when the fancy takes me once more louise a pleasant evening  he passed out of the door which the parlor maid was holding open for him crossing to the window louise watched him leave the house and enter his waiting automobile he gave no sign of haste or disappointment he lit another cigarette deliberately upon the pavement and gave his orders to the chauffeur with some care  as the car drove off without his having once glanced up at the window she shivered a little there was a silence which it seemed to her could be more minatory even than accusation                                        xi   the little room was gaudily decorated and redolent with the lingering odors of many dinners yet louise who had dined on the preceding evening at the ritz and been bored whose taste in food and environment was almost hypercritical was perfectly happy she found the cuisine and the chianti excellent  we are outstaying every one else she declared and i dont even mind their awful legacy of tobaccosmoke do you see that the waiter has brought you the bill mr strangewey prepare for a shock it is fortunate that you are a millionaire  john laughed as he paid the bill and ludicrously overtipped the waiter  london must be a paradise to the poor man he exclaimed i have never dined better  dont overdo it sophy begged  i can only judge by results john insisted i have dined and i am happy therefore the dinner must have been good  you are so convincing sophy murmured there is such a finality about your statements that i would not venture to dispute them but remember that your future entertainment is in the hands of two women one of whom is a deserving but struggling young artist without the means of gratifying her expensive tastes there are heaps of places we are going to take you to which even louise pretends she cannot afford it is so fortunate mr strangewey that you are rich  i believe you would be just as nice to me if i werent john ventured  i am so susceptible sophy sighed looking into her empty coffeecup much more susceptible than louise  i wont have mr strangewey spoiled louise put in and dont build too much upon his being content with us as entertainersinchief remember the halfpenny papers in a few days he will be interviewedmillionaire farmer come to london to spend his fortune he will become famous he will buy a green morocco engagementbook and perhaps employ a secretary we shall probably have to ask ourselves to luncheon three weeks ahead  i feel these things coming john declared  my children said louise rising we must remember that we are going to the palace it is quite time we started  they made their way down two flights of narrow stairs into the street the commissionnaire raised his whistle to his lips but louise stopped him  we will walk she suggested this way mr strangewey  they passed down the long narrow street with its dingy foreign cafés and shops scarcely one of which seemed to be english the people who thronged the pavements were of a new race to john swarthy a little furtive a class of foreigner seldom seen except in alien lands men and women in all stages of dishabille were leaning out of the windows or standing on the doorsteps the girls whom they met occasionallyyoung women of all ages walking arm in arm with shawls on their heads in place of hatslaughed openly in johns face  conquests everywhere he goes louise sighed we shall never keep him sophy  we have him for this evening at any rate sophy replied contentedly and he hasnt spent all his fortune yet i am not at all sure that i shall not hint at supper when we come out of the palace  no hint will be necessary john promised i feel the gnawings of hunger already  a millionaires first night in london sophy exclaimed i think i shall write it up for the daily mail  a pity he fell into bad hands so quickly louise laughed here we are stalls please mr millionaire i wouldnt be seen tonight in the seats of the mighty  john risked a reproof however and was fortunate enough to find a disengaged box  the tone of the evening louise grumbled as she settled herself down comfortably is lost this is the most expensive box in the place  you could restore it by eating an orange sophy suggested  or even chocolates john ventured sweeping most of the contents of an attendants tray onto the ledge of the box  after this sophy declared falling upon them supper will be a farce  make you thirsty john reminded her  they devoted their attention to the show louise and sophy at first with only a moderate amount of interest john with the real enthusiasm of one to whom everything is new his laughter was so hearty his appreciation so sincere that his companions found it infectious and began to applaud everything  what children we are louise exclaimed fancy shrieking with laughter at a ventriloquist whom i have seen at every musichall i have been to during the last five or six years  he was wonderfully clever all the same john insisted  the bioscope louise decided firmly i refuse to have anything to do with you have had all the entertainment you are going to have this evening mr countryman  now for supper then he proposed  sophy sighed as she collected the halfempty chocolateboxes  what a pity ive eaten so many theyd have saved me a luncheon tomorrow  greedy child louise laughed sighing for want of an appetite i think well insist upon a taxi this time i dont like overcrowded streets where shall we take him to sophy you know the supper places better than i do  luigis sophy declared firmly the only place in london  they drove toward the strand john looked around him with interest as they entered the restaurant  ive been here before he said as they passed through the doors  explain yourself at once louise insisted  it was eight years ago when i was at oxford he told them we were here on the boatrace night i remember he added reminiscently that some of us were turned out then we went on to  stop louise interrupted sternly i am horrified the one thing i did not suspect you of mr strangewey was a past  well it isnt a very lurid one he assured them that was very nearly the only evening about town i have ever been guilty of  luigi who had come forward to welcome sophy escorted them to one of the best tables  you must be very nice to this gentleman luigi she said he is a very great friend of mine just arrived in london he has come up on purpose to see me and we shall probably decide to make this our favorite restaurant  i shall be vairy happy luigi declared with a bow  i am beginning to regret mr strangewey that i ever introduced you to sophy louise remarked as she sank back into her chair you wont believe that all my friends are as frivolous as this will you  they arent sophy proclaimed confidently i am the one person who succeeds in keeping louise with her feet upon the earth she has never had supper here before dry biscuits hot milk and a volume of poems are her relaxation after the theater she takes herself too seriously  i wonder if i do louise murmured as she helped herself to caviar  she was suddenly pensive her eyes seemed to be looking out of the restaurant sophy was exchanging amenities with a little party of friends at the next table  one must sometimes be serious john remarked or life would have no poise at all  i have a friend who scolds me she confided sometimes he almost loses patience with me he declares that my attitude toward life is too analytical when happiness comes my way i shrink back i keep my emotions in the background while my brain works dissecting wondering speculating perhaps what he says is true i believe that if one gets into the habit of analyzing too much one loses all elasticity of emotion the capacity to recognize and embrace the great things when they come  i think you have been right john declared earnestly if the great things come as they should come they are overwhelming they will carry you off your feet you will forget to speculate and to analyze therefore i think you have been wise and right to wait you have run no risk of having to put up with the lesser things  she leaned toward him across the roseshaded table for those few seconds they seemed to have been brought into a wonderfully intimate communion of thought a wave of her hair almost touched his forehead his hand boldly rested upon her fingers  you talk she whispered as if we were back upon your hilltops once more  he turned his head toward the little orchestra which was playing a low and tremulous waltz tune  i want to believe he said that you can listen to the music here and yet live upon the hilltops  you believe that it is possible  i do indeed he assured her although my heart was almost sick with loneliness i do not think that i should be here if i did not believe it i have not come for anything else for any lesser things but to find  for once his courage failed him for once too he failed to understand her expression she had drawn back a little her lips were quivering sophy broke suddenly in upon that moment of suspended speech  i knew how it would be she exclaimed i leave you both alone for less than a minute and there you sit as grave as two owls i ask you now is this the place to wander off into the clouds when two people sit looking at each other as you were doing a minute ago here in luigis at midnight with champagne in their glasses and a supper ordered regardless of expense on the table before them they are either without the least sense of the fitness of things or else  or else what louise asked  or else they are head over heels in love with each other sophy concluded  perhaps the child is right louise assented tolerantly taking a peach from the basket by her side evidently it is our duty to abandon ourselves to the frivolity of the moment what shall we do to bring ourselves into accord with it everybody seems to be behaving most disgracefully do you think it would contribute to the gaiety of the evening if i were to join in the chorus of you made me love you and mr strangewey were to imitate the young gentleman at the next table and throw a roll say at that portly old gentleman with the highly polished shirtfront  there is no need to go to extremes sophy protested besides we should get into trouble the portly old gentleman happens to be one of the directors  then we will just talk nonsense louise suggested  i am not very good at it john sighed and there is so much i want to say that isnt nonsense  you ought to be thankful all your life that you have met me and that i am disposed to take an interest in you sophy remarked as she moved her chair a little nearer to johns i am quite sure that in a very short time you would have becomewell almost a prig providence has selected me to work out your salvation  providence has been very kind then john told her  i hope you mean it she returned you ought to if you only understood the importance of lightheartedness  the lights were lowered a few minutes later and john paid the bill  weve enjoyed our supper louise whispered as they passed down the room the whole evening has been delightful  may i drive you home alone he asked bluntly  i am afraid we cant desert sophy she replied avoiding his eyes she nearly always goes home with me you see although she seems quite a frivolous little person she is really very useful to mekeeps my accounts and all that sort of thing  and does her best sophy joined in to protect you against your ruinously extravagant habits  louise laughed they were standing in the little hall and the commissionnaire was blowing his whistle for a taxi  i wont be scolded tonight she declared come you shall both of you drive home with me and then mr strangewey can drop you at your rooms on his way back  sophy made a little grimace and glanced up at john anxiously he was looking very big and very grim  shall you mind that she asked  a slight plaintiveness in her tone dispelled his first disappointment after all it was louises decision  i will try to bear it cheerfully he promised smiling as he handed them into the cab                                       xii   as they drove from luigis to knightsbridge louise leaned back in her corner although her eyes were only half closed there was an air of aloofness about her an obvious lack of desire for conversation which the others found themselves instinctively respecting even sophys lighthearted chatter seemed to have deserted her somewhat to johns relief  he sat back in his place his eyes fixed upon louise he was so anxious to understand her in all her moods and vagaries he was forced to admit to himself that she had deliberately chosen not to take any portion of that drive home alone with him and yet as he looked back through the evening he told himself that he was satisfied he declined to feel even a shadow of discouragement  after a time he withdrew his eyes from her face and looked out upon the human panorama through which they were passing  they were in the very vortex of londons midnight traffic the night was warm for the time of year and about leicester square and beyond the pavements were crowded with pedestrians the women lightly and gaily clad flitting notwithstanding some sinister note about their movements like butterflies or brighthued moths along the pavements and across the streets the procession of taxicabs and automobiles each with its human freight of men and women in evening dress on their way home after an evenings pleasure seemed endless  presently sophy began to talk and louise too roused herself  i am only just beginning to realize the latter said that you are actually in london  when i leave you he replied i too shall find it hard to believe that we have actually met again and talked there seems to be so much that i have to say he added looking at her closely and i have said nothing  there is plenty of time she told him and once more the signs of that slight nervousness were apparent in her manner there are weeks and months ahead of us  when shall i see you again he asked  whenever you like there are no rehearsals for a day or two ring me up on the telephoneyou will find my number in the bookor come and lunch with me tomorrow if you like  thank you he answered that is just what i should like at what time  half past one i will not ask either of you to come in now you can come down tomorrow morning and get the books sophy i think i am tiredtired she added with a curious little note of selfpity in her tone i am very glad to have seen you again mr strangewey she said lifting her eyes to his good night  he helped her out rang the bell and watched her vanish through the swiftly opened door then he stepped back into the taxicab sophy retreated into the corner to make room for him  you are going to take me home are you not she asked  of course he replied his eyes still fixed with a shade of regret upon the closed door of louises little house no 10 southampton street he told the driver  they turned round and spun once more into the network of moving vehicles and streaming pedestrians john was silent and his companion for a little while humored him soon however she touched him on the arm  this is still your first night in london she reminded him and there is tomorrow you are going to lunch with her tomorrow wont you talk to me please  he shut the door upon a crowd of disturbing thoughts and fantastic imaginings and smiled back at her her fingers remained upon his arm a queer gravity had come into her dainty little face  are you really in love with louise she inquired with something of his own directness  he answered her with perfect seriousness  i believe so he admitted but i should not like to say that i am absolutely certain i have come here to find out  sophy suddenly rocked with laughter  you are the dearest queerest madman i have ever met she exclaimed holding tightly to his arm you sit there with a face as long as a fiddle wondering whether you are in love with a girl or not well i am not going to ask you anything more tell me are you tired  not a bit he declared i never had such a ripping evening in my life  she held his arm a little tighter she was the old sophy again full of life and gaiety  lets go to the aldwych she suggested and see the dancing we can just have something to drink we neednt have any more supper  rather he assented readily but where is it and what is it  just a supper club she told him tell the man no 19 kean street what fun i havent been there for weeks  what about my clothes he asked  youll be all right she assured him youre quite a nicelooking person and the manager is a friend of mine  the cab stopped a few minutes later outside what seemed to be a private house except for the presence of a commissionnaire upon the pavement the door was opened at once and john was relieved of his hat and stick by a cloakroom attendant sophy wrote his name in a book and they were ushered by the manager who had come forward to greet them into a long room brilliantly lit and filled except in the center with suppertables  they selected one near the wall and close to the open space in which at the present moment a man and a woman were dancing the floor was of hardwood and there was a little raised platform for the orchestra john looked around him wonderingly the popping of champagne corks was almost incessant a slightly voluptuous atmosphere of cigarettesmoke mingled with the perfumes shaken from the clothes and hair of the women several more of whom were now dancing hung about the place a girl in fancy dress was passing a great basket of flowers from table to table  sophy sat with her head resting upon her hands and her face very close to her companions keeping time with her feet to the music  isnt this rather nice she whispered do you like being here with me mr john strangewey  of course i do he answered heartily is this a restaurant  she shook her head  no its a club we can sit here all night if you like  can i join he asked  she laughed as she bent for a form and made him fill it in  tell me he begged as he looked around him who are these girls they look so pretty and well dressed and yet so amazingly young to be out at this time of night  mostly actresses she replied and musicalcomedy girls i was in musical comedy myself before louise rescued me  did you like it  i liked it all right she admitted but i left it because i wasnt doing any good i can dance pretty well but i have no voice so there didnt seem to be any chance of my getting out of the chorus and one cant even pretend to live on the salary they pay you unless one has a part  but these girls who are here tonight  they are with their friends of course she told him i suppose if it hadnt been for louise i should have been here toowith a friend  i should like to see you dance he remarked in a hurry to change the conversation  ill dance to you some day in your rooms if you like she promised or would you like me to dance here there is a man opposite who wants me to would you rather i didnt i want to do just which would please you most  dance by all means he insisted i should like to watch you  she nodded and a minute or two later she had joined the small crowd in the center of the room clasped in the arms of a very immaculate young man who had risen and bowed to her from a table opposite john leaned back in his place and watched her admiringly her feet scarcely touched the ground she never once glanced at or spoke to her partner but every time she passed the corner where john was sitting she looked at him and smiled  he for his part watched her no longer with pleasant interest but with almost fascinated eyes the spirit of the place was creeping into his blood his long years of seclusion seemed like a spell of time lying curiously far away a crude period mislived in an atmosphere which notwithstanding its austere sweetness took no account of the human cry he refilled his glass with champagne and deliberately drank its contents it was splendid to feel so young and strong to feel the wine in his veins his pulse and his heart moving to this new measure  his eyes grew brighter and he smiled back at sophy she suddenly released her hold upon her partner and stretched out her arms to him her body swayed backward a little she waved her hands with a gesture infinitely graceful subtly alluring her lips were parted with a smile almost of triumph as she once more rested her hand upon her partners shoulder  who is your escort this evening the latter asked her speaking almost for the first time  you would not know him she replied he is a mr john strangewey and he comes from cumberland  just happens that i do know him the young man remarked thought id seen his face somewhere used to be up at the varsity with him we once played rackets together hasnt he come into a pile just lately  an uncle in australia left him a fortune  ill speak to him presently the young man decided always make a point of being civil to anybody with lots of oof  i expect hell be glad to meet you again sophy remarked he doesnt know a soul in town  the dance was finished they returned together to where john was sitting and the young man held out a weary hand  amerton you know of magdalen he said youre strangewey arent you  lord amerton of course john exclaimed i thought your face was familiar why we played in the rackets doubles together  and won em thanks to you amerton replied are you up for long  i am not quite sure john told him i only arrived last night  look me up some time if youve nothing better to do the young man suggested where are you hanging out  the milan  i am at the albany solong must get back to my little lady  he bowed to sophy and departed she sank a little breathlessly into her chair and laid her hand on johns arm her cheeks were flushed her bosom was rising and falling quickly  i am out of breath she said her head thrown back perilously near to johns shoulder lord amerton dances so well give me some champagne  and youyou dance divinely he told her as he filled her glass  if we were alone she whispered i should want you to kiss me  the stem of the wineglass in johns fingers snapped suddenly and the wine trickled down to the floor a passing waiter hurried up with a napkin and a fresh glass was brought the affair was scarcely noticed but john remained disturbed and a little pale  have you cut your hand sophy asked anxiously  not at all he assured her how hot it is here do you mind if we go  go she exclaimed disconsolately i thought you were enjoying yourself so much  so i am he answered but i dont quite understand  he paused  understand what she demanded  myself if you must know  she set down the glass which she had been in the act of raising to her lips  how queer you are she murmured listen you havent got a wife or anything up in cumberland have you  you know i havent he answered  youre not engaged to be married you have no ties you came up here perfectly free you havent even said anything yetto louise  of course not  well then she began  her words were so softly spoken that they seemed to melt away she leaned forward to look in his face  sophy he begged with sudden and almost passionate earnestness be kind to me please i am just a simple stupid countryman who feels as if he had lost his way i have lived a solitary sort of lifean unnatural one you would sayand ive been brought up with some oldfashioned ideas i know they are oldfashioned but i cant throw them overboard all at once i have kept away from this sort of thing i didnt think it would ever attract mei suppose because i didnt believe it could be made so attractive i have suddenly found outthat it does  what are you going to do she whispered  there is only one thing for me to do he answered until i know what i have come to london to learn i shall fight against it  you mean about louise  i mean about louise he said gravely  sophy came still closer to him her voice was as soft as the lightest finest note of music trembling a little with that one thread of passion she seemed so dainty so quiet and sweet that for a moment he found himself able to imagine that it was all a dream that hers was just one of those fairy disquieting voices that floated about on the summer breeze and rippled along the valleys and hillsides of his cumberland home then swift as the fancy itself came the warm touch of her hand upon his the lure of her voice once more with its trembling cadence  why are you so foolish she murmured louise is very wonderful in her place but she is not what you want in life has it never occurred to you that you may be too late  what do you mean he demanded  i believe what the world believes what some day i think she will admit to herselfthat she cares for the prince of seyre  has she ever told you so  louise never speaks of these things to any living soul i am only telling you what i think i am trying to save you paintrying for my own sake as well as yours  he paid his bill and stooped to help her with her cloak her heart sank her lips quivered a little it seemed to her that he had passed to a great distance  very soon john said i shall ask louise to tell me the truth i think that i shall ask her if i can tomorrow                                       xiii   johns first caller at the milan was in a way a surprise to him he was sitting smoking an afterbreakfast pipe on the following morning and gazing at the telephone directory when his bell rang he opened the door to find the prince of seyre standing outside  i pay you a very early visit i fear the latter began  not at all john replied taking the pipe from his mouth and throwing open the door it is very good of you to come and see me  the prince followed john into the little sitting room he was dressed as usual with scrupulous care his white linen gaiters were immaculate his trousers were perfectly creased the hang of his coat had engaged the care of an artist his tie was of a deep shade of violet fastened with a wonderful pearl and his fingers were perhaps a trifle overmanicured he wore a bunch of parma violets in his buttonhole and he carried with him a very faint but unusual perfume which seemed to john like the odor of delicate green tea it was just these details and the slowness of his speech which alone accentuated his foreign origin  it occurred to me he said as he seated himself in an easy chair that if you are really intending to make this experiment in town life of which miss maurel spoke i might be of some assistance to you there are certain matters quite unimportant in themselves concerning which a little advice in the beginning may save you trouble  very good of you i am sure john repeated to tell you the truth i was just looking through the telephone directory to see if i could come across the name of a tailor i used to have some things from  if it pleases you to place yourself in my hands the prince suggested i will introduce you to my own tradespeople i have made the selection with some care  that will suit me admirably john declared if you will just give me the addressesi couldnt think of taking up your time  i have fortunately an idle morning the prince said and it is entirely at your disposal at half past one i believe we are both lunching with miss maurel  john was conscious of a momentary sense of annoyance his têteàtête with louise seemed farther off than ever at the princes suggestion however he fetched his hat and gloves and entered the formers automobile which was waiting below  miss maurel the prince remarked as they glided off westward is i believe inviting a few friends to meet you if you would feel more comfortable in town clothes i think the tailor to whom i am taking you will be able to arrange that he makes special preparations for such emergencies  i will do what you think best john agreed  they spent the morning in the neighborhood of bond street and john laid the foundations of a wardrobe more extensive than any he had ever dreamed of possessing at half past one they were shown into louises little dressing room there were three or four men already present standing around their hostess and sipping some faint yellow cordial from long venetian glasses  louise came forward to meet them and made a little grimace as she remarked the change in johns appearance  honestly i dont know you and i dont believe i like you at all she exclaimed how dare you transform yourself into a tailors dummy in this fashion  it was entirely out of respect to you john said  in fact the prince added we considered that we had achieved rather a success  i suppose i must look upon your effort as a compliment louise sighed but it seems queer to lose even so much of you shall you take up our manners and our habits mr strangewey as easily as you wear our clothes  that i cannot promise he replied  the brain should adapt itself at least as readily as the body the prince remarked  m graillot who was one of the three men present turned around  who is talking platitudes he demanded i write plays and that is my monopoly ah it is the prince i see and our young friend who interrupted us at rehearsal yesterday  and whom i am anxious to have you meet again louise intervened you remember his name perhapsmr john strangewey  graillot held out his left hand to the prince and his right to john  mr strangewey he said i congratulate you any person who has the good fortune to interest miss maurel is to be congratulated yet must i look at you and feel myself puzzled you are not an artistno you do not paint or write  john shook his head  mr strangeweys claim to distinction is that he is just an ordinary man louise observed such a relief you know after all you clever people and that reminds me miles she added turning to the actor i asked you here too especially to meet mr strangewey again mr faraday is one of the most dangerous guides in london a young man could have he knows everybody and everything unknowable and yet worth knowing i present him to you as a hero he is going to make love to me three hours a night for very many nights we hope  john shook hands with everybody and sipped the contents of the glass which had been handed to him then a butler opened the door and announced luncheon louise offered her hand to the prince who stepped back  it shall be the privilege of the stranger within our gates he decided  louise turned to john with a little smile  let me show you then the way to my dining room i ought to apologize for not asking some women to meet you i tried two on the telephone but they were engaged  i will restore the balance the prince promised turning from the contemplation of one of the prints hanging in the hall i am giving a supper party tonight for mr strangewey and i will promise him a preponderance of your charming sex  am i invited louise inquired  the prince shook his head  alas no  they passed into a small dining room and here again john noticed that an absolute simplicity was paramount the carpet was of some dark almost indistinguishable color the walls were white hung with three or four french etchings in black reed frames at one end a curved window looked out upon a vista of green trees and shrubs and the recess was completely filled in with what appeared to be almost a grotto of flowers the round table covered with an exquisitely fine cloth was very simply laid there was a little glass of the finest quality and a very little silver for flowers there was only one bowl a brilliant patch of some scarlet exotic in the center  a supper party to which i am not invited said louise as she took her place at the table and motioned john to a seat by her side fills me with curiosity who are to be your guests prince  calavera and her sprites the prince announced  louise paused for a moment in the act of helping herself to hors doeuvres she glanced toward the prince he was busy studying the menu through his eyeglass  by her sprites you mean  the young ladies of her wonderful ballet the prince replied i am also dipping into musical comedy for a few of my guests calavera however is to be the pièce de résistance  the prince dropped his eyeglass and glanced toward his hostess for a moment their eyes met louises lips were faintly curled it was almost as if a challenge had passed between them  mr strangewey she said turning to john let me warn you you are to meet tonight a woman for whom kings are reported to sigh in vain at whose feet the jeunesse dorée of the world pours out its riches is it kind of the prince i wonder to try and seal your fate so soon  john laughed easily he met the challenge in her eyes and answered it  if you are talking of the great calavera he said she will be far too wonderful a lady to take any notice of a yokel like myself and besides  besides the prince intervened  i have only seen her photographs and read of her john remarked but i dont think she would attract me very much  they all laughed graillot leaned across the table  my young friend he exclaimed pray to your presiding genius the presiding genius that won for you the friendship of our hostess that calavera never hears that speech or within a week you will be at her chariotwheels i have seen many women and loved many but there are none like calavera in her way she is the greatest artist that ever breathed as for her beauty wait till you see her she has a body which makes me close my eyes and dream of greece eyes such as one seldom sees save in a few parts of southern spain and as for her smilewell if i go on i shall begin to tell stories of her victims and neglect my lunch  the conversation drifted away to reminiscences of other great dancers louise under its cover devoted her attention to her guest  first of all she asked tell me how you like my little friend  i think she is charming john answered without hesitation we went to a supper club last night and stayed there till about half past three  a supper club  john nodded  i have forgotten the name of the place but they made me a member it was great fun we had some more champagne and sophy danced i found a young man there whom i used to know  really said louise i am not sure that i approve of this a supper club with sophy until half past three in the morning  he looked at her quickly  you dont mind  my dear man why should i mind she returned what concern is it of mine if you and sophy care to amuse each other it is exactly what i hoped for  thats all right then john declared with a sigh of relief do you know he went on lowering his voice that i am just a little disappointed about today  disappointed after i have taken the trouble to give a luncheon party for you  i should have thought it a greater compliment and liked it better if you had asked me to lunch with you alone he said  she shook her head  it would have been a wasted opportunity you have come up to london with a purpose you have an experiment to make an experiment in living all these men can help you  the greater part of my experiment he pointed out needs the help of only one person and that person is you  she moved a little uneasily in her chair it might have been his fancy but he imagined that she glanced under her eyelids toward the prince of seyre the prince however had turned almost ostentatiously away from her he was leaning across the table talking to faraday  you have not lost your gift of plain speech she observed  i hope i never shall he declared it seems to me to be the simplest and the best plan after all to say what you feel and to ask for what you want  so delightful in cumberland and utopia she sighed so impracticable here  then since we cant find utopia come back to cumberland he suggested  a reminiscent smile played for a moment about her lips  i wonder she murmured whether i shall ever again see that dear wonderful old house of yours and the mist on the hills and the stars shining here and there through it and the moon coming up in the distance  all these things you will see again he assured her confidently it is because i want you to see them again that i am here  just now at this minute i feel a longing for them she whispered looking across the table out of the window to the softly waving trees  at the close of the luncheon a servant handed around coffee and liqueurs the prince turned to louise  you must not keep our young friend too late he said he has appointments with his tailor and other myrmidons who have undertaken to adorn his person  alas replied louise rising i too have to go early to my dressmakers do the honors for me prince will youand i will make my adieus now  they all rose she nodded to graillot and faraday the prince moved to stand by the door for a moment she and john were detached from the others  i want to see you alone he said under his breath when can i  she hesitated  i am so busy she murmured next week there are rehearsals nearly every minute of the day  tomorrow john said insistently you have no rehearsals then i must see you i must talk to you without this crowd  it was his moment her halfformed resolutions fell away before the compelling ring in his voice and the earnest pleading in his eyes  i will be in she promised tomorrow at six oclock                                       xiv   after the departure of her guests louise seemed to forget the pressing appointment with her dressmaker she stood before the window of her drawingroom looking down into the street she saw faraday hail a taxicab and drive off by himself she watched the prince courteously motion john to precede him into his waiting automobile she saw the two men seat themselves side by side and the footman close the door and take his place beside the chauffeur she watched until the car took its place in the stream of traffic and disappeared the sense of uneasiness which had brought her to the window was unaccountable but it seemed in some way deepened by their departure together then a voice from just behind suddenly startled her  lest your reverie dear lady should end in spoken words not meant for my ears i who often give myself up to reveries hasten to acquaint you with the fact of my presence  she turned quickly around it was graillot who had returned noiselessly into the room  you she exclaimed why i thought you were the first to leave  i returned graillot explained an impulse brought me back a thought came into my mind i wanted to share it with you as a proof of the sentiment which i feel exists between us it is my firm belief that the same thought in a different guise was traveling through your mind as you watched the departure of your guests  she motioned him to a place upon the couch close to where she had already seated herself  come she invited prove to me that you are a thoughtreader  he sank back in his corner his hands with their short stubby fingers were clasped in front of him his eyes wide open and alert seemed fixed upon her with the ingenuous inquisitiveness of a child  to begin then i find our friend the prince of seyre a most interesting i might almost say a most fascinating study  louise did not reply after a moments pause he continued  let me tell you something which may or may not be unknown to you a matter of eighty years ago there was first kindled in the country places of france that fire which ultimately blazed over the whole land devastating murderous anarchic yet purifying the family seat of the house of seyre was near orléans in that region were many oppressors of the poor who when they heard the mutterings of the storm shivered for their safety upon not one of them did that furious mob of men and women pause to waste a single moment of their time without even a spoken word save one simultaneous unanimous yell they grouped together from all quartersfrom every hamlet from every homestead men and women and even childrenand moved in one solid body upon the château de seyre the old prince would have been burned alive but for a servant who threw him a pistol with which he blew out his brains spitting at the mob one of the sons was caught and torn almost to pieces only the father of our friend the present prince of seyre escaped  why do you tell me all this louise asked shivering it is such a chapter of horrors  it illustrates a point graillot replied among the whole aristocracy of france there was no family so loathed and detested as the seigneurs of seyre those at the château and others who were arrested in paris met their death with singular contempt and calm eugène of seyre whose character in my small way i have studied is of the same breed  louise took up a fan which lay on the table by her side and waved it carelessly in front of her face  one does so love she murmured to hear ones friends discussed in this friendly spirit  it is because eugène of seyre is a friend of yours that i am talking to you in this fashion graillot continued you have also another friendthis young man from cumberland  well  in him graillot went on one perceives all the primitive qualities which go to the making of splendid manhood physically he is almost perfect for which alone we owe him a debt of gratitude he has if i judge him rightly all the qualities possessed by men who have been brought up free from the taint of cities from the smear of our spurious overcivilization he is chivalrous and unsuspicious he is also unfortunately for him the enemy of the prince  louise laid down her fan she no longer tried to conceal her agitation  why are you so melodramatic she demanded they have scarcely spoken this is i think their third meeting  when two friends graillot declared desire the same woman then all of friendship that there may have been between them is buried when two others who are so far from being friends that they possess opposite qualities opposite characters opposite characteristics also desire the same woman  dont louise interrupted with a sudden little scream dont you are talking wildly you must not say such things  graillot leaned forward he shook his head very slowly his heavy hand rested upon her shoulder  ah no dear lady he insisted i am not talking wildly i am graillot who for thirty years have written dramas on one subject and one subject onlymen and women it has been given to me to study many varying types of the human race to watch the outcome of many strange situations i have watched the prince draw you nearer and nearer to him what there is or may be between you i do not know it is not for me to know but if not now some day eugène of seyre means you to be his and he is not a person to be lightly resisted now from the skies there looms up this sudden obstacle  you do not realize louise protested almost eagerly how slight is my acquaintance with mr strangewey i once spent the night and a few hours of the next morning at his house in cumberland and that is all i have ever seen of him how can his presence here be of any serious import to eugène  as to that graillot replied i say nothing if what i have suggested does not exist then for the first time in my life i have made a mistake but i do not think i have you may not realize it but there is before you one of those struggles that make or mar the life of women of every age as for the men i will only say this and it is because of it that i have spoken at alli am a lover of fair play and the struggle is not even the younger man may hold every card in the pack but eugène of seyre has learned how to win tricks without aces i stayed behind to say this to you louise you know the young man and i do not it is you who must warn him  warn him louise repeated with upraised eyebrows dear master arent we just a littledo youmelodramatic the age of duels is past also the age of hired bravos and assassins  agreed graillot interrupted but the weapons of today are more dangerous it is the souls of their enemies that men attack if i were a friend of that young mans i would say to him beware not of the enmity of eugène of seyre but of his friendship and now dear lady i have finished i lingered behind because the world holds no more sincere admirer of yourself and your genius than i dont ring may i not let myself out  stop louise begged  graillot resumed his seat he watched with an almost painful curiosity the changes in louises face which was convulsed by a storm of passionate apprehension yet behind it all he could see the truth there was something softer in her face than he had ever perceived before a tenderer light than he had ever seen in her eyes he sighed and looked down at the carpet  louise rose presently and walked abruptly to the window then she came back and reseated herself by his side  you are the one friend i have in life who understands dear master she said do i weary you if i speak  he looked steadfastly into her eyes his plain bearded face was heavybrowed lined tired a little with the coming of age  louise he declared it is only because i dare not lift my thoughts and eyes any higher that i count myself the greatest friend you ever could have in life  she caught at his hand her head drooped a little  dont overpower me she faltered i cantno i cant  he watched in silence the twitching of her lips the filling of her eyes a momentary remorse struck him why should he afflict her at this moment with his own secret he closed his eyes and deliberately shut out the vision which had lured his tongue into the byways of unwonted sentiment he spoke firmly and without emotion  louise he begged let me be your confidant no man knows more of the game of life as it is played out between men and women there is no one in whom you can place a greater trust  her fingers clutched his her nails dug into his palm but he did not flinch  i do not know she murmured her voice trembling with agitation that is the truth of it all i do not know where to go for guidance or inspiration life has suddenly become mysterious men seem always so strong and sure it is only we poor women who lose our bearings  graillot patted her hands tenderly then he rose to his feet  you are not going she asked him  dear louise he said i am going because the time when i can help is not yet listen more harm has been done in this world by advice than in any other way i have no advice to give you you have one sure and certain guide and that is your own heart your own instincts your own sweet consciousness of what is best i leave you to that if trouble comes i am always ready                                        xv   during the remainder of that afternoon and evening john was oppressed by a vague sense of the splendor of his surroundings and his companions mysterious capacity for achieving impossibilities their visits to the tailors the shirtmakers the hosiers and the bootmakers almost resembled a royal progress all difficulties were waved aside that night he dined clothed like other men from head to foot in the lofty dining room of one of the most exclusive clubs in london the prince proved an agreeable if somewhat reticent companion he introduced john to many wellknown people always with that little note of personal interest in his few words of presentation which gave a certain significance to the ceremony  from the club where the question of johns proposed membership the prince acting as his sponsor was favorably discussed with several members of the committee they drove to covent garden and for the first time in his life john entered the famous operahouse the prince preceded by an attendant led the way to a box upon the second tier a woman turned her head as they entered and stretched out her hand which the prince raised to his lips  you see i have taken you at your word eugène she remarked so many evenings i have looked longingly from my stall at your empty box tonight i summoned up all my courage and here i am  you give me a double pleasure dear lady the prince declared not only is it a joy to be your host but you give me also the opportunity of presenting to you my friend john strangewey strangewey this is my very distant relative and very dear friend lady hilda mulloch  lady hilda smiled graciously at john she was apparently of a little less than middle age with dark bands of chestnut hair surmounted by a tiara her face was the face of a clever and still beautiful woman her figure slender and dignified her voice low and delightful  are you paying your nightly homage to calavera mr strangewey or are you only an occasional visitor she asked  this is my first visit of any sort to covent garden john told her  she looked at him with as much surprise as good breeding permitted john who had not as yet sat down seemed almost preternaturally tall in that small box with its low ceiling he was looking around the house with the enthusiasm of a boy lady hilda glanced away from him toward the prince and smiled then she looked back at john there was something like admiration in her face  do you live abroad she asked  john shook his head  i live in cumberland he said many people here seem to think that that is the same thing my brother and i have a farm there  but you visit london occasionally surely  i have not been in london john told her since i passed through it on my way home from oxford eight years ago  but why not she persisted  john laughed a little  well really he admitted when i come to think of it seriously i scarcely know i have lived alone with an elder brother who hates london and would be very unhappy if i got into the way of coming up regularly i fancy that i have rather grown into his way of thinking i am quite satisfiedor rather i have been quite satisfiedto live down there all the year round  i have never heard anything so extraordinary in my life the woman declared frankly is it the prince who has induced you to break out of your seclusion  our young friend the prince explained finds himself suddenly in altered circumstances he has been left a large fortune and has come to spend it incidentally i hope he has come to see something more of your sex than is possible among his mountain wilds he has come in short to look a little way into life  lady hilda leaned back in her chair  how romantic  the prince amuses himself john assured her i dont suppose i shall stay very long in london i want just to try it for a time  she looked at him almost wistfully she was a woman with brains a woman notorious for the freedom of her life for her intellectual gifts for her almost brutal disregard of the conventions of her class the psychological interest of john strangeweys situation appealed to her powerfully besides she had a weakness for handsome men  of course it all sounds like a fairy tale she declared tell me exactly please how long you have been in london  about fortyeight hours he answered  and what did you do last night  i dined with two friends we went to the palace and one of them took me to a supper club  she made a little grimace  you began in somewhat obvious fashion she remarked  i can vouch for the friends the prince observed smiling  at any rate said lady hilda i am glad to think that i shall be able to watch you when you see calavera dance for the first time  the curtain rang up upon one of the most gorgeous and sensuous of the russian ballets john who by their joint insistence was occupying the front chair in the box leaned forward in his place his eyes steadfastly fixed upon the stage both the prince and lady hilda in the background although they occasionally glanced at the performance devoted most of their attention to watching him  as the story progressed and the music grew in passion and voluptuousness they distinctly saw his almost militant protest they saw the knitting of his firm mouth and the slight contraction of his eyebrows the prince and his friend exchanged glances she drew her chair a little farther back and he followed her example  where did you find anything so wonderful as this she murmured  lost among the hills in cumberland the prince replied i have an estate up therein fact he and i are joint lords of the manor of the village in which he has lived  and you she whispered glancing at john to be sure that she was not overheard where do you come in an educator of the young i dont seem to see you in that rôle  a very rare and by no means pleasant smile twisted the corners of his lips for a moment  it is a long story  can i be brought in she asked  he nodded  it rests with you it would suit my plans  she toyed with her fan for a moment looked restlessly at the stage and back again at john then she rose from her place and stood before the lookingglass from the greater obscurity of the box she motioned to the prince  john remained entirely heedless of their movements his eyes were still riveted upon the stage fascinated with the wonderful coloring the realization of a new art  you and i lady hilda whispered do not need to play about with the truth eugène what are you doing this for  the idlest whim the prince assured her quietly look at him think for a moment of his positionabsolutely without experience entirely ignorant about women with a fortune one only dreams of and probably the handsomest animal in london what is going to become of him  i think i understand a little she confessed  i think you do the prince assented he has views this young man it is my humor to see them dissipated the modern sir galahad always irritated me a little  she shrugged her shoulders  theyll never give him a chance these women she said much better hand him over to me  the prince smiled enigmatically and lady hilda returned to her seat john was still leaning forward with his eyes fixed upon calavera who was dancing alone now the ballet was drawing toward the end the music had reached its climax of wild and passionate sensuousness dominated and inspired by the woman whose every movement and every glance seemed part of some occult dimly understood language  when the curtain rang down john like many others was confused nevertheless after that first breathless pause he stood up and joined in the tumultuous applause  well the prince asked  john shook his head i dont know he answered  neither does any one else lady hilda said dont try to analyze your impressions for our benefit mr strangewey i am exactly in your position and i have been here a dozen times even to us hardened men and women of the world this russian music came as a surprise there were parts of it you did not like though werent there  there were parts of it i hated john agreed there were passages that seemed to aim at discord in every sense of the word  she nodded sympathetically they were on their way down the broad staircase  i wonder she murmured whether i am going to be asked out to supper  alas not tonight dear lady the prince regretted i am having a few friends at seyre house  she shot a glance at him and shrugged her shoulders she was evidently displeased  how much too bad she exclaimed i am not at all sure that it is right of you to invite mr strangewey to one of your orgies a respectable little supper at the carlton and a cigarette in my library afterward would have been a great deal better for both of youcertainly for mr strangewey i think i shall run away with him as it is  the prince shrugged his shoulders  it is unfortunate he sighed but we are both engaged if you will give us the opportunity some other evening  i am not at all sure that i shall have anything more to do with you eugène she declared you are not behaving nicely will you come and see me while you are in town mr strangewey she added turning to john i suppose you can be trusted to reach no 21 pont street without your mephistophelian chaperon  i should like to very much he replied i think he added a little hesitatingly that i have read one of your books of travel it is very interesting to meet you  so my fame has really reached cumberland she laughed you must come and talk to me one afternoon quite soon will you i want so much to hear your impressions of london i am always in between six and seven or if you want to come earlier i will try to be in if you telephone  i will come with pleasure john promised  they stood for a few moments in the crowded vestibule until lady hilda mullochs car was called the prince stood back allowing john to escort her to the door she detained him for a moment after she had taken her seat and leaned out of the window her fingers still in his hand  be careful she whispered the princes supper parties are just a littleshall i say banal there are better things if one waits                                       xvi   the receptionrooms of seyre house by some people considered the finest in london were crowded that night by a brilliant and cosmopolitan assembly for some time john stood by the princes side and was introduced to more people than he had ever met before in his life presently however he was discovered by his friend amerton  queer thing your being here a friend of the prince and all that the young man remarked wheres miss sophy this evening  i havent seen her john replied i dont believe she is invited  did you hear that calavera is coming amerton inquired  john nodded  shes expected any moment i wonder what shes like off the stage  you wait and see lord amerton sighed there isnt another woman in europe to touch her why they say that even our host is one of her victims like to be introduced to some of the girls or shall we go and have a drink  john was hesitating when he felt a hand upon his shoulder the princes voice sounded in his ear  strangewey he said i am privileged to present you to mme aida calavera madame this is the friend of whom i spoke to you  john turned away from the little group of girls and young men toward whom amerton had been leading him even though the princes speech had given him a moments breathingspace he felt himself constrained to pause before he made his bow of ceremony  the woman was different from anything he had imagined from anything he had ever seen in the ballet a writhing sensuous figure with every gesture a note in the octave of passion here she seemed the very personification of a negative and striking immobility she was slender not so tall as she had seemed upon the stage dressed in white from head to foot her face was almost marblelike in its pallor her smooth black hair was drawn tightly over her ears and her eyes were of the deepest shade of blue  during that momentary pause while he searched among a confused mixture of sensations for some formula of polite speech john found time to liken her in his mind to something egyptian she raised her hand as he bowed with a gesture almost royal in its condescension the prince with quiet tact bridged over the moment during which john struggled in vain for something to say  mr strangewey he remarked paid his first visit to covent garden tonight he has seen his first ballet as we moderns understand the term i cannot help envying him that delight he naturally finds it difficult to realize this additional good fortune will you excuse me for one moment  the prince departed to welcome some later arrivals the noisy little group standing close at hand from which john had been diverted passed on into the refreshmentroom and the two were for a few moments almost isolated  even then john felt himself tonguetied standing where she was with that background of dark oilpaintings lit only by shaded electric lamps she was more than ever like a wonderful old egyptian statue into which some measure of slowmoving life had been breathed he recognized almost with wonder the absence of any ornament of any sort on her neck or fingers  you were pleased with the performance i hope  her voice was in character with her personality it was extremely low scarcely louder than a whisper to his surprise it was almost wholly free from any foreign accent  it was very wonderful john answered  you understood the story  only partly he confessed  would you have recognized me seeing me as you do now  never in the world he assured her  tell me why i am so different off the stage  on the stage he replied you seem to me to be the embodiment of wild movement here you seemforgive meto be a statue i can scarcely believe that you walked across the room  it is my pose she said calmly  then you are a great actress as well as a great dancer he declared  for the first time the plastic calm of her features seemed disturbed she smiled but even her smile seemed to him more like some mechanically contrived alteration in the facial expression of a statue than anything natural or spontaneous  the prince tells me she continued that you are a stranger in london give me your arm we will walk to a quieter place in a few moments we are to be disturbed for supper one eats so often and so much in this country why do i say that though it is not so bad as in russia  they passed across the polished wood floor into a little room with oriental fittings where a lamp was swinging from the ceiling giving out a dim but pleasant light the place was empty and the sound of the music and voices seemed to come from a distance she sank down upon a divan back among the shadows and motioned john to sit by her side  you have come to find out to understandis that not so she inquired what you know of life the prince tells me you have learned from books now you have come to discover what more than that there is to be learned in the world of men and women  did the prince tell you all this john asked  he did she admitted he seems much interested in you  he has been very kind john said  she turned her head slowly and looked at him  a young man to whom the prince chooses to be kind is in a way fortunate she said i think he knows more of life than any other person whom i ever met  you have known him for long  in budapest five years ago in russia the season afterward then in paris in petersburg again and now in london the prince has been a faithful friend he came once from florence to petersburg to be present at my first night at the opera always he impresses me the same way there is very little in life in men or in women which he does not understand let us return to what we were speaking about i find it very interesting  you are very kind john declared  what you will learn here she went on depends very much upon yourself are you intelligent perhaps not very she added looking at him critically you have brains however without a doubt you have also what places you at once en rapport with the cult of the momentyou are wonderfully goodlooking  john moved a little uneasily in his place he felt that the dancers eyes were fixed upon him and he was feverishly anxious not to respond to the invitation of their gaze he was conscious too of the queer indefinable fascination of her near presence in the dimly lighted room  what you will learn she proceeded depends very much upon your desires if you seek for the best and are content with nothing else you will find it but so few men are content to wait  i intend to john said simply  look at me please she ordered  once more he was compelled to look into her deepblue eyes the incomprehensible smile was still upon her lips  you have loved  no he answered taken a little aback by the abruptness of the question  you grow more wonderful how old are you may i ask  twentyeight  at the present moment then you are free from any distracting thoughts about women you have no entanglements  i have nothing of the sort john declared almost irritably there is one person who has made a wonderful change in my life i believe i could say that i am absolutely certain of my feelings for her but so far she has not given me much encouragement tell me madame why do you ask me these questions  because it interests me she replied why do you not insist that this lady should tell you the truth  i have come to london to insist he told her but i have been here only fortyeight hours  so you are waiting  i am waiting he assented  so many people spend their lives doing that she went on presently it does not appeal to me the moment i make up my mind that i want a thing i take it the moment i make up my mind to give i give  john was suddenly conscious of the closeness of the atmosphere the fingers of his hands were clenched tightly together he swore to himself that he would not look into this womans face he listened to the band which was playing in the balcony of the great hall to the murmur of the voices the shouts of laughter he told himself that mme calavera was amusing herself with him  the princes party she continued after a long pause seems to be a great success to judge by the noise they are making so many people shout and laugh when they are happy i myself find a more perfect expression of happiness in silence  she was leaning a little back in her place one arm was resting upon a pile of cushions the other hung loosely over the side of the divan john felt a sudden desire to rise to his feet and a simultaneous consciousness that his feet seemed to be made of lead  you may hold my fingers she said and please keep your face turned toward me why are you nervous i am not very formidable  he took her fingers very much as the prince had done upon her arrival and pressed them formally to his lips then he released them and rose  you know he confessed i am very stupid at this sort of thing shall we go back to the reception rooms i shall be the most unpopular man here if i keep you any longer  the smile deepened slightly little lines appeared at the sides of her eyes so far from being annoyed he could see that she was laughing  joseph she mocked i am not tempting you really do sit down i have met men in many countries but none like you so you do not wish to accept those small privileges which a woman may offer when she chooses  i believein fact i am almost certainthat i love the woman i have come to london to see john declared  you get more and more interesting she murmured dont you realize that your love for one woman should make you kind to all  no i dont he answered bluntly  come she said do not be afraid of me i will not make love to youseriously you must be kind to me because everybody spoils me after supper there are one or two more questions i must ask you do you know that i am going to dance here never before have i danced in a private house in england except upon the stage i like to dance only to those whom i love  the little space between the curtains was suddenly darkened john turned eagerly around and to his immense relief recognized the prince their host came forward to where they were sitting and held out his arm to calavera  dear lady he announced supper is served will you do me this great honor  she rose to her feet the prince turned to john  this is my privilege as host he explained but if you will follow us you will find some consolation in store for you                                       xvii   well the prince asked as he handed aida calavera to her place at his right hand  i think not she replied  he raised his eyebrows slightly for a moment he glanced down the suppertable with the care of a punctilious host to see that his guests were properly seated he addressed a few trivialities to the musicalcomedy star who was sitting on his left then he leaned once more toward the great dancer  you surprise me he said i should have thought that the enterprise would have commended itself to you you do not doubt the facts  they are obvious enough she replied the young man is all that you say even more ingenuous than i had believed possible but i fancy i must be getting old he tried to tell me that he was in love with another woman and i felt suddenly powerless i think i must be getting to that age when one prefers to achieve ones conquests with the lifting of a finger  the prince sighed  i shall never understand your sex he declared i should have supposed that the slight effort of resistance such a young man might make would have provided just the necessary stimulus to complete his subjection  she turned her beautiful head and looked at the prince through narrowed eyes  after all she asked what should i gain i am not like a child who robs an insect of life for a few moments amusement even if i have no conscience it gives me no pleasure to be wanton besides the young man is in his way a splendid work of art why should i be vandal enough to destroy it i shall ask you another question  the prince slowly sipped the wine from the glass that he was holding to his lips then he set it down deliberately  why not  what is your interest is it a bet a whim orenmity  you may count it the latter the prince replied deliberately  calavera laughed softly to herself  now for the first time she confessed i feel interest this is where one realizes that we live in the most impossible age of all history the great noble who seeks to destroy the poor young man from the country is powerless to wreak harm upon him you can neither make him a pauper nor have him beaten to death why are there princes any longer i wonder you are only as other men  it is an unhappy reflection but it is the truth the prince admitted my ancestors would have disposed of this young man as i should a troublesome fly and it would have cost them no more than a few silver pieces and a cask of wine today alas conditions are different it will cost me more  she trifled for a moment with the salad upon her plate which as yet she had scarcely tasted  i am feeling she remarked magnificently orientallike cleopatra the sensation pleases me we are bargaining are we not  we shall not bargain the prince interrupted softly it is you who shall name your price  she raised her eyes and dropped them again  the prince has spoken she murmured  he touched her fingers for a moment with his as if to seal their compact then he turned once more to the lady upon his left  seyre house was one of the few mansions in london which boasted a banquetinghall as well as a picturegallery although the long table was laid for forty guests it still seemed with its shaded lights and its profusion of flowers like an oasis of color in the middle of the huge somberly lighted apartment the penny illustrated papers whose contributors know more of the doings of london society than anybody else always hinted in mysterious terms at the saturnalian character of the princes supper parties john who had heard a few whispers beforehand and whose interest in his surroundings was keen and intense wondered whether this company of beautiful women and elegant men were indeed a modern revival of those wonderful creations of boccaccio to whom they had so often been likened  some of the faces of the guests were well known to him through their published photographs to others he had been presented by the prince upon their arrival he was seated between a young american star of musical comedy and a lady who had only recently dropped from the social firmament through the medium of the divorcecourt to return to the theater of her earlier fame both showed every desire to converse with him between the intervals of eating and drinking but were constantly brought to a pause by johns lack of knowledge of current topics after her third glass of champagne the lady who had recently been a countess announced her intention of taking him under her wing  some one must tell you all about things she insisted what you need is a guide and a chaperon wont i do  perfectly he agreed  fair play protested the young lady on his left whose name was rosie sharon i spoke to him first  jolly bad luck lord amerton drawled from the other side of the table neither of you have an earthly hes booked saw him out with her the other evening  i shant eat any more supper rosie sharon pouted pushing away her plate  you ought to have told us about her at once the lady who had been a countess declared severely  john preserved his equanimity  it is to be presumed he murmured that you ladies are both free from any present attachment  got you there amerton chuckled what about billy  rosie sharon sighed  we dont come to the princes supper parties to remember our ties she declared lets all go on talking nonsense please even if my heart is broken i could never resist the princes pâté  apparently every one was of the same mind the hum of laughter steadily grew jokes mostly in the nature of personalities were freely bandied across the table it was becoming obvious that the contributors to the penny illustrated papers knew what they were talking about under shelter of the fire of conversation the prince leaned toward his companion and reopened their previous discussion  do you know he began i am inclined to be somewhat disappointed by your lack of enthusiasm in a certain direction  i have disappointed many men in my time she replied do you doubt my power now that i have promised to exercise it  who could he replied courteously yet this young man poses i believe as something of a st anthony he may give you trouble  he is then what you call a prig  a most complete and perfect specimen even in this nation of prigs  all that you tell me she sighed makes the enterprise seem easier it is after all rather like the lioness and the mouse isnt it  the prince made no reply but upon his lips there lingered a faintly incredulous smile the woman by his side leaned back in her place she had the air of accepting a challenge  after supper she said we will see                                       a single chord of music in a minor key floated across the room soft at first swelling later into a volume of sound then dying away and ceasing altogether john standing momentarily alone in a corner of the picturegallery found it almost incredible that this wildly hilarious throng of men and women could so soon and without a single admonitory word break off in the midst of their conversation stifle their mirth almost hold their breath in obedience to this unspoken appeal for silence every light in the place was suddenly extinguished there remained only the shaded lamps overhanging the pictures  not a whisper was heard in the room john looking around him in astonishment was conscious only of the halfsuppressed breathing of the men and women who lined the walls or were still standing in little groups at the end of the long hall again there came the music this time merged in a low but insistent clamor of other instruments then suddenly through the door at the farther end of the room came a dimly seen figure in white the place seemed wrapped in a mystical twilight with long black rays of deeper shadow lying across the floor there was a little murmur of tense voices and then again silence  for a few moments the figure in white was motionless then without any visible commencement she seemed suddenly to blend into the waves of low passionate music the dance itself was without form or definite movement she seemed at first like some white limbless spirit floating here and there across the dark bars of shadow at the calling of the melody there was no apparent effort of the body she was merely a beautiful unearthly shape it was like the flitting of a white moth through the blackness of a moonless summer night  the impression it made upon john was indescribable he watched with straining eyes conscious of a deep sense of pleasure here was something appealing insistently to his love of beauty pure and simple a new joy a new grace something which thrilled him and which left no aftermath of uneasy thoughts  the music suddenly faded away into nothing with no more effort than when she had glided into her poem of movement the dancer stood in a pose of perfect stillness there were a few moments of tense silence then came a crash of chords and the slender white figure launched into the dance  her motions became more animated more human with feet which seemed never to meet the earth she glided toward the corner where john was standing he caught the smoldering fire in her eyes as she danced within a few feet of him he felt a catch in his breath some subtle and only halfexpressed emotion shook his whole being seemed to tear at the locked chamber of his soul  she had flung her arms forward so near that they almost touched him he could have sworn that her lips had called his name he felt himself bewitched filled with an insane longing to throw out his arms in response to her passionate unspoken invitation in obedience to the clamoring of his seething senses he had forgotten even that any one else was in the room  then suddenly the music stopped the lights flared out from the ceiling and from every corner of the apartment slender and erect her arms hanging limply at her sides without a touch of color in her cheeks or a coil of her black hair disarranged without a sign of heat or disturbance or passion in her face john found aida calavera standing within a few feet of him her eyes seeking for his she laid her fingers upon his arm the room was ringing with shouts of applause in which john unconsciously joined every one was trying to press forward toward her with her left hand she waved them back  if i have pleased you she said i am so glad i go now to rest for a little time  she tightened her clasp upon her companions arm and they passed out of the picturegallery and down a long corridor john felt as if he were walking in a dream volition seemed to have left him he only knew that the still white hand upon his arm seemed like a vise burning into his flesh  she led him to the end of the corridor through another door into a small room furnished in plain but comfortable fashion  we will invade the princes own sanctum she murmured before i dance i drink nothing but water now i want some champagne will you fetch me some and bring it to me yourself  she sank back upon a divan as she spoke john turned to leave the room but she called him back  come here she invited close to my side i can wait for the champagne tell me why you are so silent and my dancingthat pleased you  he felt the words stick in his throat the sight of her cold alluring beauty shining out of her eyes proclaiming itself and her wishes from her parted lips filled him with a sudden resentment he hated himself for the tumult which raged within him and her for having aroused it  your dancing was indeed wonderful he stammered  it was for you she whispered her voice growing softer and lower it was for you i danced did you not feel it  her arms stole toward him the unnatural calm with which she had finished her dance seemed suddenly to pass her bosom was rising and falling more quickly there was a faint spot of color in her cheek  it was wonderful he told her i will get you the champagne  her lips were parted she smiled up at him  go quickly she whispered and come back quickly i wait for you  he left the room and passed out again into the picturegallery before he had the least idea where he was the band was playing a waltz and one or two couples were dancing the people seemed suddenly to have become like puppets in some strange unreal dream he felt an almost feverish longing for the open air for a long draft of the fresh sweetness of the night far away from this overheated atmosphere charged with unnamable things  as he passed through the farther doorway he came face to face with the prince  where are you going the latter asked  mme calavera has asked me to get her some champagne he answered  the prince smiled  i will see that it is sent to her at once he promised you are in my sanctum are you not you can pursue your têteàtête there without interruption you are a very much envied man  mme calavera is there john replied as for me i am afraid i shall have to go now  the smile faded from the princes lips his eyebrows came slowly together  you are leaving he repeated  i must john insisted i cant help it forgive my behaving like a boor but i must go good night  the prince stretched out his hand but he was too late  it was twenty minutes past two oclock when john left grosvenor square and it was twenty minutes to five when a sleepy hallporter took him up in the lift to his rooms on the fourth floor at the milan the intervening space of time was never anything to him but an ugly and tangled sheaf of memories  his first overwhelming desire had been simply to escape from that enervating and perfervid atmosphere to feel the morning air cool upon his forehead to drink in great gulps of the fresh windy sweetness he felt as if poison had been poured into his veins as if he had tampered with the unclean things of life  he found himself after a few minutes hurried walking in piccadilly the shadows that flitted by him lingering as he approached and offering their stereotyped greeting filled him with a new horror he turned abruptly down duke street and made his way to st jamess park from here he walked slowly eastward when he reached the strand however the storm in his soul was still unabated he turned away from the milan the turmoil of his passions drove him to the thoughts of flight half an hour later he entered st pancras station  what time is the next train north to kendal or carlisle he inquired  the porter stared at him johns evening clothes were spattered with mud the raindrops were glistening on his coat and face his new silk hat was ruined it was not only his clothes however which attracted the mans attention there was the strained look of a fugitive in johns face a fugitive flying from some threatened fate  the newspaper train at five thirty is the earliest sir he said i dont know whether you can get to kendal by it but it stops at carlisle  john looked at the clock there was an hour to wait he wandered about the station gloomy chill deserted the place sickened him and he strolled out into the streets again by chance he left the station by the same exit as on the day of his arrival in london he stopped short  how could he have forgotten even for a moment this was not the world which he had come to discover this was just some plaguespot upon which he had stumbled through the murky dawn and across the ugly streets he looked into louises drawingroom she would be there waiting for him on the morrow  louise the thought of her was like a sweet purifying stimulant he felt the throbbing of his nerves soothed he felt himself growing calm the terror of the last few hours was like a nightmare which had passed he summoned a taxicab and was driven to the milan his wanderings for the night were over                                      xviii   sophy gerard sat in the little back room of louises house which the latter called her den but which she seldom entered the little actress was looking very trim and neat in a simple blueserge costume which fitted her to perfection her hair very primly arranged and tied up with a bow she had a pen in her mouth there was a sheaf of bills before her and an open housekeepingbook lay on her knee she had been busy for the last halfhour making calculations the result of which had brought a frown to her face  there is no doubt about it she decided louise is extravagant  the door opened and louise herself in a gray morning gown of some soft material with a bunch of deepred roses at her waist looked into the room  why little girl she exclaimed how long have you been here  all the morning sophy replied i took the dogs out and then i started on your housekeepingbook and the bills your checks will have to be larger than ever this month louise and i dont see how you can possibly draw them unless you go and see your bankers first  louise threw herself into an easy chair  dear me she sighed i thought i had been so careful  how can you talk about being careful sophy protested tapping the little pile of bills with her forefinger you seem to have had enough asparagus and strawberries every day for at least half a dozen people as for the butcher i am going this afternoon to tell him exactly what i think of him and there are several matters here she went on concerning which you must really talk to the cook yourself for instance  oh please dont louise broke in i know i am extravagant i suppose i always shall be but if there is one thing in the world i will not do it is talk to the cook she might insist upon going and i have never known any one who made such entrées remember child it will be full salary in a fortnights time  you will have to go and see your bankers anyhow sophy declared its no use my writing out these checks for you unless you have paid in some money i dont know anything about you seem to be overdrawn already  i will see to that louise promised the bank manager is such a charming person besides what are banks for but to oblige their clients how pale you look little girl were you not late last night  sophy swung round in her place  i am all right i spent the evening in my rooms and went to bed at eleven oclock whos lunching with you i see the table is laid for two  louise glanced at the clock upon the mantelpiece  mr strangewey she replied i suppose he will be here in a minute or two  sophy dropped the housekeepingbook and jumped up  id better go then  of course not louise answered you must stay to lunch ring the bell and tell them to lay a place for you afterward if you like you may come in here and finish brooding over these wretched bills while mr strangewey talks to me  sophy came suddenly across the room and sank on the floor at louises feet  what are you going to do about mr strangewey louise she asked wistfully  what am i going to do about him  he is in love with you sophy continued i am surei am almost sure of it  louises laugh was unconvincing  i do not think she said that he quite knows what it means to be in love  sophy suddenly clasped her friends knees  dear she whispered perhaps i am a little fool but tell me please  louise for a moment was startled then she leaned forward and kissed the eager upturned face  you foolish child she exclaimed i believe that you have been worrying why do you think so much about other people  please tell me sophy begged i want to understand how things really are between you and john strangewey are you in love with him  louises eyes were soft and dreamy  i wish i knew she answered if i am then there are things in life more wonderful than i have ever dreamed of he doesnt live in our worldand our world as you know has its grip he knows nothing about my art and you can guess what life would be to me without that what future could there be for him and for me together i cannot remake myself  there was something in sophys face which was almost like wonder  so this is the meaning of the change in you louise i knew that something had happened you have seemed so different for the last few months  louise nodded  london has never been the same place to me since i first met him in cumberland she admitted sometimes i think i amto use your own wordsin love with john sometimes i feel it is just a queer indistinct but passionate appreciation of the abstract beauty of the life he seems to stand for  is he really so good i wonder sophy asked pensively  i do not know louise sighed i only know that when i first talked to him he seemed different from any man i have ever spoken with in my life i suppose there are few temptations up there and they keep nearer to the big things sometimes i wonder sophy if it was not very wrong of me to draw him away from it all  rubbish sophy declared if he is good he can prove it and know it here he will come to know the truth about himself besides it isnt everything to possess the standard virtues louise he will be here in a minute you want to be left alone with him what are you going to say when he asks you what you know he will ask you  louise looked down at her  dear she said i wish i could tell you i do not know that is the strange troublesome part of iti do not know  will you promise me something sophy begged promise me that if i stay in here quietly until after he has gone you will come and tell me  louise leaned a little downward as if to look into her friends face sophy suddenly dropped her eyes and the color rose to the roots of her hair there was a knock at the door and the parlor maid entered  mr strangewey madam she announced                                       xix   there can be no possible doubt louise remarked as she unfolded her napkin as to our first subject of conversation both sophy and i are simply dying of curiosity to know about the princes supper party  it was very cheerful and very gay john said every one seemed to enjoy it very much  oh la la sophy exclaimed is that all you have to tell us i shall begin to think that you were up to mischief there  i believe louise declared that every one of the guests is sworn to secrecy as to what really goes on  i can assure you that i wasnt john told them  the papers hint at all sorts of things sophy continued every one who writes for the penny illustrated papers parades his whole stock of classical knowledge when he attempts to describe them we read of the feasts of lucullus and bacchanalian orgies they say that at suppertime you lie about on sofas and feast for four hours at a stretch  the reports seem exaggerated john laughed we went in to supper at half past twelve and we came out just before two we sat on chairs and the conversation was quite decorous  this is most disappointing louise murmured i cannot think why the prince never invites us  the ladies of his family were not present john remarked stiffly  there was a moments silence louise had looked down at her plate and sophy glanced out of the window  is it true that calavera was there the latter asked presently  yes she was there john replied she danced after supper  oh you lucky man louise sighed she only dances once or twice a year off the stage is she really so wonderful close to  she is in her way very wonderful john agreed  confess that you admired her louise persisted  i thought her dancing extraordinary he confessed and to be truthful i did admire her all the same hers is a hateful gift  louise looked at him curiously for a moment his face showed few signs of the struggle through which he had passed but the grim setting of his lips reminded her a little of his brother he had lost too something of the boyishness the simple lightheartedness of the day before instinctively she felt that the battle had begun she asked him no more about the supper party and sophy quick to follow her lead also dropped the subject  luncheon was not a lengthy meal and immediately its service was concluded sophy rose to her feet with a sigh  i must go and finish my work she declared let me have the den to myself for at least an hour please louise it will take me longer than that to muddle through your books  louise nodded and rose to her feet  we will leave you entirely undisturbed she promised i hope when you have finished you will have something more agreeable to say than you had before lunch shall we have our coffee upstairs she suggested turning to john  i should like to very much he replied i want to talk to you alone  she led the way upstairs into the cool white drawingroom with its flowerperfumed atmosphere and its delicate shadowy air of repose she curled herself up in a corner of the divan and gave him his coffee then she leaned back and looked at him  so you have really come to london mr countryman  i have followed you he answered i think you knew that i would i tried not to he went on after a moments pause i fought against it as hard as i could but in the end i had to give in  that was very sensible of you she declared knocking the ash from her cigarette there is no use wearing oneself out fighting a hopeless battle you know now that there are things in life which are not to be found in your passionless corner among the hills you have realized that you owe a duty to yourself  that was not what brought me he answered bluntly i came for you  louises capacity for fencing seemed suddenly enfeebled a frontal attack of such directness was irresistible  for me she repeated weakly  of course he replied none of your arguments would have brought me here if i have desired to understand this world at all it is because it is your world it is you i wantdont you understand that i thought you would know it from the first moment you saw me  he was suddenly on his feet leaning over her a changed man masterful passionate she opened her lips but said nothing she felt herself lifted up clasped for a moment in his arms unresisting she felt the fire of his kisses the world seemed to have stopped then she tried to push him away weakly and against her own will at her first movement he laid her tenderly back in her place  i am sorry he said and yet i am not he added drawing his chair close up to her side i am glad you knew that i loved you louise you knew that it was for you i had come  she was beginning to collect herself her brain was at work again but she was conscious of a new confusion in her senses a new element in her life she was no longer sure of herself  listen she begged earnestly be reasonable how could i marry you do you think that i could live with you up there in the hills  we will live he promised anywhere you choose in the world  ah no she continued patting his hand you know what your life is the things you want in life you dont know mine yet there is my work you cannot think how wonderful it is to me you dont know the things that fill my brain from day to day the thoughts that direct my life i cannot marry you just becausebecause  because what he interrupted eagerly  because you make me feelsomething i dont understand because you come and you turn the world for a few minutes topsyturvy but that is all foolishness isnt it life isnt built up of emotions what i want you to understand and what you please must understand is that at present our lives are so far so very far apart i do not feel i could be happy leading yours and you do not understand mine  i have come to find out about yours john explained that is why i am here perhaps i ought to have waited a little time before i spoke to you as i did just now come you can forget what i have said and done but to me it will be an everlasting joy i shall treasure the memory of it it will help mei cant tell you quite in what way it will help me but for the rest i will serve my apprenticeship i will try to get into sympathy with the things that please you it will not take me long as soon as you feel that we are drawing closer together i will ask you again what i have asked you this afternoon in the meantime i may be your friend may i not you will let me see a great deal of you you will help me just a little  louise leaned back in her chair she had been carried off her feet brought face to face with emotions which she dared not analyze perhaps after all her selfdissection there were still secret chambers she thought almost with fear of what they might contain her sense of superiority was vanishing she was after all like other women  yes she promised i will help we will leave it at that some day you shall talk to me again if you like in the meantime remember we are both free you have not known many women and you may change your mind when you have been longer in london perhaps it will be better for you if you do  that is quite impossible john said firmly you see he went on looking at her with shining eyes i know now what i half believed from the first moment that i saw you i love you  springing restlessly to her feet she walked across the room and back again action of some sort seemed imperative a curious hypnotic feeling seemed to be dulling all her powers of resistance she looked into her life and she was terrified everything had grown insignificant it couldnt really be possible that with her brains her experience this man who had dwelt all his life in the simple ways had yet the power to show her the path toward the greater things  through the complex web of emotions which made up her temperament there suddenly sprang a primitive instinct the primitive instinct of all women rebelling against the first touch of a masters hand was she to find herself wrong and this man right was she to submit to accept from his hand the best gifts of lifeshe who had looked for them in such very high such very inaccessible places  she felt like a child again she trembled a little as she sat down by his side it was not in this fashion that she had intended to hear what he had to say  i dont know what is the matter with me today she murmured distractedly i think i must send you away you disturb my thoughts i cant see life clearly dont hope for too much from me she begged but dont go away she added with a sudden irresistible impulse of anxiety oh i wishi wish you understood me and everything about me without my having to say a word  i feel what you are he answered and that is sufficient  once more she rose to her feet and walked across to the window an automobile had stopped in the street below she looked down upon it with a sudden frozen feeling of apprehension  john moved to her side and for him too the joy of those few moments was clouded a little shiver of presentiment took its place he recognized the footman whom he saw standing upon the pavement  it is the prince of seyre louise faltered  must you see him john muttered  yes  send him away john begged we havent finished yet i wont say anything more to upset you what i want now is some practical guidance  i cannot send him away  john glanced toward her and hated himself for his fierce jealousy she was looking very white and very pathetic the light had gone from her eyes he felt suddenly dominant and with that feeling there came all the generosity of the conqueror  goodby he said perhaps i can see you some time tomorrow  he raised her hand to his lips and kissed her fingers one by one then he left the room she listened to his footsteps descending the stairs firm resolute deliberate they paused there was a sound of voicesthe prince and he were exchanging greetings then she heard other footsteps ascending lighter smoother yet just as deliberate  her face grew paler as she listened there was something which sounded to her almost like the beating of fate in the slow inevitable approach of this unseen visitor                                        xx   henri graillot had made himself thoroughly comfortable he was ensconced in the largest of johns easy chairs his pipe in his mouth a recently refilled teacupgraillot was english in nothing except his predilection for teaon the small table by his side through a little cloud of tobaccosmoke he was studying his host  so you call yourself a londoner now my young friend i suppose he remarked taking pensive note of johns fashionable clothes it is a transformation beyond a doubt is it i wonder upon the surface only or have you indeed become heart and soul a son of this corrupt city  whatever i may have become john grumbled its meant three months of the hardest work ive ever done  graillot held out his pipe in front of him and blew away a dense cloud of smoke  explain yourself he insisted  john stood on the hearthrug with his hands in his pockets his morning clothes were exceedingly wellcut his tie and collar unexceptionable his hair closely cropped according to the fashion of the moment he had an extremely civilized air  look here graillot he said ill tell you what ive done although i dont suppose you would understand what it means to me ive visited practically every theater in london  alone  sometimes with miss maurel sometimes with her little friend sophy gerard and sometimes alone john replied i have bought a baedeker taken a taxicab by the day and done all the sights ive spent weeks in the national gallery picturegazing and ive done all those more modern shows up round bond street i have bought a racingcar and learned to drive it i have been to dinner parties that have bored me stiff i have been introduced to crowds of people whom i never wish to see again and made one or two friends he added smiling at his guest for whom i hope i am properly grateful  the prince has been showing you round a bit hasnt he graillot grunted  the prince has been extraordinarily kind to me john admitted slowly for what reason i dont know he has introduced me to a great many pleasant and interesting people and a great many whom i suppose a young man in my position should be glad to know he has shown me one side of london life pretty thoroughly  and what about it all graillot demanded you find yourself something more of a citizen of the world eh  not a bit john answered simply the more i see of the life up here the smaller it seems to me i mean of course the ordinary life of pleasure the life to be lived by a young man like myself who hasnt any profession or work upon which he can concentrate his thoughts  then why do you stay  john made no immediate reply instead he walked to the window of his sitting room and stood looking out across the thames with a discontented frown upon his face between him and the frenchman a curious friendship had sprung up during the last few months  tell me then graillot continued taking a bite from his piece of cake and shaking the crumbs from his waistcoat what do you find in london to compensate you for the things you miss you are cooped up here in this little flatyou who are used to large rooms and open spaces you have given up your exercise your sportsfor what  i get some exercise john protested i play rackets at ranelagh most mornings and i bought a couple of hacks and ride occasionally in the park before youre out of bed  thats all right for exercise graillot observed what about amusements  well ive joined a couple of clubs ones rather a swagger sort of placethe prince got me in there and then i belong to the lambs where you yourself go sometimes i generally look in at one or the other of them during the evening  you see much of miss maurel  john shook his head gloomily  not as much as i should like he confessed she seems to think and dream of nothing but this play of yours i am hoping that when it is once produced she will be more free  i gather graillot concluded that to put it concisely and truthfully you are the most bored man in london there is something behind all this effort of yours my friend to fit yourself the round human being into the square place speak the truth now treat me as a father confessor  john swung round upon his heel in the clear light it was obvious that he was a little thinner in the face and that some of the tan had gone from his complexion  i am staying up here and going on with it he announced doggedly because of a woman  graillot stopped eating placed the remains of his cake in the saucer of his teacup and laid it down then he leaned back in his chair and balanced his fingertips one against the other  a woman he murmured how you astonish me  why  candor is so good graillot continued so stimulating to the moral system it is absolute candor which has made friends of two people so far apart in most ways as you and myself you surprise me simply because of your reputation  what about my reputation  graillot smiled benignly  in france he observed you would probably be offered your choice of lunatic asylums here your weakness seems to have made you rather the vogue  what weakness  it is to a certain extent hearsay i must admit graillot proceeded but the report about you is that although you have had some of the most beautiful women in london almost offer themselves to you you still remain without a mistress  what in the world do you mean john demanded  i mean graillot explained frankly that for a young man of your age your wealth and your appearance to remain free from any feminine entanglement is a thing unheard of in my country and i should imagine rare in yours it is not so that young men were made when i was young  i dont happen to want a mistress john remarked lighting a cigarette i want a wife  but meanwhile  you can call me a fool if you like john interrupted i may be one i suppose from your point of view all i know is that i want to be able to offer the woman whom i marry and who i hope will be the mother of my children precisely what she offers me i want a fair bargain from her point of view as well as mine  graillot who had been refilling his pipe stopped and glowered at his host  what exactly do you mean he asked  surely my meaning is plain enough john replied we all have our peculiar tastes and our eccentricities one of mine has to do with the other sex i cannot make an amusement of them it is against all my prejudices  graillot carefully completed the refilling of his pipe and lit it satisfactorily then he turned once more to john  let us not be mistaken he said you are a purist  you can call me what you like john retorted i do not believe in one law for the woman and another for the man if a man wants a woman and we all do more or less it seems to me that he ought to wait until he finds one whom he is content to make the mother of his children  graillot nodded ponderously  something like this i suspected he admitted i felt that there was something extraordinary and unusual about you if i dared my young friend i would write a play about you but then no one would believe it now tell me something i have heard your principles we are face to facemen brothers and friends do you live up to them  i have always done so john declared  graillot was silent for several moments then he opened his lips to speak and abruptly closed them his face suddenly underwent an extraordinary change a few seconds ago his attitude had been that of a professor examining some favorite object of study now a more personal note had humanized his expression whatever thought or reflection it was that had come into his mind it had plainly startled him  who is the woman he asked breathlessly  there is no secret about it so far as i am concerned john answered it is louise maurel i thought you must have guessed  the two men looked at each other in silence for some moments out on the river a little tug was hooting vigorously the roar of the strand came faintly into the room upon the mantelpiece a very ornate french clock was ticking lightly all these sounds seemed suddenly accentuated they beat time to a silence almost tragical in its intensity  graillot took out his handkerchief and dabbed his forehead he had written many plays and the dramatic instinct was strongly developed in him  louise he muttered under his breath  she is very different i know john went on after a moments hesitation she is very clever and a great artist and she lives in an atmosphere of which a few months ago i knew nothing i have come up here to try to understand to try to get a little nearer to her  there was another silence this time almost an awkward one then graillot rose suddenly to his feet  i will respect your confidence he promised holding out his hand have no fear of that i am due now at the theater your tea is excellent and such little cakes i never tasted before  you will wish me good luck  no  why not john demanded a little startled  because graillot pronounced from what i have seen and know of you both there are no two people in this world less suitable for each other  look here john expostulated i dont want you to go away thinking so you dont understand what this means to me  perhaps not my friend graillot replied but remember that it is at least my trade to understand men and women i have known louise maurel since she was a child  then it is i whom you dont understand  that may be so graillot confessed one makes mistakes let us leave it at that you are a young man of undeveloped temperament you may be capable of much which at present i do not find in you  tell me the one quality in which you consider me most lacking john begged you think that i am narrow too oldfashioned in my views perhaps i am but on the other hand i am very anxious to learn and absorb all that is best in this wider life you cant really call me prejudiced i hated the stage before i came to london but during the last few months no one has been a more assiduous theatergoer i understand better than i did and my views are immensely modified i admit that louise is a great artist i admit that she has wonderful talents i am even willing if she wished it to allow her to remain for a time upon the stage what could i say more i want you on my side graillot  and i graillot replied as he shook his friends hand and hurried off want only to be on the side that will mean happiness for you both  he left the room a little abruptly john walked back to the window oppressed with a sense of something almost ominous in the frenchmans manner something which he could not fathom against which he struggled in vain side by side with it there surged into his memory the disquietude which his present relations with louise had developed she was always charming when she had any time to sparesometimes almost affectionate on the other hand he was profoundly conscious of her desire to keep him at arms length for the present  he had accepted her decision without a murmur he made but few efforts to see her alone and when they met he made no special claim upon her notice he was serving his apprenticeship doggedly and faithfully yet there were times like the present when he found his task both hateful and difficult  he walked aimlessly backward and forward chafing against the restraint of the narrow walls and the low ceiling a sudden desire had seized him to fly back to the hills wreathed in mist though they might be to struggle on his way through the blinding rain to drink down long gulps of his own purer less civilized atmosphere  the telephonebell rang he placed the receiver to his ear almost mechanically  who is it he asked  lady hilda mulloch is asking for you sir the hallporter announced                                       lady hilda peered around johns room through her lorgnette and did not hesitate to express her dissatisfaction  my dear man she exclaimed what makes you live in a hotel why dont you take rooms of your own and furnish them surroundings like these are destructive to ones individuality  well you see john explained as he drew an easy chair up to the fire for his guest my stay in london is only a temporary one and it hasnt seemed worth while to settle anywhere  she stretched out her graceful body in front of the fire and raised her veil she was very smartly dressed as usual her whitetopped boots and white silk stockings which she seemed to have no objection to displaying were of the latest vogue the chinchilla around her neck and in her little toque was most becoming she seemed to bring with her an atmosphere indefinable in its way but distinctly attractive brisk in her speech a little commanding in her manner she was still essentially feminine  john at her direct invitation had called upon her once or twice since their meeting at the opera and he had found her from the first more attractive than any other society woman of his acquaintance none the less he was a little taken aback at her present visit  exactly why are you here anyhow she demanded i feel sure that eugène told me the reason which had brought you from your wilds but i have forgotten it  for one thing john replied i have come because i dont want to appear prejudiced and the fact that i had never spent a month in london or even a week seemed a little narrowminded  whats the real attraction lady hilda asked it is a woman isnt it  i am very fond of a woman who is in london john admitted perhaps it is true that i am here on her account  lady hilda withdrew from her muff a gold cigarettecase and a little box of matches  order some mixed vermuth with lemon for me please she begged i have been shopping and i hate tea i dont know why i came to see you i suddenly thought of it when i was in bond street  it was very kind of you john said if i had known that you cared about seeing me i would have come to you with pleasure  what does it matter she answered you are thinking perhaps that i risk my reputation in coming to a young mans rooms those things do not count for me ever since i was a child i have done exactly as i liked and people have shrugged their shoulders and said ah well it is only lady hilda i have been six months away from civilization biggame shooting and havent seen a white woman it didnt matter because it was i i traveled around the world with a most delightful man who was writing a book but it didnt affect my reputation in the slightest i am quite convinced that if i chose to take you off to monte carlo with me next week and spend a month with you there i should get my pass to the royal enclosure at ascot when i returned and my invitation to the next court ball even in this era of starch you see they would say it is only lady hilda  the waiter brought the vermuth which his visitor sipped contentedly  so there is a woman is there she went on looking across the room at her companion have you committed yourself already then dont you remember what i told you the first night we met after the operathat it is well to wait  yes i remember john admitted  i meant it  he laughed goodhumoredly yet not without some trace of selfconsciousness  the mischief was done then he said  couldnt it be undone she asked lazily or are you one of those tedious people who are faithful forever fidelity she continued knocking the ash from her cigarette is really to my mind the most bourgeois of vices it comes from a want of elasticity in the emotional fibres nothing in life has bored me so much as the faithfulness of my lovers  you ought to put all this into one of your books john suggested  i probably shall when i write my reminiscences she replied tell me about this woman and dont stand about in that restless way at the other end of the room bring a chair close to methere close to my side  john obeyed and his visitor contemplated him thoughtfully through a little cloud of tobaccosmoke  yes she decided there is no use denying it you are hatefully goodlooking and somehow or other i think your clothes have improved you you have a little more air than when you first came to town are you quite sure that you havent made up your mind about this woman in a hurry  quite sure john laughed i suppose i am rather an idiot but i am addicted to the vice of which you were speaking  she nodded  i should imagine she said that you were not an adept in the art of flirtation is it true that the woman is louise maurel  quite true john replied  but dont you know  she broke off abruptly she saw the face of the man by her side suddenly change and her instinct warned her of the danger into which she was rushing  you surprise me very much she said louise maurel is a very wonderful woman but she seems to spend the whole of her time with my cousin the prince  they are without doubt very friendly john assented they have a good many interests in common and the prince is connected with the syndicate which finances the theater i do not imagine however that the prince wishes to marry her or she him  lady hilda began to laugh softly but as if genuinely amused john sat and watched her in ominous silence not the flicker of a smile parted his set lips his visitor however was undisturbed she leaned over and patted his hand  simple simon she murmured leaning a little toward him if you go looking like that i shall pat your cheeks too you are really much too nicelooking to wear such thunderclouds  perhaps if we chose some other subject of conversation john said stiffly  oh dear me she interrupted very well you really are a most trying person you know i put up with a great deal from you  john was silent her face darkened a little and an angry light flashed in her eyes  well ill leave you alone if you like she decided tossing her cigarette into the grate if my friendship isnt worth having let it go it hasnt often been offered in vain there are more men in london than i could count who would go down on their knees for such a visit as i am paying you and youyou she added with a little tremble of real anger in her tone youre too hatefully polite and priggish come and ring the bell for the lift i am going  she slid gracefully to her feet shook the cigarette ash from her clothes and picked up her muff  you really are an egregious thickheaded obstinate countryman she declared as she moved toward the door you havent either manners or sensibility i am a perfect idiot to waste my time upon you i wouldnt have done it she added as he followed her dumbly down the corridor if i hadnt rather liked you  i am very sorry he declared i dont know quite what i have done i do appreciate your friendship you have been very kind to me indeed  she hesitated as his finger touched the bell of the lift and glanced at the watch on her wrist  well she said if you want to be friends i will give you one last chance i am doing what sounds rather a ghastly thingi am having a little weekend party down at my cottage at bourne end it will be rather like camping out but some interesting people are coming will you motor down on saturday evening and stay till sunday night or monday  i shall be very pleased indeed john replied it is very good of you to ask me when i come id like if i may he went on to tell you about myself and why i am here and about louise  she sighed and watched the top of the lift as it came up then she dropped her veil  you will find me she assured him as she gave him the tips of her fingers a most sympathetic listener                                       louise and sophy came to dine that evening with john in the grillroom at the milan they arrived a little late and were still in morning clothes louise was looking pale and tired and her greeting was almost listless  we are dead beat sophy exclaimed weve been having a secret rehearsal this afternoon without graillot and he came in just as we were finishing he was perfectly furious  he was here to tea with me john remarked as he led the way to their table  my dear man louise exclaimed if you could have kept him half an hour longer youd have earned our undying gratitude you see there are several little things on which we shall never agree he and myself and the rest of the company so we decided to run over certain passages in the way we intend to do them without him of course he saw through it all when he arrived tore up his manuscript on the stage and generally behaved like a madman  i am sorry john said as they took their seats and he handed louise the menu of the dinner that he had ordered wont the play be produced tomorrow night then  oh it will be produced all right louise told him but you dont know how weve all worn ourselves out trying to make that old bear see reason weve had to give way on one scene as it is what a delightful little dinner john youre spoiling us you know how i love that big white asparagus and strawberries too well i think weve earned it anyhow sophy  you have the latter declared you were the only one who could soothe graillot at all  i can get my way with most people louise remarked languidly but it simply means that the more difficult they are the more you have to spend yourself in getting it john she went on after a moments pause you are coming tomorrow night i suppose  of course didnt i take my box two months ago  and now that my part after the first act has been cut out i am coming with him sophy put in i may maynt i  of course john assented  louise sighed dejectedly  i am not at all sure that i shall like having you there she said i shouldnt be at all surprised if it made me nervous  he laughed incredulously  its all very well she went on watching the champagne poured in to her glass but you wont like the play you know  perhaps i shant understand it altogether john agreed its very subtle and as you know i dont find problem plays of that sort particularly attractive but with you in it you cant imagine that i shant find it interesting  we were talking about it coming up in the taxi louise continued and we came to the conclusion that youd hate it weve had to give way to graillot with regard to the last act of course there is really nothing in it but i dont know just what you will say  well you neednt be afraid that i shall stand up in my box and order the performance to cease john assured them smiling besides i am not quite such an idiot louise i know very well that you may have to say and do things on the stage which in private life would offend your taste and your sense of dignity i am quite reconciled to that i am prepared to accept everything you do and everything that you say there i cant say more than that can i  louise smiled at him almost gratefully she drew her hand over his caressingly  you are a dear she declared youve really made me feel much more comfortable now please tell me what you have been doing all day  well graillot came in and spent most of the afternoon john answered since then lady hilda mulloch has been here  louise looked up quickly  what here in your rooms  i didnt ask her john said i have been to see her once or twice and she has been very nice but i never dreamed of her coming here  shameless hussy sophy exclaimed as she set down her wineglass didnt you tell her that louise and i are the only two women in london who have the entrée to your rooms  i am afraid it didnt occur to me to tell her that john confessed smiling all the same i was surprised to see her it was just a whim i think  she is a clever woman louise sighed she wont know mei cant imagine why she is a cousin of the prince too you know  she is very amusing john agreed i have met some interesting people at her house too she has asked me down to bourne end for this next weekendthe weekend you are spending with mrs faraday he continued glancing toward louise  louise nodded she looked at john critically  quite a success in town isnt he she remarked to sophy people tumble over one another to get invitations for her weekend parties in the season i must say i never heard of going down to bourne end in february though  the idea seemed rather pleasant to me john confessed so many of you people know nothing of the country except just in the summer  if john gets talking about the country louise said we shall not be allowed our proper share in the conversation for the rest of the evening the question is are we to allow him to go down to bourne end lady hilda isnt exactly a puritan where your sex is concerned you know john  shell expect you to flirt with her sophy insisted  she wont john replied i have told her that i am in love with louise  was there ever such a man in the world louise exclaimed tell me what did lady hilda say to that  not much he answered she suggested that her cousin had a prior claim on you  louise laid down her knife and fork her left hand clutched the piece of toast which was lying by her side she began to crumble it up into small pieces  what did lady hilda say exactly she insisted  nothing much john replied she seemed surprised when i mentioned your name i asked her why and she told me or rather she hinted that you and the prince are very great friends  anything more  nothing at all i pointed out that the prince is interested in theatrical affairs and that he is the chief member of the syndicate that runs the theaters she seemed to understand  there was a brief silence louise was once more looking a little tired she changed the subject abruptly and only returned to it when john was driving home with her  do you know she said after a long silence i am not at all sure that i want you to go to lady hildas  then i wont he promised with alacrity ill do just as you say  louise sat quite still thinking looking through the rainsplashed windows of the taxicab  you have only to say the word john continued i should be flattered to think that you cared  it isnt that lady hilda is very clever and she is used to having her own way i am afraid  afraid of what  of nothing louise declared suddenly go by all means john i am simply a little idiot when i give way for a moment to such poisonous thoughts lady hilda can say what she likes about anybody or anything it really doesnt matter at all whether you go to bourne end or not  i dont quite understand you john confessed but if you mean that you are afraid of anything lady hilda might say to me about you why i feel inclined to laugh at you lady hilda he added with a touch of intuition is far too clever a woman to make such a mistake  i believe you are right louise agreed i shall pin my faith to lady hildas cleverness and to yourfidelity go and spend your weekend there by all means i only wish i wasnt bound to go to the faradays but that cant possibly be helped come and lunch with me on monday she added impulsively it seems a long time since we had a little talk together  he suddenly held her to him and she met his lips unresistingly it was the first time he had even attempted anything of the sort for months  you are a dear john she said a little wistfully i am terribly divided in my thoughts about you just now i feel that i have only one wishthat i could give you all that you want all that you deserve  he was very loverlike she was once more a slight quivering thing in his arms  why need we wait any longer he begged if we told everyone tonighttomorrowthe faradays would not expect you to keep your engagement  she shook herself free from him but her smile was almost a compensation the taxicab had stopped opposite her door and her servant came hurrying out  until monday she murmured                                       xxi   early on the following morning john glided out of london in his twoseated racingcar on his way to bourne end the white mist that hung over the streets and parks and obscured the sky passed away as he left the suburbs behind him with his first glimpse of the country came a welcome change there were little flecks of blue in the firmament above him a distinct if somewhat watery sunshine and a soft buoyancy in the air almost an anticipation of spring  john leaned back in his seat filled with an unexpected sense of contentment after all this weekend visit would probably turn out to be pleasant enough and on monday night the play was to be produced at last he felt that for weeks louise had been living in an atmosphere of high tension he himself had begun to realize the nervous excitement of a first night when the work of many months is at last presented in its concrete form he was content to believe that all that had depressed him in louises demeanor had been due to this causeto anxiety about her success to the artistic dissatisfaction evolved by the struggle between her desire to conform to the prejudices of the critics and her wish to present truthfully the work of the great french dramatist once it was all over and the verdict given relaxation would come he was content to wait  he had no trouble in finding lady hildas cottage in bourne enda long white bungalowlooking building surrounded by a little stream which led down to the river a man servant took his dressing case from the back of the car and showed him the way to the garage lady hilda herself came strolling up the lawn and waved her hand  now what about my weekend on the river she exclaimed as they shook hands isnt it delightful i have ordered lunch earlydo you mindand i thought if you felt energetic its not too cold for you to take me out on the river or if you feel lazy ill take you  i am not much of an oarsman john told her but i certainly wont ask you to pull me about  she led him into the little dining room and answered the question in his eyes when he saw the table laid for two  colonel and mrs dauncey are coming down this afternoon she said and my brother fred will be here in time for dinner i wired to mrs hendersonthe woman who writes novels you knowto come down too if she can but i havent heard from her i have been looking at the river this morning and its almost like glass and i can see little specks of green in the flowerbeds where my bulbs are coming up richards will show you your room now if you like and well have lunch in ten minutes  john found his cottage bedroom with its view of the river delightful and at luncheon lady hilda showed him the side of herself that he liked best she talked of her travels and of biggame shooting afterward they sauntered out to the stream and john selecting the more stable of the two boats moored to the little landingstage pulled out into the river lady hilda in a fur coat leaned back on a pile of cushions and watched him with a cigarette between her lips he found the exercise stimulating and delightful some of the color which he had lost came back to his cheeks  arent you sorry she asked him once as they paused to look across a vista of green meadows toward a distant range of hills for the people who see nothing in the country except in summer look at those lines of bare sad trees the stillness of it all and yet the softness and think what it will soon be think what there is underneath ready to burst into life as the weeks go on i always come down here early just to watch the coming of springtime that wood to our left with its bare brown undergrowth will soon show little flushes of pinkyyellow and then a few days more sunshine and the primroses will be there and you see higher up that wood where the trees stand so far apart a little later still the wild hyacinths will be like a blue carpet there in the garden we begin with little rings of white snowdrops then the crocuses come up in lines yellow and purple and the daffodils and then on those beds behind the hyacinths when the wind blows from the south the perfume of them as you pass down the river is simply wonderful be careful if you are turning round theres a strong current here  john nodded he was watching his hostess a little curiously  i had no idea he said simply that you cared about flowers and that sort of thing  she threw her cigarette away and looked at him for a moment without speaking  you see you dont really understand me very well she remarked  the twilight was coming on as they turned into their own little stream and gleams of light shot from the windows of the few houses that were open as they strolled up the lawn they could see a roseshaded lamp and a silver teaequipage set out in lady hildas sitting room  no one arrived yet i see she remarked carelessly as they entered the cottage ill play you a game of billiards as soon as we have had tea  john who had thoroughly enjoyed his exercise sat in a low chair by her side drank innumerable small cups of tea and ate buttered toast in thin strips when they had finished lady hilda rose  go and knock the balls about for a few minutes she begged i am going to put on a more comfortable gown if the daunceys come you can entertain them i played a round of golf this morning before you came  john made his way into the comfortable billiard room at one end of which a wood fire was burning lit a cigarette and took out a cue presently lady hilda returned she was wearing a rosecolored teagown and once more john caught a glimpse of something in her eyes as she looked at him which puzzled him  i am a little gaudy i am afraid she laughed as she took a cue from the rack but so comfortable how many will you give me in a hundred  i have never seen you play john reminded her i am not much good myself  they played two games and john had hard work to escape defeat as they were commencing the third the butler entered the room bearing a telegram lady hilda took it from the salver glanced at it and threw it into the fire  what a nuisance she exclaimed the daunceys cant come  john who was enjoying himself very much murmured only a word or two of polite regret he had never got over his distaste for meeting strangers  cant be helped i suppose lady hilda remarked there is nothing from flo henderson yet well have one more game and then ill ring her up  they played another game of billiards and sat by the fire for a little while the silence outside and the air of repose about the place were delightful to john after several months of london  i wonder you ever leave here he said  she laughed softly  you forget that i am a lone woman solitude as our dear friend wrote in her last novel is a paradise for two but is an irritant for one  there was a short silence for the first time since his arrival johns tranquillity was a little disturbed there was something almost pathetic in the expression which had flashed for a moment over his hostesss face was she really lonely he wondered perhaps she had some sort of unhappy love history underneath her rather hard exterior he was disposed just then to judge the whole world charitably and he had never believed the stories which people were so anxious to tell of her he felt no desire to pursue the subject  i have never read any of mrs hendersons books he remarked  she stretched out an arm took a volume from the swinging table by her side and threw it across to him  you can glance through that while you dress she said  a gong rang through the house a few moments later and the butler brought in two cocktails on a little silver tray  we are having quite a solitude à deux arent we lady hilda remarked as she raised her glass ill go and ring up flo on my way upstairs  they parted a few minutes later and john went up to his room he found his clothes carefully laid out a bright fire burning and a bathroom leading from his bedroom he dressed in somewhat leisurely fashion and the dinnergong rang as he descended the stairs he could hear lady hildas voice talking on the telephone and made his way to her little room she had just laid down the receiver  it seems she said that you and i are the only people who appreciate the country at this time of the year i have just been talking to flo she declares that nothing in the world would tempt her down here she is convinced that all the trees are dropping with damp and that the mud is inches deep she wont believe a single word about the sunshine  she isnt coming then  lady hilda shook her head  fred is our last hope as a chaperon she remarked carelessly as she took his arm i expect hell turn up later  dinnerwhich as john observed when they entered the room was laid only for twowas served at a small round table drawn pleasantly up to the fire john who had never admired his hostess more put all disquieting thoughts behind him and thoroughly enjoyed the dainty meal the pleasant warmth of the room the excellent champagne and lady hildas amusing conversation unlocked his tongue he talked much more freely than usual of his life in cumberland of the various halfformed plans which he had made as to the spending of his unexpected fortune of the new pleasure he found in motoring of his almost pathetic efforts to understand and appreciate the town life which at heart he hated a clever listener like most good talkers lady hilda frequently encouraged him with a sympathetic word or two  they were sitting over their coffee and liqueurs in two great easy chairs drawn up to the fire when john glanced at the clock with a little start  why its nearly ten oclock he exclaimed what on earth can have become of your brother  almost as he spoke the telephonebell rang it stood on a little table behind him lady hilda who was leaning back in her chair in an attitude of luxurious repose pointed lazily to it  answer it for me theres a dear man she begged  john took up the receiver he recognized the voice at onceit was lady hildas brother who spoke  i say is lady hilda there he asked  yes where are you john replied i am john strangewey we have been expecting you all the evening  expecting me was the reply what on earth are you talking about and what are you doing in the wilderness  i am spending the weekend with your sister john replied i understood that you were coming  the young man at the other end laughed derisively  something better to do old chap he said i am dining with flo hendersonjust speaking from her flat send hilda along theres a good fellow  john turned around his eyes met lady hildas and he understood he handed the receiver to her in silence of the conversation which passed he scarcely heard a word as soon as it began in fact he left the room and went across the hall to the billiard room the lights were already lit and cues ready chalked were standing by the table  john went through a few moments of dismayed wonder he glanced out of the window toward the garage which was all in darkness he heard the soft sweep of lady hildas skirts across the hall the closing of the door as she entered her eyes met his as he turned around with something of challenge in them her lips were curved in a faintly ironical smile  well she exclaimed a little defiantly shall i telephone to london for a chaperon  not unless you think it necessary john replied suddenly feeling the fire of battle in his blood i can assure you that i am to be trusted on the other hand if you prefer it i can motor back to town or i can go to the inn and come and take you on the river in the morning  it was obvious that she was a little surprised she came over to him put her hands upon the billiard table and looked up into his face  dont be a goose she begged and please dont imagine foolish things i suppose my telegram to fred must have gone wrong anyhow i dont think we need anybody else weve got along very well so far today havent we  ive enjoyed every moment of it john declared cheerfully and i am looking forward more than i can tell you to beating you at billiards to sleeping once more with my windows wide open and no smuts and to having another pull on that river in the morning let me give you fifteen this time i want to play my best  she took up her cue with a little sigh of halfpuzzled relief they played two games the second one at johns insistence then the butler brought in whisky and soda  is there anything further tonight madam he asked after he had arranged the tray  nothing lady hilda answered you can go to bed  they played the last game almost in silence then lady hilda replaced her cue in the rack and threw herself into one of the easy chairs  bring me a whiskyandsoda she said well have one cigarette before we go to bed  john obeyed her and sat by her side she looked at him a little questioningly his unhesitating acceptance of the situation had puzzled her there was nothing but the slightest change in his manner to denote his realization of the fact that the houseparty was a sham  i believe you are cross she exclaimed suddenly  on the contrary john replied i have had a thoroughly delightful day  you dont like people who tell fibs she went on you know quite well now that my houseparty was a farce i never asked the daunceys i never sent a telegram to fred it was simply rotten luck that he rang me up i asked you down here to spend the weekend with mealone  he looked her in the face without the slightest change of expression  then i think that it was exceedingly nice of you he said and i appreciate the compliment really he went on with a smile i think we are quite safe arent we you are known as a manhater and you are allowed special privileges because you are what you are and i am known to be in love with another woman  she frowned slightly  does the whole world then know of your infatuation she asked  it may know for all i care john replied simply i am hoping that after monday louise will let me announce it  there was a short silence a portion of the log fell to the hearth and john carefully replaced it upon the fire  do you remember she asked dropping her voice almost to a whisper what i said to you the first night we met at covent garden before i had any particular interest in you before i had come to like you  john made no reply why did she again remind him of what she had said that night  i advised you she went on not to be too rash i think i told you that there were better things  there is no better thing in the world john said simply than to give every feeling of which you are capable to the woman you love  she frowned and threw her cigarette into the hearth  you talk she declared either like george alexander on the stage or like a country bumpkin why doesnt some one teach you the manners of civilized life  lady hilda he replied i am past teaching you see the fact of it is that a country bumpkin is exactly what i am  she turned her white shoulder away from him  you will find a candle on the hall table she snapped  john rose at once to his feet  its your delightful country air i suppose he said i am sorry if i betrayed my sleepiness however good night  lady hilda made no answer john looked backward from the door she had kicked off her slipper and was warming her foot before the fire  good night he repeated i am going to wake like a giant in the morning and pull you just as far as you like up the river  he closed the door lit a candle and made his way to his room as soon as he was there he locked the door and flung the window wide open resting his elbows upon the windowsill he looked out at the soft misty darkness he had the sensation of having been through some undignified fight in which even victory savored of shame he felt a quivering consciousness half indignant half irritated of having been forced into an impossible situation  presently he began to undress he moved about on tiptoe and found himself continually listening he heard lady hilda come out from the billiard room below heard her strike a match as she lit a candle heard her coming up the stairs he stood quite still suddenly he saw the handle of his door turned softlyonce and then again he watched it with fascinated almost horrified eyes the door was shaken slightly a voice from outside called him  good night  he made no reply the handle ceased to rattle he heard retreating footsteps the opening and closing of lady hildas door                                       xxii   john was awakened the next morning by the sound of rain against his window he got out of bed and looked upon a scene of desolation the clouds hung low and rain was coming down in level sheets the lawns and gardens which yesterday had had the air of waiting for the spring were today a sudden wilderness  there was a knock at the door and the butler brought in his tea  lady hilda sends her compliments sir he announced and as the morning is so unfavorable she will not rise until eleven oclock breakfast will be ready downstairs at half past nine or can be served in your room  thank you ill come down john replied  he bathed and shaved himself he even packed his own clothes then he left the room descending the stairs softly and glancing furtively at the door of lady hildas room with an air almost of a guilty schoolboy he breakfasted alone and spent the morning in the billiard room until lady hilda appeared  i am a terrible hostess am i not she said apologetically as she opened the door but what is there to be done the weather is too hopeless isnt it  appalling john agreed still its very comfortable in here and i have just made a seventyone break  well have a two hundred and fifty upthat ought to last until lunchtime she suggested throwing herself into a chair give me ten minutes will you this weather is so depressing even the effort of getting up seems to have tired me  she threw herself into an easy chair and john tried to concentrate his attention upon the balls more than once however he glanced across at his hostess she was looking older this morning paler her face a little drawn her eyes large and soft she sat looking into the fire on her knee were some letters at which she scarcely glanced presently she threw them aside and rang the bell  bring me a brandyandsoda and the cigarettes she told the butler now mr strangewey i am ready she went on turning to john give me fifty in two hundred and fifty if you dare  well try he agreed  they played until lunchtime both affecting a rapt interest in the game at the sound of the gong lady hilda laid down her cue  well finish later she suggested  john strolled to the window there were some signs of clearing in the sky although the whole place seemed still to reek of moisture  i am afraid i shall have to start soon after lunch he said it will take some time to get up to town i am not a very experienced driver and my car is a little inclined to skid on wet roads  she made no remark and to both of them the presence of servants during the meal appeared to be somewhat of a relief the coffee and liqueurs however again were served in the billiard room and there was a very awkward silence for some time lady hilda had baffled his efforts at ordinary conversation and his last few remarks about the weather she had ignored altogether  so you are going up this evening she said at last  this afternoon if you dont mind he replied glancing at the clock and thinking of the bliss with which he would turn his car out into the road i explained didnt i that i had an engagement this evening  quite right she admitted all the same you are rather an inconsiderate guest arent you to leave me here alone in this swamp  come too he suggested ill motor you up  thanks she replied i will  he was a little taken aback but after all it was perhaps the simplest way out of his difficulties  ill take you with pleasure if you dont mind being drenched  i can stand physical discomforts she said its the other sort of knocks that bruise  it wont be so bad he continued ignoring her last speech if you wear a mackintosh and something thick for your head shouldnt wonder if it cleared up presently  lady hilda smiled  i have been out in a shower in patagonia she reminded him which lasted for three weeks will it suit you to start in half an hour  any time you like he agreed  she had changed her position a little and he was forced to look at her  mr strangewey she said i want to ask you a question are you going to marry louise maurel  i am he replied without hesitation at least i hope to do so  she looked at him for a moment with a strange expression then she rose to her feet her lips were quivering she leaned against the mantelpiece with her forehead upon her arms at first he imagined that she was going to weep then to his horror he found that she was laughinghalfhysterically perhaps but still laughing he drew a step nearer to her but she waved him away  sit down she gasped oh if i might tell this to henri graillot what a play what humor my friend john strangewey i congratulate you you have created a new situation in life leave me alone please  she bent forward until her face was completely hidden her body was shaken once or twice he fancied that her laughter had turned to sobs when at last she looked up however there were the remains of an almost devilish mirth on her lips she rang the bell  that is for my maid she said i am now going to change my clothes and let you motor me up to london i shall get some fresh air at any rate and your car always fills me with longing amuse yourself wont you i shall be an hour getting ready and i will order an early tea  you wouldnt care to tell me i suppose he asked what is the new situation in life which you say i have created  she turned to him from the door she was really a very handsome woman her lips were most expressive  my friend she said if you knew if you understood the priceless humor of it would be gone  she closed the door and left john alone he went back to the billiardtable but somehow or other his skill seemed to have vanished he had the picture of her face in his mind the subtle meaning of her lips the mockery of her eyes  they drove up to london almost in silence it was nearly seven oclock when john swung the little car in pont street it was still raining softly  thank you very much he said for my weekend i enjoyed the river immensely yesterday afternoon  and thank you very much for everything mr john strangewey she returned you have given me what we are all sighing for a new sensationnot exactly what i expected perhaps but something new  i know you think i am a country yokel and a fool john said but i wish youd tell me why you laughed at me in that mysterious fashion  she shook her head  it would spoil it she replied besides it isnt for me to tell you i am the last person who should  they drew up outside her little house from which came no sign of light  will you dine with me tonight he asked suddenly  she turned toward him quicklyand understood  very nice of you she replied lightly i shall go round to my club you dont agree with me somehow when i look at you or think of you i feel inclined either to laugh or cry and i hate emotions dont get out please you see they are opening the door already  she slipped away and disappeared into her house john drove slowly back toward the milan just as he was turning in a little waterproofed figure from the pavement waved her hand and called to him he drew up and she hastened to his side  what are you doing here sophy asked i thought you were spending the weekend up the river  i stayed there last night he answered todaywell look at the weather i have just motored lady hilda up  and what are you going to do now she inquired eagerly  give you some dinner he replied promptly  hurrah she answered i have been so bored and miserable that i went and walked over waterloo bridge in a mackintosh just to get a little air ill be round in an hour will that do  any time you like he agreed the sooner the better i was almost wishing a few minutes ago he went on that i could find the courage to storm you in your little room louise is away and im hating myself  so i am to come and amuse my lord she laughed well ill come she went on quickly well sit and you shall imagine that i am louise and make love to her will that make you happy  john leaned out of the car  sophy he whispered as he slipped in his clutch just now i do not feel like making love to any woman on earth  fed up with us eh  he nodded  youre different thank heaven dont be late                                      xxiii   this is very nearly my idea of perfect happiness sophy murmured as she leaned across the table and listened idly while john ordered the dinner give me very little to eat john and talk a great deal to me i am depressed about myself and worried about everything  and i he declared am just beginning to breathe again i dont think i understand women sophy  wasnt your weekend party a success she asked  not altogether he confessed but dont lets talk about it tell me what is depressing you  about myself or things generally  yourself first  well the most respectable young man you ever knew in your life who lives in bath wants me to marry him i dont think i could i dont think i could live in bath and i dont think i could marry any one and ive just thirteen shillings and fourpence left i havent paid my rent and my dressmaker is calling for something on account on monday morning  theres only one answer to that john insisted cheerfully i am going to lend you fifty pounds while you make your mind up about the young man  she made a face at him  i couldnt borrow money from a strange gentleman she protested  rubbish he exclaimed if you begin calling me a strangerbut there never mind well see about that after dinner now what is the other cause for depression  i am not very happy about you and louise she observed  why not  she hesitated while she seemed to be pondering over her words john studied her almost critically unquestionably she was very pretty her fair hair was most becomingly arranged her petite features and delicate mouth were charming her complexion and coloring were exquisite her neck and throat very white against the plain black satin of her gown  in a way she confessed at last its the play thats bothering me  the play he repeated  you wont like it she sighed the reason the production has been delayed so long is graillots insistence upon calling a spade a spade even with all louise and miles faraday have managed to get him to leave out there is one scene which is certainly a little startling for english playgoers  and louise is in it he asked  louise is the principal figure in it  johns face darkened a little  i have noticed lately he remarked gloomily that she rather avoids talking about the play i wish shed chuck it altogether  sophy shook her head  louise wont do that she said i sometimes think that her work is more to her than anything else in life i suppose you two will find a way out of it somehow  there is only one way and louise will have to make up her mind to it john declared steadfastly however my time hasnt come just yet until it comes i must make the best of things tell me more about your own loveaffairs sophy  it isnt a loveaffair at all she exclaimed almost indignantly  why i am sorry your prospective alliance then shall i call it  oh it isnt interesting she said its just a young man in bath he is a lawyer and moderately well off he has wanted me to marry him for years he was a friend of my brothers lately he has been bothering a little more than usualin fact i suppose i have received what might be called an ultimatum he came up yesterday and i went out with him last night he has gone back to bath this morning and i have promised to let him know in a month i think that is why i went out to waterloo bridge in a mackintosh and got wet  do you like him john asked practically  i like him i suppose sophy sighed thats the worst of it if i didnt like him there might be some chance i cant realize myself ever doing more than liking him in a mild sort of way and if he expected more as of course he would then i should probably hate him he tried to kiss me on the way to the station and i nearly scratched him that isnt like me you know i rather like being kissed sometimes  john buried himself in the winelist  well he admitted it doesnt sound very hopeful im no sort of judge in these matters but i have heard lots of people say that one gets on all right after marriage without caring very much before you dont seem to have a very comfortable life now do you  comfortable no but i am free sophy replied quickly i can come in and go out when i please choose my own friends give my kisses to whom i please marriagethe sort of marriage mine would beis slavery and nothing else what i am afraid of she went on is that when i was down in that highly respectable old city sitting all day in a respectable little villa with two servants to order about and housekeepingbooks to keep i should feel the old pull come over me and some day i should chuck it all and come back here to play around under the lights its rather fine to be here you knowto be in the atmosphere even if the limelight misses one  john sighed and regarded her thoughtfully  youre a queer little girl sophy he said i dont know how to advise you  of course you dont she answered no one could as for you i suppose you will marry louise what will happen to you after that i dont know perhaps i shant care so much about london then youve made it very nice for me you know  youve made it bearable even for me he told her i often think how lonely i should have been without you to talk to louise sometimes is delightfully companionable and kind enough to turn ones head other days i scarcely understand her everything we say to one another seems wrong i come away and leave her simply because i feel that there is a wall between us that i cant get over  there isnt really sophy sighed louise is a dear considering everything i think she is wonderful but you are utterly different she is very complex very emotional and she has her own standards of life you on the other hand are very simple very faithful and honest and you accept the standards which have been made for youvery very rigidly john  i wonder he murmured as he looked into his wineglass sometimes i think i am a fool sometimes i think id do better to let go the strings and just live as others do sometimes ideas come into ones head that upset principles and everything i dont know  sophy leaned across the table toward him  be a little more human john she begged you must feel kind things sometimes couldnt you say them i am depressed and gloomy be like other men for once and flirt with me a little try to say things even if you dont mean themjust for once for a few short hours  he held her hand for a moment the fingers seemed to respond to his touch with a little thrill  you silly child he exclaimed if i were to begin to say all the kind things i feel about you  begin thenbegin she interrupted what do you think of me really am i pretty do you like to have me here at the table with you or is your mind too full of louise do you notice that ive a pretty frock on and my hair is nicely arranged i have taken so much trouble tonight what are you looking at  johns whole expression had suddenly changed his eyes were fixed upon the door his face was stern as a granite block sophy turned quickly around the maître dhôtel with another satellite in his rear was welcoming with much ceremony two lately arrived guests sophy clutched at the tablecloth the newcomers were louise and the prince of seyre  i dont understand this john muttered his lips twitching  sophy gerard said nothing her cheeks were pink with excitement  suddenly louise saw john and sophy she stood quite still for a moment then she came toward them slowly and a little languidly the prince was still studying through his eyeglass the various tables which the head waiter was offering for his consideration  what an astonishing meeting louise remarked as she laid her hand for a moment on sophys shoulder what is going on behind my back  john rose very slowly to his feet he seemed taller than ever and louises smile remained unanswered  the rain broke up my weekend party he explained and i met sophy in the strand in any case i intended returning tonight i understood that you would not be here until tomorrow about eleven oclock  those were my plans louise replied but as you see other things have intervened our little house party too was broken up by this abominable weather and we all motored up to town the faradays have gone home the prince heard from miles that i was at home and telephoned me to dine me voici  john was struggling with a crowd of hateful thoughts louise was wearing a wonderful gown her hair was beautifully arranged she had the air of a woman whose toilet was complete and perfect down to the slightest detail the princes slow drawl reached them distinctly  it was my servants fault i suppose he said i told him to ring up last night and order the table for two in that corner however we will take the vacant one near your desk  he looked around and as if for the first time missed louise he came toward them at once  the prince seems to have ordered his table last night john remarked his tone even to himself sounding queer and strained  louise made no reply the prince was already shaking hands with sophy  i thought you were spending the weekend with my cousin strangewey he remarked turning to john  we did spend part of it together john replied the weather drove us back this afternoon  i congratulate you both on your good taste said the prince there is nothing more abominable than a riverside retreat out of season we are taking the table on the left louise  he led her away and they passed down the room john slowly resumed his seat  sophy he demanded hoarsely tell me the truth is there anything between the prince and louise  sophy nervously crumbled up the toast by her side  the prince admires louise and has done so for many years she answered no one knows anything else louise never speaks of him to me i cannot tell you  but you must know he persisted with a little break in his voice forgive me sophy if i make an ass of myself first lady hilda and then graillot and thenwell i thought louise might have rung up to see whether i was at home if she came back sooner than she expected and the prince took the table last night  she leaned over and patted him on the hand  dont worry she begged if louise has to choose some day between him and you i dont think shell hesitate very long and please remember that you were commencing to flirt with me i insist upon it i wont be put off dont look so stern please you look very statuesque and perfect but i dont want to dine with a piece of sculpture remember that i am really looking very pretty and that i am finding you too attractive for my peace of mind theres your text  he poured a glass of wine and drank it off  ill do my best he agreed if it sounds like rubbish you can still believe that i appreciate everything youve told me you are pretty and i am lucky to have you here now ill try to make you believe that i think so  she leaned over so that her head almost touched his  go on please she murmured even if it hurts afterward it will be heavenly to listen to                                       xxiv   the next night sophy acted as showman her part was over at the end of the first act and a few minutes later she slipped into a seat by johns side behind the curtain  what do you think of it so far she asked a little anxiously  it seems quite good john replied cheerfully some very clever lines and all that sort of thing but i cant quite see what its all leading to  sophy peered around the house from behind the curtain  there isnt standingroom anywhere she declared i dont suppose there ever was a play in london that was more talked about and then putting it off for more than three monthswhy there have been all sorts of rumors about do you want to know who the people in the audience are  not particularly john answered i shouldnt know them if you told me there are just a few familiar faces i see the prince in the box opposite  did you telephone to louise today sophy asked  john shook his head  no i thought it better to leave her alone until after tonight  you are going to the supper of course  i have been asked john replied a little doubtfully i dont quite know whether i want to is it being given by the prince or by the management  the management sophy assured him do come and take me its going to be rather fun  the curtain went up upon the second act john from the shadows of the box listened attentively the subject was not a particularly new one but the writing was brilliant there was the old marquis de guy a roué a degenerate but still overbearing and full of personality from whose lips came some of graillots most brilliant sayings louise his wife and faraday a friend of the old marquis and obviously the intended lover of his wife  i dont see anything so terrible in this john remarked as the curtain went down once more and thunders of applause greeted some wonderful lines of graillots  its wonderful sophy declared try and bear the thread of it all in your mind for two acts you have been asked to focus your attention upon the increasing brutality of the marquis remember that wont you  not likely to forget it john replied how well they all act  there was a quarter of an hours interval before the curtain rose again rumors concerning the last act had been floating about for weeks and the house was almost tense with excitement as the curtain went up the scene was the country château of the marquis de guy who brought a noisy crowd of companions from paris without any warning his wife showed signs of dismay at his coming he had brought with him women whom she declined to receive  the great scene between her husband and herself took place in the square hall of the château on the first floor the marquis is on the way to the room of one of his guests louise reaffirms her intention of leaving the house her husband laughs at her her position is helpless  what can you do he mocks  she shrugs her shoulders and passes into her room the marquis sinks upon a settee and presently is joined by one of the ladies who have traveled with him from paris he talks to her of the pictures upon the wall she is impatient to meet the marquis de guy  the marquis knocks at his wifes door her voice is heard clearly after a moments pause  in a few minutes she replies  the marquis resumes his flirtation his companion becomes impatientthe marquis has pledged his word that she should be received by his wife an ancient enmity against the marquis de guy prompts her to insist  the marquis shrugs his shoulders and knocks more loudly than ever at his wifes door she comes outfollowed by faraday  you asked me what i could do she says pointing to her lover you see now  there was a moments breathless silence through the house the scene in itself was a little beyond anything that the audience had expected sophy who had been leaning over the edge of the box turned around in no little anxiety she heard the door slam john had disappeared  he left the theater with only his hat in his hand turning up his coat by instinct as he passed through the driving rain all his senses seemed tingling with some nameless horror the brilliance of the language the subtlety of the situation seemed like some evil trail drawn across that one horrible climax it was louise who had come from that room and pointed to faraday louise who confessed herself a  he broke out into language as he walked the desire of samson burned in his heartto stride back into the theater to smash the scenery to throw the puppets from the stage one by one to end forever this ghastly unspeakable play and all the time the applause rang in his ears he had read with one swift glance the tense interestalmost lascivious it seemed to himon the faces of that great audience the scene had tickled their fancies it was to pander to such base feelings that louise was upon the stage  he reached his roomshe scarcely knew howand walked upstairs there he threw off some of his dripping garments opened the window wide and stood there  he looked out over the thames and there was a red fire before his eyes stephen was right he told himself there was nothing but evil to be found here nothing but bitter disappointment nothing but the pain which deepens into anguish better to remain like stephen unloving and unloved to draw nearer to the mountains to find joy in the crops and the rain and the sunshine to listen stonily to the cry of human beings as if to some voice from an unknown world  he leaned a little further from the window and gazed into the court at a dizzy depth below he had cut himself adrift from the peace which might have been his he would never know again the joys of his earlier life it was for this that he had fought so many battles clung so tightly to one idealfor louise who could show herself to any one who cared to pay his shilling or his halfguinea glorying in her dishonor worse than glorying in itfinding some subtle humor in the little gesture with which she had pointed unashamed to her lover  john bent a little lower from the window a sudden dizziness seemed to have come over him then he was forced to turn around his door had been quickly opened and shut it was sophy who was crossing toward him the rain streaming from her ruined operacloak  john she cried oh john  she led him back to his chair and knelt by his side she held his hands tightly  you mustnt feel like this she sobbed you mustnt john really you dont understand its all a play louise wouldnt really do anything like that  he shivered nevertheless he clutched her hands and drew her closer to him  do please listen to me she begged its all over louise is herself againlouise maurel the marquis de guy never lived except upon these boards it is simply a wonderful creation any one of the great actresses would play that part and glory in itthe very greatest john oh its so hard to make you understand louise is waiting for you they are all waiting at the supperparty you are expected you must go and tell her that you think it was wonderful  he rose slowly to his feet  wonderful he muttered wonderful but child it is damnable  dont be foolish she answered go and put on another dress coat tie your tie again and brush your hair i have come to take you to the supper  he caught at her hands roughly  supposing i wont go he whispered hoarsely supposingi keep you here instead sophy  she swayed for a moment something flashed into her face and passed away she was paler than ever  dear john she begged pull yourself together remember that louise is waiting for you its louise you wantnot me nothing that she has done tonight should make her any the less worthy of you and your love  he strode away into the farther room he reappeared in a moment or two his hair smoothly brushed his tie newly arranged  ill come little girl he promised i dont know what ill say to her but ill come there cant be any harm in that  of course not she answered cheerfully youre the most terrible goose john she added as they walked down the corridor do please lose your tragical air the whole world is at louises feet tonight you mustnt let her know how absurdly you have been feeling tomorrow you will find that every paper in london will be acclaiming her genius  john squared his shoulders  all the same he declared grimly if i could burn the theater and the play and lock up graillot for a month tonight id do it                                       xxv   the days and weeks drifted into months and john remained in london his circle of friends and his interests had widened it was only his relations with louise which remained still unchanged always charming to him giving him much of her time favoring him beyond a doubt more than any of her admirers there was yet about her something elusive something which seemed intended to keep him so far as possible at arms length  there was nothing tangible of which he could complain and this probationary period was of his own suggestion he bore it grimly holding his place whenever it was possible by her side with dogged persistence then one evening there was a knock at his door and stephen strangewey walked in  after all this meeting of which john had often thought and which sometimes he had dreaded a little turned out to be a very ordinary affair stephen although he seemed a little taller and gaunter than ever though he seemed to bring into the perhaps overwarmed atmosphere of johns little sitting room something of the cold austerity of his own domain had evidently come in no unfriendly spirit he took both his brothers hands in his and gripped them warmly  i cant tell you how glad i am to see you stephen john declared  it has been an effort to me to come stephen admitted but i had it in my mind john that we parted bad friends i have come to see how things are with you  well enough john answered evasively sit down  stephen held his brother away from him gripping his shoulders with both hands he looked steadily into his face  well enough you may be john he said but your looks tell a different story theres a look in your eyes already that they all get here sooner or later  nonsense john protested cheerfully no one pretends that the life here is quite as healthy as ours physically but that isnt everything i am a little tired today perhaps one spends ones time differently up here you know and theres a little more call upon the brain a little less upon the muscles  give me an example stephen suggested what were you doing last night for instance  john rang the bell for some tea took his brothers hat and stick from his hand and installed him in an easy chair  i went to a political meeting down in the east end he replied one of the things i am trying to take a little more interest in up here is politics  no harm in that anyway stephen admitted that all  the meeting was over about eleven john continued after that i came up here changed my clothes and went to a dance  at that time of night  john laughed  why nothing of that sort ever begins until eleven oclock he explained i stayed there for about an hour or so and afterward i went round to a club i belong to with the prince of seyre and some other men they played bridge and i watched  so thats one of your evenings is it stephen remarked no great harm in such doingsnor much good that i can see with the prince of seyre eh  i see him occasionally  he is one of your friends now  i suppose so john admitted frowning sometimes i think he is sometimes i am not so sure at any rate he has been very kind to me  he is by way of being a friend of the young woman herself isnt he stephen asked bluntly  he has been a friend of miss maurel since she first went on the stage john replied it is no doubt for her sake that he has been so kind to me  and hows the courting getting on stephen demanded his steely eyes suddenly intent  none too well john confessed  are you still in earnest about it  absolutely more than ever  stephen produced his pipe from his pocket and slowly filled it  she is keeping you dangling at her heels and giving you no sort of answer  well i wouldnt put it quite like that john declared goodhumoredly i asked her to marry me as soon as i came up and we both agreed to wait for a time you see her life has been so extraordinarily different from mine i have only half understood the things which to her are like the air she breathes she is a great artist and i scarcely ever leave her without feeling appallingly ignorant our life down in cumberland stephen is well enough in its way but it leaves us outside many of the great things of life  that may be true enough boy stephen admitted blowing out dense volumes of smoke from his pipe but are you sure that its toward those great things that she is pointing you  i am sure of it john answered earnestly i appreciate that in my heart let us talk together stephen as we used i will admit that i have found most of the time up here wearisome on the other hand i am beginning to understand that i have been and still am very ignorant there is so much in the world that one can only learn by experience  and what are you willing to pay for the knowledge stephen asked your health i suppose your simple life your love of the pure waysall these are to go into the meltingpot  theres no such payment demanded for the things i am thinking of john assured his brother take art for instance we reach the fringe of it with our books there are pictures even here in london which when you look at them especially with one who understands give a new vigor to your understanding a new resource to living you become conscious of a new beauty in the world a new garden as it were into which one can wander every day and yet not explore it in a lifetime i have seen enough stephen to make me want to go to italy its a shameful thing to keep ones brain and taste unemployed  who takes you to see the pictures stephen demanded  miss maurel generally she understands these things better than any one i have ever talked with  pictures eh stephen grunted  i mentioned pictures as an example john continued but the love of them includes many other things  theaters  of course john assented its no good being narrow about theaters stephen you read books readily enough and theaters are only living books after all there is no real difference  there is a difference in plays though as there is a difference in books stephen reminded him what about the play miss maurel is acting in now shes a mans mistress in it isnt she and glories in it  john who had been walking about the room came and sat down opposite to his brother he leaned a little forward  stephen he confessed i loathed that play the first night i saw it i shant forget how miserable i was louise was so wonderful that i could see how she swayed all that audience just by lifting or dropping her voice but the story was a horror to me the next daywell she talked to me she was very kind and very considerate she explained many things i try my best now to look at the matter from her point of view  stephens eyes were filled for a moment with silent scorn then he knocked out the ashes from his pipe  youre content then to let the woman you want to make your wife show herself on the stage and play the wanton for folks to grin at he asked  john rose once more to his feet  look here stephen he begged a little wistfully it isnt any use talking like that is it if you have come here with evil things in your mind about the woman i love we had better shake hands and part quickly shell be my wife some day or i shall count my life a failure and i dont want to feel that words have passed between us  ill say no more john stephen interrupted i was hoping when i came that there might be a chance of seeing you back home again soon its going to be an early spring there was june sunshine yesterday it lay about the hillsides all day and brought the tender greens out of the earth it opened the crocuses waxy yellow and white all up the garden border the hedgerows down in the valley smelled of primrose and violets art and pictures i never had such schooling as you john but there was old dr benson at clowmarshi always remember what he said one day just before i left id been reading ruskin and i asked him what art was and what it meant my boy he answered art simply represents mans passionate desire to drag the truth out of life in half a dozen different ways god does it for you in the country they called him an ignorant man old benson for a schoolmaster but when id struggled through what i could of ruskin i came to the conclusion that he and i were something of the same mind  its good to hear you talk like that stephen john said earnestly youre making me homesick but whats the sense of it for good or for evil i am here to wrestle with things for a bit  its no easy matter for me to open out the things that are in my heart stephen answered i am one of the oldfashioned strangeweys what i feel is pretty well locked up inside the last time you and i met perhaps i spoke too much so here i am  its fine of you john declared i remember nothing of that day we will look at things squarely together even where we differ im  he broke off in the middle of his sentence the door had been suddenly opened and sophy gerard made a somewhat impetuous entrance  im absolutely sick of ringing john she exclaimed oh i beg your pardon i hadnt the least idea you had any one with you  she stood still in surprise a little apologetic smile upon her lips john hastened forward and welcomed her  its all right sophy he declared let me introduce my brother may i my brother stephenmiss sophy gerard  stephen rose slowly from his place laid down his pipe and bowed stiffly to sophy she held out her hand however and smiled up at him delightfully  how nice of you to come and see your poor lonely brother she said we have done our best to spoil him but i am afraid he is very homesick sometimes i hope youve come to stay a long time and to learn all about london as john is doing if you are half as nice as he is well give you such a good time  from his great height stephen looked down upon the girls upturned face a little austerely she chattered away entirely unabashed  i do hope youre not shocked at my bursting in upon your brother like this we really are great pals and i live only just across the way we are much less formal up here you know than you are in the country john ive brought you a message from louise  about tonight  she nodded  louise is most frightfully sorry she explained but she has to go down to streatham to open a bazaar and she cant possibly be back in time to dine before the theater can you guess what she dared to suggest  i think i can john replied smiling  say you will theres a dear she begged i am not playing tonight may enser is going on in my place we arranged it a week ago i had two fines to pay on saturday and i havent had a decent meal this week but i had forgotten she broke off with a sudden note of disappointment in her tone theres your brother i mustnt take you away from him  well all have dinner together john suggested youll come of course stephen  stephen shook his head  thank you he said i am due at my hotel im going back to cumberland tomorrow morning and my errand is already done  you will do nothing of the sort john declared  please be amiable sophy begged if you wont come with us i shall simply run away and leave you with john you neednt look at your clothes she went on we can go to a grillroom john shant dress either i want you to tell me all about cumberland where this brother of yours lives he doesnt tell us half enough  john passed his arm through his brothers and led him away  come and have a wash old chap he said  they dined together at luigis a curiously assorted triosophy between the two men supplying a distinctly alien note she was always gay always amusing but although she addressed most of her remarks to stephen he never once unbent he ate and drank simply seldom speaking of himself or his plans and firmly negativing all their suggestions for the remainder of the evening occasionally he glanced at the clock john became conscious of a certain feeling of curiosity which in a sense sophy shared  your brother seems to me like a man with a purpose she said as they stood in the entrancehall on their way out of the restaurant like a prophet with a mission perhaps i should say  john nodded in the little passage where they stood he and stephen seemed to dwarf the passersby the men in their evening clothes and pallid faces seemed suddenly insignificant and the women like dolls  for the last time stephen john said wont you come to a musichall with us  i have made my plans for the evening thank you stephen replied holding out his hand good night  he left them standing there and walked off down the strand john looking after him frowned he was conscious of a certain foreboding                                       xxvi   i suppose sophy sighed as they waited for a taxicab we shall spend the remainder of the evening in the usual fashion  do you mind john asked  no she assented resignedly that play will end by making a driveling idiot of me only think for yourself at first we had to rehearse an extra month to please m graillot i never had more than a dozen lines to say even before my part was practically cut out but i had to be there every time now it has been running for i dont know how many nights i have played in it half the time and if your highness ever vouchsafes me a few hours in the evening you turn to me about nine oclock with just the same plaintive expression and murmur something about going on to the theater  well do something else tonight john proposed heroically i really had no idea that you were so fed up with it  sophy shook her head they were in the taxicab now and on their way  too late she sighed besides my sense of economy revolts at the idea of your empty box if louise is tired tonight though i warn you that i shall insist upon supper  its a bargain john promised well drive louise home and then ill take you back to luigis we havent been out together for some time have we  she looked up at him with a little grimace and patted his hand  you have neglected me she said i think all these fine ladies have turned your head  she drew a little closer to him and passed her arm through his john made no responsive movement he was filled with resentment at the sensation of pleasure that her affectionate gesture gave him  i might as well try to flirt with a statue she declared discontentedly what makes you so unlike other people you man of granite you used to kiss me very clumsily when i asked you to and nowwhy how hot your hand is  john pushed her away almost roughly  yes i know i did he admitted and now i dont want to any more do you see its this cursed place and this cursed life ones feet seem always on the sands i wouldnt have believed it when i first came here dont tease me sophy he added turning toward her suddenly i am rather inclined to despise myself these last few weeks dont make me worsedont make me loathe myself  she shrugged her shoulders a little pettishly as she leaned back in the cab  you are nothing but a crank she declared you and your brother too youve lived among those flinty rocks till youve become almost like them yourselves  the taxi drew up at the theater john with a little sigh of relief was already out upon the pavement sophys eyes were still shining at him through her veil as she walked lightly and gracefully by his side but he led the way in silence down the stairs to the box that he had taken for the season  and now she exclaimed with a pout as she leaned back in the corner my little reign is over you will sit in the front seat and you will look at louise and feel louise and your eyes will shine louise until the moment for your escape comes when you can go round to the back and meet her and then you will try to make excuses to get rid of me so that you can drive her home alone  rubbish sophy he answered as he drew a chair to her side you know quite well that i cant sit in the front of the box for the very prosaic reason that i havent changed my clothes we shall both have to linger here in the shadows  well there is some comfort in that at any rate sophy confessed if i become absolutely overcome by my emotions i can hold your hand  you had better not john observed the stage manager has his eye on you if his own artists wont behave in the theater what can he expect of the audience  sophy made a little grimace if they stop my three pounds a week she murmured i shall either have to starve or become your valet  the curtain was up and the play in progressa work of genius rather in its perfectly balanced development and its phraseology than in any originality of motive louise married as an ingénue so quickly transformed into the brilliant woman of society poking mild fun at the unsympathetic husband to whom she has been sold while still striving to do her duty as a wife easily dominated every situation the witty speeches seemed to sparkle upon her lips while she was upon the stage every spoken sentence was listened to with rapt attention graillot seated as usual among the shadows of the opposite box moved his head appreciatively each time she spoke as if punctuating the measured insolence of her brilliance  exquisitely gowned full of original and daring gestures she moved about the stage as if her feet scarcely touched the boards she was full of fire and life in the earlier stages of the comedy she heaped mild ridicule upon her husband and his loveaffairs exchanged light sallies with her guests or parried with resourceful subtlety the constant appeals of the man she loved  the spell of it all against which he had so often fought came over john anew he set his chair back against the wall and watched and listened a veritable sense of hypnotism creeping over his senses presently the same impulse which had come to him so many times before induced him to turn his head to read in the faces of the audience the reflection of her genius he had often watched those long lines of faces changing each in its own way under the magic of her art tonight he looked beyond he knew very well that his search had a special object suddenly he gripped the arms of his chair in the front row of the pit sitting head and shoulders taller than the men and women who lounged over the wooden rest in front of them was stephen more than ever among these unappropriate surroundings he seemed to represent something almost patriarchal a forbidding and disapproving spirit sitting in judgment upon some modern and unworthy wantonness his face stern and grave showed little sign of approval or disapproval but to johns apprehending eyes the critical sense was there the verdict foredoomed he understood as in a flash that stephen had come there to judge once more the woman whom his brother desired  at last the second act ended and john pushed back his chair sophy whose apprehensions were remarkably acute especially where john was concerned lifted the edge of the curtain and understood she exchanged a quick glance with her companion  he wont like it she whispered  if only we could get him away before the next act john muttered  they both glanced once more into the auditorium below many of the spectators had left their places to stroll about not so stephen unflinchingly he sat there with an air of dogged patience he had bought a program and was reading the names one by one  is there nothing we can do sophy asked couldnt we send a messagepersuade him that the last act isnt worth staying for  john shook his head  stephen has come here with a purpose he said gloomily i might have guessed it he will see it through he will sit there till the end  the curtain went up again and the play moved on with subtle yet inevitable dramatic power toward the hated and dreaded crisis louises moment of combined weakness and strength was so wonderfully natural so very human that its approach sent a thrill of anticipation through the audience the intense lifelikeness of the play predominated over every other feeling it was as if real things were happening as if they were watching and listening to a woman at the moment of her choice and then at last the tense moment the sudden cessation of her husbands foolish laughter and futile taunts the supreme dénouement with its interval of breathless silence  john who was slowly tearing his program to pieces turned his head toward the spot where his brother was sitting in the dimmer light stephens countenance seemed to have changed into the color as well as the likeness of those granite rocks the line of faces on either side of him appeared now curiously featureless his eyes were still riveted upon that closed door his eyebrows had come together in a stupendous frown  sophy had parted the curtain and was peeping through  nothing in the world could make him understand she murmured do you think it would be of any use if we met him outside  john shook his head  you cant convince people he replied when you are unconvinced yourself  the play came to an end presently amid a storm of applause the grim figure in the front of the pit remained motionless and silent he was one of the last to leave and john watched his retreating figure with a sigh sophy drew him away  we had better hurry round she said louise is always very quick getting ready  they found her as a matter of fact in the act of leaving she welcomed them naturally enough but john fancied that her greeting showed some signs of embarrassment  you knew that i was going out to supper tonight she asked or didnt i tell you the prince has asked the french people from his majestys to meet m graillot at supper i am hurrying home to dress  john handed her into her waiting automobile in silence she glanced into his face  is anything the matter she asked  nothing  the prince would have asked you without a doubt louise continued but he knows that you are not really interested in the stage and this party is entirely frenchthey do not speak a word of english au revoir sophy take care of him and mind you behave yourselves  she waved her hand to them both and threw herself back among the cushions as the car glided off john walked to the corner of the street in gloomy silence then he remembered his companion he stopped short  sophy he begged dont hold me to my promise i dont want to take you out to supper tonight i am not in the humor for it  dont be foolish she replied if you stay alone you will only imagine things and be miserable we neednt have any supper unless you like let me come and sit in your rooms with you  no he decided almost roughly i am losing myself sophy i am losing something of my strength every day louise doesnt help as she might dont stay with me please i am beginning to have moods and when they come on i want to be alone  she drew a little closer to him  let me come please she begged with a pathetic almost childlike quiver at the corner of her lips  he looked down at her a sudden wave of tenderness swept every other thought from his mind his mental balance seemed suddenly restored he hailed a passing taxi and handed sophy into it  what a selfish pig i am he exclaimed anyhow its all over now well go back to luigis to supper by all means i am going to make you tell me all about that young man from bath                                      xxvii   louise glanced at her watch sat up in bed and turned reproachfully toward aline  aline do you know it is only eleven oclock she exclaimed  i am very sorry madame the latter hastened to explain but there is a gentleman downstairs who wishes to see you he says he will wait until you can receive him i thought you would like to know  a gentleman at this hour of the morning louise yawned how absurd anyhow you ought to know better than to wake me up before the proper time  i am very sorry madame aline replied i hesitated for some time but i thought you would like to know that the gentleman was here it is mr stephen strangeweymr johns brother  louise clasped her knees with her fingers and sat thinking she was wide awake now  he has been here some time already madame aline continued i did not wish to disturb you but i thought perhaps it was better for you to know that he was here  quite right aline louise decided go down and tell him that i will see him in half an hour and get my bath ready at once  louise dressed herself simply but carefully she could conceive of but one reason for stephens presence in her house and it rather amused her it was of course no friendly visit he had come either to threaten or to cajole yet what could he do what had she to fear she went over the interview in her mind imagining him crushed and subdued by her superior subtlety and finesse  with a little smile of coming triumph upon her lips she descended the stairs and swept into her pleasantly warmed and perfumed little drawingroom she even held out her hand cordially to the dark grim figure whose outline against the dainty white wall seemed so inappropriate  this is very nice of you indeed mr strangewey she began i had no idea that you had followed your brothers example and come to town  she told herself once more that her slight instinct of uneasiness had been absurd stephens bow although a little formal and austere was still an acknowledgment of her welcome the shadows of the room perhaps had prevented him from seeing her outstretched hand  mine is a very short visit miss maurel he said i had no other reason for coming but to see john and to pay this call upon you  i am greatly flattered she told him you must please sit down and make yourself comfortable while we talk see this is my favorite place she added dropping into a corner of her lounge will you sit beside me or if you prefer draw up that chair  my preference he replied is to remain standing  she raised her eyebrows her tone altered  it must be as you wish of course she continued only i have such pleasant recollections of your hospitality at peak hall that i should like if there was any possible way in which i could return it  madam he interrupted you must admit that the hospitality of peak hall was not willingly offered to you save for the force of circumstances you would never have crossed our threshold  she shrugged her shoulders she was adapting her tone and manner to the belligerency of his attitude  well  you want to know why i have found my way to london he went on i came to find out a little more about you  about me  to discover if there was anything about you he proceeded deliberately concerning which report had lied i do not place my faith in newspapers and gossip there was always a chance that you might have been an honest woman that is why i came to london and why i went to see your play last night  she was speechless it was as if he were speaking to her in some foreign tongue  i have struggled he continued to adopt a charitable view of your profession i know that the world changes quickly while we who prefer to remain outside its orbit of necessity lose touch with its new ideas and new fashions so i said to myself that there should be no mistake for that reason i sat in a theater last night almost for the first time in my life i saw you act  well she asked almost defiantly  he looked down at her all splendid selfassurance seemed ebbing away she felt a sudden depression of spirit a sudden strange sense of insignificance  i have come he said if i can to buy my brothers freedom  to buy your brothers freedom she repeated in a dazed tone  my brother is infatuated with you stephen declared i wish to save him  her womans courage began to assert itself she raised her eyes to his  exactly what do you mean she asked calmly in what way is any man to be saved from me if your brother should care for me and i by any chance should happen to care for him in what respect would that be a state from which he would require salvation  you make my task more difficult he observed deliberately does it amuse you to practise your profession before one so ignorant and so unappreciative as myself if my brother should ever marry it is my firm intention that he shall marry an honest woman  louise sat quite still for a moment a flash of lightning had glittered before her eyes and in her ears was the crash of thunder her face was suddenly strained she saw nothing but the stern forbidding expression of the man who looked down at her  you dare to say this to me here in my own house  dare why not dont people tell you the truth here in london then  she rose a little unsteadily to her feet motioning him toward the door and moving toward the bell suddenly she sank back into her former place breathless and helpless  why do you waste your breath he asked calmly we are alone here and iwe know the truth  she sat quite still shivering a little  do we tell me then because i am curioustell me why you are so sure of what you say  the world has it he replied that you are the mistress of the prince of seyre i came to london to satisfy myself as to the truth of that report do you believe that any man living among that audience last night could watch the play and know that you passed night after night into your bedchamber to meet your lover with that look upon your faceyou are a clever actress madamand believe that you were a woman who was living an honest life  that seems impossible to you she demanded  utterly impossible  and to john  i am speaking for myself and not for my brother stephen replied men like him who are assailed by a certain madness are best left alone with it that is why i came to you to bargain if i could is there anything that you lackanything which your own success and your lover or lovers have failed to provide for you  it was useless to try to rise she was powerless in all her limbs side by side with the anger and horror that his words aroused was a sense of something almost grotesque something which seemed to force an unnatural laugh from her lips  so you want to buy me off  i should be glad to believe that it was within my power to do so i have not johns great fortune but i have money the accumulated savings of a lifetime for which i have no better purpose there is one more thing too to be said  another charge  not that he told her only it is better for you to understand that if you turn me from your house this morning i shall still feel the necessity of saving my brother from you  saving him from me she exclaimed rising suddenly and throwing out her arms do you know what you are talking about do you know that if i consented to think of your brother as my husband there is not a man in london who would not envy him look at me i am beautiful am i not i am a great artist i am louise maurel and i have made myself famous by my own work and my own genius what has your brother done in life to render him worthy of the sacrifice i should make if i chose to give him my hand you had better go back to cumberland mr strangewey you do not see life as we see it up here  and what about john he asked without moving you tempted him away was it from wantonness or do you love him  love him she laughed i hate you both you are boorsyou are ignorant people i hate the moment i ever saw either of you take john back with you take him out of my life there is no place there for him  stephen picked up his hat from the sofa where it lay louise remained perfectly still her breath coming quickly her eyes lit with passion  madam he said i am sorry to have distressed you but the truth sometimes hurts the most callous of us you have heard the truth from me i will take john back to cumberland with me if he will come if he will not  take him with you she broke in fiercely he will do as i bid himdo you hear if i lift my little finger he will stay it will be i who decide i  but you will not lift your little finger he interrupted grimly  why shouldnt i just to punish you she demanded there are scores of men who fancy themselves in love with me if i choose i can keep them all their lives hanging to the hem of my skirt praying for a word a touch i can make them furious one day and penitent the nextwretched always perhaps but i can keep them there why should i not treat your brother in the same way  he seemed suddenly to dilate she was overcome with a sense of some latent power in the man some commanding influence  because he declared i am the guardian of my brothers happiness whoever trifles with it shall in the future reckon with me  his eyes were fixed upon her soft white throat his long lean fingers seemed suddenly to be drawing near to her she watched him fascinated she was trying to scream even after he had turned away and left her after she had heard his measured tramp descending the stairs her fingers flew to her throat she held herself tightly standing there with beating heart and throbbing pulses it was not until the front door had closed that she had the strength to move to throw herself face downward upon the couch                                      xxviii   louise ate a very small luncheon butan unusual thing for hershe drank two glasses of wine just as she had finished sophy came in with inkstained fingers and a serious expression  you silly child louise exclaimed no one told me you were here have you had any lunch  long ago sophy replied i have been finishing your accounts  louise made a little grimace  tell me the worst she begged  you are overdrawn at your bank your bills are heavier than ever this month and there are five or six special accountsone for some electric fittings another for the hire of a motorcarwhich ought to be paid  people are always wanting money louise declared pettishly  people always will want money sophy retorted so long as you earn three thousand a year and spend four or five thousand  louise selected a cigarette and lit it  instead of scolding me child she yawned suppose you suggest something  what is there to suggest sophy replied your bank has written you to put your overdraft straight at onceit comes to about two hundred and seventy pounds there are bills for which the people are asking for payment and which come to about as much again youve nothing but your hundred pounds a week and youre spending half of that as it is  louise flicked the ash from her cigarette  and even you my child dont know the worst she remarked theres fenillon my dressmaker she doesnt send me a bill at all but i owe her nearly six hundred pounds i have to wear a shockingly unbecoming gown in the second act as it is just because shes getting disagreeable  well ive tried to set things straight sophy declared youll have either to marry or to borrow some money you cant go on much longer  louise was looking up at the ceiling she sighed  it would be nice she said to have some one to pay ones bills and look after one and see that one wasnt too extravagant  well you need some one badly sophy asserted i suppose you mean to make up your mind to it some day  i wonder louise murmured did you know that that terrible man from the hillsjohn strangeweys brotherhas been here this morning he frightened me almost to death  what did he want sophy asked curiously  he was a trifle vague louise remarked i gathered that if i dont send john back to cumberland hes going to strangle me  sophy leaned across the table  are you going to send him back she asked  i am in an uncertain frame of mind louise confessed i really cant decide about anything  sophy poured herself out some coffee  i think she said that youll have to decide about john before long  about john indeed louise exclaimed lightly who gave you the right to call him by his christian name  sophy colored  i suppose i have just dropped into it she remarked tell me what you have decided to do louise  why should i do anything at all  you know very well sophy insisted that you have encouraged john strangewey shamefully you have persuaded him to live up here to make new friends and to start an entirely new mode of life just in the hope that some day you will marry him  have i louise asked then i suppose i must keep my wordsome day  sophy drew her chair a little nearer to her friends she passed her arm around louises waist their heads almost touched  dear louise she whispered please tell me  louise was silent her hesitation became momentous her eyes seemed to be looking through the walls sophy watched her breathlessly  you ought to make up your mind she went on you see it isnt as if there was no one else there is the prince  sophy felt the fingers that she was clasping grow a little colder  yes louise repeated there is the prince sophy i feel that i am drifting into an impossible position every day is bringing me nearer to it  i want to tell you this louise sophy said firmly john is getting to know a great many people and you know how men talk at the clubs arent you sometimes afraid that he will hear things and misunderstand  i am expecting it every day louise admitted  then why dont you end it  which way  there was a silence between the two women the muffled street noises from outside became the background to a stillness which grew every moment more oppressive louise returned to her former attitude she looked steadfastly before her her face supported by her hands  sophy grew paler and paler as the minutes passed there was something strange and almost beautiful in louises face something which had come to her lately and which shone from her eyes only at rare intervals  you care for him i believe sophy cried at last you care for him  louise did not move  why not she whispered  you louise sophy gasped you the great artist why think of the men who have tried to make you carepoets musiciansso many of them so many famous men it cant be true john strangewey is so far apart he doesnt belong to your world  louise leaned over and stroked her little friends hair  child she said thats all very true i have had it ringing in my brain for longer than you would believe but now tell me something no look at medont be ashamed are you in love with john yourself  sophy never hesitated  from the very first moment i saw him she confessed dont let that bother you dear he would never look at me except as a little pal i never expected anything from himanything serious of coursenever dared to hope for it i have thrown myself at his head in the most shameless manner it is all no good i never met any one like him before louise do you know that he is goodreally good  i believe he is louise murmured that is what makes it so wonderful  its all incomprehensible sophy declared wearily  there was a ring at the front door louise from her place could see the long gray bonnet of johns car almost before she could speak he was announced  its an atrocious time to come i know he began apologetically  youre in time for some coffee anyhow sophy told him cheerfully and i know louise is glad to see you because if you hadnt come i was going to make her go through some accounts  you know i am always glad to see you louise murmured pointing to a chair sophy and i have been having a most interesting discussion but we have come to a culdesac  i really came john explained to ask if you cared to come and see a collection of pictures theres an italiana futurist of coursejust unpacked his little lot and set them up over a curiosityshop in clifford street he is sending out cards for next week but i could take you todaythat is if you would care about it we can go somewhere for some tea afterward  louise made a little grimace  what bad luck she exclaimed  she stopped short she felt that by her hesitation she had in a sense committed herself  i have promised to go and have tea with the prince at seyre house she said it is an engagement we made last week  john set down his empty coffeecup with a clatter an inexplicable but dominating fury seemed to have suddenly assailed him he took out a cigarette and tried to light it sophy after watching him for a moment in astonishment slipped out of the room louise came over to his side  are you really so much disappointed she asked i am so sorry if i had known that you were coming for me i would have kept myself free  it isnt that exactly john answered its something i cant altogether explain if you dont mind i think i will be going there is something i must put right  he left without another word she watched him step into his new motorcar and drive away a little recklessly considering the crowded state of the streets he drew up a few minutes later outside the club in pall mall where as it chanced he had lunched that day with the prince of seyre  he found the prince still sitting in the smoking room reading a review over the top of which he glanced up as john approached and nodded nonchalantly  back again he murmured  i came back to have a word with you prince  the prince laid down the review keeping his finger in the place  delighted  not long ago john went on in this room some onei think it was major chartersasked you what you were doing this afternoon you replied that you were engaged there were several others present and they began to chaff you perhaps i joined ini dont remember i think that it was major charters who asked you to use his own words whether your appointment was with a lady you replied in the affirmative there was a little volley of chaff you listened without contradiction to many references concerning the nature of your afternoons amusement  the prince nodded slightly his face remained quite expressionless  as a matter of fact john concluded i have discovered by the purest accident that miss maurel is to be your guest this afternoon at seyre house  the prince inclined his head gently he remained monosyllabic  well  john frowned heavily  cant you see he went on bluntly that if any one of those men who were present and heard what was said about your guest found out afterward that it was miss maurel who came to see youwell i need not go on need i i am sure you understand the things which were hinted at could not possibly apply to her would you mind sending a note to miss maurel and asking her to have tea with you some other afternoon  and why the deuce should i do that the prince asked a trifle paler but entirely selfpossessed  to oblige me john replied  the prince wiped his eyeglass carefully upon his handkerchief  mr strangewey you are a very amiable young man he said equably to whom i have tried to show some kindness for miss maurels sake i really do not see howeverpardon my putting it plainlywhat business this is of yours  it is my business john declared because i have asked miss maurel to be my wife and because i am hoping that some day before very long she will consent  the prince sat quite still in his chair his eyes fixed upon a certain spot in the carpet he had not even the appearance of being engaged in thought he seemed only steeped in a sort of passivity finally with a sigh he rose to his feet  my young friend he decided your statement alters the situation i did not credit you with matrimonial intentions i must see what can be done  his lips had relaxed ever so slightlyso slightly that they showed only a glimpse of his teeth in one straight hard line he looked at john mildly and his words seemed destitute of all offense yet john felt that the lightnings were playing around them  i shall write a note to miss maurel the prince promised as he made his way toward the writingtable and ask her to visit me upon some other afternoon                                       xxix   back again to his rooms and later on once more to louises little house in kensington a few minutes masterful pleading and then success louise wrapped herself up and descended to the street by his side  for an hour or more john drove steadily westward scarcely speaking more than a chance word it was twilight when he brought the car to a standstill louise raised her veil and looked up  well she asked inquiringly  he pushed back the throttle on his steeringwheel and stopped the engine then he turned toward her  i have something to say to you he said i have brought you here that i may say it in my own way and in my own atmosphere  she responded instantly to his mood although she did not yet grasp the full significance of the situation she leaned forward in the car and her eyes were lighted with interest into their faces a slight drizzling rain was carried at intervals by a gusty north wind the sky was murky gray except for one black mass of cloud that seemed bending almost over their heads  down at their feetthey had made a circuit and were facing london againbegan the long lines of feeble lights which lit the great avenues stretching onward to the city the lights of suburban thoroughfares of local railways and here and there a more brilliant illumination of some picture palace or place of amusement farther away still the vast glow from the heart of the city was beginning to flare against the murky skyhere red and threatening as if from some great conflagration in other places yellow with a sicklier light of fogstrangled brilliance  this is like you louise murmured you had to bring me out to a hilltop on the dreariest hour of a wet march afternoon to tell mewhat  first of all john began i will answer a question which you have asked me three times since we started out this afternoon you wanted to know how i found out that you were not going to tea with the prince well here is the truth i asked the prince to change the day of your visit to him  her fine silky eyebrows came a little closer together  you asked him that she repeated  john nodded  and he consented  i will explain john continued it was a most unfortunate circumstance but in the club after lunch the subject of spending the afternoon came up the prince spoke of an engagement he was tied at home he said from four to six some of the men began to chaff him and suggested that he was entertaining some lady friend his latest favoritewell i dare say you can imagine the rest john broke off the prince thoughtlessly i am sure and probably to get rid of them pleaded guilty then i came down to see you and from what you said i discovered that it was you who were to be his visitor  her fingers played nervously for a moment with the edge of the rug she drew it higher up  well when i left your house the first time this afternoon i went straight back to the prince i pointed out to him that after what had been said as it might become known that you were his guest of today it would be better for him to postpone your visit he agreed to do so  was that all that passed between you  not quite john replied he asked me what concern it was of mine and i told him exactly what my concern was i told him i hoped that some day you would be my wife  she sat quite still looking down upon the flaring lights she was filled with a restless desire to escape to start the motor herself and rush through the wet air into london and safety and side by side with that desire she knew that there was nothing in the world she wanted so much as to stay just where she was and to hear just the words she was going to hear  so much for that john proceeded and now please listen i have brought you out here because under these conditions i feel more master of myself and my thoughts and of the things i want to say to you something takes me by the throat in your little drawingroom with its shaded lights its perfume of flowers and its atmosphere of perfection you sit enthroned there like the queen of a world i know nothing of and all the time letters and flowers and flattering invitations are showered upon you from the greatest men in london the atmosphere there stifles me louise out here you are a woman and i a man and those other things fall away i have tried my best to come a little way into sympathy with your life i want you now to make up your mind to come down a little way into mine  she shook her head  we are still too far apart she murmured cant you understand that yourself  i have been a pupil for many months he answered turning toward her with one arm at the back of her cushions and the fingers of the other hand suddenly seeking hers cant you understand if you do care a little if you have just a little flame of love in your heart for me that many of these other things which keep us apart are like the limelight which flashes out to give artificial light in an honest darkness dont you believe at the bottom of your heart that you can be happier if you will climb with me to the place where we first met even where the clouds lean over my own hills you thought me very narrow then perhaps i am but i think you are beginning to understand dear that that life is only a type we can wander about where you will my hills are only the emblems of the things that are dear to me there are many countries i want to visit i dont want to cramp your life you cant really be afraid of that because it is the most widening thing in the world that i have to give youmy love the love of my heart and my soul  she felt the sudden snapping of every nerve in her body the passing away of all sense of will or resistance she was conscious only of the little movement toward him the involuntary yielding of herself she lay back in his arms and the kisses which closed her eyes and lips seemed to be working some strange miracle  she was in some great empty space breathing wonderful things she was on the hilltops and from the heights she looked down at herself as she had beena poor little whitefaced puppet strutting about an overheated stage in a fetid atmosphere of adulation with a brain artificially stimulated and a heart growing cold with selfishness she pitied herself as she had been then she opened her eyes with a start of joy  how wonderful it all is she murmured you brought me here to tell me this  and to hear something he insisted  i have tried not to john she confessed amazed at the tremble of her sweet low voice her words seemed like the confession of a weeping child i cannot help it i do love you i have tried not to so hard but nownow i shall not try any more  they drove quietly down the long hill and through the dripping streets not another word passed between them till they drew up outside her door she felt a new timidity as he handed her out an immense gratitude for his firm tone and intuitive tact  no i wont come in thanks he declared you have so little time to rest and get ready for the theater  you will be there tonight she asked  he laughed as if there were humor in the suggestion of his absence  of course  he slipped in his clutch and drove off through the raingleaming streets with the smile and air of a conqueror louise passed into her little house to find a visitor waiting for her there                                       xxx   eugène prince of seyre had spent the early part of that afternoon in a manner wholly strange to him in pursuance of an order given to his majordomo immediately on his return from the club after lunch the great reception rooms of seyre house the picturegallery and the ballroom were prepared as if for a reception dustsheets were swept aside masterpieces of painting and sculpture were uncovered the soft brilliance of concealed electric lights lit up many dark corners  when all was ready the prince with his hands clasped behind him with expressionless face and slow thoughtful movements passed from room to room of the treasurehouse which had come to him through a long line of distinguished and famous men here and there he paused to handle with the fingers of a connoisseur some excellent piece of bronze statuary some miracle of sèvres china some treasure of carved ivory yellow with age and more than once he stood still for several minutes in rapt contemplation of one of the great masterpieces with which the walls were hung  as he passed a solitary figure from one to another of that long chain of lofty palatial rooms his stature seemed more than ever insignificant yet he walked always with the dignity of the master notwithstanding the slight excesses of his immaculate morning dress his pallid features his insignificant build he appeared to belong to these things to dominate them to understand them every beautiful object upon which he looked brought back to his memory some reminiscence of his years of travel he knew the history of the chinas and the bronzes the statuary and the lacquerwork the friezes and the great pictures which adorned his house perhaps he thought as he paused to study some italian tapestry of his own discovery he had spent too many years in the contemplative life  there had been many careers open to him in his younger days france was still his own country and he might easily have joined the long line of soldiers whose portraits filled one side of the picturegallery once he had had ambitions either to wield the sword or to take his place in the world of diplomacy it was his political inheritance which had deadened them the awful debt of blood that he still owed to the enemies of his race he had found the spirit of patriotism dead within him and in that day he had turned his back upon his country since then he had carried his great name through the pleasure places of the world always upholding its dignity perhaps but never adding to its luster  he was fortyone years old that day and the few words which john had spoken to him barely an hour ago had made him realize that there was only one thing in life that he desired the sight of his treasures merely soothed his vanity it left empty and unsatisfied his fuller and deeper desire of living he told himself that his time had come others of his race had paid a great price for the things they had coveted in life he too must follow their example  he was in louises drawingroom when she returnedlouise with hair and cheeks a little damp but with a wonderful light in her eyes and with footsteps that seemed to fall upon air  some tea and a bath this moment aline she called out as she ran lightly up the stairs never mind about dinner i am so late i will have some toast be quick  madame aline began  dont bother me about anything now louise interrupted i will throw my things off while you get the bath ready  she stepped into her little room throwing off her cloak as she entered then she stopped short almost upon the threshold the prince had risen to his feet  eugène  he came toward her even as he stooped to kiss her fingers his eyes seemed to take in her disheveled condition the little patches of color in her cheeks the radiant happiness which shone in her eyes  i am not an unwelcome intruder i hope he said but how wet you are  the fingers which he released fell nervelessly to her side she stood looking at him as if confronted with a sudden nightmare it was as if this newfound life were being slowly drained from her veins  you are overtired he murmured leading her with solicitude toward an easy chair one would imagine from your appearance that i was the bearer of some terrible tidings let me assure you that it is not so  he spoke with his usual deliberation but she seemed powerless to recover herself she was still dazed and white she sank into the chair and looked at him  nothing i trust he went on has happened to disturb you  nothing at all she declared hastily i am tired i ran upstairs perhaps a little too quickly aline had not told me that there was any one here  i had a fancy to see you this afternoon the prince explained and finding you out i took the liberty of waiting if you would rather i went away and came for you later please do not hesitate to say so  of course not she exclaimed i do not know why i should have been so silly aline take my coat and veil she directed turning to the maid who was lingering at the other end of the room i am not wet serve some tea in here i will have my bath later when i change to go to the theater  she spoke bravely but fear was in her heart she tried to tell herself that this visit was a coincidence that it meant nothing but all the time she knew otherwise  the door closed behind aline and they were alone the prince as if anxious to give her time to recover herself walked to the window and stood for some moments looking out when he turned around louise had at least nerved herself to meet what she felt was imminent  the prince approached her deliberately she knew what he was going to say  louise he began drawing a chair to her side i have found myself thinking a great deal about you during the last few weeks  she did not interrupt him she simply waited and watched  i have come to a certain determination he proceeded one which if you will grace it with your approval will give me great happiness i ask you to forget certain things which have passed between us i have come to you today to beg you to do me the honor of becoming my wife  she turned her head very slowly until she was looking him full in the face her lips were a little parted her eyes a little strained the prince was leaning toward her in a conventional attitude his words had been spoken simply and in his usual conversational manner there was something about him however profoundly convincing  your wife louise repeated  if you will do me that great honor  it seemed at first as if her nerves were strained to the breakingpoint the situation was one with which her brain seemed unable to grapple she set her teeth tightly then she had a sudden interlude of wonderful clearsightedness she was almost cool  you must forgive my surprise eugène she begged we have known each other now for some twelve years have we notand i believe that this is the first time you have ever hinted at anything of the sort  one gathers wisdom perhaps with the years he replied i am fortyone years old today i have spent the early hours of this afternoon in reflection and behold the result  you have spoken to me before she said slowly of different things you have offered me a great deal in life but never your name i do not understand this sudden change  louise he declared if i do not tell you the truth now you will probably guess it besides this is the one time in their lives when a man and a woman should speak nothing but the truth it is for fear of losing youthat is why  her selfcontrol suddenly gave way she threw herself back in her chair she began to laugh and stopped abruptly the tears streaming from her eyes the prince leaned forward he took her hands in his but she drew them away  you are too late eugène she said i almost loved you i was almost yours to do whatever you liked with but somehow somewhere notwithstanding all your worldly knowledge and mine we missed it we do not know the truth about life you and iat least you do not and i did not  he rose very slowly to his feet there was no visible change in his face save a slight whitening of the cheeks  and the sequel to this he asked  i have promised to marry john strangewey she told him  that he replied is impossible i have a prior claim  the light of battle flamed suddenly in her eyes her nervousness had gone she was a strong woman face to face with him now taller than he seeming indeed to tower over him in the splendor of her anger she was like a lioness threatened with the loss of the one dear thing  assert it then she cried defiantly do what you will go to him this minute if you have courage enough if it seems to you well claim indeed right i have the one right every woman in the world possessesto give herself body and soul to the man she loves that is the only claim and the only right i recognize and i am giving myself to him when he wants me forever  she stopped suddenly neither of them had heard a discreet knock at the door aline had entered with the tea there was a moment of silence  put it down here by my side aline her mistress ordered and show the prince of seyre out  aline held the door open for a single moment the prince hesitated then he picked up his hat and bowed  perhaps he said this may not be the last word                                       xxxi   jennings stood with a decanter in his hand looking resentfully at his masters untasted wine he shook his head ponderously not only was the wine untouched but the cumberland times lay unopened upon the table grim and severe in his highbacked chair stephen strangewey sat with his eyes fixed upon the curtained window  theres nothing wrong with the wine i hope sir the man asked its not corked or anything sir  nothing is the matter with it stephen answered bring me my pipe  jennings shook his head firmly  theres no call for you sir he declared to drop out of your old habits you shall have your pipe when youve drunk that glass of port and not before bless me theres the paper by your side all unread and full of news for ive glanced it through myself corn was higher yesterday at market ketton and theres talk of a bad shortage of fodder in some parts  stephen raised his glass to his lips and drained its contents  now bring me my pipe jennings he ordered  the old man was still disposed to grumble  drinking wine like that as if it were some publichouse stuff he muttered as he crossed the room toward the sideboard its more a night this to my way of thinking for drinking a second glass of wine than for shillyshallying with the first theres the wind coming across townley moor and down the fells strong enough to blow the rocks out of the ground it minds me of the time mr john was out with the territorials and they tried the moor for their big guns  the rain lashed the windowpanes and the wind whistled past the front of the house stephen sat quite still as if listeningit may have been to the storm  well heres your pipe sir jennings continued laying it by his masters side and your tobacco and the matches if youd smoke less and drink a glass or two more of the right stuff it would be more to my liking  stephen filled his pipe with firm fingers then he laid it down unlit by his side  bring me back the port jennings he ordered and a glass for yourself  jennings obeyed promptly stephen filled both glasses and the two men looked at each other as they held them out  heres confusion to all women stephen said as he raised his to his lips  amen sir jennings muttered  they set down the two empty glasses stephen lit his pipe he sat smoking stolidly blowing out great clouds of smoke jennings retreated coughing resentfully  spoils the taste of good wine that tobacco do he snapped good port like that should be left to lie upon the palate so to speak bless me whats that  above the roar of the wind came another and unmistakable sound the front door had been opened and shut there were steps upon the stone floor of the hallfirm familiar steps  jennings with his mouth open stood staring at the door stephen slowly turned his head the hand which held his pipe was as firm as a rock but there was a queer little gleam of expectation in his eyes then the door was thrown open and john entered the rain was dripping from his clothes he was breathless from his struggle with the elements  the two other men looked at him fixedly they both realized the same thing at the same momentthere was no trace of the returned prodigal in johns countenance or in his buoyant expression the tenmile ride seemed to have brought back all his color  master john jennings faltered  stephen said nothing john crossed the room and gripped his brothers hand  wet through to the skin and starving he declared i thought id find something at ketton but it was all i could do to get gibson at the george to lend me a horse give me a glass of wine jennings ill change my clothesi expect youve kept them aired  not a word of explanation concerning his sudden return nor did either of the two ask any questions they set the bell clanging in the stableyard and found shelter for the borrowed horse presently in dry clothes john sat down to a plentiful meal his brother watched him with a grim smile  you havent forgotten how to eat in london john he remarked  if i had a tenmile ride on a night like this would help me to remember hows the land doing  things are backward the snow lay late and weve had drying winds  and the stock  moderate we are short of heifers but you didnt come back from london to ask about the farm  john pushed back his plate and drew his chair opposite to his brothers  i did not he assented i came back to tell you my news  i was thinking that might be it stephen muttered  john crossed the room found his pipe in a drawer filled it with tobacco and lit it  old man he said as he returned to his place its all very well for you and old jennings to put your heads together every night and drink confusion to all women but you know very well that if there are to be any more strangeweys at peak hall either you or i must marry  stephen moved uneasily in his chair  if youre going to marry that woman he began  i am going to marry louise maurel john interrupted firmly stephen listen to me for a moment before you say another word please it is all settled she has promised to be my wife i dont forget what weve been to each other i dont forget the old name and the old tradition but i have been fortunate enough to meet a woman whom i love and i am going to marry her dont speak hurriedly stephen think whatever you will but keep it to yourself some day i shall expect you to give me your hand and tell me you are glad  stephen knocked the ashes deliberately from his pipe  i will tell you this much now he said i had rather that we strangeweys died out that the roof dropped off peak hall and the walls stood naked to the sky than that this woman should be your wife and the mother of your children  let it go at that then stephen john replied it is enough for me to say that i will not take it ill from you because you do not know her  but i do know her stephen answered perhaps she didnt tell you that i paid her a visit  you paid her a visit  aye that i did she wouldnt tell you therell be many a thing in life she wont tell you i went to let her hear from my lips what i thought of her as a wife for you i told her what i thought of a woman who plays the part of a wanton  stephen john thundered  the part of an adulterous wife upon the stage for every man and woman who pay their silver to go and gape at it seems i did no goodno good that is if she has promised to marry you  john drew a breath his task was harder even than he had imagined all the time he tried to keep one thought fixed in his mind stephen was his elder brother it was stephen who had been his guardian and his guide through all his youth he thought of stephens fifty odd years of simple and strenuous living of his charity of his strengththat very strength which had kept him in the narrow way which had kept him from looking to the right or to the left in his walk through life  stephen john said you are growing harder with the years was there never a time when you were younger when you were my age when you felt differently toward women  never thank heaven stephen replied i was too near the sorrow that fell upon our house when our father died with a broken heart there were the other two as wellone with a bullet in his brain the other a drunkard maybe when i was your age i felt at times what i suppose you feel well i just took it in both hands and strangled it if you must have a sweetheart why dont you take the little fairhaired girlsophy you called her shed do you as little harm as any of them  because it is not a sweetheart of that sort i want john protested vigorously ive had the same feelings as most men i suppose but ive fought my battle out to the end only for a different reason i want a wife and i want children  will she bring you children that woman stephen asked bitterly  i hope so john asserted simply i believe so  there was a moments silence stephen lit his pipe and puffed steadily at it his eyes fixed upon the log that blazed on the hearth  there is a muzzle upon my mouth he said presently there are words close to my lips which would part you and me so ill say no more go your own way john ill ask you but one more question and you must take that as man from man brother from brother how old is she  twentyseven  and she has been an actress playing parts like the one i saw her in for how long  since she was nineteen john replied  and you believe shes a good woman  john gripped at the sides of his chair with a tremendous effort he kept the torrent of words from his lips  i know she is he answered calmly  has she told you so  a man has no need to put such a question to the woman he cares for  then you havent asked her  john laid down his pipe and rose to his feet he gripped his brother by the arm  stephen he said its a hard fight for me this to sit face to face with you and know what you are thinking with the love for this woman strong and sweet in my heart you dont understand stephen youre a long way from understanding but you are my brother dont make it too hard i am not a child believe in me i would not take any woman to be my wife and the mother of my children who was not a good woman i am off tomorrow morning stephen i came all the way just on an impulse because i felt that i must tell you myself it would be one of the best things in the world to ride that ten miles back again tomorrow morning to have told you how things are to have felt your hand in mine and to know that there was no shadow of misunderstanding between us  stephen too rose to his feet they stood together before the fire  man to man john stephen said as he gripped his brother by the hands i love you this moment as i always have done and as i always shall do and if this thing must be between us ill say but one last word and youll take it from me even though i am the only man on earth youd take it from before you marry ask her                                      xxxii   john went back to town telling himself that all had gone as well as he had expected he had done his duty he had told stephen his news and they had parted friends yet all the time he was conscious of an undercurrent of disconcerting thoughts  louise met him at the station and he fancied that her expression too although she welcomed him gaily enough was a little anxious  well she asked as she took his arm and led him to where her motorcar was waiting what did that terrible brother of yours say  john made a little grimace  it might have been worse he declared stephen wasnt pleased of course he hates women like poison and he always will that is because he doesnt know very much about them and because he will insist upon dwelling upon certain unhappy incidents of our family history  i shall never forget the morning he came to call on me louise sighed he threatened all sorts of terrible things if i did not give you up  why didnt you tell me about it john asked  i thought it might worry you she replied and it couldnt do any good he believed he was doing his duty john you are sure about yourself arent you  come and have tea with me in my rooms and ill tell you he laughed  just what id planned to do she assented with a sigh of content its too late to go home and get back to the theater comfortably  the theater john murmured a few minutes later when they were seated in his comfortable little sitting room and he had ordered tea do you know that i grudge those three or four hours of your day  i believe i do too she admitted and yet a little while ago it was my only pleasure in life dont sit over there please you are much too far away closer still let me feel your arms you are strong and brave arent you john you would not let any one take me away from you  he was a little startled by the earnestness of her words she seemed pale and fragile her eyes larger and deeper than usual and her mouth tremulous she was like a child with the shadow of some fear hanging over her he laughed and held her tightly to him  there is nothing that could take you awayyou know that quite well there is nobody in the world whom you need fear for a single moment if you have troubles i am here to share them if you have enemies you can leave me to dispose of them  i think she murmured that i am in an emotional frame of mind today i am not often like this you know i woke this morning feeling so happy and then all of a sudden i couldnt somehow believe in itin myself i felt it slip away you wont let it slip away john  never a chance he promised confidently look at me do i seem like a person to be easily got rid of what you need is a holiday and you need it badly we havent made any plans yet have we i wonder whether we could break your contract at the theater  we must talk to graillot she said there is a little frenchwoman over here now i once saw her act in paris and i am sure she could play thérèse wonderfully but dont lets talk seriously any longer just let us sit here and talk nonsense  have you told any of your friends yet louisethe prince for instance  he had asked this question on his way across the room to ring the bell there was no reply and when he turned around a moment or two later he was almost frightened louise was sitting quite still but the color seemed to have been drained from her cheeks her eyes were filled with some expression which he did not wholly understand he only knew that they were calling him to her side and he promptly obeyed the summons her head fell upon his shoulder her arms were locked about his neck  john she sobbed i do not know what is the matter with me i am hysterical dont ask me any questions dont talk to me hold me like you are doing now and listen i love you johndo you understandi love you  her lips sought his and clung to them a queer little wave of passion seemed to have seized her half crying half laughing she pressed her face against his i do not want to act tonight i do not want to play even to the most wonderful audience in the world i do not want to shake hands with many hundreds of people at that hateful reception i think i want nothing else in the world but you  she lay for a moment passive in his arms he smoothed her hair and kissed her tenderly then he led her back to her place upon the couch her emotional mood while it flattered him in a sense did nothing to quiet the little demons of unrest that pulled every now and then at his heartstrings  what is this reception he asked  she made a little grimace  it is a formal welcome from the english stage to the french company that has come over to play at the new french theater she told him sir edward and i are to receive them you will come will you not  i havent an invitation he told her  invitation i invite you i am the hostess of the evening  then i am not likely to refuse am i he asked smiling shall i come to the theater  come straight to the reception at the whitehall rooms she begged sir edward is calling for me and graillot will go down with us later if you care to you can drive me home  dont you think he suggested that it would be rather a good opportunity to announce our engagement  not tonight she pleaded you know i cannot seem to believe it myself except when i am with you and we are alone it seems too wonderful after all these years do you know john that i am nearly thirty  he laughed  how pathetic all the more reason i should say why we should let people know about it as soon as possible  there is no particular hurry she said a little nervously let me get used to it myself i dont think you will have to wait long everything i have been used to doing and thinking seems to be crumbling up around me last night i even hated my work or at least part of it  his eyes lit up with genuine pleasure  i cant tell you how glad i am to hear you say that he declared i dont hate your workive got over that i dont think i am narrow about it i admire graillot and his play is wonderful but i think and i always shall think that the dénouement in that third act is damnable  she nodded understandingly  i am beginning to realize how you must feel she confessed we wont talk about it any more now drive me to the theater will you i want to be there early tonight just to get everything ready for changing afterward  the telephonebell rang as they were leaving the room john put the receiver to his ear and a moment later held it away  it is sophy he announced shall i tell them to send her up  sophy indeed louise exclaimed i thought she was in the country on tour and was not expected back until tomorrow  i thought she went away for a week john said but there she is waiting downstairs  louise hesitated for a moment then she came over to john with a tremulous little smile at the corners of her lips  dear she said i am in a strange frame of mind today i dont want even to see sophy tell them to send her up here she can wait for you while you take me out the other way  may i tell her john asked as he rang for the lift she has been such a good little pal  once more louise seemed to hesitate a vague look of trouble clouded her face  perhaps you had better dear she agreed spiritlessly only tell her not to breathe it to another soul it is to be our secret for a little timenot longjust a day or two longer  the gates of the lift swung open and john raised her fingers to his lips  it is for you to say dear he promised  when he came back to his room sophy was curled up on the couch with a cigarette between her lips she looked at him severely  i am losing faith in you she declared there are signs of a hurried departure from this room there is a distinct perfume of roses about the place you have always told me that i am the only visitor of my sex you allow here i am fiercely jealous tell me what this teatray and the empty cups mean  it means louise he answered smiling she has just this moment gone away  sophy sighed with an air of mock relief  louise i suppose i must tolerate she said fancy her coming here to tea with you though  i have been up to cumberland for a day he told her and louise came to meet me at the station  how is your angel brother she asked did he ask after me  he did mention you john confessed i dont remember any direct message though you want a cocktail of course dont you  dying for it she admitted i have had such a dull week weve been playing in wretched little places and last night the show went bust the manager presented us with our fares home this morning we were only down in surrey so here i am  well im glad to see you back again john told her after he had ordered the cocktails louise has been quite lost without you too  i didnt want to go away she sighed but i do get so tired of not working although my part wasnt worth anything i hated it being cut out it makes one feel so aimless one has too much time to think  he laughed at her pleasantly but derisively  time to think he repeated why i have never seen you serious for five minutes in your life except when youve been adding up louises housekeepingbooks  she threw her cigarette into the grate swung round toward him and looked steadily into his face  havent you she said i can be i often am it isnt my correct pose though people dont like me serious if they take me out or entertain me they think they are being cheated if i am not continually gay you see what it is to have a reputation for being amusing louise keeps me by her side to talk nonsense to her to keep her from being depressed men take me out because i am bright because i save them the trouble of talking and they dont feel quite so stupid with me as with another woman my young man at bath wants to marry me for the same reason he thinks it would be so pleasant to have me always at hand to chatter nonsense that is why you like me too you have been pitched into a strange world you are not really in touch with it you like to be with some one who will talk nonsense and take you a little way out of it i am just a little fool you see a harmless little creature in cap and bells whom every one amuses himself with  john stared at her for a moment only half understanding  why little girl he exclaimed i believe youre in earnest  i am in deadly earnest she assured him her voice breaking a little dont take any notice of me i have had a wretched week and its a rotten world anyway  there was a knock at the door and the waiter entered with the cocktails  come john said as he took one from the tray i will tell you some news that will give you something to think about i hope that you will be gladi feel sure that you will i want you to be the first to drink our healthslouises and mine  the glass slipped through her fingers and fell upon the carpet she never uttered even an exclamation john was upon his knees picking up the broken glass  my fault he insisted i am so sorry sophy i am afraid some of the stuff has gone on your frock looks as if youll have to take me out shopping ill ring for another cocktail  he rose to his feet and stepped toward the bell then it suddenly occurred to him that as yet she had not spoken he turned quickly around  sophy he exclaimed what is the matter arent you going to congratulate me  she was sitting bolt upright upon the couch her fingers buried in the cushions her eyes closed he moved quickly across toward her  i say sophy whats wrong he asked hastily arent you well  she waved him away  dont touch me she begged i went without my lunchnearly missed the train as it was i was feeling a little queer when i came and dropping that glass gave me a shock let me drink yours may i  he handed it to her and she drained its contents then she smiled up at him weakly  what a shame she said just as you were telling me your wonderful news i can scarcely believe ityou and louise  john sat down beside her  louise does not want it talked about for a day or two he observed we have not made any plans yet  is louise going to remain upon the stage  probably if she wishes it he replied but i want to travel first for a year or so before we settle definitely upon anything i did not think that you would be so much surprised sophy  perhaps i am not really she admitted one thinks of a thing as being possible for a long time and when it actually comeswell it takes you off your feet just the same you know she added slowly there are no two people in this world so far apart in their ways as you and louise  that is true from one point of view he confessed from another i think that there are no two people so close together of course it seems wonderful to me and i suppose it does to you sophy that she should care for a man of my type she is so brilliant and so talented such a woman of this latterday world the world of which i am about as ignorant as a man can be perhaps after all that is the real explanation of it each of us represents things new to the other  did you say that no one has been told yetno one at all  no one except stephen john assented that is why i went up to cumberland to tell him  you have not told the prince sophy asked dropping her voice a little louise has not told him  not that i know of why do you ask john inquired looking into sophys face  i dont know she answered it just occurred to me he and louise have known each other for such a long time and i wondered what he might have to say about it  john laid his hands upon the poisonous thoughts that had stolen once more into his blood and told himself that he had strangled them he swept them away and glanced at his watch  lets have some dinner before i change down in the grillroomin a quarter of an hours time say i dont want to be at the theater before the second act  sophy hesitated there was a hard feeling in her throat a burning at the back of her eyes she was passionately anxious to be alone yet she could not bring herself to refuse she could not deny herself or tear herself at once away from the close companionship which seemed somehow or other to have crept up between herself and john and to have become the one thing that counted in life  id love to she said but remember ive been traveling look at me i must either go home or you must let me go into your room  make yourself at home john invited i have three letters to write and some telephone messages to answer  sophy lit another cigarette and strolled jauntily through his suite of rooms when she was quite sure that she was alone however she closed the door behind her dropped her cigarette and staggered to the window she stood there gazing down into an alleyway six stories below where the people passing back and forth looked like dwarf creatures  one little movement forward no one could have been meant to bear pain like this she set her teeth  it would be so soon over  then she suddenly found that she could see nothing the people below were blurred images a rush of relief had come to her she sank into the nearest chair and sobbed                                      xxxiii   the reception in honor of the little company of french tragedians at which almost the whole of the english stage and a sprinkling of society people were present was a complete success louise made a charming hostess and sir edward more than ever justified his reputation for saying the right thing to the right person at the right moment the rooms were crowded with throngs of distinguished people who all seemed to have plenty to say to one another  the only person perhaps who found himself curiously ill at ease was john he heard nothing but french on all sides of hima language which he read with some facility but which he spoke like a schoolboy he had been wandering about for more than an hour before louise discovered him she at once left her place and crossed the room to where he was standing by the wall  cheer up she begged with a delightful smile i am afraid that you are being bored to death will you not come and be presented to our guests  for goodness sake no john implored i have never seen one of them act and my french is appalling i am all right dear its quite enough pleasure to see you looking so beautiful and to think that i am going to be allowed to drive you home afterward  louise looked into a neighboring mirror and gazed critically at her own reflected image the lines of her figure fine and subtle seemed traced by the finger of some great sculptor underneath her faultlessly made whitesatin gown she studied her white neck and shoulders and her perfectly shaped head seeking everywhere for some detail with which an impartial critic might find fault  she had a curious feeling that at that precise moment she had reached the zenith of her power and her charm her audience at the theater had been wonderfully sympathetic had responded with rare appreciation to every turn of her voice to every movement and gesture the compliments too which she had been receiving from the crowds who had bent over her fingers that night had been no idle words many distinguished men had looked at her with a light in their eyes which women understand so wella light questioning yet respectful which provokes yet begs for something in the way of response  she was conscious acutely conscious of the atmosphere she had created around her she was glorying in the subtle outward signs of it she was in love with herself in love too with this delightful new feeling of loving it would have given her more joy than anything else in the world in that moment of her triumph to have passed her arm through johns to have led him up to them all and to have said  after all you see i am a very simple sort of woman i have done just the sort of simple thing that other women do and i am glad of itvery glad and very happy  her lips moved to the music of her thoughts john leaned toward her  did you say anything he asked  you dear stupid of course i did not or if i did it was just one of those little whispers to oneself which mean nothing yet which count for so much can i not do anything to make you enjoy yourself more i shall have to go back to my guests now we are expecting a royal personage and those two dears who keep so close to my side do not speak a word of english  please go back dear john begged promptly it was nice of you to come at all and heres sophy at last thank goodness now i am all right  she laid her fingers upon his arm  you must take me back to my place she said then you can go and talk nonsense to sophy i wont even ask you what she said when you told her the news i suppose you did tell her  of course  she glanced at him swiftly his reply had sounded a little lame but they were back in the crowd now and she dismissed him with a little nod he made his way quickly to the spot where he had seen sophy to his disappointment she had disappeared graillot however came up and seized him by the arm  still playing the moth my young friend he exclaimed arent the wings sufficiently burned yet  i am afraid its become a permanent rôle john replied as the two men shook hands where have you been all these weeks and why havent you been to see me  paris my dear young friendparis and life now i am back againi am not sure that i know why i came over with these french people to see them start their theater forgive me i have not paid my respects to our hostess we shall meet again presently  he strolled off and a few minutes later john found sophy  how late you are he grumbled  i couldnt help it she answered this is the only evening dress i possess at present and i had to mend it before it was decent to come out in why are you wandering about alone hasnt louise been kind to you  she has been charming john declared promptly but she is surrounded with all sorts of people i dont know i cant help her for one thing my french is absurd then they are all talking about things which i dont understand in the least  sophy remained silent for a moment then she took johns arm and led him to the buffet  give me an ice and a cigarette will you please you are a dear impractical person but you are as much out of this world as a human being well could be  john waited upon her without any further remark the prince of seyre passing through bowed to them john looked after his retreating figure an irresistible impulse seized him  sophy he asked sitting down by her side tell me why have the prince and louise always been such great friends  sophy looked steadfastly at her ice  i suppose because the prince is a very clever and cultivated person she said he has been of great assistance to louise several times it was he who financed miles faraday when he put on this play of graillots graillot hasnt a penny you know and poor miles was almost broke after three failures  that was just an investment john remarked irritably he will get his money back again  of course sophy agreed i think the prince generally manages to get value for what he does in life  you dont think louise ever thought of caring for him do you john persisted  sophy paused until she had lit a cigarette the expression in her face when she looked up at john irritated him vaguely it was as if she were talking to a child  i think she said you had better ask louise that question yourself dont you                                       he asked it an hour or so later when at last the party of guests had taken their leave and somewhat to the wellbred surprise of the one or two friends who lingered louise had beckoned to john to take her out to her car her hand had sought his at once her head rested a little wearily but very contentedly upon his shoulder  louise dear he began i asked sophy a question tonight which i ought to have asked you quite properly she told me so  nice little soul sophy louise murmured what was it john  once or twice i have wondered he went on whether you have ever cared in any sort of way or come near to caring for the prince of seyre  for a moment she made no movement then she turned her head and looked at him the sleepy content had gone from her eyes  why do you ask  isnt it quite a natural question from a jealous man who believes that every one who sees you must be in love with you you have seen a great deal of the prince havent you in the last few years he understands your art there are many things that you and he have in common  louise was looking out of the window at the thin stream of people still passing along piccadilly she seemed suddenly to have become only the shadow of her former brilliant self  i think that onceperhaps twice she confessed i came very near to caring for him  and now  and now she repeated suddenly gripping johns hands i tell you that i am very much nearer hating him so much for the prince in ten minutes we shall be at home and you are such a dear stupid about coming in you must try to say all the nice things in the world to me quicklyin ten minutes  how shall i begin he whispered  she leaned once more toward him  you dont need any hints she murmured youre really quite good at it                                      xxxiv   the ten minutes passed very much too quickly she was gone and john thrilled though he was through all his senses by the almost passionate fervor of her leavetaking found himself once more confronted by that little black demon he sat up in the car which bore him quickly back toward his rooms and although the sense of her presence the delicate perfume the empty place by his side even a fallen flower from her gown were still there the unrest seemed sharper  there was something about all of them all these people whom he knew to be his friends which seemed to him to savor of a conspiracy one by one they flitted through his braingraillots covert warning sophys plaintive almost fearful doubts the princes subtle yet cynical silence and behind it all stephens brutal and outspoken words there was nothing that could be put into definite shapejust the ghost of torturing impossible thoughts john told himself that it must be ended even though the words should blister his tongue with shame they must be spoken  a moment later he hated himself for the thought he set his teeth filled his thought with the glory of her presence and crushed those demoniacal suggestions to the back of his brain he was in no humor to go home however changing the order he had first given to the chauffeur he was driven instead to a small bohemian club which he had joined at graillots instigation he had a vague hope that he might find the great dramatist there there were no signs of him however in the smoking room or any one else whom john knew  he threw himself into an easy chair and ordered a whiskyandsoda two men close at hand were writing at desks others were lounging about discussing the evenings reception one man sitting upon the table a recognized authority was treating the company to a fluent dissertation upon modern actresses winding up by contrasting louise maurels style with that of her chief french rival john found himself listening with pleased interest the mans opinion was certainly not unfavorable to louise  it is only in the finer shades of emotionalism the critic declared that these french actresses get at us a little more completely even than louise maurel do you know the reason ill tell you it is because they live the life they have a dozen new emotions in a season they make a cult of feeling they use their brains to dissect their passions they cut their own life into small pieces and give us the result without concealment that is where they score if anywhere this mme latrobe who opens over here tomorrow night is living at the present moment with jean tourbet she had an affair with that italian poet in the summer so they tell me she was certainly in madrid in october with bretoldi the sculptor these men are all great artists think what she must have learned from associating with them now louise maurel so far as we know has never had but one lover the prince of seyre and has been faithful to him all the time  it was out at last john had heard it spoken in plain words the black demon upon which his hand had lain so heavily was alive now without a doubt jeering at him mocking at himalive and selfassertive in the sober words of the elderly wellbred man who lounged upon the table  for a moment or two john was stunned a wild impulse assailed him to leap up and confront them all to choke the lie back down the throat of the man who had uttered it every nerve in his body was tingling with the desire for action the stupor of his senses alone kept him motionless and a strange incomprehensible clarity of thought he realized exactly how things were this man had not spoken idly or as a scandalmonger he had spoken what he had accepted as a fact what other people believed  john rose to his feet and made his way toward the door his face showed little sign of disturbance he even nodded to some men whom he knew slightly as he passed down the stairs he met graillot then once more the selfcontrol became in danger he seized the frenchman savagely by the arm  come this way he said leading him toward the cardroom come in here i want to speak to you  he locked the doora most unheardof and irregular proceeding graillot felt the coming of the storm  well he exclaimed grimly trouble already eh i see it in your face young man out with it  johnwho had won a hard match at rackets a few days before against a more experienced opponent simply because of his perfect conditionwas breathing hard there was a dull patch of color in his cheek drops of sweat stood upon his forehead he controlled his voice with difficulty its tone was sharp and unfamiliar  i was sitting in the smoking room there a few moments ago he began jerking his head toward the door there were some men talkingdecent fellows not dirty scandalmongers they spoke of louise maurel  graillot nodded gravely he knew very well what was coming  well  they spoke also of the prince of seyre  well  john felt his throat suddenly dry the words he would have spoken choked him he banged his fist upon the table by the side of which they were standing  look here graillot he cried almost piteously you know it is not true not likely to be true cant you say so  stop my young friend the frenchman interrupted i know nothing it is a habit of mine to know nothing when people make suggestions of that sort i make no inquiries i accept life and people as i find them  but you dont believe that such a thing could be possible  why not graillot asked steadily  john could do no more than mumble a repetition of his words the world was falling away from him he was dimly conscious that one of the engravings upon the wall opposite was badly hung for the rest graillots face stern yet pitying seemed to loom like the features of a giant eclipsing everything else  i will not discuss this matter with you my friend i will only ask you to remember the views of the world in which we live louise maurel is an artist a great artist if there has been such an affair as you suggest between her and any man if it were something which appealed to her affections it is my opinion that she would not hesitate you seem to think it an outrageous thing that the prince should have been her lover to be perfectly frank i do not i should be very much more surprised at her marriage  john made his escape somehow he remembered opening the door but he had no recollection of reaching the street a few minutes later however he found himself striding down piccadilly toward hyde park corner  the night was warm and there were still plenty of people about a woman touched his arm her hackneyed greeting filled him with inexpressible horror he stared at her barely conscious of what he was doing filled with an indescribable sickness of heart  you look about done up she said in friendly fashion come round to my flat and have a drink you neednt stay if you dont want to  he muttered something and passed on a moment or two later however he retraced his steps out of the horror of his thought had come an irresistible impulse he slipped some gold into her hand  please take this and go home he enjoined go home at once get out of the streets and hide yourself  she stared at him and at the money  why ive only just come out she protested all the same im dead tired ill go walk with me wont you you look as if you wanted looking after  im all right he answered you go home  she slipped the money carefully into her purse and hailed a taxi  you shall have your own way she declared cant i drop you anywhere  he raised his hat and once more swinging around passed on his way presently he found himself in the street where louise lived he looked at his watchit was twenty minutes to three oclock  the house was in solemn darkness he stood and looked up at it there was no sign of a light not even from the top windows its silence seemed to him more than the silence of sleep he found himself wondering whether it was really inhabited whether there were really human souls in this quiet corner waiting peacefully for the dawn heedless of the torment which was tearing his soul to pieces perhaps behind that drawn blind louise herself was awake perhaps she was thinking looking back into the past wondering about the future he took a step toward the gate  are you going in there sir  he turned quickly around a policeman had flashed a lantern upon him john suddenly became intensely matteroffact  no he replied it is too late i am afraid i see that they have all gone to bed any chance of a taxi about here  most likely youll find one at the corner the policeman pointed out theres a rank there and one or two of them generally stay late very much obliged sir  john had slipped a coin into the mans hand then he walked deliberately away he found a taxicab and was driven toward the milan he let down both the windows and leaned out he was conscious of a wild desire to keep away from his roomsto spend the night anywhere anyhow sooner than go back to the little apartment where louise had sat with him only a few hours ago and had given herself into his arms every pulse in his body was tingling he was fiercely awake eager for motion action excitement of any sort  suddenly he remembered the nightclub to which he had been introduced by sophy on the first night of his arrival in london the address too was there quite clearly in his disordered brain he leaned out of the cab and repeated it to the driver                                       xxxv   the little place was unexpectedly crowded when john entered after having handed his hat and coat to a vestiaire a large supperparty was going on at the further end and the dancing space was smaller than usual the maître dhôtel was escorting john to a small table in a distant corner which had just been vacated when the latter heard his name suddenly called by a familiar voice sophy who had been dancing abandoned her partner precipitately and came hurrying up to john with outstretched hands  john she exclaimed you of all people in the world what do you mean by coming here alone at this time of night fancy not telling me is anything the matter  nothing he replied i really dont exactly know why i am here i simply didnt want to go to bed  she looked at him closely it was clear that she was a little puzzled at his appearance  if it were not you john she declared i should say that you had been having more to drink than was good for you  then you would be very wrong john assured her because i havent had anything at all i have come here to get something cant you come and sit with me  of course she assented eagerly the prince is giving a supperparty at the other end of the room there we all came on together from the reception let us get away to your corner quickly or they will see you and make you go and join them i would much rather have you to myself the people here seem so stupid tonight  john stood still and made no movement toward the table which the maître dhôtel was smilingly preparing for them  where is the prince he asked  sophy struck by something in his voice swung around and looked at him then she thrust both her arms through his clasped her two hands together and led him firmly away a glimmering of the truth was beginning to dawn upon her  tell me where you have been since you left the reception she insisted when at last they were seated together  wait till i have ordered some wine he said  a waiter served them with champagne when johns glass was filled he drained its contents sophy watched him with surprise she came a little closer to him  john she whispered you must tell medo you hear you must tell me everything did you take louise home  yes  what happened then you didnt quarrel with her  nothing at all happened he assured her we parted the best of friends it wasnt that  then what remember that i am your friend john dear tell me everything  he poured himself more wine and drank it  i will tell you he assented i went to a little club i belong to on the adelphi terrace i sat down in the smoking room there was no one there i knew some men were talking they had been to the reception tonight they were comparing french actresses and english they spoke first of the french woman latrobe and her lovers then of louise they spoke quite calmly like men discussing history they compared the two actresses they compared their lives latrobe they said had lovers by the scorelouise only one  sophys hand stole into his she was watching the twisting of his features she understood so well the excitement underneath  i think i can guess she whispered dont hurt yourself telling me something was said about the prince  his eyes blazed down upon her  you too he muttered does the whole world know of it and speak as if it did not matter sophy is it true speak out dont be afraid of hurting me you call yourself my friend ive been down looking at the outside of her house i dared not go in theres a fire burning in my soul tell me if it is true  you must not ask me that question john she begged how should i know besides these things are so different in our world the world you havent found out much about yet supposing it were true john she went on remember that it was before you knew her supposing it should be true remember thisyour idea of life is too absurd is one creed made to fit human beings who may differ in a million different ways a woman may be as good as any ever born into the world and yet take just a little love into her life if she be true and faithful in doing it i dont believe there is a dearer or sweeter woman breathing than louise but one must have love dont i know it a man may be strong enough to live without it but a womannever  the skirts of the women brushed their table as they danced the rhythm of the music rose and fell above the murmur of laughter and conversation john looked around the room and a sort of despair crept in upon him it was no good he had come to london to understand he understood nothing he was made of the wrong fiber if only he could change himself if it were not too late if he could make himself like other men  he turned and glanced at his companion sophy was looking very sweet and very wistful the warm touch of her fingers was grateful her sympathy was like some welcome flower in a wilderness his heart ached with a new desire if only he could make himself different if only he could stretch out his hand for the flowers which made the lives of other men so sweet  i must not ask you any more questions sophy he said you are her friend and you have spoken very sweetly tomorrow i will go and see her  and tonight forget it all she pleaded wipe it out of your memory louise and your future belong to tomorrow tonight she is not here and i am even if you are furiously in love with her there isnt any harm in your being just a little nice to me give me some champagne and i want some caviar sandwiches  i wonder why you are so good to me sophy he exclaimed as he gave the order to a waiter you ought either to marry your young man down at bath or to have a sweetheart of your own a companion some one quite different  how different  some one who cared for you as you deserve to be cared for and whom you cared for too  i cannot take these things as lightly as i used to she answered a little sadly something has come over me latelyi dont know what it isbut i seem to have lost my taste for flirtations john dont look up dont turn round i have been afraid of the prince all the evening when you came in i fancied that you had been drinking when the prince asked me something about you an hour or so ago i knew that he had i saw him like it once before about a year ago dont take any notice of him dont talk to him if you can help it  john was scarcely conscious of her words a new glow of excitement seemed to be taking entire possession of him to be thrilling his blood to be shining out of his eyes he rose slowly to his feet it was as if he were being drawn forward out of himself to meet some coming challenge  toward their table the prince was slowly making his way skilfully avoiding the dancers yet looking neither to the right nor to the left his eyes were fastened upon john if he had been drinking as sophy suggested there were few signs of it his walk was steady his bearing as usual deliberate and distinguished  he came to a standstill beside them sophys fingers clutched at the tablecloth the prince looked from one to the other  you have robbed me of a guest mr strangewey he remarked but i bear you no illwill it is very seldom that one sees you in these haunts of dissipation  it is a gala night with me john replied his tone raised no more than usual but shaking with some new quality drink a glass of wine with me prince he invited taking the bottle from the icepail and filling a tumbler upon the table wish me luck wont you i am engaged to be married  i wish you happiness with all my heart the prince answered holding his glass up may i not know the name of the lady  no doubt you are prepared for the news john told him miss maurel has promised to become my wife  the princes hand was as steady as a rock he raised his glass to his lips  i drink to you both with the greatest pleasure he said looking john full in the face it is a most remarkable coincidence tonight is the anniversary of the night when louise maurel pledged herself to me in somewhat different fashion  johns frame seemed for a moment to dilate and fire flashed from his eyes  will you be good enough to explain those words he demanded  the prince bowed he glanced toward sophy  since you insist he replied tonight then let me tell you is the anniversary of the night when louise maurel consented to become my mistress  what followed came like a thunderclap the prince reeled back his hand to his mouth blood dropping upon the tablecloth from his lips where john had struck him he made a sudden spring at his assailant sophy shrieking leaped to her feet every one else in the place seemed paralyzed with wonder  john seized the prince by the throat and held him for a moment at arms length then he lifted him off his feet as one might lift a child from the floor holding his helpless victim in a merciless grip he carried him across the room and deliberately flung him over the table toward his empty chair  there was a crash of glass and crockery which rang through the momentarily hushed room the dancers had stopped in their places the bow of the violinist lay idle upon the strings of his instrument the waiters were all standing about like graven images then as the prince fell there was a shout and all was pandemonium they rushed to where he was lying motionless a ghastly sight across the wreck of his flowerstrewn suppertable  sophy held john by the arm clutching it hysterically striving to drag him away but to john the room was empty he stood there a giant motionless figure his muscles still taut his face tense his eyes aflame glaring down at the prostrate figure of the man on whom he had wreaked the accumulated fury of those last days and weeks of madness                                      xxxvi   toward nine oclock on the following morning john rose from a fitful sleep and looked around him even before he could recall the events of the preceding night he felt that there was a weight pressing upon his brain a miserable sense of emptiness in life a dull feeling of bewilderment although he had no clear recollection of getting there he realized that he was in his own sitting room and that he had been asleep upon the couch he saw too that it was morning for a ray of sunlight lay across the carpet  as he struggled to his feet he saw with a little shock that he was not alone sophy gerard was curled up in his easy chair still in evening clothes her cloak drawn closely around her as if she were cold her head had fallen back she too was asleep at the sound of his movement however she opened her eyes and looked at him for a moment with a puzzled stare then she jumped to her feet  why we have both been asleep she murmured a little weakly  at the sound of her voice it all came back to him a tangled hideous nightmare he sat down again upon the couch and held his head between his hands  how did i come here he asked i cant remember  she hesitated he answered the unspoken question in her eyes  i remember everything that happened at the club he went on slowly is the prince dead  she shook her head  of course not he was hurt though and there was a terrible scene of confusion in the room the people crowded around him and i managed somehow to drag you away the manager helped us to tell the truth he was only too anxious for you to get away before the police arrived he was so afraid of anything getting into the papers i drove you back here and as you still seemed stunned i brought you upstairs i didnt mean to stay but i couldnt get you to say a single coherent word i was afraid to leave you alone  i suppose i was drunk he said in a dull tone i remember filling my glass over and over again there is one thing though he added his voice gaining a sudden strength i was not drunk when i struck the prince i remember those few seconds very distinctly i saw everything knew everything felt everything if no one had interfered i think i should have killed him  you were not drunk at all she declared with a little shiver but you were in a state of terrible excitement it was a long time before i could get you to lie down and then you wouldnt close your eyes until i came and sat by your side i watched you go to sleep i hope you are not angry with me i didnt like to go and leave you  how could i be angry he protested you are far kinder to me than i deserve i expect i should have been in a police cell but for you  and now she begged coming over to him and speaking in a more matteroffact tone do let us be practical i must run away and you must go and have a bath and change your clothes dont be afraid of your reputation i can get out by the other entrance  he made no movement she laid her hand on his arm in the sunlight with a little patch of rouge still left on her cheek with her disordered hair and tired eyes she looked almost ghastly  remember she whispered you have to go to see louise  he covered his face with his hands  whats the use of it he groaned its only another turn of the screw  dont be foolish john she admonished briskly you dont actually know anything yetnothing at all at least you are not sure of anything and besides you strange impossible person she went on patting his hand dont you see that you must judge her not by the standards of your world in which she has never lived but by the standards of her world in which she was born and bred that is only fair isnt it  he made no answer she watched him anxiously but there was no sign in his face  pull yourself together john she continued ring for some tea get your bath and then have it out with louise remember life is a very big thing you are dealing this morning with all it may mean to you  he rose listlessly to his feet there was a strange dull look in his face  you are a dear girl sophy he said dont go just yet i have never felt like it before in my life but just now i dont want to be left alone send a boy for some clothes and i will order some tea  she hesitated  my own reputation she murmured is absolutely of no consequence but remember that you live here and  dont be silly he interrupted what does that matter and besides according to you and all the rest of you here these things dont affect a mans reputationthey are expected of him see i have rung the bell for breakfast now i am going to telephone down for a messengerboy to go for your clothes  they breakfasted together a little later and she made him smoke he stood before the window looking down upon the river with his pipe in his mouth and an unfamiliar look upon his face  do you suppose that louise knows anything he asked at length  i should think not she replied it is for you to tell her i rang up the princes house while you were in your bathroom they say that he has a broken rib and some bad cuts sustained in a motor accident last night but that he is in no danger there was nothing about the affair in the newspapers and the princes servants have evidently been instructed to give this account to inquirers  a gleam of interest shone in johns face  by the bye he remarked the prince is a frenchman he will very likely expect me to fight with him  no hope of that my belligerent friend sophy declared with an attempt at a smile the prince knows that he is in england he would not be guilty of such an anachronism besides he is a person of wonderfully wellbalanced mind when he is himself again he will realize that what happened to him is exactly what he asked for  john took up his hat and gloves he glanced at the clockit was a little past eleven  i am ready he announced let me drive you home first  his motor was waiting at the door and he left sophy at her rooms before she got out she held his arm for a moment  john she said remember that louise is very highstrung and very sensitive be careful  there is only one thing to do or to say he answered there is only one way in which i can do it  he drove the car down piccadilly like a man in a dream steering as carefully as usual through the traffic and glancing every now and then with unseeing eyes at the streams of people upon the pavements finally he came to a standstill before louises house and stopped the engine with deliberate care then he rang the bell and was shown into her little drawingroom which seemed to have become a perfect bower of pink and white lilac  he sat waiting as if in a dream unable to decide upon his words unable even to sift his thoughts the one purpose with which he had come the one question he designed to ask was burning in his brain the minutes of her absence seemed tragically long he walked up and down oppressed by the perfume of the flowers the room seemed too small for him he longed to throw open all the windows to escape from the atmosphere in which for the first time he seemed to find some faint enervating poison  then at last the door opened and louise entered she came toward him with a little welcoming smile upon her lips her manner was gay almost affectionate  have you come to take me for a ride before lunch she asked do you know i think that i should really like it we might lunch at ranelagh on our way home  the words stuck in his throat from where she was she saw now the writing on his face she stopped short  what is it she exclaimed  ever since i knew you he said slowly there have been odd moments when i have lived in torture during the last fortnight those moments have become hours last night the end came  are you mad john she demanded  perhaps he replied listen when i left you last night i went to the club in adelphi terrace there was a wellknown critic there comparing you and latrobe on the whole he favored you but he gave latrobe the first place in certain parts latrobe he said had had more experience of life she had had a dozen loversyou only one  she winced the glad freshness seemed suddenly to fade from her face her eyes became strained  well  i found graillot i cornered him i asked him for the truth about you he put me off with an evasion i came down here and looked at your window it was three oclock in the morning i dared not come in a very demon of unrest was in my blood i stopped at a nightclub on my way back sophy was there i asked her plainly to put me out of my agony she was like graillot she fenced with me and thenthe prince came  the prince was there she faltered  he came up to the table where sophy and i were sitting i think i was half mad i poured him a glass of wine and asked him to drink with me i told him that you had promised to become my wife he raised his glassi can see him now he told me with a smile that it was the anniversary of the day on which you had promised to become his mistress  louise shrank back  he told you that  john was on his feet the fever was blazing once more  he told me that face to facetold me that it was the anniversary of the day on which you had consented to become his mistress  and you  if we had been alone john answered simply i should have killed him i drove the words down his throat i threw him back to the place he had left and hurt him rather badly im afraid sophy took me home somehow and now i am here  she leaned a little forward on the couch she looked into his face searchingly anxiously as if seeking for something she could not find his lips were set in hard cold lines the likeness to stephen had never been more apparent  listen she said you are a puritan while i admire the splendid selfrestraint evolved from your creed it is partly temperamental isnt it i was brought up to see things differently and i do see them differently tell me do you love me  the veins swelled for a moment upon his forehead stood out like whipcord along the back of his hands but of softening there was no sign in his face  love you he repeated you know it could i suffer the tortures of the damned if i didnt could i come to you with a mans blood upon my hands if i didnt if the prince lives it is simply the accident of fate i tell you that if we had been alone i should have driven the breath out of his body love you  she rose slowly to her feet she leaned with her elbow upon the mantelpiece and her face was hidden for a moment  let me think she said i dont know what to say to you i dont know you john there isnt anything left of the john i loved let me look again  she swung around  you speak of love she went on suddenly do you know what it is do you know that loves reaches to the heavens and can also touch the nethermost depths of hell if i throw myself on my knees before you now if i link my fingers around your neck if i whisper to you that in the days that were past before you came i had done things i would fain forget if i told you that from henceforth every second of my life was yours that my heart beat with yours by day and by night that i had no other thought no other dream than to stay by your side to see you happy to give all there was of myself into your keeping to keep it holy and sacred for youjohn what then  never a line in his face softened he looked at her a moment as he had looked at the woman in piccadilly into whose hand he had dropped gold  are you going to tell me that it is the truth he asked hoarsely  she stood quite still her bosom rising and falling even then she made one last effort she held out her hands with a little trembling gesture her eyes filled with tears  think for a single moment of that feeling which you call love john she pleaded listen i love you it has come to me at last after all these years it lives in my heart a greater thing than my ambition a greater thing than my success a greater thing than life itself i love you john cant you feel dont you know that nothing else in life can matter  not a line in his face softened his teeth had come together he was like a man upon the rack  it is true it is true then he demanded  she looked at him without any reply the seconds seemed drawn out to an interminable period he heard the rolling of the motorbuses in the street once more the perfume of the lilacs seemed to choke him then she leaned back and touched the bell  the prince spoke the truth she said i think you had better go                                      xxxvii   before the wideflung window of her attic bedchamber sophy gerard was crouching with her face turned westward she had abandoned all effort to sleep the one thought that was beating in her brain was too insistent too clamorous somewhere beyond that tangled mass of chimneys and telegraphpoles somewhere on the other side of the gray haze which hung about the myriad roofs john and louise were working out their destiny speaking at last the naked truth to each other  somehow or other during those few minutes every thought of herself and her own life seemed to have passed away johns face seemed always before herthe sudden hard lines about his mouth the dull smoldering pain in his eyes how would he return louise had guarded the secret of her life so well would he wrest it from her or  she started suddenly back into the room there was a knocking at the door something quite different from her landladys summons she wrapped her dressinggown around her pulled the curtains around the little bed on which she had striven to rest and moved toward the door she turned the handle softly  who is that she asked  john almost pushed his way past her she closed the door with nerveless fingers her eyes sought his face her lips were parted she clung to the back of the chair  you have seen louise she exclaimed breathlessly  i have seen louise he answered it is all over  she looked a little helplessly around her then she selected the one chair in the tiny apartment that was likely to hold him and led him to it  please sit down she begged and tell me about it you mustnt despair like this all at once i wonder if i could help  no one can help he told her grimly it is all finished and done with i would rather not talk any more about it i didnt come here to talk about it i came to see you so this is where you live  he looked around him and for a moment he almost forgot the pain which was gnawing at his heart it was such a simple plainly furnished little room so clean so neat so pathetically eloquent of poverty she drew closer together the curtains which concealed her little chintzcovered bed and came and sat down by his side  you know you are rather a silly person she whispered soothingly wait for a time and perhaps things will look different i know that louise cares isnt that the great thing after all  i would like not to talk about it any more said john just now i cannot put what i feel into words what remains is just this i have been a fool a sort of don quixote building castles in spain and believing that real men and women could live in them i have expected the impossible in life it is perhaps a good thing that i can see the truth now i am going to climb down  she clasped her hands tighter around his arm her eyes sought his anxiously  but you mustnt climb down john she insisted you are so much nicer where you are so much too good for the silly ugly things you must fight this in your own way fight it according to your own standards you are too good to come down  am i too good for you sophy  she looked at him and her whole face seemed to soften the light in her blue eyes was sweet and wistful a bewildering little smile curled her lips  dont be stupid she begged a few minutes ago i was looking out of my window and thinking what a poor little morsel of humanity i am and what a useless drifting life i have led but thats foolish come now what i want to persuade you to do is to go back to cumberland for a time and try hardvery hard indeedto realize what it means to be a woman like louise with her temperament her intense intellectual curiosity her charm nothing could make louise different from what she isa dear sweet woman and a great artist and john i believe she loves you  his face remained undisturbed even by the flicker of an eyelid  sophy he said i have decided to go abroad will you come with me  she sat quite still again her face was momentarily transformed all its pallor and fatigue seemed to have vanished her head had fallen a little back she was looking through the ceiling into heaven then the light died away almost as quickly as it had come her lips shook tremulously  you know you dont mean it john you wouldnt take me and if you did youd hate me afterwardyoud want to send me back  he suddenly drew her to him his arm went around her waist she had lost all power of resistance for the first time in his life of his own deliberate accord he kissed herfeverishly almost roughly  sophy he declared i have been a fool i have come an awful cropper but you might help me with whats left i am going to start afresh i am going to get rid of some of these ideas of mine which have brought me nothing but misery and disappointment i dont want to live up to them any longer i want to just forget them i want to live as other men livejust the simple ordinary life come with me ill take you to the places weve talked about together i am always happy and contented with you lets try it  her arms stole around his neck  if only you cared john she sobbed  but i do he insisted i love to have you with me i love to see you happy i shall love to give you pretty things i shall be proud of you soothed by youand rested what do you say sophy  john she whispered hiding her face for a moment what can i say what could any poor weak little creature like me say you know i am fond of youi havent had the pride even to conceal it  he stood up held her face for a moment between his hands and kissed her forehead  then thats all settled he declared i am going back to my rooms now i want you to come and dine with me there tonight at eight oclock  her eyes sought his pleaded with them searched them  you are sure john she asked her voice a little broken you want me really i am to come you wont be sorryafterward  i am sure he answered steadfastly i shall expect you at eight oclock                                       john went back to his rooms fighting all the time against a sense of unreality a sense almost of lost identity he bought an evening newspaper and read it on the way he talked to the hallporter he talked to a neighbor with whom he ascended in the lifthe did everything except think  in his rooms he telephoned to the restaurant for a waiter and with the menu in his hand a few minutes later he ordered dinner then he glanced at his watchit was barely seven oclock he went down to the barbershop was shaved and had his hair cut encouraging the barber all the time to talk to him he gave his hands over to a manicure and did his best to talk nonsense to her then he came upstairs again changed his clothes with great care and went into his little sitting room  it was five minutes to eight and dinner had been laid at a little round table in the center of the room there was a bowl of pink rosessophys favorite flowersent in from the florists the table was lighted by a pinkshaded lamp john went around the room turning out the other lights until the apartment was hung with shadows save for the little spot of color in the middle an unopened bottle of champagne stood in an icepail and two specially prepared cocktails had been placed upon the little sidetable there were no more preparations to be made  john walked restlessly to the window and gazed at the curving line of lights along the embankment this was the end thenthe end of his strenuous days the end of his ideals the end of a lovestory which had made life for a time seem so wonderful he could hear them talking about him in a few days timethe princes subtle sneer the jests of his acquaintances and louise his heart stopped for a moment as he tried to think of her face when she heard the news  he turned impatiently away from the window and glanced at the clock it was almost eight he tried to imagine that the bell was ringing that sophy was standing there on the threshold in her simple but dainty evening dress with a little smile parting her lips the end of it all he pulled down the blind no more of the window no more looking out at the lights no more living in the clouds it was time indeed that he lived as other men he lifted one of the glasses to his lips and drained its contents  then the bell rang he moved forward to answer its summons with beating heart as he opened it he received a shock a messengerboy stood outside he took the note which the boy handed him and tore it open under the lamp there were only a few lines      john my heart is breaking but i know you do not mean what you     said i know it was only a moment of madness with you i know     you will love louise all your life and will bless me all your     life because i am giving up the one thing which could make my     life a paradise i shall be in the train when you read this on     my way to bath i have wired my young man as you call him to     meet me i am going to ask him to marry me if he will next     week      goodby i give you no advice some day i think that life will     right itself with you                                                            sophy  the letter dropped upon the table john stood for a moment dazed suddenly he began to laugh then he remembered the messengerboy gave him half a crown and closed the door he came back into the room and took his place at the table he looked at the empty chair by his side looked at the full glass on the sideboard it seemed to him that he was past all sensations the waiter came in silently  you can serve the dinner john ordered shaking out his napkin open the champagne before you go  you will be alone sir the man inquired  i shall be alone john answered                                     xxxviii   it was a room of silence save for the hissing of the green logs that burned on the open hearth and for the slow movements of jennings as he cleared the table straight and grim in his chair with the newspaper by his side stephen strangewey sat smoking stolidly opposite to him almost as grim equally silent sat john  things were quiet at market ketton today then john stephen asked at last  there was nothing doing was the brief reply  that for the space of a quarter of an hour or so was the sole attempt at conversation between the two brothers then jennings appeared with a decanter of wine and two glasses which he reverently filled stephen held his up to the light and looked at it critically johns remained by his side unnoticed  a glass for yourself jennings stephen ordered  i thank ye kindly sir the old man replied  he fetched a glass from the sideboard filled it and held it respectfully before him  its the old toast stephen said glumly you know it  aye master stephen the servant assented weve drunk it together for many a long year i give it ye now with all my heartconfusion to all women  they both glanced toward john who showed no signs of movement then they drank together the older man and his servant still john never moved jennings drained his glass placed the decanter by his masters side and withdrew  so the poisons still there brother stephen asked  and will be so long as i live john confessed gloomily for all that ill not drink your toast  why not  there was a little girlyou saw her when you were in london she is married now but i think of her sometimes and when i do you and old jennings seem to me like a couple of blithering idiots cursing things too wonderful for you to understand  stephen made no protest for a time he smoked in silence curiously enough as they sat there together some of the grim fierceness seemed to have passed from his expression and settled upon john more than once as he looked across at his younger brother it almost seemed as if there was something of selfreproach in his questioning look  you dined at the ordinary in market ketton stephen asked at last  i did  then you heard the news  who could help it john muttered there wasnt much else talked about  bailiff henderson has been over here stephen went on theres a small army of painters and decorators coming down to the castle next week you saw the announcement of the wedding in the morning post maybe  john assented without words stephen smoked vigorously for a few moments every now and then he glanced across to where john was sitting once again the uneasiness was in his eyes an uneasiness which was almost selfreproach  you mind what i called her once johna witchwoman she is that right enough this marriage of hers proves it although he is half a frenchman the prince of seyre is the greatest landowner in the county he is the worst landlord maybe but the bloods there he is a man who has lived among women all his life he should know something about them and be proof against their wiles yet hes going to marry her next thursday  john moved a little restlessly in his chair  lets drop it stephen he begged we both know the facts she is going to marry him and thats the end of it fill your glass up again heres mine untouched ill drink your toast with you if youll leave out the little girl who was kind to me ill give it to you myselfconfusion to all women  confusion to stephen began what on earth is that  they both heard it at the same timethe faint beating of a motorengine in the distance john set down his glass there was a strange look in his eyes  there are more cars passing along the road now than in the old days he muttered but thats a queer sound it reminds onegood heavens how it reminds one  there was a look of agony in his face for a moment then once more he raised his glass to his lips  its passed out of hearing stephen said its some one on the way to the castle maybe  still their glasses remained suspended in mid air the little garden gate had opened and closed with a click there were footsteps upon the flinty walk  its some one coming here john cried hoarsely why cant they keep away its two years ago this week since i brought her up the drive and you met us at the front door two years ago stephen who can it be  they heard the front door open they heard jennings voice raised in unusual and indignant protest then their own door was suddenly flung wide and a miracle happened johns glass slipped from his fingers and the wine streamed out across the carpet he shrank back gripping the tablecloth stephen turned his head and sat as if turned to stone  john  she was coming toward him exactly as he had dreamed of her so many times her hands outstretched her lips quivering with that sweet look in her face which had dwelt there once for a few daysjust a few days of her life  john she faltered it isnt the car this timeit is i who have broken down i cannot go on i have no pride left i have come to you will you help me  he found himself upon his feet stephen too had risen she stood between the two men and glanced from one to the other then she looked more closely into johns face peering forward with a little start of pain and her eyes were filled with tears  john she cried forgive me you were so cruel that morning and you seemed to understand so little dont you really understand even now have you ever known the truth i wonder  the truth he echoed hoarsely dont we all know that dont we all know that he is to give you your rights that you are coming  stop she ordered him  he obeyed and for a moment there was silencea tense strained silence  john she continued at last i have no rights to receive from the prince of seyre he owes me nothing listen always we have seen life differently you and i to me there is only one great thing and that is love and beyond that nothing counts i tried to love the prince before you came and i thought i did and i promised him at last what you know because i believed that he loved me and that i loved him and that if so it was his right look down the road john on that night i was on my way to the castle to give myself to him but i broke down and in the morning the world was all different and i went back to london it has been different ever since and there has never been any question of anything between the prince and me because i knew that it was not love  john was shaking in every limb his eyes were filled with fierce questioning stephen sat there and there was wonder in his face too  when you came to me that morning she went on you spoke to me in a strange tongue i couldnt understand you you seemed so far away i wanted to tell you the whole truth but i didnt perhaps i wasnt sureperhaps it seemed to me that it was best for me to forget if ever i had cared for the ways of our lives seemed so far apart you went away and i drifted on but it wasnt true that i ever promised to marry the prince no one had any right to put that paragraph in the newspaper  but what are you doing here then john asked hoarsely arent you on your way to the castle  she came a little nearer still her arms went around his neck  you dear stupid she cried havent i told you ive tried to do without you and i cant ive come for you come outside please its quite light the moons coming over the hills i want to walk up the orchard i want to hear just what ive come to hear  he passed out of the room in a dream under the blossomladen boughs of the orchard and up the hillside toward the church the dream passed but louise remained flesh and blood her lips were warm and her arms held him almost feverishly  in that little church john and quicklyso quickly please she whispered                                       jennings hastened in to where stephen was sitting alone  mr stephen he cried whats coming to us theres that french hussy outside and a motorcar in the drive and the chauffeurs asking where hes to sleep the woman wants to know whether she can have the same bedroom for her mistress as last time  then why dont you go and see about it you old fool stephen replied pick up those pieces of glass there lay the cloth and get some supper ready  jennings gazed at his master dumbfounded no power of speech remained to him  through the open doorway they heard alines voice in the hall  meester jennings will you please come and help me with the luggage  get along with you stephen ordered youd better hurry up with the supper too the boy tom can see to the luggage  the old man recovered himself slowly  youre taking em in sirtaking em into the house he gasped what about that toast  stephen refilled two glasses  wed better alter it a little he declared heres confusion to most women but luck to john and his wife  mr john and his wife jennings repeated as he set his glass down empty ill just see that them sheets is aired upstairs sir or that hussy will be making eyes at tom  he departed and stephen was left alone he sat and listened to the sound of luggage being taken upstairs to alines little torrent of directions goodhumored but profuse to the sound of preparations in the kitchen in the room the tall clock ticked solemnly a fragment of the log every now and then fell upon the hearth  presently he rose to his feet he heard the click of the garden gate the sound of john and louise returning he rose and stood ready to welcome them                                     the end                             popular copyright novels                            at moderate
