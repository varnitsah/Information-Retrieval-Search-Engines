making of a saint     introduction   these are the memoirs of the beato giuliano brother of the order of st francis of assisi known in his worldly life as filippo brandolini of which family i giulo brandolini am the last descendant on the death of fra giuliano the manuscript was given to his nephew leonello on whom the estates devolved and has since been handed down from father to son as the relic of a member of the family whose piety and good works still shed lustre on the name of brandolini  it is perhaps necessary to explain how the resolution to give these memoirs to the world has eventually been arrived at for my part i should have allowed them to remain among the other papers of the family but my wife wished otherwise when she deserted her home in the new world to become the countess brandolini she was very naturally interested at finding among my ancestors a man who had distinguished himself in good works so as to be granted by the pope the title of beatus which was acquired for him by the influence of his greatnephew not very long after his death and indeed had our house retained the prosperity which it enjoyed during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries he would undoubtedly have been canonised for it was a well certified fact that the necessary miracles had been performed by his remains and that prayers had been regularly offered at his tomb but our estates had dwindled so that we could not afford the necessary expenditure and now when my wife has restored its ancient magnificence to our house times alas have changed the good old customs of our fathers have fallen into disuse and it is impossible to create a saint for ready money however my wife desired to publish an account of her pious ancestor but a difficulty arose in the fact that there were no materials whatever for any relation of the life which fra giuliano led when he had entered the franciscan monastery of campomassa and it was obvious that even if there had been good works prayer and fasting could not have afforded a very interesting story and so we have been constrained to leave untold his pieties and recount instead his sins for which there was every facility in the memoirs he had himself left behind him  not content with writing the story of his own life fra giuliano begins with a mythical consul of the roman republic who is supposed to have founded the family by a somewhat discreditable union with somebody elses wife he then carries the story through countless ages till he arrives at his own conception and the prodigies attending his birth which he describes with great minuteness he gives very amply the history of his childhood and boyhood the period he spent as page at the court of the bentivogli of bologna and his adventures in the neapolitan armies under the duke of calabria but the whole story is narrated at such length with so many digressions and details and is sometimes so vague incoherent and disjointed that with whatever editing it was considered impossible to make a clear and continuous narrative  fra giuliano himself divided his life into two parts the one he named the time of honey being the period of expectation the other the time of gall being that of realisation the second half commences with his arrival at the town of forli in the year 1488 and it is this part which we have decided to publish for notwithstanding its brevity this was the most eventful period of his life and the account of it seems to hang together in a sufficiently lucid fashion centring round the conspiracy which resulted in the assassination of girolamo riario and finishing with the authors admission to the order of st francis this then i have given exactly as he wrote it neither adding nor suppressing a word i do not deny that it would have pleased me a little to falsify the history for the anglosaxons are a race of idealists as is shown in all their dealing international and commercial and truth they have always found a little ugly i have a friend who lately wrote a story of the london poor and his critics were properly disgusted because his characters dropped their aitches and often used bad language and did not behave as elegantly as might be expected from the example they were continually receiving from their betters while some of his readers were shocked to find that people existed in this world who did not possess the delicacy and refinement which they felt palpitating in their own bosoms the author forgot that truth is a naked lady and that nudity is always shameful unless it points a moral if truth has taken up her abode at the bottom of a well it is clearly because she is conscious that she is no fit companion for decent people  i am painfully aware that the persons of this drama were not actuated by the moral sentiments which they might have acquired by education at a really good english public school but one may find excuse for them in the recollection that their deeds took place four hundred years ago and that they were not wretched paupers but persons of the very highest rank if they sinned they sinned elegantly and much may be forgiven to people whose pedigree is above suspicion and the writer as if unwilling to wound the susceptibilities of his readers has taken care to hurl contempt at the only character whose family was distinctly not respectable  before making my bow and leaving the reader with filippo brandolini i will describe his appearance shown in a portrait painted in the same year 1488 and till the beginning of this century in the possession of my family when it was sold with many other works of art to travellers in italy my wife has succeeded in buying back the portraits of several of my ancestors but this particular one is in the collection of an english nobleman who has refused to part with it though kindly allowing a copy to be made which now hangs in the place formerly occupied by the original  it represents a middlesized man slim and graceful with a small black beard and moustache an oval face olive coloured and from his fine dark eyes he is looking straight out into the world with an expression of complete happiness it was painted soon after his marriage he is dressed in the costume of the period and holds a roll of parchment in his hand at the top right hand corner are the date and the arms of the family or a griffin rampant gules crest a demiswan issuing from a coronet the motto felicitas     i   allow me to present to you my friend filippo brandolini a gentleman of città di castello  then turning to me matteo added this is my cousin checco dorsi  checco dorsi smiled and bowed  messer brandolini he said i am most pleased to make your acquaintance you are more than welcome to my house  you are very kind i replied matteo has told me much of your hospitality  checco bowed courteously and asked his cousin you have just arrived matteo  we arrived early this morning i wished to come here directly but filippo who suffers from a very insufferable vanity insisted on going to an inn and spending a couple of hours in the adornment of his person  how did you employ those hours matteo asked checco looking rather questioningly at his cousins dress and smiling  matteo looked at his boots and his coat  i am not elegant but i felt too sentimental to attend to my personal appearance and i had to restore myself with wine you know we are very proud of our native forli wine filippo  i did not think you were in the habit of being sentimental matteo remarked checco  it was quite terrifying this morning when we arrived said i he struck attitudes and called it his beloved country and wanted to linger in the cold morning and tell me anecdotes about his childhood  you professional sentimentalists will never let anyone sentimentalise but yourselves  i was hungry said i laughing and it didnt become you even your horse had his doubts  brute said matteo of course i was too excited to attend to my horse and he slipped over those confounded stones and nearly shot me offand filippo instead of sympathising burst out laughing  evidently you must abandon sentiment said checco  im afraid you are right now filippo can be romantic for hours at a stretch and what is worse he isbut nothing happens to him but on coming back to my native town after four years i think it was pardonable  we accept your apology matteo i said  but the fact is checco that i am glad to get back the sight of the old streets the palazzo all fill me with a curious sensation of joyand i feeli dont know how i feel  make the utmost of your pleasure while you can you may not always find a welcome in forli said checco gravely  what the devil do you mean asked matteo  oh well talk of these things later you had better go and see my father now and then you can rest yourselves you must be tired after your journey tonight we have here a great gathering where you will meet your old friends the count has deigned to accept my invitation  deigned said matteo lifting his eyebrows and looking at his cousin  checco smiled bitterly  times have changed since you were here matteo he said the forlivesi are subjects and courtiers now  putting aside matteos further questions he bowed to me and left us  i wonder what it is said matteo what did you think of him  i had examined checco dorsi curiouslya tall dark man with full beard and moustache apparently about forty there was a distinct likeness between him and matteo they both had the same dark hair and eyes but matteos face was broader the bones more prominent and the skin rougher from his soldiers life checco was thinner and graver he looked a great deal more talented matteo as i often told him was not clever  he was very amiable i said in reply to the question  a little haughty but he means to be courteous he is rather oppressed with his dignity of head of the family  but his father is still alive  yes but hes eightyfive and hes as deaf as a post and as blind as a bat so he remains quietly in his room while checco pulls the strings so that we poor devils have to knuckle under and do as he bids us  im sure that must be very good for you i said im curious to know why checco talks of the count as he did when i was here last they were bosom friends however let us go and drink having done our duty  we went to the inn at which we had left our horses and ordered wine  give us your best my fat friend cried matteo to mine host this gentleman is a stranger and does not know what wine is he was brought up on the sickly juice of città di castello  you live at città di castello asked the innkeeper  i wish i did i answered  he was ejected from his country for his countrys good remarked matteo  that is not true i replied laughing i left of my own free will  galloping as hard as you could with fourandtwenty horsemen at your heels  precisely and so little did they want me to go that when i thought a change of air would suit me they sent a troop of horse to induce me to return  your head would have made a pretty ornament stuck on a pike in the grand piazza  the thought amuses you i answered but the comedy of it did not impress me at the time  i remembered the occasion when news was brought me that the vitelli the tyrant of castello had signed a warrant for my arrest whereupon knowing the rapid way he had of dealing with his enemies i had bidden farewell to my hearth and home with somewhat indecent haste but the old man had lately died and his son proceeding to undo all his fathers deeds had called back the fuorusciti and strung up from the palace windows such of his fathers friends as had not had time to escape i had come to forli with matteo on my way home to take possession of my confiscated property hoping to find that the intermediate proprietor who was dangling at a ropes end some hundred feet from the ground had made sundry necessary improvements  well what do you think of our wine said matteo compare it with that of città di castello  i really havent tasted it yet i said pretending to smile agreeably strange wines i always drink at a gulplike medicine  brutta bestia said matteo you are no judge  its passable i said laughing having sipped it with great deliberation  matteo shrugged his shoulders  these foreigners he said scornfully come here fat man he called to the innkeeper tell me how count girolamo and the gracious caterina are progressing when i left forli the common people struggled to lick the ground they trod on  the innkeeper shrugged his shoulders  gentlemen of my profession have to be careful in what they say  dont be a fool man i am not a spy  well sir the common people no longer struggle to lick the ground the count treads on  i see  you understand sir now that his father is dead  when i was here last sixtus was called his uncle  ah they say he was too fond of him not to be his father but of course i know nothing far be it from me to say anything in disparagement of his holiness past or present  however go on  well sir when the pope died the count girolamo found himself short of moneyand so the taxes that he had taken off he put on again  and the result is  well the people are beginning to murmur about his extravagance and they say that caterina behaves as if she were a queen whereas we all know that she is only the bastard of old sforza of milan but of course it has nothing to do with me  matteo and i were beginning to feel sleepy for we had been riding hard all night and we went upstairs giving orders to be called in time for the nights festivity we were soon fast asleep  in the evening matteo came to me and began examining my clothes  i have been considering filippo he said that it behoves me on my first appearance before the eyes of my numerous lady loves to cut the best figure i can  i quite agree with you i answered but i dont see what you are doing with my clothes  nobody knows you and it is unimportant how you look and as you have some very nice things here i am going to take advantage of your kindness and  youre not going to take my clothes i said springing out of bed matteo gathered up in his arms various garments and rushed out of the room slamming the door and locking it on the outside so that i was left shut in helpless  i shouted abuse after him but he went away laughing and i had to manage as best i could with what he had left me in half an hour he came to the door do you want to come out he said  of course i do i answered kicking the panel  will you promise not to be violent  i hesitated  i shant let you out unless you do  very well i answered laughing  matteo opened the door and stood bolt upright on the threshold decked out from head to foot in my newest clothes  you villain i said amazed at his effrontery  you dont look bad considering he answered looking at me calmly     ii   when we arrived at the palazzo orsi many of the guests had already come matteo was immediately surrounded by his friends and a score of ladies beckoned to him from different parts of the room so that he was torn away from me leaving me rather disconsolate alone in the crowd presently i was attracted to a group of men talking to a woman whom i could not see matteo had joined them and they were laughing at something he had said i had turned away to look at other people when i heard matteo calling me  filippo he said coming towards me come and be introduced to donna giulia she has asked me to present you  he took me by the arm and i saw that the lady and her admirers were looking at me  shes no better than she should be he whispered in my ear but shes the loveliest woman in forli  allow me to add another to your circle of adorers donna giulia said matteo as we both bowedmesser filippo brandolini like myself a soldier of distinction  i saw a graceful little woman dressed in some oriental brocade a small face with quite tiny features large brown eyes which struck me at the first glance as very soft and caressing a mass of dark reddishbrown hair and a fascinating smile  we were asking matteo where his wounds were she said smiling on me very graciously he tells us they are all in the region of his heart  in that case i answered he has come to a more deadly battlefield than any we saw during the war  what war asked a gentleman who was standing by nowadays we are in the happy state of having ten different wars in as many parts of the country  i was serving under the duke of calabria i replied  in that case your battles were bloodless  we came we saw and the enemy decamped said matteo  and now taking advantage of the peace you have come to trouble the hearts of forli said donna giulia  who knows how useful your swords may not be here remarked a young man  be quiet nicolo said another and there was an awkward silence during which matteo and i looked at one another in surprise and then everyone burst out talking so that you could not hear what was said  matteo and i bowed ourselves away from donna giulia and he took me to checco standing in a group of men  you have recovered from your fatigue he asked kindly  you have been travelling matteo said one of the company  yes we rode sixty miles yesterday he replied  sixty miles on one horse you must have good steeds and good imaginations said a big heavylooking manan ugly sallowfaced person whom i hated at first sight  it was only once in a way and we wanted to get home  you could not have come faster if you had been running away from a battlefield said the man  i thought him needlessly disagreeable but i did not speak matteo had not cultivated the golden quality  you talk as one who has had experience he remarked smiling in his most amiable manner  i saw checco frown at matteo while the bystanders looked on interestedly  i only said that added the man shrugging his shoulders because the duke of calabria is rather celebrated for his retreative tactics  i entertained a very great respect for the duke who had always been a kind and generous master to me  perhaps you do not know very much about tactics i remarked as offensively as i could  he turned and looked at me as if to say who the devil are you he looked me up and down contemptuously and i began to feel that i was almost losing my temper  my good young man he said i imagine that i was engaged in war when your battles were with your nursemaid  you have the advantage of me in courtesy as well as in years sir i replied but i might suggest that a man may fight all his life and have no more idea of war at the end than at the beginning  it depends on the intelligence remarked matteo  exactly what i was thinking said i  what the devil do you mean said the man angrily  i dont suppose he means anything at all ercole put in checco with a forced laugh  he can answer for himself i suppose said the man a flush came over checcos face but he did not answer  my good sir i said you have to consider whether i choose to answer  jackanapes  i put my hand to my sword but checco caught hold of my arm i recovered myself at once  i beg your pardon messer checco i said then turning to the man you are safe in insulting me here you show your breeding really matteo you did not tell me that you had such a charming fellowcountryman  you are too hard on us filippo answered my friend for such a monstrosity as that forli is not responsible  i am no forlivese thank god neither the count nor i he looked round scornfully we offer up thanks to the almighty every time the fact occurs to us i am a citizen of castello  matteo was going to burst out but i anticipated him i too am a citizen of castello and allow me to inform you that i consider you a very insolent fellow and i apologise to these gentlemen that a countryman of mine should forget the courtesy due to the city which is sheltering him  you a castelese and pray who are you  my name is filippo brandolini  i know your house mine is ercole piacentini  i cannot return the compliment i have never heard of yours  the surrounders laughed  my family is as good as yours sir he said  really i have no acquaintance with the middleclasses of castello but i have no doubt it is respectable  i noticed that the listeners seemed very contented and i judged that messer ercole piacentini was not greatly loved in forli but checco was looking on anxiously  you insolent young boy said the man furiously how dare you talk to me like that i will kick you  i put my hand to my sword to draw it for i was furious too i pulled at the hilt but i felt a hand catch hold of mine and prevent me i struggled then i heard checco in my ear  dont be a fool he said be quiet  let me be i cried  dont be a fool youll ruin us he held my sword so that i could not draw it  ercole saw what was going on his lips broke into a sarcastic smile  you are being taught the useful lesson of discretion young man you are not the only one who has learnt it he looked round at the bystanders  at that moment a servant came to checco and announced  the count  the group broke up and checco advanced to the further end of the hall with ercole piacentini and several other gentlemen matteo and i lingered where we were there was a rustle and the count and countess appeared attended by their suite  first of all my eyes were attracted to caterina she was wonderfully beautiful a tall wellmade woman holding herself proudly her head poised on the neck like a statue  one would think she was a kings daughter said matteo looking at her with astonishment  it is almost francescos face i said  we both had an immense admiration for francesco sforza the king of condottieri who had raised himself from a soldier of fortune to the proudest duchy in the world and caterina his natural daughter had the same clear strong features the strong piercing eyes but instead of the sforzas pockmarked skin she had a complexion of rare delicacy and softness and afterwards she proved that she had inherited her fathers courage as well as his appearance she was dressed in a gorgeous robe of silver cloth glittering and shimmering as she walked and her hair was done in her favourite manner intertwined with gold and silver threads but the wonderful chestnut outshone the brilliant metals seeming to lend them beauty rather than to borrow it i heard her speak and her voice was low and full like a mans  matteo and i stood looking at her for a minute then we both broke out per bacco she is beautiful  i began thinking of the fairy stories i had heard of caterina at rome where she had enchanted everyone by her loveliness and sixtus had squandered the riches of the church to satisfy her whims and fancies banquets balls pageants and gorgeous ceremonies the ancient city had run red with wine and mad with delight of her beauty  suddenly matteo said to me look at girolamo  i lifted my eyes and saw him standing quite close to mea tall man muscular and strong with big heavy face and prominent jaw bones the nose long and hooked small keen eyes very mobile his skin was unpleasant red and coarse like his wife he was dressed with great magnificence  one sees the sailor grandfather in him i said remembering that sixtuss father the founder of the family was a common sailor at rovese  he was talking to checco who was apparently speaking to him of us for he turned and stepped forward to matteo  the prodigal has returned he said we will not fail to kill the fatted calf but this time you must stay with us matteo we can give you service as well as the duke of calabria  matteo smiled grimly and the count turned to me  checco has told me of you also sir but i fear there is no chance of keeping you you are but a bird of passagestill i hope you will let us make you welcome at the palace  all the time he was speaking his eyes kept moving rapidly up and down all round me and i felt he was taking in my whole person after these few words he smiled a harsh mechanical smile meant to be gracious and with a courteous bow moved on i turned to matteo and saw him looking after the count very sourly  what is it i asked  he is devilish condescending he answered when last i was here it was hail fellow well met but good god hes put on airs since then  your cousin said something to the same effect i remarked  yes i understand what he meant now  we strolled round the room looking at the people and talking  look i said theres a handsome woman pointing to a voluptuous beauty a massive creature fullbrested and highcoloured  your eye is drawn to a handsome woman like steel to a magnet filippo answered matteo laughing  introduce me i said if she is not ferocious  by no means and she has probably already fixed her eyes upon you but she is wife to ercole piacentini  i dont care i mean to kill the man afterwards but that is no reason why i should not make myself pleasant to his spouse  you will do her a service in both ways he replied and going up to her claudia he said your fatal eyes have transfixed another heart  her sensual lips broke into a smile  have they that power she fixed them on me and made room on the couch on which she was sitting neither matteo nor i were slow to take the hint for i took my place and he his leave i wonder you have not already fallen victim to madonna giulia said claudia looking languorously at me and glancing over to the other lady  one does not worship the moon when the sun is shining i replied politely  giulia is more like the sun for she gathers all men in her embrace i am more modest  i understood that the rival beauties were not good friends  you boast that you are cruel i replied she did not answer but sighed deeply smiling and fixed on me her great liquid eyes  oh there is my husband i looked up and saw the great ercole glaring viciously at me i laughed within myself  he must be very jealous of so beautiful a wife i asked  he torments me to death  under these circumstances i thought i would pursue my advantage i pressed closer to her  i can understand it the first moment i saw you i felt my head whirl  she gave me a very long glance from beneath her eyelashes i seized her hand  those eyes i said looking into them fervently  ah she sighed again  madam said a pageboy coming up to her messer piacentini begs that you will come to him  she gave a little cry of annoyance  my husband then rising from her seat she turned to me holding out her hand i immediately offered my arm and we solemnly crossed the room to ercole piacentini here she bowed very graciously to me and i smiled on the happy husband with the utmost sweetness while he looked very grim and took not the faintest notice of me then i marched off feeling particularly pleased with myself  the count and countess were on the point of taking their departure they were followed by ercole and his wife the remaining guests soon went and in a little while there were left only matteo and myself two other men and checco     iii   checco led us to a smaller room at some distance from the great hall of the reception then turning to a man i did not know he said did you hear the piacentini  yes he answered and for a moment they looked at one another silently  he would not have been so bold without good cause added the man  i was told that his name was lodovico pansecchi and that he was a soldier in the counts pay  checco turned round and looked at me sharply matteo understood what he meant and said have no fear of filippo he is as safe as myself  checco nodded and made a sign to a youth who immediately rose and carefully closed the door we sat still for a while then checco stood up and said impatiently i cannot understand it he walked up and down the room stopping at last in front of me  you had never seen that man before  never i answered  the quarrel was brought on solely by ercole himself said the youth whom i found to be alessandro moratini a brother of giulia dall aste  i know said checco but he would never have dared to behave thus unless he knew of some design of girolamo he paused a moment to think then turning to me again you must not challenge him  on the contrary i replied i must challenge him he has insulted me  i dont care about that i will not have you challenge him  this concerns myself alone  nonsense you are a guest of my house and for all i know it is just such an opportunity as this that girolamo is seeking  i dont understand i said  listen said checco sitting down again when sixtus obtained possession of forli for his nephew girolamo riario i like the fool i was did all i could to bring the town to his allegiance my father was against the plan but i bore down his opposition and threw the whole power of my house on his side without me he would never have been lord of forli  i remember said matteo you used sixtus to keep the ordelaffi out and you thought girolamo would be a catspaw in our hands  i did not give the city for love of a person i had never seen in my life well this was eight years ago girolamo took off the heaviest taxes granted favours to the town and entered in solemn state with caterina  amid shouts and cheers remarked alessandro  for a while he was more popular than ever the ordelaffi had been and when he went out the people ran to kiss the hem of his garment he spent the great part of his time in rome but he employed the riches of the pope in beautifying forli and when he came it was one round of feasts and balls and gaiety  then pope sixtus died and girolamo settled here for good in the palace which he had commenced building on his accession the feasts and balls and gaiety continued whenever a distinguished stranger passed through the town he was welcomed by the count and his wife with the most lavish hospitality so that forli became renowned for its luxury and riches  the poets ransacked parnassus and the ancients for praises of their rules and the people echoed the panegyrics of the poet  then came the crash i had often warned girolamo for we were intimate friendsthen i told him that he could not continue the splendour which he had used when the wealth of christendom was at his command when he could spend the tribute of a nation on a necklace for caterina he would not listen it was always i cannot be mean and thrifty and he called it policy to be popular he said i must be magnificent the time came when the treasury was empty and he had to borrow he borrowed in rome and florence and milanand all the time he would not retrench but rather as his means became less the extravagance became greater but when he could borrow no more outside he came to the citizens of forli first of course to me and i repeatedly lent him large sums these were not enough and he sent for the richest men of forli and asked them to lend him money naturally they could not refuse but he squandered their money as he had squandered his own and one fine day he assembled the council  ah yes said alessandro i was there then i heard him speak  checco stopped as if for alessandro  he came to the council chamber clad as usual in the richest robes and began talking privately to the senators very courteouslylaughing with them shaking their hands then going to his place he began to speak he talked of his liberality towards them and the benefits he had conferred on the town showed them his present necessities and finally asked them to reimpose the taxes which he had taken off at the beginning of his reign they were all prejudiced against him for many of them had already lent him money privately but there was such a charm in his discourse he was so persuasive that one really could not help seeing the reasonableness of his demand i know i myself would have granted him whatever he asked  he can make one do anything he likes when he once begins talking said lodovico  the council unanimously voted the reimposition of the taxes and girolamo offered them his thanks in his most gracious manner  there was a silence broken by matteo  and then he asked  then answered checco he went to imola and commenced spending there the money that he was gathering here  and what did they think of it in forli  ah when the time came to pay the taxes they ceased their praises of girolamo first they murmured beneath their breath then out loud and soon they cursed him and his wife the count heard of it and came back from imola thinking by his presence to preserve the town in its allegiance but the fool did not know that the sight of him would redouble the anger of the populace they saw his gorgeous costumes the gold and silver dresses of his wife the jewels the feasting and riotry and they knew that it came out of their pockets the food of their children all that they had toiled and worked for was spent on the insane luxury of this papal favourite and his bastard wife  and how has he treated us cried lodovico beating his fist violently down on the table i was in the pay of the duke of calabria and he made me tempting offers so that i left the armies of naples to enter the papal service under him and now for four years i have not received a penny of my salary and when i ask him he puts me aside with gentle words and now he does not even trouble to give me them a few days back i stopped him in the piazza and falling on my knees begged for what he owed me he threw me violently away and said he could not pay meand the jewel on his breast was worth ten times the money he owed me and now he looks at me with frowns me who have served him faithfully as a dog i will not endure it by god i will not he clenched his fists as he spoke trembling with rage  and you know how he has served me said checco i have lent him so much that he has not the face to ask for more and how do you think he has rewarded me because i have not paid certain dues i owe the treasury he sent a sheriff to demand them and when i said i would not pay them at that moment he sent for me and himself asked for the money  what did you do  i reminded him of the money he owed me and he informed me that a private debt had nothing to do with a debt to the state and said that i must pay or the law should take its course  he must be mad said matteo  he is mad mad with pride mad in his extravagance  i tell you said lodovico it cannot be endured  and they tell me that he has said my tongue must be silenced added checco the other day he was talking to giuseppe albicina and he said let checco beware he may go too far and find the hand of the master not so gentle as the hand of the friend  i too have heard him say things which sounded like threats said alessandro  we have all heard it added lodovico when his temper overcomes him he cares not what he says and one discovers then what he and his silent wife have been plotting between them  now sir interrupted checco speaking to me you see how things stand we are on thin ground and the fire is raging beneath us you must promise not to seek further quarrel with this countryman of yours this ercole piacentini he is one of girolamos chiefest favourites and he would not bear to see him touched if you happened to kill him the count would take the opportunity to have us all arrested and we should suffer the fate of the pazzi at florence will you promise  i promise i answered smiling to defer my satisfaction to a fitter opportunity  now gentlemen said checco we can separate  we bade one another goodnight alessandro as he was going said to matteo you must bring your friend to my sister tomorrow she will be glad to see you both  we said we should be enchanted and alessandro and lodovico pansecchi left us  matteo looked at checco meditatively  cousin he said all this looks very like conspiracy  checco started  i cannot help it if the people are dissatisfied with girolamo  but you pursued matteo i imagine you do not greatly care whether the people are taxed or no you knew the taxes would have to come on again sooner or later  has he not insulted me by sending a sheriff to demand his dues  is there nothing further than that asked matteo looking at his cousin steadily  checco lifted his eyes and gazed back into matteos  yes he said at last eight years ago i was girolamos equal now i am his servant i was his friend he loved me like a brotherand then his wife came the daughter of francesco sforza the bastardand gradually he has lifted himself up from me he has been cold and reserved he begins to show himself master and now i am nothing more than a citizen among citizensthe first but not the equal of the master  checco kept silence for a moment and in his quietness i could see the violence of his emotion  this concerns you as well as me matteo you are an orsi and the orsi are not made to be servants i will be no mans servant when i think of this manthis bastard of a popetreating me as beneath him by god i cannot breathe i could roll on the floor and tear my hair with rage do you know that the orsi have been great and rich for three hundred years the medici pale before them for they are burghers and we have been always noble we expelled the ordelaffi because they wished to give us a bastard boy to rule over us and shall we accept this riario i swear i will not endure it  well said said matteo  girolamo shall go as the ordelaffi went by god i swear it  i looked at matteo and i saw that suddenly a passion had caught hold of him his face was red his eyes staring wide and his voice was hoarse and thick  but do not mistake again checco he said we want no foreign rulers the orsi must be the only lords of forli  checco and matteo stood looking at one another then the former shaking himself as if to regain his calmness turned his back on us and left the room matteo strode up and down for a while in thought and then turning to me said come  we went out and returned to our hostelry     iv   next day we went to donna giulias  who is she i asked matteo as we walked along  a widow he answered shortly  further i asked  the scandal of forli  most interesting but how has she gained her reputation  how do i know he answered laughing how do women usually gain their reputations she drove giovanni dall aste into his grave her rivals say she poisoned himbut that is a cheerful libel probably due to claudia piacentini  how long has she been a widow  five or six years  and how has she lived since then  matteo shrugged his shoulders  as widows usually live he answered for my part i really cannot see what inducement a woman in that position has to be virtuous after all one is only young once and had better make the best use of ones youth while it lasts  but has she no relations  certainly she has a father and two brothers but they hear nothing or care nothing besides it may be only scandal after all  you talked as if it were a fact i said  oh no i only say that if it is not a fact she is a very foolish woman now that she has a bad reputation it would be idiotic not to live up to it  you speak with some feeling i remarked laughing  ah answered matteo with another shrug of the shoulders i laid siege to the fort of her virtueand she sallied and retired and mined and countermined advanced and drew back so that i grew weary and abandoned the attack life is not long enough to spend six months in politeness and flattery and then not be sure of the reward at the end  you have a practical way of looking at things  with me you know one woman is very like another it comes to the same in the end and after one has kicked about the world for a few years one arrives at the conclusion that it it does not much matter if they be dark or fair fat or thin  did you tell all this to donna giulia i asked  more or less  what did she think of it  she was cross for a while she wished she had yielded sooner when it was too late it served her right  we had arrived at the house and were ushered in donna giulia greeted us very politely gave me a glance and began talking again to her friends one could see that the men round her were more or less in love for they followed every motion with their eyes disputing her smiles which she scattered in profusion now upon one now upon another i saw she delighted in adulation for the maker of any neat compliment was always rewarded with a softer look and a more charming smile  matteo surpassed the others in the outrageousness of his flattery i thought she must see that he was laughing at her but she accepted everything he said quite seriously and was evidently much pleased  are you not glad to be back in forli she said to him  we all delight to tread the ground you walk on  you have grown very polite during your absence  what other result could have been when i spent my time thinking of the lovely giulia  i am afraid you had other thoughts in naples they say that there the women are all beautiful  naples my dear lady i swear that during all the time i have been away i have never seen a face to compare with yours  her eyes quite shone with pleasure i turned away finding the conversation silly i thought i would do without the pleasant looks of madonna giulia and i decided not to come to her again meanwhile i began talking to one of the other ladies in the room and passed the time agreeably enough in a little while giulia passed me leaning on the arm of one of her admirers i saw her glance at me but i took no notice immediately afterwards she came again hesitating a moment as if she wished to say something but passed on without speaking i thought she was piqued at my inattention to her and with a smile redoubled my attentions to the lady with whom i was talking  messer filippo donna giulia called me if you are not too engaged will you speak to me for one moment  i approached her smiling  i am anxious to hear of your quarrel with ercole piacentini i have heard quite ten different stories  i am surprised that the insolence of an illbred fellow should rouse such interest  we must talk of something in forli the only thing i hear for certain is that he insulted you and you were prevented from getting satisfaction  that will come later  she lowered her voice and took my arm  but my brother tells me that checco dorsi has made you promise to do nothing  i shall get my revengehaving to wait for it will only make it sweeter  then supposing she had nothing further to say to me i stood still as if expecting her to leave me she looked up suddenly  am i incommoding you she said  how could you i replied gallantly  i thought you wanted to get rid of me  how can such an idea have entered your head do you not see that all men lie humble at your feet attentive to every word and gesture  yes she answered but not you  of course i protested  oh she said i saw very well that you avoided me when you came in hereyou hardly came near me  i did not think you would notice my inattention  certainly i noticed it i was afraid i had offended you i could not think how  my dear lady you have certainly done nothing to offend me  then why do you avoid me she asked petulantly  really i said i dont perhaps in my modesty i thought it would be a matter of indifference to you whether i was at your side or not i am sorry i have annoyed you  i dont like people not to like me she said in a plaintive way  but why should you think i do not like you indeed without flattery i can assure you that i think you one of the most beautiful women i have ever seen  a faint blush came over her cheeks and a smile broke out on her lips she looked up at me with a pretty reproachful air  then why dont you let me see it more plainly  i smiled and looking into her eyes was struck by their velvet softness i almost thought she was as charming as she was beautiful  do you really wish to know i said in reply to her question  do tell me she said faintly pressing my arm  i thought you had so many admirers that you could well do without me  but you see she answered charmingly i cannot  and then i have a certain dislike to losing myself in a crowd i did not wish to share your smiles with twenty others  and would you for that refuse them altogether  i have always avoided the woman who is the object of general admiration i think i am too proud to struggle for favours i would rather dispense with them  but then supposing the lady wishes to favour you especially you do not give her the opportunity  that is so rare i replied that it is not worth while breaking the rule  but it may happen  i shrugged my shoulders she paused a moment and then said  you do like me then after all  i saw a slight trembling of the lip perhaps the eyes were a little moist i felt sorry for what i had done  i fear i have given you pain i said  you have a little she replied  i am sorry i thought you did not care  i like people to love me and be pleased with me  i do both  then you must show it she replied a smile breaking through the beginning of tears  i really had been brutal and i was very sorry that i had caused a cloud to gather over her sunshiny nature she was indeed very sweet and charming  well we are good friends now arent we she said  of course  and youll come and see me often  as often as you will allow me to i answered she gave me her hand to kiss and a bright happy smile lit up her face  a rivederci she said  we went home and matteo found waiting for him a message from checco bidding him leave the inn and take up his quarters with me at the palazzo orsi on arriving we found checco excitedly walking up and down a long corridor lined with statues and pictures  i am glad you have come he said to matteo taking his hand and nodding you must stay here we must all keep together now for anything may happen  what do you mean asked matteo  the catastrophe nearly came today  we both looked at him with astonishment not comprehending checco stood still abruptly  he tried to arrest me todaygirolamo then speaking very quickly as if labouring under great excitement i had to go to the palace on business i found him in the audience chamber and we began to talk certain matters over and i grew rather heated suddenly i noticed that the place had emptied itself i stopped in the midst of my sentence and looked up at girolamo i saw he was not attending to me his eyes were fixed on the door  checco was silent and drops of perspiration were standing on his forehead  yes yes we both said eagerly  the door opened and the master of the guard walked in by god i thought im trapped i have been waiting for you andrea said girolamo then he turned to me and said come into the room of the nymphs checco i have some papers there to show you he took hold of my arm i loosed myself i pray you excuse me i said i have some very urgent business i walked to the door andrea glanced at his master and i thought he was going to bar my way i think he was waiting for some sign but before it came i had seen through the open door paolo bruni and i called out paolo paolo wait for me i want to talk to you urgently then i knew i was safe he dared not touch me and i turned round and said again i pray you excuse me my business with paolo is a matter of life or death i brushed past andrea and got out by heaven how i breathed when i found myself in the piazza  but are you sure he meant to arrest you said matteo  certain what else  andrea might have come in by accident there may have been nothing in it at all  i was not deceived answered checco earnestly their looks betrayed themandreas questioning glance i know he wants to kill me  but would he dare seize you in cold blood  he cares for nothing when he has an object in view besides when he had me in his power what could have been done i know girolamo too well there would have been a mock trial and i should have been condemned or else he would have me strangled in my cell and when i had gone you would have been helplessmy father is too old and there would have been no leader to the party but youand what could you do alone  we all remained silent for a while then checco broke out  i know he wants to rid himself of me he has threatened before but has never gone so far as this  i agree with you said matteo things are becoming grave  it is not so much for myself i care but what would happen to my children my father is safehe is so old and helpless that they would never think of touching himbut my boys caterina would throw them into prison without a scruple  well said matteo what will you do  what can i do he answered i have been racking my brains and i see no way of safety i can wear a coat of mail to preserve me from the stray knife of an assassin but that will not help me against a troop of soldiers i can leave forli but that is to abandon everything  no you must not leave forlianything but that  what can i do what can i do he stamped his foot on the ground as if almost in desperation  one thing said matteo you must not go about alonealways with at least two friends  yes i have thought of that but how will it all turn out it cannot last what can i do  he turned to me  what do you think he said he means to kill me  why not anticipate him i answered quietly  they both started up with a cry  kill him  assassination i dare not i dare not said checco very excitedly i will do all i can by fair means but assassination  i shrugged my shoulders  it seems a matter of selfpreservation i said  no no i wont speak of it i wont think of it he began again to walk excitedly up and down the room i wont think of it i tell you i could not  neither matteo nor i spoke  why dont you speak he said to matteo impatiently  i am thinking he answered  not of that i forbid you to think of that i will not have it then after a pause abruptly as if he were angry with us and with himself leave me     v   a few days later matteo came to me as i was dressing having rescued my clothes from him  i wonder youre not ashamed to go out in those garments he remarked people will say that you wear my old things  i took no notice of the insult  where are you going he asked  to madonna giulia  but you went there yesterday  that is no reason why i should not go today she asked me to come  thats very obliging of her im sure then after a pause during which i continued my toilet i have been gathering the news of forli  oh  madonna giulia has been affording a great deal of interest  you have been talking to the lady whom you call the beautiful claudia i said  by the way why have you not been to her  i really dont know i said why should i  you told me you had progressed a long way in her favours during the halfhours talk you had with her the other night have you not followed up the advantage  i shrugged my shoulders  i dont think i like a woman to make all the advances  dont you said matteo i do  besides i dont care for the type she is too massive  she feels very much hurt at your neglect she says you have fallen in love with giulia  that is absurd i replied and as to her being hurt at my neglect i am very sorry but i dont feel any obligation to throw myself into the arms of every woman who chooses to open them  i quite agree with you neither she nor giulia are a bit better than they should be im told giulias latest lover is amtrogio della treccia it seems one day he was almost caught by old bartolomeo and had to slip out of the window and perform feats worthy of a professional acrobat to get out of the way  i dont think i attach belief to all the scandal circulating on the subject of that lady  youre not in love with her asked matteo quickly  i laughed  certainly not but still  thats all right because of course you know its notorious that she has had the most disgraceful amours and she hasnt even kept them to her own class all sorts of people have enjoyed her favours  she does not look very much like a messalina i said sneering a little  honestly filippo i do think she is really very little better than a harlot  you are extremely charitable i said but dont you think you are somewhat prejudiced by the fact that you yourself did not find her one besides her character makes no particular difference to me i really care nothing if shes good or bad she is agreeable and that is all i care about she is not going to be my wife  she may make you very unhappy you wont be the first  what a fool you are i said a little angrily you seem to think that because i go and see a woman i must be dying of love for her you are absurd  i left him and soon found myself at the palazzo aste where donna giulia was waiting for me i had been to see her nearly every day since my arrival in forli for i really liked her naturally i was not in love with her as matteo suggested and i had no intention of entering into that miserable state i had found her charmingly simple very different from the monster of dissipation she was supposed to be she must have been three or fourandtwenty but in all her ways she was quite girlish merry and thoughtless full of laughter at one moment and then some trifling thing would happen to discompose her and she would be brought to the verge of tears but a word or caress even a compliment would make her forget the unhappiness which had appeared so terrible and in an instant she would be wreathed in smiles she seemed so delightfully fragile so delicate so weak that one felt it necessary to be very gentle with her i could not imagine how anyone could use a hard word to her face  her eyes lit up as she saw me  how long youve been she said i thought you were never coming  she always seemed so glad so see you that you thought she must have been anxiously awaiting you and that you were the very person of all others that she wished to have with her of course i knew it was an affectation but it was a very charming one  come and sit by me here she said making room for me on a couch then when i had sat down she nestled close up to me in her pretty childish way as if seeking protection now tell me all youve been doing  ive been talking to matteo i said  what about  you  tell me what he said  nothing to your credit my dear i said laughing  poor matteo she answered hes such a clumsy lumbering creature one can see hes spent half his life in camps  and i i have spent the same life as matteo am i a clumsy lumbering creature  oh no she answered you are quite different she put the pleasantest compliments in the look of her eyes  matteo told me all sorts of scandal about you she blushed a little  did you believe it  i said i did not much care if it were true or not  but do you believe it she asked insisting  if youll tell me it is not true i will believe absolutely what you say  the little anxious look on her face gave way to a bright smile  of course it is not true  how beautiful you are when you smile i remarked irrelevantly you should always smile  i always do on you she answered she opened her mouth as if about to speak held back as if unable to make up her mind then said did matteo tell you he made love to me once and was very angry because i would not pick up the handkerchief which he had condescended to throw  he mentioned it  since then i am afraid he has not had very much good to say of me  i had thought at the time that matteo was a little bitter in his account of donna giulia and i felt more inclined to believe her version of the story than his  he has been beseeching me not to fall in love with you i said  she laughed  claudia piacentini has been telling everyone that it is too late and she is horribly jealous  has she matteo also seemed certain i was in love with you  and are you she asked suddenly  no i replied with great promptness  brutta bestia she said throwing herself to the end of the couch and beginning to pout  i am very sorry i said laughing but i cannot help it  i think it is horrid of you she remarked  you have so many adorers i said in expostulation  yes but i want more she smiled  but what good can it do you to have all these people in love with you  i dont know she said it is a pleasant sensation  what a child you are i answered laughing  she bent forward seriously  but are you not at all in love with me  i shook my head she came close up to me so that her hair brushed lightly against my cheek it sent a shiver through me i looked at her tiny ear it was beautifully shaped transparent as a pink shell unconsciously quite without intention i kissed it she pretended to take no notice and i was full of confusion i felt myself blushing furiously  are you quite sure she said gravely  i got up to go foolishly rather angry with myself  when shall i see you again i asked  i am going to confession tomorrow be at san stefano at ten and we can have a little talk in the church when i have finished     vi   there had been a great commotion in forli during the last two days for it had become known that the country people of the counts domain had sent a petition for the removal of certain taxes which pressed so heavily upon them that the land was speedily going to ruin the proprietors were dismissing their labourers the houses of the peasants were falling into decay and in certain districts the poverty had reached such a height that the farmers had not even grain wherewith to sow their fields and all around the ground was lying bare and desolate a famine had been the result and if the previous year the countrymen had found it difficult to pay their taxes this year they found it impossible girolamo had listened to their arguments and knew them to be true after considering with his councillors he had resolved to remit certain of the more oppressive taxes but in doing this he was confronted with the fact that his treasury was already empty and that if the income were further diminished it would be impossible for him to meet the demands of the coming year  it was clear that the country could not pay and it was clear that the money must be procured he set his eyes on the town and saw that it was rich and flourishing but he dared not on his own initiative propose any increase in its burdens he called a council showed the state of his affairs and asked the elders for advice no one stirred or spoke at last antonio lassi a creature of the count whom he had raised to the council from a humble position rose to his feet and gave utterance to the plan which his master had suggested to him the pith of it was to abrogate the taxes on the country people and in compensation place others on certain foodstuffs and wines which had previously gone free girolamo answered in a studied speech pretending great unwillingness to charge what were the necessaries of life and asked several of the more prominent members what they thought of the suggestion they had met antonio lassis speech with silence and now applauded girolamos answer they agreed with him that such taxes should not be then the count changed his tone he said it was the only means of raising the money and gathering anger from their sullen looks and their silence he told them that if they would not give their sanction to the decree he would do without their sanction then breaking short he asked them for their answer the councillors looked at one another rather pale but determined and the reply came from one after the other quietly  nonono  antonio lassi was cowed and dared not give his answer at all the count with an oath beat his fist on the table and said i am determined to be lord and master here and you shall learn all of you that my will is law  with that he dismissed them  when the people heard the news there was great excitement the murmurs against the count which had hitherto been cautiously expressed were now cried out in the marketplace the extravagance of the countess was bitterly complained of and the townsmen gathered together in groups talking heatedly of the proposed exaction occasionally breaking out into open menace it was very like sedition  on the day after the council the head of the customs had been almost torn to pieces by the people as he was walking towards the palace and on his way back he was protected by a troop of soldiers antonio lassi was met everywhere with hoots and cries and checco dorsi meeting him in the loggia of the piazza had assailed him with taunts and bitter sarcasms ercole piacentini interposed and the quarrel nearly ended in a brawl but checco with difficulty restraining himself withdrew before anything happened  on leaving donna giulia i walked to the piazza and found the same restlessness as on the preceding days through all these people a strange commotion seemed to pass a tremor like the waves of the sea everywhere little knots of people were listening eagerly to some excited speaker no one seemed able to work the tradesmen were gathered at their doors talking with one another idlers were wandering to and fro now joining themselves to one group now to another  suddenly there was a silence part of the crowd began looking eagerly in one direction and the rest in their curiosity surged to the end of the piazza to see what was happening then it was seen that caterina was approaching she entered the place and all eyes were fixed upon her as usual she was magnificently attired her neck and hands and arms her waistband and headgear shone with jewels she was accompanied by several of her ladies and two or three soldiers as guard the crowd separated to let her pass and she walked proudly between the serried rows of people her head uplifted and her eyes fixed straight in front as if she were unaware that anyone was looking at her a few obsequiously took off their hats but most gave no greeting all around her was silence a few murmurs an oath or two muttered under breath but that was all she walked steadily on and entered the palace gates at once a thousand voices burst forth and after the deadly stillness the air seemed filled with confused sounds curses and imprecations were hurled on her from every side they railed at her pride they called her foul names six years before when she happened to cross the streets the people had hurried forward to look at her with joy in their hearts and blessings on their lips they vowed they would die for her they were in ecstasies at her graciousness  i went home thinking of all these things and of donna giulia i was rather amused at my unintentional kiss i wondered if she was thinking of me she really was a charming creature and i was glad at the idea of seeing her again on the morrow i liked her simple fervent piety she was in the habit of going regularly to mass and happening to see her one day i was struck with her devout air full of faith she also went to confessional frequently it was rather absurd to think she was the perverse being people pretended  when i reached the palazzo orsi i found the same excitement as outside in the piazza girolamo had heard of the dispute in the loggia and had sent for checco to hear his views on the subject of the tax the audience was fixed for the following morning at eleven and as checco never went anywhere without attendants scipione moratini giulias second brother and i were appointed to accompany him matteo was not to go for fear of the presence of the two most prominent members of the family tempting the count to some sudden action  the following morning i arrived at san stefano at halfpast nine and to my surprise found giulia waiting for me  i did not think you would be out of the confessional so soon i said were your sins so small this week  i havent been she answered scipione told me that you and he were to accompany checco to the palace and i thought you would have to leave here early so i postponed the confessional  you have preferred earth and me to heaven and the worthy father  you know i would do more for you than that she answered  you witch  she took my arm  come she said come and sit in one of the transept chapels it is quiet and dark there  it was deliciously cool the light came dimly through the coloured glass clothing the marble of the chapel in mysterious reds and purples and the air was faintly scented with incense sitting there she seemed to gain a new charm before i had never really appreciated the extreme beauty of the brown hair tinged with red its wonderful quality and luxuriance i tried to think of something to say but could not i sat and looked at her and the perfumes of her body blended with the incense  why dont you speak she said  im sorry i have nothing to say  she laughed  tell me of what you are thinking  i darent i said  she looked at me repeating the wish with her eyes  i was thinking you were very beautiful  she turned to me and leant forward so that her face was close to mine her eyes acquired a look of deep voluptuous languor we sat without speaking and my head began to whirl  the clock struck ten  i must go i said breaking the silence  yes she answered but come tonight and tell me what has happened  i promised i would then asked whether i should lead her to another part of the church  no leave me here she said it is so good and quiet i will stay and think  of what i said  she did not speak but she smiled so that i understood her answer     vii   i hurried back to the palazzo and found scipione moratini already arrived i liked him for his sisters sake but in himself he was a pleasant person  both he and his brother had something of giulia in themthe delicate features the fascination and the winning ways which in them seemed almost effeminate their mother had been a very beautiful womanreport said somewhat gayand it was from her the sons had got the gallantry which made them the terror of husbands in forli and giulia the coquetry which had given rise to so much scandal the father bartolomeo was quite different he was a rugged upright man of sixty very grave and very dignified the only resemblance of feature to his children being the charming smile which the sons possessed as well as giulia though in him it was rarely seen what i liked most in him was the blind love for his daughter leading him to unbend and become a youth to flatter her folly he was really devoted to her so that it was quite pathetic to see the look of intense affection in his eyes as he followed her movements he of course had never heard a word of the rumours circulating about giulia he had the utmost faith in her virtue and i it seems to me had gained faith from him  after talking a while with scipione checco came and we started for the palazzo the people in forli know everything and were well aware of checcos mission as we walked along we were met by many kind greetings good luck and god speed were wished us and checco beaming with joy graciously returned the salutations  we were ushered into the council chamber where we found the councillors and many of the more prominent citizens and several gentlemen of the court immediately the great folding doors were opened and girolamo entered with his wonted state accompanied by his courtiers and menatarms so that the hall was filled with them he took his seat on a throne and graciously bowed to the left and to the right his courtiers responded but the citizens preserved a severe aspect quite unsympathetic towards his condescension  girolamo rose to his feet and made a short speech in which he extolled checcos wisdom and knowledge and patriotism saying he had heard of a controversy between him and antonio lassi on the subject of the proposed tax and consequently had sent for him to hear his opinion on the subject  he stopped and looked round his courtiers obsequiously applauded then at opposite ends of the room doors opened and through each filed a string of soldiers the citizens looked at one another wondering a flourish of trumpets was heard in the piazza outside and the tramp of soldiers girolamo waited at last he proceeded  a good prince owes this to his subjectsto do nothing against their will freely expressed and though i could command for i am placed here by the vicar of christ himself with absolute power over your lives and fortunes yet such is my love and affection towards you that i do not disdain to ask your advice  the courtiers broke out into a murmur of surprise and selfcongratulation at his infinite graciousness the trumpets flourished again and in the succeeding silence could be heard cries of command from the officers in the square while from the soldiers standing about the hall there was a clank of swords and spurs  checco rose from his seat he was pale and he almost seemed to hesitate i wondered if the soldiers had had the effect which girolamo intended then he began to speak quietly in even wellturned sentences so that one could see the speech had been carefully thought out  he called to mind his own affection for girolamo and the mutual friendship which had solaced many hours of doubt and difficulty and assured him of his unalterable fidelity to himself and his family then he reminded him of the love borne by the people towards their ruler and their consciousness of an equal love on the part of the count towards themselves he drew a picture of the joy in forli when first girolamo came to it and of the enthusiasm caused by the sight of him or his wife walking through the streets  there was a little applause chiefly from the counts suite checco paused as if he had come to the end of his preface and were gathering himself up for the real matter of his speech there was deadly silence in the hall all eyes were fixed on him and all minds were asking themselves what will he say girolamo was leaning forward resting his chin on his hand looking anxious i wondered if he regretted that he had called the meeting  checco resumed his speech  girolamo he said the people from the country districts lately sent you a petition in which they showed their sufferings from rain and storm and famine their poverty and misery the oppressiveness of the taxes they bade you come and look at their untilled fields their houses falling to ruin themselves dying by the roadside naked and hungry children expiring at their mothers breasts parents lying unburied in the ruin of their home they bade you come and look at the desolation of the land and implored you to help them while there was yet time and lighten from their backs the burdens you had laid upon them  you turned an eye of pity on them and now the land smiles the people have shaken themselves from their sleep of death and awakened to new life and everywhere prayers are offered and blessings rained on the head of the most high and magnificent prince girolamo riario  and we too my lord join in the thanks and praise for these to whom you have given new life are our cousins and brothers our fellowcountrymen  what was coming the councillors looked at one another questioningly could checco have made terms with the count and was it a comedy they were playing girolamo also was surprised he had not for long heard praise from any but his courtiers  eight years ago when you acquired the sovereignty of forli you found the town weighed down under the taxes which the ordelaffi had imposed depression had seized hold of the merchants and tradesmen they were burdened so that they could not buy nor sell they had given up effort and the town was lying numb and cold as if dying from a pestilence the streets were deserted such people as there were moved sadly and with downturned faces the inhabitants were becoming fewer there was no motion no life a few years more and forli would have become a city of the dead  but you came and with you life for your first deed was to remove the most oppressive imposts as the bow doubled up when the string is loosened shoots back with a sudden impulse which propels the arrow to its mark so forli rebounded from the weight it had borne before the goddess of plenty reigned in the land it was the sunlight after storm everywhere life and activity the merchant wrote busily at his desk the tradesman spread his wares anew and laughed in the joy of his heart the mason the builder the blacksmith returned to their work and through the city was heard the sound of hammering and building the news spread of a beneficent lord and the goldsmith and silversmith the painter the sculptor came to the city in throngs the money passed from hand to hand and in its passage seemed to increase by magic on the faces of all was happiness the apprentice sang as he worked and mirth and joy were universal forli became known as the home of delight italy rang with its feasts and celebrationsand every citizen was proud to be a forlivese  and everywhere prayers were offered and blessings rained on the head of the most high and magnificent prince girolamo riario  checco paused again an inkling of his meaning was coming to his hearers but they dared not think he would say what was in all their minds  then checco went on you reimposed the taxes which you had taken off  that is a lie interrupted girolamo they were imposed by the council  checco shrugged his shoulders smiling ironically  i remember quite well you called a meeting of the ancients and showing them your necessities suggested that they should reimpose the taxes  i forget if you reminded them that you could command and that you were placed here by the vicar of christ on earth  and you forebore to let us hear the ring of trumpets and the tramp of soldiery in the square nor did you think so numerous a suite necessary for your dignity  he looked round at the soldiers thoughtfully stroking his beard  proceed said girolamo impatiently he was beginning to get angry  checco in talking had recovered the assurance which at first seemed to fail him he smiled politely at the counts command and said  i will come to the point at once  you replaced the taxes which you had taken away and thereby undid the benefit you had done the town soon felt the effect of the change its prosperity is already declining and it is not doubtful that a few years more will bring it to the condition in which you found it and who knows perhaps its last state may be worse than its first  and now you propose to make the townspeople pay the duties which you have taken off the countryfolk you have sent for me to ask my advice on the subject and here i give it you  do not put on but take off in the name of the people i beseech you to do away with the taxes you imposed four years ago and return to the happy state of the first years of your rule  he paused a moment then with outstretched arm pointing to the count he added solemnly or girolamo riario the magnificent prince may share the fate of the ordelaffi who ruled the town for two centuries and now wander homeless about the land  there was a cry all round the room they were astounded at his audacity girolamo had started in his chairhis eyes were staring his face red he was dumb with rage he tried to speak but the words died in his throat and nothing was heard but an inarticulate murmur the soldiers and courtiers were looking at one another in surprise they did not know what to do or think they looked at their master but found no help in him the citizens were bewildered and by turns felt wonder dismay fear pleasure they could not understand  oh girolamo said checco unmindful of the excitement round him i do not say these things in enmity to you come among your people yourself and see their wants with your own eyes do not believe what your courtiers tell youdo not think the land in your charge is a captured town which you can spoil at your pleasure you have been placed here as a guardian in our perils and an assistance in our necessities  you are a stranger here you do not know this people as i know it they will be faithful meek obedientbut do not rob them of the money they have hardly earned or they will turn against you forli has never supported an oppressor and if you oppress them beware of their wrath what do you think are these soldiers of yours against the wrath of a people and are you so sure of your soldiers will they take part for you against their fathers and brothers their children  be quiet girolamo had risen from his seat and was standing with his arm threateningly upraised he shouted so as to drown checco be quiet you have always been against me checco he cried you have hated me because i have overwhelmed you with bounty there has never been trouble between me and my people but you have come to make them more bitter against me  you lie said checco passionately  oh i know you checco and your pride as satan fell by pride so may you notwithstanding all your riches and power you thought you were my equal and because you found me your master you gnashed your teeth and cursed me  by god you would kill me if you could  checco lost his calm and gesticulating wildly shouted back at girolamo  i have hated you because you are a tyrant to this town are these not my fellowcitizens my brothers my friends have we not been together since childhood and our fathers and grandfathers before us and do you think i look upon them as you who are a stranger  no so long as you obtained money from the rich i said nothing you know what sums i have myself lent you all that i freely give you i do not want a penny of it backkeep it all but when you have extorted the uttermost from us and you turn to the poor and needy and rob them of their little then i will not keep silence you shall not impose these taxes on the people and why is it you want them for your riotous insane extravagance so that you may build yourself new palaces and deck yourself in gorgeous robes and buy diamonds and precious stones for your wife  do not speak of my wife interrupted the count  so that you may pile gold in the hands of the parasite who makes a sonnet in your praise you came to us and begged for money we gave it and you flung it away in feasts and riotry the very coat you wear was made out of our riches but you have no right to take the money of the people for these ignoble uses you are not their master you are their servant their money is not yours but yours is theirs your duty before god is to protect them and instead you rob them  be silent broke in girolamo i will hear no more you have outraged me as no man has ever done without repenting it you think you are allpowerful checco but by god you shall find that i am more powerful  now go all of you i have had enough of this scene go  he waved his hand imperiously then with a look of intense rage he descended from his throne and scowling flung himself out of the room     viii   the courtiers followed on their masters heels but the soldiers stood undecided ercole piacentini looked at us and spoke in an undertone to the captain of the guard i thought they were discussing the possibility of boldly arresting checco on the spot which they doubtless knew would be a step very acceptable to girolamo but he was surrounded by his friends and evidently whatever ercole and the captain wished they dared nothing for the former quietly left the chamber and the soldiers on a whispered order slid silently from the room like whipped dogs  then the excitement of our friends knew no bounds i at the end of the speech had seized his hand and said  well done  now he was standing in the midst of all these people happy and smiling proud of the enthusiasm he had aroused breathing heavily so that a casual observer might have thought him drunk with wine  my friends he said in answer to their praises and his voice slightly trembled so that his sincerity was conspicuous whatever happens be sure that i will continue to uphold your rights and that i will willingly give my life for the cause of justice and freedom  he was choked by the violence of his emotion and could say nothing more  the cries of approbation were renewed and then with an impulse to get into the open air they surged out of the council chamber into the piazza it was not exactly known what had passed in the palace but the people knew that checco had braved the count and that the latter had broken up the meeting in anger wonderful rumours were going about it was said that swords had been drawn and there had almost been a battle others said that the count had tried to arrest checco and this story gaining credencesome even saying that checco was being kept a prisonerhad worked the citizens to fever height  when checco appeared there was a great shout and a rush towards him bravo well done i dont know what they did not find to say in praise of him their enthusiasm grew by its own fire they went mad they could not contain themselves and they looked about for something on which to vent their feeling a word and they would have attacked the palace or sacked the customhouse they surrounded us and would not let us pass bartolomeo moratini pushed his way to checco and said  quiet them quickly before it is too late  checco understood at once friends he said let me pass quietly for the love of god and do you return to your work in peace let me pass  moving forward the crowd opened to him and still shouting yelling and gesticulating allowed him to go through when we arrived at the gate of his palace he turned to me and said  by god filippo this is life i shall never forget this day  the crowd had followed to the door and would not go away checco had to appear on the balcony and bow his thanks as he stood there i could see that his head was whirling he was pale almost senseless with his great joy  at last the people were persuaded to depart and we entered the house  we were in checcos private room besides the cousins and myself were present bartolomeo moratini and his two sons fabio oliva and cesare gnocchi both related on the mothers side to the orsi we were all restless and excited discussing the events that had occurred only bartolomeo was quiet and grave matteo in the highest of spirits turned to him  why so silent messer bartolomeo he said you are like the skeleton at the banquet  it is a matter for gravity he answered  why  why good god man do you suppose nothing has happened  we stopped talking and stood round him as if suddenly awakened  our ships are burnt behind us he proceeded and we must advancemust  what do you mean said checco  do you suppose girolamo is going to allow things to go on as before you must be mad checco  i believe i am was the answer all this has turned my head go on  girolamo has only one step open to him now you have braved him publicly you have crossed the streets in triumph amid the acclamation of the people and they have accompanied you to your house with shouts of joy girolamo sees in you a rivaland from a rival there is only one safeguard  and that asked checco  is death  we were all silent for a moment then bartolomeo spoke again  he cannot allow you to live he has threatened you before but now he must carry his threats into effect take care  i know said checco the sword is hanging over my head but he dare not arrest me  perhaps he will try assassination you must go out well guarded  i do said checco and i wear a coat of mail the fear of assassination has been haunting me for weeks oh god it is terrible i could bear an open foe i have courage as much as anyone but this perpetual suspense i swear to you it is making me a coward i cannot turn the corner of a street without thinking that my death may be on the other side i cannot go through a dark corridor at night without thinking that over there in the darkness my murderer may be waiting for me i start at the slightest sound the banging of a door a sudden step and i awake in the night with a cry sweating i cannot stand it i shall go mad if it continues what can i do  matteo and i looked at one another we had the same thought bartolomeo spoke  anticipate him  we both started for they were my very words checco gave a cry  you too that thought has been with me night and day anticipate him kill him but i dare not think of it i cannot kill him  you must said bartolomeo  take care we are not heard said oliva  the doors are well fastened  you must repeated bartolomeo it is the only course left you and what is more you must make hastefor he will not delay the lives of all of us are at stake he will not be satisfied with you after you are gone he will easily enough find means to get rid of us  hold your peace bartolomeo for gods sake it is treachery  of what are you frightened it would not be difficult  no we must have no assassination it always turns out badly the pazzi in florence were killed salviati was hanged from the palace windows and lorenzo is allpowerful while the bones of the conspirators rot in unconsecrated ground and at milan when they killed the duke not one of them escaped  they were fools we do not mistake as in florence we have the people with us and we shall not bungle it as they did  no no it cannot be  i tell you it must it is our only safety  checco looked round anxiously  we are all safe said oliva have no fear  what do you think of it asked checco i know what you think filippo and matteo  i think with my father said scipione  i too said his brother  and i  and i  every one of you said checco you would have me murder him  it is just and lawful  remember that he was my friend i helped him to this power once we were almost brothers  but now he is your deadly enemy he is sharpening a knife for your heartand if you do not kill him he will kill you  it is treachery i cannot  when a man has killed another the law kills him it is a just revenge when a man attempts anothers life the law permits him to kill that man in selfdefence girolamo has killed you in thoughtand at this moment he may be arranging the details of your murder it is just and lawful that you take his life to defend your own and ours  bartolomeo is right said matteo  a murmur of approval showed what the others thought  but think bartolomeo said checco you are greyheaded you are not so very far from the tomb if you killed this man what of afterwards  i swear to you checco that you would be a minister of gods vengeance has he not madly oppressed the people what right has he more than another through him men and women and children have died of want unhappiness and misery have gone through the landand all the while he has been eating and drinking and making merry  make up your mind checco you must give way to us said matteo girolamo has failed in every way on the score of honesty and justice he must die and to save us he must die  you drive me mad said checco all of you are against me you are right in all you say but i cannotoh god i cannot  bartolomeo was going to speak again but checco interrupted him  no no for heavens sake say nothing more leave me alone i want to be quiet and think     ix   in the evening at ten i went to the palazzo aste the servant who let me in told me that donna giulia was at her fathers and he did not know when she would be back i was intensely disappointed i had been looking forward all day to seeing her for the time in church had been so short the servant looked at me as if expecting me to go away and i hesitated but then i had such a desire to see her that i told him i would wait  i was shown into the room i already knew so well and i sat down in giulias chair i rested my head on the cushions which had pressed against her beautiful hair her cheek and i inhaled the fragrance which they had left behind them  how long she was why did she not come  i thought of her sitting there in my mind i saw the beautiful soft brown eyes the red lips her mouth was exquisite very delicately shaped with wonderful curves it was for such a mouth as hers that the simile of cupids bow had been invented  i heard a noise below and i went to the door to listen my heart beat violently but alas it was not she and bitterly disappointed i returned to the chair i thought i had been waiting hours and every hour seemed a day would she never come  at last the door opened and she came inso beautiful she gave me both her hands  i am sorry you have had to wait she said but i could not help it  i would wait a hundred years to see you for an hour  she sat down and i lay at her feet  tell me she said all that has happened today  i did as she asked and as i gave my story her eyes sparkled and her cheeks flushed i dont know what came over me i felt a sensation of swooning and at the same time i caught for breath and i had a sudden impulse to take her in my arms and kiss her many times  how lovely you are i said raising myself to her side  she did not answer but looked at me smiling her eyes glistened with tears her bosom heaved  giulia  i put my arm round her and took her hands in mine  giulia i love you  she bent over to me and put forward her face and thenthen i took her in my arms and covered her mouth with kisses oh god i was mad i had never tasted such happiness before her beautiful mouth it was so soft so small i gasped in the agony of my happiness if i could only have died then  giulia giulia                                       the cock crew and the night seemed to fade away into greyness the first light of dawn broke through the windows and i pressed my love to my heart in one last kiss  not yet she said i love you  i could not speak i kissed her eyes her cheeks her breasts  dont go she said  my love  at last i tore myself away and as i gave her the last kiss of all she whispered  come soon  and i replied  tonight  i walked through the grey streets of forli wondering at my happiness it was too great to realise it seemed absurd that i a poor commonplace man should be chosen out for this ecstasy of bliss i had been buffeted about the world an exile wandering here and there in search of a captain under whom to serve i had had loves before but common grotesque thingsnot like this pure and heavenly with my other loves i had often felt a certain ugliness about them they had seemed sordid and vulgar but this was so pure so clean she was so saintly and innocent oh it was good and i laughed at myself for thinking i was not in love with her i had loved her always when it began i did not know  and i did not care all that interested me now was to think of myself loving and beloved i was not worthy of her she was so good so kind and i a poor mean wretch i felt her a goddess and i could have knelt down and worshipped her  i walked through the streets of forli with swinging steps i breathed in the morning air and felt so strong and well and young everything was beautifulall life the grey walls enchanted me the sombre carvings of the churches the market women gaily dressed entering the town laden with baskets of manycoloured fruit they gave me greeting and i answered with a laughing heart how kind they were indeed my heart was so full of love that it welled over and covered everything and everybody so that i felt a strange hearty kindness to all around me i loved mankind     x   when i got home i threw myself on my bed and enjoyed a delightful sleep and when i awoke felt cool and fresh and very happy  what is the matter with you asked matteo  i am rather contented with myself i said  then if you want to make other people contented you had better come with me to donna claudia  the beautiful claudia  the same  but can we venture in the enemys camp  that is exactly why i want you to come the idea is to take no notice of the events of yesterday and that we should all go about as if nothing had happened  but messer piacentini will not be very glad to see us  he will be grinding his teeth and inwardly spitting fire but he will take us to his arms and embrace us and try to make us believe he loves us with the most christian affection  very well come on  donna claudia at all events was delighted to see us and she began making eyes and sighing and putting her hand to her bosom in the most affecting manner  why have you not been to see me messer filippo she asked  indeed madam i was afraid of being intrusive  ah she said with a sweeping glance how could you be no there was another reason for your absence alas  i dared not face those lustrous eyes  she turned them full on me and then turned them up madonnawise showing the whites  are they so cruel do you think  they are too brilliant how dangerous to the moth is the candle and in this case the candle is twain  but they say the moth as it flutters in the flame enjoys a perfection of ecstasy  ah but i am a very sensible moth i answered in a matteroffact tone and i am afraid of burning my wings  how prosaic she murmured  the muse i said politely loses her force when you are present  she evidently did not quite understand what i meant for there was a look of slight bewilderment in her eyes and i was not surprised for i had not myself the faintest notion of my meaning still she saw it was a compliment  ah you are very polite  we paused a moment during which we both looked unutterable things at one another then she gave a deep sigh  why so sad sweet lady i asked  messer filippo she answered i am an unhappy woman she hit her breast with her hand  you are too beautiful i remarked gallantly  ah no ah no i am unhappy  i glanced at her husband who was stalking grimly about the room looking like a retired soldier with the gout and i thought that to be in the society of such a person was enough to make anyone miserable  you are right she said following my eyes it is my husband he is so unsympathetic  i condoled with her  he is so jealous of me and as you know i am a pattern of virtue to forli  i had never heard her character so described but of course i said  to look at you would be enough to reassure the most violent of husbands  oh i have temptation enough i assure you she answered quickly  i can well believe that  but i am as faithful to him as if i were old and ugly and yet he is jealous  we all have our crosses in this life i remarked sententiously  heaven knows i have mine but i have my consolations  so i supposed and answered  oh  i pour out my soul in a series of sonnets  a second petrarch  my friends say some of them are not unworthy of that great name  i can well believe it  here relief came and like the tired sentinel i left the post of duty i thought of my sweet giulia and wondered at her beauty and charm it was all so much clearer and cleaner than the dross i saw around me i came away for i was pining for solitude and then i gave myself up to the exquisite dreams of my love  at last the time came the long day had at last worn away and the night the friend of lovers gave me leave to go to giulia     xi   i was so happy the world went on things happened in forli the rival parties agitated and met together and discussed there was a general fermentand to it all i was profoundly indifferent what matter all the petty little affairs of life i said people work and struggle plot scheme make money lose it conspire for place and honour they have their ambitions and hopes but what is it all beside love i had entered into the excitement of politics in forli i was behind the veil and knew the intricacies the ambitions the emotions of the actors but now i withdrew myself what did i care about the prospects of forli whether taxes were put on or taken off or whether a killed b or b killed a it really seemed so unimportant i looked upon them as puppets performing on a stage and i could not treat their acts with seriousness giulia that was the great fact in life nothing mattered to me but giulia when i thought of giulia my heart was filled with ecstasy and i spat with scorn on all the silly details of events  i would willingly have kept myself out of the stream which was carrying along the others but i could not help knowing what happened and it was indeed ridiculous after the great scene at the palace people had begun to take steps as if for big events checco had sent a large sum of money to florence for the medici to take care of bartolomeo moratini had made preparations there were generally a stir and unrest girolamo was supposed to be going to take some step people were prepared for everything when they woke up in the morning they asked if aught had taken place in the night and checco wore a coat of mail on the counts side people were asking what checco meant to do whether the ovation he had received would encourage him to any violent step all the world was agog for great eventsand nothing happened it reminded me of a mystery play in which after great preparation of dialogue some great stage effect is going to be produceda saint is going to ascend to heaven or a mountain is to open and the devil spring out the spectators are sitting openmouthed the moment has come everything is ready the signal is given the mob have already drawn their breath for a cry of astonishmentand something goes wrong and nothing happens  the good forlivesi could not understand it they were looking for signs and miracles and behold they came not each day they said to themselves that this would be one to be remembered in the history of the town that today girolamo would surely leave his hesitations but the day wore on quite calmly everyone took his dinner and supper as usual the sun journeyed from east to west as it had done on the previous day the night came and the worthy citizen went to his bed at his usual hour and slept in peace till the following sunrise nothing happened and it seemed that nothing was going to happen the troubled spirits gradually came to the conclusion that there was nothing to be troubled about and the old quiet came over the town there was no talk of new taxes and the world wagged on checco and matteo and the moratini resigned themselves to the fact that the sky was serene and that they had better pursue their way without troubling their little heads about conspiracies and midnight daggers  meanwhile i laughed and admired their folly and my own wisdom for i worried myself about none of these things i lived in giulia for giulia by giulia i had never enjoyed such happiness before she was a little cold perhaps but i did not mind i had passion that lived by its own flame and i cared for nothing as long as she let me love her and i argued with myself that it is an obvious thing that love is not the same on both sides there is always one who loves and one who lets himself be loved perhaps it is a special decree of nature for the man loves actively caresses and is passionate while the woman gives herself to him and is in his embrace like some sweet helpless animal i did not ask for such love as i gave all i asked was that my love should let herself be loved that was all i cared for that was all i wanted my love for giulia was wonderful even to me i felt i had lost myself in her i had given my whole being into her hand samson and delilah but this was no faithless philistine i would have given my honour into her keeping and felt it as sure as in my own in my great love i felt such devotion such reverence that sometimes i hardly dared touch her it seemed to me i must kneel and worship at her feet i learnt the great delight of abasing myself to the beloved i could make myself so small and mean in my humility but nothing satisfied my wish to show my abject slavery oh giulia giulia                                       but this inaction on the part of girolamo riario had the effect of persuading his subjects of his weakness they had given over expecting reprisals on his part and the only conclusion they could come to was that he dared do nothing against checco it was inconceivable that he should leave unavenged the insults he had received that he should bear without remark the signs of popularity which greeted checco not only on the day of the council meeting but since every time he appeared in the streets they began to despise their ruler as well as hate him and they told one another stories of violent disputes in the palace between the count and caterina everyone knew the pride and passion which came to the countess with her sforza blood and they felt sure that she would not patiently bear the insults which her husband did not seem to mind for the fear of the people could not stop their sarcasms and when any member of the household was seen he was assailed with taunts and jeers caterina herself had to listen to scornful laughs as she passed by and the town was ringing with a song about the count it was whispered that girolamos little son ottaviano had been heard singing it in ignorance of its meaning and had been nearly killed by his father in a passion of rage evil reports began to circulate about caterinas virtue it was supposed that she would not keep faithful to such a husband and another song was made in praise of cuckoldry  the orsi would not be persuaded that this calm was to be believed in checco was assured that girolamo must have some scheme on hand and the quiet and silence seemed all the more ominous  the count very rarely appeared in forli but one saints day he went to the cathedral and as he came back to the palace passing through the piazza saw checco at the same moment checco saw him and stopped uncertain what to do the crowd suddenly became silent and they stood still like statues petrified by a magic spell what was going to happen girolamo himself hesitated a moment a curious spasm crossed his face checco made as if to walk on pretending not to notice the count matteo and i were dumbfounded absolutely at a loss then the count stepped forward and held out his hand  ah my checco how goes it  he smiled and pressed warmly the hand which the orsi gave him checco was taken aback pale as if the hand he held were the hand of death  you have neglected me of late dear friend said the count  i have not been well my lord  girolamo linked his arm in checcos  come come he said you must not be angry because i used sharp words to you the other day you know i am hottempered  you have a right to say what you please  oh no i have only a right to say pleasant things  he smiled but all the time the mobile eyes were shifting here and there scrutinising checcos face giving occasional quick glances to me and matteo he went on  you must show a forgiving spirit then to matteo we must all be good christians if we can eh matteo  of course  and yet your cousin bears malice  no my lord said checco i am afraid i was too outspoken  well if you were i have forgiven you and you must forgive me but we will not talk of that my children have been asking for you it is strange that this ferocious creature who tells me i am the worst among bad men should be so adored by my children your little godson is always crying for you  dear child said checco  come and see them now there is no time like the present  matteo and i looked at one another was all this an attempt to get him in his hand and this time not to let him go  i must pray you to excuse me for i have some gentlemen coming to dine with me today and i fear i shall be late already  girolamo gave us a rapid look and evidently saw in our eyes something of our thoughts for he said goodhumouredly  you never will do anything for me checco but i wont keep you i respect the duties of hospitality however another day you must come  he warmly pressed checcos hand and nodding to matteo and me left us  the crowd had not been able to hear what was said but they had seen the cordiality and as soon as girolamo disappeared behind the palace doors broke out into murmurs of derision the christian sentiment clearly gained little belief from them and they put down the counts act to fear it was clear they said that he found checco too strong for him and dared nothing it was a discovery that the man they had so feared was willing to turn the other cheek when the one was smitten and to all their former hate they added a new hate that he had caused them terror without being terrible they hated him now for their own pusillanimity the mocking songs gained force and girolamo began to be known as cornuto the man of horns  borne on this wave of contempt came another incident which again showed the counts weakness on the sunday following his meeting with checco it was known that girolamo meant to hear mass at the church of san stefano and jacopo ronchi commander of a troop stationed himself with two other soldiers to await him when the count appeared accompanied by his wife and children and his suite jacopo pressed forward and throwing himself on his knees presented a petition in which he asked for the arrears of pay of himself and his fellows the count took it without speaking and pursued his way then jacopo took hold of his legs to stop him and said  for heavens sake my lord give me a hearing i and these others have received nothing for months and we are starving  let me go said the count your claim shall be attended to  do not dismiss me my lord i have presented three petitions before and to none of them have you paid attention now i am getting desperate and can wait no longer look at my tattered clothes give me my money  let me go i tell you said girolamo furiously and he gave him a sweeping blow so that the man fell on his back to the ground how dare you come and insult me here in the public place by god i cannot keep my patience much longer  he brought out these words with such violence of passion that it seemed as if in them exploded the anger which had been gathering up through this time of humiliation then turning furiously on the people he almost screamed  make way  they dared not face his anger and with white faces shrunk back leaving a path for him and his party to walk through     xii   i looked at these events as i might have looked at a comedy of plautus it was very amusing but perhaps a little vulgar i was wrapped up in my own happiness and i had forgotten nemesis  one day perhaps two months from my arrival in forli i heard checco tell his cousin that a certain giorgio dall aste had returned i paid no particular attention to the remark but later when i was alone with matteo it occurred to me that i had not heard before of this person i did not know that giulia had relations on her husbands side i asked  by the way who is that giorgio dall aste of whom checco was speaking  a cousin of donna giulias late husband  i have never heard him spoken of before  havent you he enjoys quite a peculiar reputation as being the only lover that the virtuous giulia has kept for more than ten days  another of your old wives tales matteo nature intended you for a begging friar  i have often thought i have missed my vocation with my brilliant gift for telling lies in a truthful manner i should have made my way in the church to the highest dignities whereas certain antiquated notions of honour having been instilled into me during my training as a soldier my gifts are lost with the result that when i tell the truth people think i am lying but this is solemn truth  all your stories are i jeered  ask anyone this has been going on for years when giulia was married by old tommaso whom she had never seen in her life before the betrothal the first thing she did was to fall in love with giorgio he fell in love with her but being a fairly honest sort of man he had some scruples about committing adultery with his cousins wife especially as he lived on his cousins money however when a woman is vicious a mans scruples soon go to the devil if adam couldnt refuse the apple you cant expect us poor fallen creatures to do so either the result was that joseph did not run away from potiphars wife so fast as to prevent her from catching him  how biblical you are  yes answered matteo im making love to a parsons mistress and i am cultivating the style which i find she is used to but however giorgio being youthful after a short while began to have prickings of conscience and went away from forli giulia was heartbroken and her grief was so great that she must have half the town to console her then giorgios conscience calmed down and he came back and giulia threw over all her lovers  i dont believe a single word you say  on my honour its true  on the face of it the story is false if she really loves him why do they not keep together now that there is no hindrance  because giulia has the heart of a strumpet and cant be faithful to any one man shes very fond of him but they quarrel and she takes a sudden fancy for somebody else and for a while they wont see one another but there seems some magical charm between them for sooner or later they always come back to one another i believe if they were at the ends of the world eventually they would be drawn together even if they struggled with all their might against it and i promise you giorgio has struggled he tries to part with her for good and all and each time they separate he vows it shall be for ever but there is an invisible chain and it always brings him back  i stood looking at him in silence strange horrible thoughts passed through my head and i could not drive them away i tried to speak quite calmly  and how is it when they are together  all sunshine and storm but as time goes on the storm gets longer and blacker and then giorgio goes away  but good god man how do you know i cried in agony  he shrugged his shoulders  they quarrel i asked  furiously he feels himself imprisoned against his will with the door open to escape but not the strength to do it and she is angry that he should love her thus trying not to love her it rather seems to me that it explains her own excesses her other loves are partly to show him how much she is loved and to persuade herself that she is lovable  i did not believe it oh no i swear i did not believe it yet i was frightened horribly frightened but i would not believe a single word of it  listen matteo i said you believe badly of giulia but you do not know her i swear to you that she is good and pure whatever she may have been in the past and i do not believe a word of these scandals i am sure that now she is as true and faithful as she is beautiful  matteo looked at me for a moment  are you her lover he asked  yes  matteo opened his mouth as if about to speak then stopped and after a moments hesitation turned away                                       that evening i went to giulia i found her lying full length on a divan her head sunken in soft cushions she was immersed in reverie i wondered whether she was thinking of me and i went up to her silently and bending over her lightly kissed her lips she gave a cry and a frown darkened her eyes  you frightened me  i am sorry i answered humbly i wanted to surprise you  she did not answer but raised her eyebrows slightly shrugging her shoulders i wondered whether something had arisen to vex her i knew she had a quick temper but i did not mind it a cross word was so soon followed by a look of repentance and a word of love i passed my hand over her beautiful soft hair the frown came again and she turned her head away  giulia i said what is it i took her hand she withdrew it immediately  nothing she answered  why do you turn away from me and withdraw your hand  why should i not turn away from you and withdraw my hand  dont you love me giulia  she gave a sigh and pretended to look bored i looked at her pained at heart and wondering  giulia my dear tell me what it is you are making me very unhappy  oh dont i tell you nothing nothing nothing  why are you cross  i put my face to hers and my arms round her neck she disengaged herself impatiently  you refuse my kisses giulia  she made another gesture of annoyance  giulia dont you love me my heart was beginning to sink and i remembered what i had heard from matteo oh god could it be true  yes of course i love you but sometimes i must be left in peace  you have only to say the word and i will go away altogether  i dont want you to do that but we shall like one another much better if we dont see too much of one another  when one is in love really and truly one does not think of such wise precautions  and you are here so often that i am afraid of my good name  you need have no fear about your character i answered bitterly one more scandal will not make much difference  you need not insult me  i could not be angry with her i loved her too much and the words i had said hurt me ten times more than they hurt her i fell on my knees by her side and took hold of her arms  oh giulia giulia forgive me i dont mean to say anything to wound you but for gods sake dont be so cold i love you i love you be good to me  i think i have been good to you after all it is not such a very grave matter i have not taken things more seriously than you  what do you mean i cried aghast  she shrugged her shoulders  i suppose you found me a pretty woman and thought you could occupy a few spare moments with a pleasant amour you can hardly have expected me to be influenced by sentiments very different from your own  you mean you do not love me  i love you as much as you love me i dont suppose either you are lancelot or i guinevere  i still knelt at her side in silence and my head felt as if the vessels in it were bursting  you know she went on quite calmly one cannot love for ever  but i love you giulia i love you with all my heart and soul i have had loves picked up for the opportunitys sake or for pure idleness but my love for you is different i swear to you it is a matter of my whole life  that has been said to me so often  i was beginning to be overwhelmed  but do you mean that it is all finished do you mean that you wont have anything more to do with me  i dont say i wont have anything more to do with you  but love it is love i want  she shrugged her shoulders  but why not i said despairingly why have you given it me at all if you want to take it away  one is not master of ones love it comes and goes  dont you love me at all  no  oh god but why do you tell me this today  i had to tell you some time  but why not yesterday or the day before why today particularly  she did not answer  is it because giorgio dall aste has just returned  she started up and her eyes flashed  what have they been telling you about him  has he been here today were you thinking of him when i came were you languorous from his embraces  how dare you  the only lover to whom you have been faithful more or less  you vowed you did not believe the scandals about me and now when i refuse you the smallest thing you are ready to believe every word what a love is this i thought i had heard you talk so often of boundless confidence  i believe every word i have heard against you i believe you are a harlot  she had raised herself from her couch and we were standing face to face  do you want money look i have as good money as another i will pay you for your love here take it  i took gold pieces from my pocket and flung them at her feet  ah she cried in indignation you cur go go  she pointed to the door then i felt a sudden revulsion i fell on my knees and seized her hands  oh forgive me giulia i dont know what i am saying i am mad but dont rob me of your love it is the only thing i have to live for for gods sake forgive me oh giulia i love you i love you i cant live without you the tears broke from my eyes i could not stop them  leave me leave me  i was ashamed of my abjectness i rose up indignant  oh you are quite heartless you have no right to treat me so you were not obliged to give me your love but when once you have given it you cannot take it away no one has the right to make another unhappy as you make me you are a bad evil woman i hate you  i stood over her with clenched fists she shrank back afraid  dont be frightened i said i wont touch you i hate you too much  then i turned to the crucifix and lifted my hands  oh god i pray you let this woman be treated as she has treated me and to heri hope to god you are as unhappy as i am and i hope the unhappiness will come soonyou harlot  i left her and in my rage slammed the door so that the lock shattered behind me     xiii   i walked through the streets like a man who has received sentence of death my brain was whirling and sometimes i stopped and pressed my head with both hands to relieve the insupportable pressure i could not realise what had happened i only knew it was terrible i felt as if i were going mad i could have killed myself at last getting home i threw myself on my bed and tried to gather myself together i cried out against that woman i wished i had my fingers curling round her soft white throat that i could strangle the life out of her oh i hated her  at last i fell asleep and in that sweet forgetfulness enjoyed a little peace when i woke i lay still for a moment without remembering what had happened then suddenly it came back to me and the blood flushed to my face as i thought of how i had humiliated myself to her she must be as hard as stone i said to myself to see my misery and not take pity on me she saw my tears and was not moved one jot all the time i had been praying and beseeching she had been as calm as a marble figure she must have seen my agony and the passion of my love and yet she was absolutely absolutely indifferent oh i despised her i had known even when i adored her madly that it was only my love which gave her the qualities i worshipped i had seen she was ignorant and foolish and commonplace and vicious but i did not care as long as i loved her and could have her love in return but when i thought of her so horribly heartless so uncaring to my unhappiness i did more than hate heri utterly despised her i despised myself for having loved her i despised myself for loving her still  i got up and went about my days duties trying to forget myself in their performance but still i brooded over my misery and in my heart i cursed the woman it was nemesis always nemesis in my folly i had forgotten her and yet i should have remembered that through my life all happiness had been followed by all misery i had tried to ward off the evil by sacrifice i had rejoiced at the harm which befell me but the very rejoicing seemed to render the hurt of no avail and with the inevitableness of fate nemesis had come and thrown me back into the old unhappiness but of late i had forgotten what was nemesis to me now when i thought my happiness so great that it could not help but last it was so robust and strong that i never thought of its cessation i did not even think the gods were good to me at last i had forgotten the gods i thought of nothing but love and giulia  matteo came asking me to go to the palace with him and checco at the particular desire of girolamo who wished to show them the progress of the decorations i would not go i wanted to be alone and think  but my thoughts maddened me over and over again i repeated every word of the terrible quarrel and more than ever i was filled with horror for her cold cruelty what right have these people to make us unhappy is there not enough misery in the world already oh it is brutal  i could not bear myself i regretted that i had not gone to the palace i detested this solitude  the hours passed like years and as my brain grew tired i sank into a state of sodden passive misery  at last they came back and matteo told me what had happened i tried to listen to forget myself it appeared that the count had been extremely cordial after talking to them of his house and showing the beautiful things he had collected to furnish it with he took them to caterinas apartments where they found the countess surrounded by her children she had been very charming and gracious even deigning to compliment matteo on his gallantry how it interested me to know all this the children had run to checco as soon as they saw him dragging him into their game the others looked on while the orsi played goodhumouredly with the little boys and girolamo laying his hand on checcos shoulder had remarked  you see dear friend the children are determined that there should not be enmity between us and when the little ones love you so dearly can you think that i should hate you  and when they left he had accompanied them to the gates and been quite affectionate in his farewell  at last the night came and i could shut myself up in my room i thought with a bitter smile that it was the hour at which i was used to go to giulia and now i should never go to giulia again my unhappiness was too great for wrath i felt too utterly miserable to think of my grievances or of my contempt i only felt brokenhearted i could not keep the tears back and burying my face in the pillows i cried my heart out it was years and years since i had wept not since i was quite a boy but this blow had taken from me all manliness and i gave myself over to my grief passionately shamelessly i did not care that i was weak i had no respect for myself or care for myself the sobs came one on the heels of another like waves and the pain as they tore my chest relieved the anguish of my mind exhaustion came at last and with it sleep  but i knew i could not hide the change in me and matteo soon noticed it  what is the matter with you filippo he asked i blushed and hesitated  nothing i answered at last  i thought you were unhappy  our eyes met but i could not stand his inquiring glance and looked down he came to me and sitting on the arm of my chair put his hand on my shoulder and said affectionately  were friends arent we filippo  yes i answered smiling and taking his hand  wont you trust me  after a pause i answered  i should so much like to i felt as if indeed it would relieve me to be able to confide in somebody i wanted sympathy so badly  he passed his hand gently over my hair  i hesitated a little but i could not help myself and i told him the whole story from beginning to end  poverino he said when i had finished then clenching his teeth she is a beast that woman  i ought to have taken your warning matteo but i was a fool  who ever does take warning he answered shrugging his shoulders how could you be expected to believe me  but i believe you now i am horrified when i think of her vice and cruelty  ah well it is over now  quite i hate her and despise her oh i wish i could get her face to face and tell her what i think of her  i thought my talk with matteo had relieved me i thought the worst was over but at night melancholy came on me stronger than ever and i groaned as i threw myself on my bed i felt so terribly alone in the world i had no relation but a halfbrother a boy of twelve whom i had hardly seen and as i wandered through the land an exile i had been continually assailed by the hateful demon of loneliness and sometimes in my solitude i had felt that i could kill myself but when i found i was in love with giulia i cried aloud with joy i threw everything to the winds gathering myself up for the supreme effort of passion all the storm and stress were passed i was no longer alone for i had someone to whom i could give my love i was like the ship that arrives in the harbour and reefs her sails and clears her deck settling down in the quietness of the waters  and now all was over oh god to think that my hopes should be shattered in so short a time that the ship should be so soon tossed about in the storm and the stars hidden by the clouds and the past delight made the present darkness all the more bitter i groaned in my misery i uttered a prayer to god to help me i could not think i should live henceforth how could i go on existing with this aching void in my heart i could not spend days and weeks and years always with this despair it was too terrible to last my reason told me that time would remedy it but time was so long and what misery must i go through before the wound was healed and as i thought of what i had lost my agony grew more unbearable it grew vivid and i felt giulia in my arms i panted as i pressed my lips against hers and i said to her  how could you  i buried my face in my hands so as better to enjoy my dream i smelt the perfume of her breath i felt on my face the light touch of her hair but it would not last i tried to seize the image and hold it back but it vanished and left me brokenhearted  i knew i did not hate her i had pretended to but the words came from the mouth in my heart i loved her still more passionately than ever what did i care if she was heartless and cruel and faithless and vicious it was nothing to me as long as i could hold her in my arms and cover her with kisses i did despise her i knew her for what she was but still i loved her insanely oh if she would only come back to me i would willingly forget everything and forgive her nay i would ask her forgiveness and grovel before her if she would only let me enjoy her love again  i would go back to her and fall on my knees and pray her to be merciful why should i suppose she had changed in the few days i knew she would treat me with the same indifference and only feel a wondering contempt that i should so abase myself it came like a blow in the face the thought of her cold cruelty and her calmness no i vowed i would never subject myself to that again i felt myself blush at the remembrance of the humiliation but perhaps she was sorry for what she had done i knew her pride would prevent her from coming or sending to me and should i give her no opportunity perhaps if we saw one another for a few moments everything might be arranged and i might be happy again an immense feeling of hope filled me i thought i must be right in my idea she could not be so heartless as to have no regret how willingly i would take her back my heart leaped but i dared not go to her house i knew i should find her on the morrow at her fathers who was going to give a banquet to some friends i would speak to her there casually as if we were ordinary acquaintances and then at the first sign of yielding on her part even if i saw but a tinge of regret in her eyes i would burst out i was happy in my plan and i went to sleep with the name of giulia on my lips and her image in my heart     xiv   i went to the moratini palace and with beating heart looked round for giulia she was surrounded by her usual court and seemed more lively and excited than ever i had never seen her more beautiful she was dressed all in white and her sleeves were sewn with pearls she looked like a bride she caught sight of me at once but pretended not to see me and went on talking  i approached her brother alessandro and said to him casually  i am told a cousin of your sister has come to forli is he here today  he looked at me inquiringly not immediately understanding  giorgio dall aste i explained  oh i didnt know you meant him no hes not here he and giulias husband were not friends and so  why were they not friends i interrupted on the spur of the moment not seeing the impertinence of the question till i had made it  oh i dont know relations always are at enmity with one another probably some disagreement with regard to their estates  was that all  so far as i know  i recollected that in a scandal the persons most interested are the last to hear it the husband hears nothing of his wifes treachery till all the town knows every detail  i should like to have seen him i went on  giorgo oh hes a weak sort of creature one of those men who commit sins and repent  that is not a fault of which you will ever be guilty alessandro i said smiling  i sincerely hope not after all if a man has a conscience he ought not to do wrong but if he does he must be a very poor sort of a fool to repent  you cannot have the rose without the thorn  why not it only needs care there are dregs at the bottom of every cup but you are not obliged to drink them  you have made up your mind that if you commit sins you are ready to go to hell for them i said  it is braver than going to heaven by the back door turning pious when you are too old to do anything you shouldnt  i agree with you that one has little respect for the man who turns monk when things go wrong with him  i saw that giulia was alone and seized the opportunity to speak with her  giulia i said approaching  she looked at me for a moment with an air of perplexity as if she really could not remember whom i was  ah messer filippo she said as if suddenly recollecting  it is not so long since we met that you can have forgotten me  yes i remember last time you did me the honour to visit me you were very rude and cross  i looked at her silently wondering  well she said steadily answering my gaze and smiling  have you nothing more to say to me than that i asked in an undertone  what do you want me to say to you  are you quite heartless  she gave a sigh of boredom and looked to the other end of the room as if for someone to come and break a tedious conversation  how could you i whispered  notwithstanding her selfcontrol a faint blush came over her face i stood looking at her for a little while and then i turned away she was quite heartless i left the moratini and walked out into the town this last interview had helped me in so far that it made certain that my love was hopeless i stood still and stamped on the ground vowing i would not love her i would put her away from my thoughts entirely she was a contemptible vicious woman and i was too proud to be subject to her i wondered i did not kill her i made up my mind to take my courage in both hands and leave forli once away i should find myself attracted to different matters and probably i should not live long before finding some other woman to take giulias place she was not the only woman in italy she was not the most beautiful nor the cleverest give me a month and i could laugh at my torments  the same evening i told matteo i meant to leave forli  why he asked in astonishment  i have been here several weeks i answered i dont want to outstay my welcome  that is rubbish you know i should be only too glad for you to stay here all your life  that is very kind of you i replied with a laugh but the establishment is not yours  that makes no difference besides checco has become very fond of you and im sure he wishes you to stay  of course i know your hospitality is quite unlimited but i am beginning to want to get back to città di castello  why asked matteo doubtfully  one likes to return to ones native place  you have been away from castello for ten years you cannot be in any particular hurry to get back  i was beginning to protest when checco came in and matteo interrupted me with  listen checco filippo says he wants to leave us  but he shant said checco laughing  i really must i answered gravely  you really mustnt replied checco we cant spare you filippo  theres no great hurry about your going home he added when i had explained my reasons and i fancy that soon we shall want you here a good sword and a brave heart will probably be of good use to us  everything is as quiet as a cemetery i said shrugging my shoulders  it is quiet above but below there are rumblings and strange movements i feel sure this calm only presages a storm it is impossible for girolamo to go on as he is now his debts are increasing every day and his difficulties will soon be impracticable he must do something there is certain to be a disturbance at any attempt to put on the taxes and then heaven only knows what will happen  i was beginning to get a little vexed at their opposition and i answered petulantly  no i must go  stay another month things must come to a head before then  a month would have been as bad as a year  i am out of health i answered i feel i want to get into a different atmosphere  checco thought for a moment  very well he said we can arrange matters to suit us both i want someone to go to florence for me to conclude a little business matter with messer lorenzo de medici you would be away a fortnight and if you are out of sorts the ride across country will put you right will you go  i thought for a moment it was not a very long absence but the new sights would distract me and i wanted to see florence again on the whole i thought it would suffice and that i could count on the cure of my ill before the time was up  very well i answered  good and you will have a pleasant companion i had talked to scipione moratini about it it did not occur to me that you would go but it will be all the better to have two of you  if i go i said i shall go alone  checco was rather astonished  why  scipione bores me i want to be quiet and do as i like  i was quite determined that neither of the moratini should come with me they would have reminded me too much of what i wanted to forget  as you like said checco i can easily tell scipione that i want him to do something else for me  thanks  when will you start  at once  then come and i will give you the instructions and necessary papers     xv   next morning i mounted my horse and set out with matteo who was to accompany me for a little way  but at the town gate a guard stopped us and asked where we were going  out i answered shortly moving on  stop said the man catching hold of my bridle  what the devil dyou mean said matteo dyou know whom we are  i have orders to let no one go by without the permission of my captain  what tyrants they are cried matteo well what the hell are you standing there for go and tell your captain to come out  the man signed to another soldier who went into the guardhouse he was still holding my bridle i was not very goodtempered that morning  have the goodness to take your hands off i said  he looked as if he were about to refuse  will you do as you are told then as he hesitated i brought down the buttend of my whip on his fingers and with an oath bade him stand off he let go at once cursing and looked as if he would willingly stab me if he dared we waited impatiently but the captain did not appear  why the devil doesnt this man come i said and matteo turning to one of the soldiers ordered  go and tell him to come here instantly  at that moment the captain appeared and we understood the incident for it was ercole piacentini he had apparently seen us coming or heard of my intended journey and had set himself out to insult us we were both furious  why the devil dont you hurry up when youre sent for said matteo  he scowled but did not answer turning to me he asked  where are you going  matteo and i looked at one another in amazement at the mans impudence and i burst forth  you insolent fellow what do you mean by stopping me like this  i have a right to refuse passage to anyone i choose  take care i said i swear the count shall be told of your behaviour and nowadays the count is in the habit of doing as the orsi tell him  he shall hear of this growled the piacentini  tell him what you like do you think i care you can tell him that i consider his captain a very impertinent ruffian now let me go  you shall not pass till i choose  by god man i said absolutely beside myself it seems i cannot touch you here but if ever we meet in città di castello  i will give you any satisfaction you wish he answered hotly  satisfaction i would not soil my sword by crossing it with yours i was going to say that if ever we meet in castello i will have you whipped by my lacqueys in the public place  i felt a ferocious pleasure in throwing the words of contempt in his face  come on said matteo we cannot waste our time here  we put the spurs to our horses the soldiers looked to their captain to see whether they should stop us but he gave no order and we passed through when we got outside matteo said to me  girolamo must be planning something or ercole would not have dared to do that  it is only the impotent anger of a foolish man i answered the count will probably be very angry with him when he hears of it  we rode a few miles and then matteo turned back when i found myself alone i heaved a great sigh of relief i was free for a while at least another episode in my life was finished i could forget it and look forward to new things  as i rode on the march wind got into my blood and sent it whirling madly through my veins the sun was shining brightly and covered everything with smiles the fruit trees were all in flowerapples pears almondsthe dainty buds covered the branches with a snow of pink and white the ground beneath them was bespattered with narcissi and anemones the very olive trees looked gay all the world laughed with joy at the bright spring morning and i laughed louder than the rest i drew in long breaths of the keen air and it made me drunk so that i set the spurs to my horse and galloped wildly along the silent road  i had made up my mind to forget giulia and i succeeded for the changing scenes took me away from myself and i was intent on the world at large but i could not command my dreams at night she came to me and i dreamed that she was by my side with her arms round my neck sweetly caressing trying to make me forget what i had suffered and the waking was bitter but even that would leave me soon i hoped and then i should be free indeed  i rode on full of courage and good spirits along endless roads putting up at wayside inns through the mountains past villages and hamlets past thriving towns till i found myself in the heart of tuscany and finally i saw the roofs of florence spread out before me  after i had cleaned myself at the inn and had eaten i sauntered through the town renewing my recollections i walked round madonna del fiore and leaning against one of the houses at the back of the piazza looked at the beautiful apse the marble all glistening in the moonlight it was very quiet and peaceful the exquisite church filled me with a sense of rest and purity so that i cast far from me all vice then i went to the baptistery and tried to make out in the dim light the details of ghibertis wonderful doors it was late and the streets were silent as i strolled to the piazza della signoria and saw before me the grim stone palace with its tower and i came down to the arno and looked at the glistening of the water with the bridge covered with houses and as i considered the beauty of it all i thought it strange that the works of man should be so good and pure and man himself so vile  next day i set about my business i had a special letter of introduction to lorenzo and was ushered in to him by a clerk i found two people in the room one a young man with a long oval face and the bones of the face and chin very strongly marked he had a very wonderful skin like brown ivory black hair that fell over his forehead and ears and most striking of all large brown eyes very soft and melancholy i thought i had never before seen a man quite so beautiful seated by him talking with animation was an insignificant man bent and wrinkled and mean looking like a clerk in a cloth merchants shop except for the massive golden chain about his neck and the dress of dark red velvet with an embroidered collar his features were ugly a large coarse nose a heavy sensual mouth small eyes but very sharp and glittering the hair thin and short the skin muddy yellow wrinkledlorenzo de medici  as i entered the room he interrupted himself and spoke to me in a harsh disagreeable voice  messer filippo brandolini i think you are very welcome  i am afraid i interrupt you i said looking at the youth with the melancholy eyes  oh no answered lorenzo gaily we were talking of plato i really ought to have been attending to very much more serious matters but i never can resist pico  then that was the famous pico della mirandola i looked at him again and felt envious that one person should be possessed of such genius and such beauty it was hardly fair on natures part  it is more the subject than i that is irresistible  ah the banquet said lorenzo clasping his hands what an inexhaustible matter i could go on talking about it all day and all night for a year and then find i had left unsaid half what i had in my mind  you have so vast an experience in the subject treated of said pico laughing you could give a chapter of comment to every sentence of plato  you rascal pico answered lorenzo also laughing and what is your opinion of love messer he added turning to me  i answered smiling      con tua promesse et tua false parole     con falsi risi et con vago sembiante     donna menato hai il tuo fidele amante                                           those promises of thine and those false words     those traitor smiles and that inconstant seeming     lady with these thoust led astray thy faithful lover  they were lorenzos own lines and he was delighted that i should quote them but still the pleasure was not too great and i saw that it must be subtle flattery indeed that should turn his head  you have the spirit of a courtier messer filippo he said in reply to my quotation you are wasted on liberty  it is in the air in florenceone breathes it in through every pore  what liberty  no the spirit of the courtier  lorenzo looked at me sharply then at pico repressing a smile at my sarcasm  well about your business from forli he said but when i began explaining the transaction he interrupted me oh all that you can arrange with my secretaries tell me what is going on in the town there have been rumours of disturbance  i looked at pico who rose and went out saying  i will leave you politics are not for me  i told lorenzo all that had happened while he listened intently occasionally interrupting me to ask a question when i had finished he said  and what will happen now  i shrugged my shoulders  who knows  the wise man knows he said earnestly for he has made up his mind what will happen and goes about to cause it to happen it is only the fool who trusts to chance and waits for circumstances to develop themselves  tell your master  i beg your pardon i interrupted  he looked at me interrogatively  i was wondering of whom you were speaking i murmured  he understood and smiling said  i apologise i was thinking you were a forlivese of course i remember now that you are a citizen of castello and we all know how tenacious they have been of their liberty and how proud of their freedom  he had me on the hip for città di castello had been among the first of the towns to lose its liberty and unlike others had borne its servitude with more equanimity than was honourable  however he went on tell checco dorsi that i know girolamo riario it was his father and he who were the prime movers in the conspiracy which killed my brother and nearly killed myself let him remember that the riario is perfectly unscrupulous and that he is not accustomed to forgive an injuryor forget it you say that girolamo has repeatedly threatened checco has that had no effect on him  he was somewhat alarmed  besides  i looked at him trying to seize his meaning  did he make up his mind to sit still and wait till girolamo found means to carry his threats into effect  i was rather at a loss for an answer lorenzos eyes were fixed keenly upon me they seemed to be trying to read my brain  it was suggested to him that it would be unwise i replied slowly  and what did he answer to that  he recalled the ill results of certain recentevents  ah  he took his eyes off me as if he had suddenly seen the meaning behind my words and was now quite sure of everything he wanted to know he walked up and down the room thinking then he said to me  tell checco that girolamos position is very insecure the pope is against him though he pretends to uphold him you remember that when the zampeschi seized his castle of san marco girolamo thought they had the tacit consent of the pope and dared make no reprisal lodovico sforza would doubtless come to the assistance of his halfsister but he is occupied with the venetiansand if the people of forli hate the count  then you advise  i advise nothing but let checco know that it is only the fool who proposes to himself an end when he cannot or will not attain it but the man who deserves the name of man marches straight to the goal with clearness of mind and strength of will he looks at things as they are and puts aside all vain appearances and when his intelligence has shown him the means to his end he is a fool if he refuses them and he is a wise man if he uses them steadily and unhesitatingly tell that to checco  he threw himself into his chair with a little cry of relief  now we can talk of other things pico  a servant came in to say that pico had gone away  the villain cried lorenzo but i daresay you will want to go away too messer brandolini but you must come tomorrow we are going to act the menacchini of plautus and besides the wit of the latin you will see all the youth and beauty of florence  as i took my leave he added  i need not warn you to be discreet     xvi   a few days later i found myself in sight of forli as i rode along i meditated and presently the thought came to me that after all there was perhaps a certain equality in the portioning out of good and evil in this world when fate gave one happiness she followed it with unhappiness but the two lasted about an equal time so that the balance was not unevenly preserved in my love for giulia i had gone through a few days of intense happiness the first kiss had caused me such ecstasy that i was rapt up to heaven i felt myself a god and this was followed by a sort of passive happiness when i lived but to enjoy my love and cared for nothing in the world besides then came the catastrophe and i passed through the most awful misery that man had ever felt even now as i thought of it the sweat gathered on my forehead but i noticed that strangely as this wretchedness was equal with the first happiness so was it equal in length and this was followed by a passive unhappiness when i no longer felt all the bitterness of my woe but only a certain dull misery which was like peace and half smiling half sighing i thought that the passive misery again was equal to the passive happiness finally came the blessed state of indifference and except for the remembrance my heart was as if nothing had been at all so it seemed to me that one ought not to complain for if the world had no right to give one continual misery one had no cause to expect unmingled happiness and the conjunction of the two in all things equal seemed normal and reasonable and i had not noticed that i was come to forli  i entered the gate with a pleasant sense of homecoming i passed along the grey streets i was beginning to know so well and felt for them something of the affection of old friends i was glad too that i should shortly see checco and my dear matteo i felt i had been unkind to matteo he was so fond of me and had always been so good but i had been so wrapped up in my love that his very presence had been importunate and i had responded coldly to his friendliness and being then in a sentimental mood i thought how much better and more trustworthy a friend is to the most lovely woman in the world you could neglect him and be unfaithful to him and yet if you were in trouble you could come back and he would take you to his arms and comfort you and never once complain that you had strayed away i longed to be with matteo clasping his hand in my hurry i put the spurs to my horse and clattered along the street in a few minutes i had reached the palazzo leapt off my horse sprung up the stairs and flung myself into the arms of my friend  after the first greetings matteo dragged me along to checco  the good cousin is most eager to hear your news we must not keep him waiting  checco seemed as pleased to see me as matteo he warmly pressed my hand and said  i am glad to have you back filippo in your absence we have been lamenting like forsaken shepherdesses now what is your news  i was fully impressed with my importance at the moment and the anxiety with which i was being listened to i resolved not to betray myself too soon and began telling them about the kindness of lorenzo and the play which he had invited me to see i described the brilliancy of the assembly and the excellence of the acting they listened with interest but i could see it was not what they wanted to hear  but i see you want to hear about more important matters i said well  ah they cried drawing their chairs closer to me settling themselves to listen attentively  with a slight smile i proceeded to give them the details of the commercial transaction which had been the ostensible purpose of my visit and i laughed to myself as i saw their disgust checco could not restrain his impatience but did not like to interrupt me matteo however saw that i was mocking and broke in  confound you filippo why do you torment us when you know we are on pins and needles  checco looked up and saw me laughing and implored  put us out of torture for heavens sake  very well i answered lorenzo asked me about the state of forli and i told him then after thinking awhile he said tell this to checco  and i repeated word for word what lorenzo had said to me and as far as i could i reproduced his accent and gesture  when i had finished they both sat still and silent at last matteo glancing to his cousin said  it seems sufficiently clear  it is indeed very clear answered checco gravely     xvii   i made up my mind to amuse myself now i was sick of being grave and serious when one thinks how short a while youth lasts it is foolish not to take the best advantage of it the time man has at his disposal is not long enough for tragedy and moaning he has only room for a little laughter and then his hair gets grey and his knees shaky and he is left repenting that he did not make more of his opportunities so many people have told me that they have never regretted their vices but often their virtues life is too short to take things seriously let us eat drink and be merry for tomorrow we die  there was really so much to do in forli that amusement became almost hard work there were hunting parties in which we scoured the country all day and returned at night tired and sleepy but with a delicious feeling of relief stretching our limbs like giants waking from their sleep there were excursions to villas where we would be welcomed by some kind lady and repeat on a smaller scale the decameron of boccaccio or imitate the learned conversations of lorenzo and his circle at careggio we could platonise as well as they and we discovered the charm of treating impropriety from a philosophic point of view we would set ourselves some subject and all write sonnets on it and i noticed that the productions of our ladies were always more highly spiced than our own sometimes we would play at being shepherds and shepherdesses but in this i always failed lamentably for my nymph invariably complained that i was not as enterprising as a swain should be then we would act pastoral plays in the shadow of the trees orpheus was our favourite subject and i was always set for the title part rather against my will for i could never bring the proper vigour into my lament for eurydice since it always struck me as both unreasonable and ungallant to be so inconsolable for the loss of one love when there were all around so many to console one  and in forli itself there was a continuous whirl of amusement festivities of every kind crowded on one so that one had scarcely time to sleep from the gravity and instructive tedium of a comedy by terence to a drinking bout or a card party i went everywhere and everywhere received the heartiest of welcomes i could sing and dance and play the lute and act and i was ready to compose a sonnet or an ode at a moments notice in a week i could produce a fiveact tragedy in the senecan manner or an epic on rinaldo or launcelot and as i had not a care in the world and was as merry as a drunken friar they opened their arms to me and gave me the best of all they had  i was attentive to all the ladies and scandalous tongues gave me half a dozen mistresses with details of the siege and capture i wondered whether the amiable giulia heard the stories and what she thought of them occasionally i saw her but i did not trouble to speak to her forli was large enough for the two of us and when people are disagreeable why should you trouble your head about them                                       one afternoon i rode with matteo a few miles out of forli to a villa where there was to be some festivity in honour of a christening it was a beautiful spot with fountains and shady walks and pleasant lawns of wellmown grass and i set myself to the enjoyment of another day among the guests was claudia piacentini i pretended to be very angry with her because at a ball which she had recently given i had not received the honour of an invitation she came to me to ask forgiveness  it was my husband she said which i knew perfectly well he said he would not have you in his house youve had another quarrel with him  how can i help it when i see him the possessor of the lovely claudia  he says he will never be satisfied till he has your blood  i was not alarmed  he talked of making a vow never to cut his beard or his hair till he had his revenge but i implored him not to make himself more hideous than a merciful providence had already made him  i thought of the ferocious ercole with a long untrimmed beard and unkempt hair falling over his face  he would have looked like a wild man of the woods i said i should have had to allow myself to be massacred for the good of society i should have been one more of the martyrs of humanitysaint philip brandolini  i offered her my arm suggesting a saunter through the gardens we wandered along cool paths bordered with myrtle and laurel and cypress trees the air was filled with the song of birds and a gentle breeze bore to us the scent of the spring flowers byandby we came to a little lawn shut in by tall shrubs in the middle a fountain was playing and under the shadow of a chestnuttree was a marble seat supported by griffins in one corner stood a statue of venus framed in green bushes we had left the throng of guests far behind and the place was very still the birds as if oppressed with its beauty had ceased to sing and only the fountain broke the silence the unceasing fall of water was like a lullaby in its monotony and the air was scented with lilac  we sat down the quiet was delightful peace and beauty filled one and i felt a great sense of happiness pass into me like some subtle liquid permeating every corner of my soul the smell of the lilac was beginning to intoxicate me and from my happiness issued a sentiment of love towards all nature i felt as though i could stretch out my arms and embrace its impalpable spirit the venus in the corner gained fleshlike tints of green and yellow and seemed to be melting into life the lilac came across to me in great waves oppressive overpowering  i looked at claudia i thought she was affected as myself she too was overwhelmed by the murmur of the water the warmth the scented air and i was struck again with the wonderful voluptuousness of her beauty her mouth sensual and moist the lips deep red and heavy her neck was wonderfully massive so white that the veins showed clear and blue her clinging dress revealed the fulness of her form its undulating curves she seemed some goddess of sensuality as i looked at her i was filled with a sudden blind desire to possess her i stretched out my arms and she with a cry of passion like an animal surrendered herself to my embrace i drew her to me and kissed her beautiful mouth sensual and moist her lips deep red and heavy  we sat side by side looking at the fountain breathing in the scented air  when can i see you i whispered  tomorrow after midnight come into the little street behind my house and a door will be opened to you  claudia  goodbye you must not come back with me now we have been away so long people would notice us wait here a while after me and then there will be no fear goodbye  she left me and i stretched myself on the marble seat looking at the little rings which the drops made as they fell on the water my love for giulia was indeed finished nowdead buried and a stone venus erected over it as only sign of its existence i tried to think of a suitable inscription time could kill the most obstinate love and a beautiful woman with the breezes of spring to help her could carry away even the remembrance i felt that my life was now complete i had all pleasures imaginable at my beck and call good wines to drink good foods to eat nice clothes games sports and pastimes and last of all the greatest gift the gods can make a beautiful woman to my youth and strength i had arrived at the summit of wisdom the point aimed at by the wise man to take the day as it comes seizing the pleasures avoiding the disagreeable enjoying the present and giving no thought to the past or future that i said to myself is the highest wisdomnever to think for the way of happiness is to live in ones senses as the beasts and like the ox chewing the cud use the mind only to consider ones superiority to the rest of mankind  i laughed a little as i thought of my tears and cries when giulia left me it was not a matter worth troubling about all i should have said to myself was that i was a fool not to abandon her before she abandoned me poor giulia i quite frightened her in the vehemence of my rage  the following evening i would not let matteo go to bed  you must keep me company i said i am going out at one  very well he said if you will tell me where youre going  ah no that is a secret but i am willing to drink her health with you  without a name  yes  to the nameless one then and good luck  then after a little conversation he said  i am glad you have suffered no more from giulia dall aste i was afraid  oh these things pass off i took your advice and found the best way to console myself was to fall in love with somebody else  there was a little excitement in going to this mysterious meeting i wondered whether it was a trap arranged by the amiable ercole to get me in his power and rid himself of my unpleasant person but faint heart never won fair lady and even if he set on me with two or three others i should be able to give a reasonable account of myself                                       but there had been nothing to fear on my way home as the day was breaking i smiled to myself at the matteroffact way in which a woman had opened the little door and shown me into the room claudia had told me of she was evidently well used to her business she did not even take the trouble to look into my face to see who was the newcomer i wondered how many wellcloaked gallants she had let in by the same door i did not care if they were half a hundred i did not suppose the beautiful claudia was more virtuous than myself suddenly it occurred to me that i had revenged myself on ercole piacentini at last and the quaint thought coming unexpectedly made me stop dead and burst into a shout of laughter the thought of that hangdog visage and the beautiful ornaments i had given him was enough to make a dead man merry oh it was a fairer revenge than any i could have dreamed of  but besides that i was filled with a great sense of pleasure because i was at last free i felt that if some slight chain still bound me to giulia now even that was broken and i had recovered my liberty there was no love this time there was a great desire for the magnificent sensual creature with the lips deep red and heavy but it left my mind free i was now again a complete man and this time i had no nemesis to fear     xviii   and so my life went on for a little while filled with pleasure and amusement i was contented with my lot and had no wish for change the time went by and we reached the first week in april girolamo had organised a great ball to celebrate the completion of his palace he had started living in it as soon as there were walls and roof but he had spent years on the decorations taking into his service the best artists he could find in italy and now at last everything was finished the orsi had been invited with peculiar cordiality and on the night we betook ourselves to the palace  we walked up the stately staircase a masterpiece of architecture and found ourselves in the enormous hall which girolamo had designed especially for gorgeous functions it was ablaze with light at the further end on a low stage led up to by three broad steps under a daïs on highbacked golden chairs sat girolamo and caterina sforza behind them in a semicircle and on the steps at each side were the ladies of caterinas suite and a number of gentlemen at the back standing like statues a row of menatarms  it is almost regal said checco pursing up his lips  it is not so poor a thing to be the lord of forli answered matteo fuel to the fire  we approached and girolamo as he saw us rose and came down the steps  hail my checco he said taking both his hands till you had come the assembly was not complete  matteo and i went to the countess she had surpassed herself this night her dress was of cloth of silver shimmering and sparkling in her hair were diamonds shining like fireflies in the night her arms her neck her fingers glittered with costly gems i had never seen her look so beautiful nor so magnificent let them say what they liked checco and matteo and the rest of them but she was born to be a queen how strange that this offspring of the rough condottiere and the lewd woman should have a majesty such as one imagines of a mighty empress descended from countless kings  she took the trouble to be particularly gracious to us me she complimented on some verses she had seen and was very flattering in reference to a pastoral play which i had arranged she could not congratulate my good matteo on any intellectual achievements but the fame of his amours gave her a subject on which she could playfully reproach him she demanded details and i left her listening intently to some history which matteo was whispering in her ear and i knew he was not particular in what he said  i felt in peculiarly high spirits and i looked about for someone on whom to vent my good humour i caught sight of giulia i had seen her once or twice since my return to forli but had never spoken to her now i felt sure of myself i knew i did not care two straws for her but i thought it would please me to have a little revenge i looked at her a moment i made up my mind i went to her and bowed most ceremoniously  donna giulia behold the moth i had used the simile before but not to her so it did not matter  she looked at me undecidedly not quite knowing how to take me  may i offer you my arm i said as blandly as i could  she smiled a little awkwardly and took it  how beautiful the countess is tonight i said everyone will fall in love with her i knew she hated caterina a sentiment which the great lady returned with vigour i would not dare say it to another but i know you are never jealous she is indeed like the moon among the stars  the idea does not seem too new she said coldly  it is all the more comprehensible i am thinking of writing a sonnet on the theme  i imagined it had been done before but the ladies of forli will doubtless be grateful to you  she was getting cross and i knew by experience that when she was cross she always wanted to cry  i am afraid you are angry with me i said  no it is you who are angry with me she answered rather tearfully  i why should you think that  you have not forgiven me for  i wondered whether the conscientious giorgio had had another attack of morality and ridden off into the country  my dear lady i said with a little laugh i assure you that i have forgiven you entirely after all it was not such a very serious matter  no she looked at me with a little surprise  i shrugged my shoulders  you were quite right in what you did those things have to finish some time or other and it really does not so much matter when  i was afraid i had hurt you she said in a low voice  the scene came to my mind the dimlylit room the delicate form lying on the couch cold and indifferent while i was given over to an agony of despair i remembered the glitter of the jewelled ring against the white hand i would have no mercy  my dear giuliayou will allow me to call you giulia  she nodded  my dear giulia i was a little unhappy at first i acknowledge but one gets over those things so quicklya bottle of wine and a good sleep they are like bleeding to a fever  you were unhappy  naturally one is always rather put out when one is dismissed one would prefer to have done the breaking oneself  it was a matter of pride  i am afraid i must confess to it  i did not think so at the time  i laughed  oh that is my excited way of putting things i frightened you but it did not really mean anything  she did not answer after a while i said  you know when one is young one should make the most of ones time fidelity is a stupid virtue unphilosophical and extremely unfashionable  what do you mean  simply this you did not particularly love me and i did not particularly love you  oh  we had a passing fancy for one another and that satisfied there was nothing more to keep us together we should have been very foolish not to break the chain if you had not done so i should have with your womans intuition you saw that and forestalled me  again she did not answer  of course if you had been in love with me or i with you it would have been different but as it was  i see my cousin violante in the corner there will you lead me to her  i did as she asked and as she was bowing me my dismissal i said  we have had a very pleasant talk and we are quite good friends are we not  quite she said  i drew a long breath as i left her i hoped i had hurt i hoped i had humiliated her i wished i could have thought of things to say that would have cut her to the heart i was quite indifferent to her but when i rememberedi hated her  i knew everyone in forli by now and as i turned away from giulia i had no lack of friends with whom to talk the rooms became more crowded every moment the assembly was the most brilliant that forli had ever seen and as the evening wore on the people became more animated a babel of talk drowned the music and the chief topic of conversation was the wonderful beauty of caterina she was bubbling over with high spirits no one knew what had happened to make her so joyful for of late she had suffered a little from the unpopularity of her husband and a sullen look of anger had replaced the old smiles and graces but tonight she was herself again men were standing round talking to her and one heard a shout of laughter from them as every now and then she made some witty repartee and her conversation gained another charm from a sort of soldierly bluntness which people remembered in francesco sforza and which she had inherited people also spoke of the cordiality of girolamo towards our checco he walked up and down the room with him arm in arm talking affectionately it reminded the onlookers of the time when they had been as brothers together caterina occasionally gave them a glance and a little smile of approval she was evidently well pleased with the reconciliation  i was making my way through the crowd watching the various people giving a word here and there or a nod and i thought that life was really a very amusing thing i felt mightily pleased with myself and i wondered where my good friend claudia was i must go and pay her my respects  filippo  i turned and saw scipione moratini standing by his sister with a number of gentlemen and ladies most of them known to me  why are you smiling so contentedly he said you look as if you had lost a pebble and found a diamond in its place  perhaps i have who knows  at that moment i saw ercole piacentini enter the room with his wife i wondered why they were so late claudia was at once seized upon by one of her admirers and leaving her husband sauntered off on the proffered arm ercole came up the room on his way to the count his grim visage was contorted into an expression of amiability which sat on him with an ill grace  this is indeed a day of rejoicing i said even the wicked ogre is trying to look pleasant  giulia gave a little silvery laugh i thought it forced  you have a forgiving spirit dear friend she said accenting the last word in recollection of what i had said to her a truly christian disposition  why i asked smiling  i admire the way in which you have forgiven ercole for the insults he has offered you one does not often find a gentleman who so charitably turns his other cheek to the smiter  i laughed within myself she was trying to be even with me i was glad to see that my darts had taken good effect scipione interposed for what his sister had said was sufficiently bitter  nonsense giulia he said you know filippo is the last man to forgive his enemies until the breath is well out of their bodies but circumstances  giulia pursed up her lips into an expression of contempt  circumstances i was surprised because i remembered the vigour with which messer filippo had vowed to revenge himself  oh but messer filippo considers that he has revenged himself very effectively i said  how  there are more ways of satisfying ones honour than by cutting a hole in a persons chest  what do you mean filippo said scipione  did you not see as he passed  ercole what  did you not see the adornment of his noble head the elegant pair of horns  they looked at me not quite understanding then i caught sight of claudia who was standing close to us  ah i see the diamond i have found in place of the pebble i have lost i pray you excuse me  then as they saw me walk towards claudia they understood and i heard a burst of laughter i took my ladys hand and bowing deeply kissed it with the greatest fervour i glanced at giulia from the corner of my eyes and saw her looking down on the ground with a deep blush of anger on her face my heart leapt for joy to think that i had returned something of the agony she had caused me  the evening grew late and the guests began to go checco as he passed me asked  are you ready  yes i said accompanying him to girolamo and the countess to take our leave  you are very unkind checco said the countess you have not come near me the whole evening  you have been so occupied he answered  but i am not now she replied smiling  the moment i saw you free i came to you  to say goodbye  it is very late  no surely sit down and talk to me  checco did as he was bid and i seeing he meant to stay longer sauntered off again in search of friends the conversation between checco and the countess was rather hindered by the continual leavetakings as the people began to go away rapidly in groups i sat myself down in a window with matteo and we began comparing notes of our evening he told me of a new love to whom he had discovered his passion for the first time  fair wind foul wind i asked laughing  she pretended to be very angry he said but she allowed me to see that if the worst came to the worst she would not permit me to break my heart  i looked out into the room and found that everyone had gone except ercole piacentini who was talking to the count in undertones  i am getting so sleepy said matteo we went forward to the countess who said as she saw us come  go away matteo i will not have you drag checco away yet we have been trying to talk to one another for the last halfhour and now that we have the chance at last i refuse to be disturbed  i would not for worlds rob checco of such pleasure said matteo adding to me as we retired to our window what a nuisance having to wait for ones cousin while a pretty woman is flirting with him  you have me to talk towhat more can you want  i dont want to talk to you at all he answered laughing  girolamo was still with ercole his mobile eyes were moving over the room hardly ever resting on ercoles face but sometimes on us more often on checco i wondered whether he was jealous  at last checco got up and said goodnight then girolamo came forward  you are not going yet he said i want to speak with you on the subject of those taxes  it was the first time he had mentioned them  it is getting so late said checco and these good gentlemen are tired  they can go home really it is very urgent  checco hesitated and looked at us  we will wait for you said matteo  girolamos eyes moved about here and there never resting a moment from checco to me from me to matteo and on to his wife and then on again with extraordinary rapidityit was quite terrifying  one would think you were afraid of leaving checco in our hands said the countess smiling  no returned matteo but i look forward to having some of your attention now that checco is otherwise occupied will you let me languish  she laughed and a rapid glance passed between her and the count  i shall be only too pleased she said come and sit by me one on each side  the count turned to ercole  well goodnight my friend he said goodnight  ercole left us and girolamo taking checcos arm walked up and down the room speaking the countess and matteo commenced a gay conversation although i was close to them i was left alone and i watched the count his eyes fascinated me moving ceaselessly what could be behind them what could be the mans thoughts that his eyes should never rest they enveloped the person they looked athis head every feature of his face his body his clothes one imagined there was no detail they had not caught it was as if they ate into the very soul of the man  the two men tramped up and down talking earnestly i wondered what they were saying at last girolamo stopped  ah well i must have mercy on you i shall tire you to death and you know i do not wish to do anything to harm you  checco smiled  whatever difficulty there has been between us checco you know that there has never on my part been any illfeeling towards you i have always had for you a very sincere and affectionate friendship  and as he said the words an extraordinary change came over him the eyes the mobile eyes stopped still at last for the first time i saw them perfectly steady motionless like glass they looked fixedly into checcos eyes without winking and their immobility was as strange as their perpetual movement and to me it was more terrifying it was as if girolamo was trying to see his own image in checcos soul  we bade them farewell and together issued out into the silence of the night and i felt that behind us the motionless eyes like glass were following us into the darkness     xix   we issued out into the silence of the night there had been a little rain during the day and the air in consequence was fresh and sweet the light breeze of the spring made one expand ones lungs and draw in long breaths one felt the trees bursting out into green leaves and the buds on the plants opening their downy mantles and discovering the flower within light clouds were wandering lazily along the sky and between them shone out a few dim stars checco and matteo walked in front while i lingered enjoying the spring night it filled me with a sweet sadness a reaction from the boisterous joy of the evening and pleasant by the contrast  when matteo fell behind and joined me i received him a little unwillingly disappointed at the interruption of my reverie  i asked checco what the count had said to him of the taxes but he would not tell me he said he wanted to think about the conversation  i made no answer and we walked on in silence we had left the piazza and were going through the narrow streets bordered by the tall black houses it was very late and there was not a soul about there was no sound but that of our own footsteps and of checco walking a few yards in front between the roofs of the houses only a little strip of sky could be seen a single star and the clouds floating lazily the warm air blew in my face and filled me with an intoxication of melancholy i thought how sweet it would be to fall asleep this night and never again to wake i was tired and i wanted the rest of an endless sleep  suddenly i was startled by a cry  i saw from the shadow of the houses black forms spring out on checco an arm was raised and a glittering instrument flashed in the darkness he staggered forward  matteo he cried help help  we rushed forward drawing our swords there was a scuffle three of us against four of them a flash of swords a cry from one of the men as he reeled and fell with a wound from matteos sword then another rush a little band of men suddenly appeared round the corner and ercole piacentinis voice crying  what is it what is it  and matteos answer  help us ercole i have killed one checco is stabbed  ah a cry from ercole and with his men he rushed into the fray  a few more cries still the flash of swords the fall of heavy bodies on the stones  they are done for said matteo  the shouts the clang of metal woke up the neighbours lights were seen at the windows and nightcapped women appeared shrieking doors were thrown open and men came out in their shirts sword in hand  what is it what is it  checco are you hurt asked matteo  no my coat of mail  thank god you had it on i saw you stagger  it was the blow at first i did not know whether i was hurt or not  what is it what is it  the neighbours surrounded us  they have tried to murder checco checco dorsi  my god is he safe  who has done it  all eyes were turned to the four men each one lying heaped up on the ground with the blood streaming from his wounds  they are dead  footpads said ercole they wanted to rob you and did not know you were accompanied  footpads why should footpads rob me this night said checco i wish they were not dead  look look said a bystander there is one moving  the words were hardly out of the mans mouth before one of ercoles soldiers snatched up his dagger and plunged it in the mans neck shouting  bestia  a tremor went through the prostrate body and then it was quite still  you fool said matteo angrily why did you do that  he is a murderer said the soldier  you fool we wanted him alive not dead we could have found out who hired him  what do you mean said ercole they are common robbers  here is the guard cried someone  the guard came and immediately there was a babel of explanation the captain stepped forward and examined the men lying on the ground  they are all dead he said  take them away said ercole let them be put in a church till morning  stop cried checco bring a light and let us see if we can recognise them  not now it is late tomorrow you can do what you like  tomorrow it will be later ercole answered checco bring a light  torches were brought and thrust into the face of each dead man everyone eagerly scrutinised the features drawn up in their last agony  i dont know him  then to another  no  and the other two also were unknown checco examined the face of the last and shook his head but a man broke out excitedly  ah i know him  a cry from us all  who is it  i know him it is a soldier one of the counts guard  ah said matteo and checco looking at one another one of the counts guard  that is a lie said ercole i know them all and i have never seen that face before it is a footpad i tell you  it is not i know him well he is a member of the guard  it is a lie i tell you  ercole is doubtless right said checco they are common thieves let them be taken away they have paid a heavy price for their attempt goodnight my friends goodnight ercole and thanks  the guard took hold of the dead men by the head and by the feet and one after another in single file they bore them off down the dark street we three moved on the crowd gradually melted away and everything again became dark and silent  we walked home side by side without speaking we came to the palazzo orsi entered walked upstairs one after the other into checcos study lights were brought the door closed carefully and checco turned round to us  well  neither i nor matteo spoke checco clenched his fist and his eyes flashed as he hissed out  the cur  we all knew the attempt was the counts  by god i am glad you are safe said matteo  what a fool i was to be taken in by his protestations i ought to have known that he would never forget the injury i had done him  he planned it well said matteo  except for the soldier i remarked he should not have chosen anyone who could be recognised  probably he was the leader but how well he managed everything keeping us after the others and nearly persuading filippo and me to go home before you caterina was in the plot  i wonder he did not defer the attempt when he found you would not be alone i said to checco  he knows i am never alone and such an opportunity would not easily occur again perhaps he thought they could avoid you two or even murder you as well  but ercole and his men i said  yes i have been thinking about them the only explanation i have is that he placed them there to cover their flight if they succeeded and if they failed or could not escape to kill them  as in fact they did i thought i saw ercole make a sign to the soldier who stabbed the only living one  possibly the idea was evidently to destroy all witnesses and all opportunity for inquiry  well said matteo it will show others that it is dangerous to do dirty work for the riario  it will indeed  and now what is to happen said matteo  checco looked at him but did not reply  do you still refuse to do to girolamo as he has tried to do to you  checco answered quietly  no  ah we both cried then you consent  i see no reason now for not taking the law into my own hands  assassination whispered matteo  and checco answered boldly  assassination then after a pause it is the only way open to me do you remember lorenzos words they have been with me every day and i have considered them very very deeply let checco know that it is only the fool who proposes to himself an end when he cannot or will not attain it but the man who deserves the name of man marches straight to the goal with clearness of mind and strength of will he looks at things as they are putting aside all vain appearances and when his intelligence has shown him the means to his end he is a fool if he refuses them and he is a wise man if he uses them steadily and unhesitatingly i know the end and i will attain it i know the means and i will use them steadily without hesitation  i am glad to hear you speak like that at last said matteo we shall have plenty to help us the moratini will join at once jacopo ronchi and lodovico pansecchi are so bitter against the count they will come with us as soon as they hear you have decided to kill the enemy of us all  you are blind matteo do you not see what we must do you mistake the means for the end  what do you mean  the death of girolamo is only a means the end is further and higher  matteo did not speak  i must keep my hands clean from any base motive it must not seem that i am influenced by any personal incentive nothing must come from me the idea of assassination must come from outside  whom do you  i think bartolomeo moratini must propose it and i will yield to his instances  good then i will go to him  that will not do either neither you nor i must be concerned in it afterwards it must be clear to all minds that the orsi were influenced solely by the public welfare do you see i will tell you how it must be filippo must help us he must go to bartolomeo and from his great affection for us talk of our danger and intreat bartolomeo to persuade me to the assassination do you understand filippo  perfectly  will you do it  i will go to him tomorrow  wait till the news of the attempt has spread  i smiled at the completeness with which checco had arranged everything he had evidently thought it all out how had his scruples disappeared  the blackness of the night was sinking before the dawn when we bade one another goodnight     xx   i seemed to have slept a bare halfhour when i was awakened by a great noise downstairs i got up and looking out of the window saw a crowd gathered in the street below they were talking and gesticulating furiously then i remembered the occurrence of the night and i saw that the news had spread and these were citizens come to gather details i went downstairs and found the courtyard thronged immediately i was surrounded by anxious people asking for news very contrary reports had circulated some said that checco had been killed outright others that he had escaped while most asserted that he was wounded all asked for checco  if he is unhurt why does he not show himself they asked  a servant assured them that he was dressing and would be with them at once suddenly there was a shout checco had appeared at the top of the stairs they rushed towards him surrounding him with cries of joy they seized his hand they clung to his legs some of them touched him all over to see that he was indeed unwounded others kissed the lappets of his coat bartolomeo moratini entered the court with his sons and the people shrunk back as he came forward and embraced checco  thank god you are saved he said it will be an evil day for forli when anything happens to you  the people answered in shouts but at that moment another sound was heard withouta long and heavy murmur the people surrounding the doorway looked out and turned in astonishment to their neighbours pointing to the street the murmur spread what was it  make way make way  a strident voice called out the words and ushers pushed the people aside a little troop of men appeared in the entrance and as they sank back there stepped forward the count the count checco started but immediately recovering himself advanced to meet his visitor girolamo walked up to him and taking him in his arms kissed him on the cheeks and said  my checco my checco  we who knew and the others who suspected looked on with astonishment  as soon as i heard the terrible news i rushed to find you said the count are you safequite safe  he embraced him again  you cannot think what agony i suffered when i heard you were wounded how glad i am it was not true oh god in heaven i thank thee for my checco  you are very kind my lord answered our friend  but it is some consolation that the miscreants have met the end which they deserved we must take steps to free the town of all such dangerous persons what will men say of my rule when it is known that the peaceful citizen cannot walk home at night without danger to his life oh checco i blame myself bitterly  you have no cause my lord butwould it not be well to examine the men to see if they are known in forli perhaps they have associates  certainly the idea was in my mind let them be laid out in the marketplace so that all may see them  pardon sir said one of his suite but they were laid in the church of san spirito last night and this morning they have disappeared  matteo and i looked at one another checco kept his eyes fixed on the count  disappeared cried the latter displaying every sign of impatience who is responsible for this offer a reward for the discovery of their bodies and of any accomplices i insist on their being discovered  shortly afterwards he took his leave after repeatedly kissing checco and warmly congratulating matteo and myself on the assistance we had given to our friend to me he said  i regret messer filippo that you are not a forlivese i should be proud to have such a citizen  bartolomeo moratini was still at the palazzo orsi so seizing my opportunity i took him by the arm and walked with him to the statue gallery where we could talk in peace  what do you think of all this i said  he shook his head  it is the beginning of the end of course it is clear to all of us that the assassination was ordered by the count he will persuade nobody of his innocence by his pretended concern all the town is whispering his name  having made a first attempt and failed he will not hesitate to make a second for if he could forgive the injury which he has received from checco he can never forgive the injury which he himself has done him and next time he will not fail  i am terribly concerned i said you know the great affection i have for both the orsi  he stopped and warmly shook my hand  i cannot let checco throw away his life in this way i said  what can be done  only one thing and you suggested it girolamo must be killed  ah but checco will never consent to that  i am afraid not i said gravely you know the delicacy of his conscience  yes and though i think it excessive i admire him for it in these days it is rare to find a man so honest and upright and conscientious as checco but messer filippo one must yield to the ideas of the age one lives in  i too am convinced of his noblemindedness but it will ruin him  i am afraid so sighed the old man stroking his beard  but he must be saved in spite of himself he must be brought to see the necessity of killing the count i spoke as emphatically as i could  he will never consent  he must consent and you are the man to make him do so he would not listen to anything that matteo or i said but for you he has the greatest respect i am sure if anyone can influence him it is you  i have some power over him i believe  will you try dont let him suspect that matteo or i have had anything to do with it or he will not listen it must come solely from you  i will do my best  ah that is good of you but dont be discouraged by his refusals be insistent for our sake and one thing more you know his unselfishness he would not move his hand to save himself but if you showed him that it is for the good of others he could not refuse let him think the safety of us all depends on him he is a man you can only move by his feeling for others  i believe you he answered but i will go to him and i will leave no argument unused  i am sure that your efforts will be rewarded  here i showed myself a perfectly wise man for i only prophesied because i knew     xxi   in the evening bartolomeo returned to the palace and asked for checco at his request matteo and i joined him in checcos study and besides there were his two sons scipione and alessandro bartolomeo was graver than ever  i have come to you now checco impelled by a very strong sense of duty and i wish to talk with you on a matter of the greatest importance  he cleared his throat  firstly are you convinced that the attempt on your life was plotted by girolamo riario  i am sorry for his sake buti am  so are we all absolutely and what do you intend to do now  what can i do nothing  the answer is not nothing you have something to do  and that is  to kill girolamo before he has time to kill you  checco started to his feet  they have been talking to youmatteo and filippo it is they who have put this in your head i knew it would be suggested again  nothing has given me the idea but the irresistible force of circumstances  never i will never consent to that  but he will kill you  i can die  it will be the ruin of your family what will happen to your wife and children if you are dead  if need be they can die too no one who bears the name of orsi fears death  you cannot sacrifice their lives in cold blood  i cannot kill a fellowman in cold blood ah my friend you dont know what is in me i am not religious i have never meddled with priests but something in my heart tells me not to do this thing i dont know what it isconscience or honourbut it is speaking clearly within me  he had his hand on his heart and was speaking very earnestly we followed his eyes and saw them resting on a crucifix  no bartolomeo he said one cannot forget god he is above us always always watching us and what should i say to him with the blood of that man on my hands you may say what you like but believe me it is best to be honest and straightforward and to the utmost of ones ability to carry out the doctrines which christ has left us and upon which he set the seal with the blood of his hands and feet and the wound in his side  bartolomeo looked at me as if it were hopeless to attempt anything against such sentiments but i signed him energetically to go on he hesitated it would be almost tragic if he gave the matter up before checco had time to surrender however he proceeded  you are a good man checco and i respect you deeply for what you have said but if you will not stir to save yourself think of the others  what do you mean said checco starting as if from a dream  have you the right to sacrifice your fellowmen the citizens of forli depend on you  ah they will easily find another leader why you yourself will be of greater assistance to them than i have ever been how much better will they be in your strong hands than with me  no no you are the only man who has power here you could not be replaced  but what can i do more than i am doing i do not seek to leave forli i will stay here and protect myself as much as i can i cannot do more  oh checco look at their state it cannot continue they are ground down now the count must impose these taxes and what will be their condition then the people are dying in their misery and the survivors hold happy those who die how can you look on and see all this and you you know girolamo will kill you it is a matter of time and who can tell how short a time perhaps even now he is forging the weapon of your death  my death my death cried checco all that is nothing  but what will be the lot of the people when you are gone you are the only curb on riarios tyranny when you are dead nothing will keep him back and when once he has eased his path by murder he will not fail to do so again we shall live under perpetual terror of the knife oh have mercy on your fellowcitizens  my country said checco my country  you cannot resist this for the good of your country you must lead us on  and if my soul  it is for your country ah checco think of us all not for ourselves only but for our wives our innocent children we beg you we implore shall we go down on our knees to you  oh my god what shall i do said checco extremely agitated  listen to my father checco said scipione he has right on his side  oh not you too do not overwhelm me i feel you are all against me god help me i know it is wrong but i feel myself wavering  do not think of yourself checco it is for others for our liberty our lives our all that we implore you  you move me terribly you know how i love my country and how can i resist you appealing on her behalf  be brave checco said matteo  it is the highest thing of all that we ask you added bartolomeo man can do nothing greater we ask you to sacrifice yourself even your soul may be for the good of us all  checco buried his face in his hands and groaned  oh god oh god  then with a great sigh he rose and said  be it as you will for the good of my country  ah thanks thanks  bartolomeo took him in his arms and kissed him on both cheeks then suddenly checco tore himself away  but listen to this all of you i have consented and now you must let me speak i swear that in this thing i have no thought of myself if i alone were concerned i would not move i would wait for the assassins knife calmly i would even sacrifice my wife and children and god knows how dearly i love them i would not stir a finger to save myself and i swear by all that is most holy to me that i am actuated by no base motive no ambition no thought of self no petty revenge i would willingly forgive girolamo everything believe me my friends i am honest i swear to you that i am only doing this for the welfare of the men i love for the sake of you all andfor liberty  they warmly pressed his hands  we know it checco we believe it you are a great and a good man  a little later we began to discuss the ways and means everyone had his plan and to it the others had the most conclusive objections we all talked together each one rather annoyed at the unwillingness of the others to listen to him and thinking how contemptible their ideas were beside his own checco sat silent after a while checco spoke  will you listen to me  we held our tongues  first of all he said we must find out who is with us and who is against us  well interrupted scipione there are the two soldiers jacopo ronchi and lodovico pansecchi they are furious with the count and said to me a long while since that they would willingly kill him  our six selves and those two make eight  then there are pietro albanese and paglianino and marco scorsacana  they were devoted adherents of the house of orsi and could be trusted to follow the head of the family to the bottomless pit  eleven counted bartolomeo  and then  each mentioned a name till the total was brought to seventeen  who else asked matteo  that is enough said checco it is as foolish to have more than necessary as to have less now once more who are they  the names were repeated they were all known enemies of the count and most of them related to the orsi  we had better go to them separately and talk to them  it will want care said bartolomeo  oh they will not be backward the first word will bring their adhesion  before that said checco we must make all arrangements every point of the execution must be arranged and to them nothing left but the performance  well my idea is  have the goodness to listen to me said checco you have been talking of committing the deed in church or when he is out walking both of those ways are dangerous for he is always well surrounded and in the former one has to remember the feeling of horror which the people have for sacrilege witness galeazzo in milan and the medici in florence one is always wise to respect the prejudices of the mob  what do you propose  after the midday meal theour friend is in the habit of retiring to a private room while his servants dine he is then almost alone i have often thought it would be an excellent opportunity for an assassin i did not know it would be myself to take the opportunity  he paused and smiled at the pleasantness of the irony  afterwards we shall raise the town and it is well that as many of our partisans as possible be present the best day for that is a marketday when they will come in and we shall have no need of specially summoning them and thus giving rise to suspicion  checco looked at us to see what we thought of his idea then as if from an after thought he added  of course this is all on the spur of the moment  it was well he said that for i was thinking how elaborately everything was planned i wondered how long he had the scheme in his head  we found nothing to say against it  and who will do the actual deed  i will answered checco quietly  you  yes alone i will tell you your parts later  and when  next saturday that is the first marketday  so soon we were all surprised it was only five days off it gave us very little time to think it was terribly near alessandro voiced our feelings  does that give us enough time why not saturday week there are many needful preparations  there are no needful preparations you have your swords ready the others can be warned in a few hours i wish it were tomorrow  it isit is very soon  there is less danger of our courage failing meanwhile we have our goal before us and we must go to it straight with clearness of mind and strength of will  there was nothing more to be said as we separated one of the moratini asked  about the others shall we  you can leave everything to me i take all on my hands will you three come here to play a game of chess on friday night at ten our affairs will occupy us so that we shall not meet in the interval i recommend you to go about as much as possible and let yourselves be seen in all assemblies and parties  checco was taking his captaincy in earnest he would allow no contradiction and no swerving from the path he had marked outon the spur of the moment  we had four days in which to make merry and gather the roses after that who knows we might be dangling from the palace windows in an even line suspended by elegant hempen ropes or our heads might be decorating spear heads and our bodies god knows where i suggested these thoughts to matteo but i found him singularly ungrateful still he agreed with me that we had better make the most of our time and as it accorded with checcos wishes we were able to go to the devil from a sense of duty i am sure claudia never had a lover more ardent than myself during these four days but added to my duties towards that beautiful creature were routs and banquets drinkingparties gamingparties where i plunged heavily in my uncertainty of the future and consequently won a fortune checco had taken on his own shoulders all preparations so that matteo and i had nothing to do but to enjoy ourselves and that we did the only sign i had that checco had been working was a look of intelligence given me by one or two of those whose names had been mentioned in checcos study jacopo ronchi taking leave of me on the thursday night said  we shall meet tomorrow  you are coming to play chess i think i said smiling  when at the appointed hour matteo and i found ourselves again in checcos study we were both rather anxious and nervous my heart was beating quite painfully and i could not restrain my impatience i wished the others would come gradually they made their way in and we shook hands quietly rather mysteriously with an air of schoolboys meeting together in the dark to eat stolen fruit it might have been comic if our minds eye had not presented us with so vivid a picture of a halter  checco began to speak in a low voice slightly trembling his emotion was real enough this time and he did all he could to conceal it  my very dear and faithful fellowcitizens he began it appears that to be born in forli and to live in it in our times is the very greatest misfortune with which one can be born or with which one can live  i never heard such silence as that among the listeners it was awful checcos voice sank lower and lower but yet every word could be distinctly heard the tremor was increasing  is it necessary that birth and life here should be the birth and life of slaves our glorious ancestors never submitted to this terrible misfortune they were free and in their freedom they found life but this is a living death  he recounted the various acts of tyranny which had made the count hateful to his subjects and he insisted on the insecurity in which they lived  you all know the grievous wrongs i have suffered at the hands of the man whom i helped to place on the throne but these wrongs i freely forgive i am filled only with devotion to my country and love to my fellowmen if you others have private grievances i implore you to put them aside and think only that you are the liberators from oppression of all those you love and cherish gather up to your hearts the spirit of brutus when for the sake of freedom he killed the man whom above all others he loved  he gave them the details of the plot told them what he would do himself and what they should do and finally dismissed them  pray to god tonight he said earnestly that he will look with favour upon the work which we have set ourselves and implore him to judge us by the purity of our intentions rather than by the actions which in the imperfection of our knowledge seem to us the only means to our end  we made the sign of the cross and retired as silently as we had come     xxii   my sleep was troubled and when i woke the next morning the sun had only just risen  it was saturday the 14th of april 1488  i went to my window and saw a cloudless sky brilliantly yellow over in the east and elsewhere liquid and white hardening gradually into blue the rays came dancing into my room and in them incessantly whirled countless atoms of dust through the open window blew the spring wind laden with the scents of the country the blossoms of the fruit trees the primroses and violets i had never felt so young and strong and healthy what could one not do on such a day as this i went into matteos room and found him sleeping as calmly as if this were an ordinary day like any other  rise thou sluggard i cried  in a few minutes we were both ready and we went to checco we found him seated at a table polishing a dagger  do you remember in tacitus he said smiling pleasantly how the plot against nero was discovered by one of the conspirators giving his dagger to his freedman to sharpen whereupon the freedman became suspicious and warned the emperor  the philosophers tell us to rise on the mistakes of others i remarked in the same tone  one reason for my affection towards you filippo he answered is that you have nice moral sentiments and a pleasant moral way of looking at things  he held out his dagger and looked at it the blade was beautifully damaskeened the hilt bejewelled  look he said showing me the excellence of the steel and pointing out the makers name then meditatively i have been wondering what sort of blow would be most effective if one wanted to kill a man  you can get most force said matteo by bringing the dagger down from above your headthus  yes but then you may strike the ribs in which case you would not seriously injure your friend  you can hit him in the neck  the space is too small and the chin may get in the way on the other hand a wound in the large vessels of that region is almost immediately fatal  it is an interesting subject i said my opinion is that the best of all blows is an underhand one ripping up the stomach  i took the dagger and showed him what i meant  there are no hindrances in the way of bones it is simple and certainly fatal  yes said checco but not immediately my impression is that the best way is between the shoulders then you strike from the back and your victim can see no uplifted hand to warn him and if he is very quick enable him to ward the blow  it is largely a matter of taste i answered shrugging my shoulders in these things a man has to judge for himself according to his own idiosyncrasies  after a little more conversation i proposed to matteo that we should go out to the marketplace and see the people  yes do said checco and i will go and see my father  as we walked along matteo told me that checco had tried to persuade his father to go away for a while but that he had refused as also had his wife i had seen old orso dorsi once or twice he was very weak and decrepit he never came downstairs but stayed in his own rooms all day by the fireside playing with his grandchildren checco was in the habit of going to see him every day morning and evening but to the rest of us it was as if he did not exist checco was complete master of everything  the marketplace was full of people booths were erected in rows and on the tables the peasant women had displayed their wares vegetables and flowers chickens ducks and all kinds of domestic fowls milk butter eggs and other booths with meat and oil and candles and the sellers were a joyful crew decked out with red and yellow handkerchiefs great chains of gold around their necks and spotless headdresses they were standing behind their tables with a scale on one hand and a little basin full of coppers on the other crying out to one another bargaining shouting and joking laughing quarrelling then there were the purchasers who walked along looking at the goods picking up things and pinching them smelling them tasting them examining them from every point of view and the sellers of tokens and amulets and charms passed through the crowd crying out their wares elbowing cursing when someone knocked against them gliding in and out between peoples legs under the barrow wheels behind the booths were countless urchins chasing one another through the crowd unmindful of kicks and cuffs pouncing on any booth of which the proprietor had turned his back seizing the first thing they could lay hands on and scampering off with all their might and there was a conjurer with a gaping crowd a quack extracting teeth a ballad singer everywhere was noise and bustle and life  one would not say on the first glance that these people were miserably oppressed slaves i said maliciously  you must look beneath the surface replied matteo who had begun to take a very serious view of things in general i used to tell him that he would have a call some day and end up as a shaven monk  let us amuse ourselves i said taking matteo by the arm and dragging him along in search of prey we fixed on a seller of cheap jewellerya huge woman with a treble chin and a red face dripping with perspiration we felt quite sorry for her and went to console her  it is a very cold day i remarked to her whereupon she bulged out her cheeks and blew a blast that nearly carried me away  she took up a necklace of beads and offered it to matteo for his lady love we began to bargain offering her just a little lower than she asked and then as she showed signs of coming down made her a final offer a little lower still at last she seized a broom and attacked us so that we had to fly precipitately  i had never felt in such high spirits i offered to race matteo in every way he likedriding running and walkingbut he refused brutally telling me that i was frivolous then we went home i found that checco had just been hearing mass and he was as solemn and silent as a hangman i went about lamenting that i could get no one to talk to me and at last took refuge with the children who permitted me to join in their games so that at hideandseek and blind mans buff i thoroughly amused myself till dinnertime we ate together and i tried not to be silenced talking the greatest nonsense i could think of but the others sat like owls and did not listen so that i too began to feel depressed  the frowns of the others infected me and the dark pictures that were before their eyes appeared to mine my words failed me and we all three sat gloomily i had started with an excellent appetite but again the others influenced me and i could not eat we toyed with our food wishing the dinner over i moved about restlessly but checco was quite still leaning his face on his hand occasionally raising his eyes and fixing them on matteo or me one of the servants dropped some plates we all started at the sound and checco uttered an oath i had never heard him swear before he was so pale i wondered if he were nervous i asked the time still two hours before we could start how long would they take to pass i had been longing to finish dinner so that i might get up and go away i felt an urgent need for walking but when the meal was over a heaviness came to my legs and i could do nothing but sit and look at the other two matteo filled his tankard and emptied it several times but after awhile as he reached over for the wine he saw checcos eyes fixed on the flagon with a frown on his forehead and the curious raising of one corner of the mouth which was a sign he was displeased matteo withdrew his hand and pushed his mug away it rolled over and fell on the floor we heard the church bell strike the hour it was three oclock would it never be time we sat on and on at last checco rose and began walking up and down the room he called for his children they came and he began talking to them in a husky voice so that they could scarcely understand him then as if frightened of himself he took them in his arms one after the other and kissed them convulsively passionately as one kisses a woman and he told them to go he stifled a sob we sat on and on i counted the minutes i had never lived so long before it was awful  at last  it was halfpast three we got up and took our hats  now my friends said checco drawing a breath of relief our worst troubles are over  we followed him out of the house i noticed the jewelled hilt of his dagger and every now and then i saw him put his hand to it to see that it was really there we passed along the streets saluted by the people a beggar stopped us and checco threw him a piece of gold  god bless you said the man  and checco thanked him fervently  we walked along the narrow streets in the shade but as we turned a corner the sun came full on our faces checco stopped a moment and opened his arms as if to receive the sunbeams in his embrace and turning to us with a smile he said  a good omen  a few more steps brought us to the piazza     xxiii   among the members of the counts household was fabrizio tornielli a cousin of the orsi on the mothers side checco had told him that he wished to talk with girolamo about the money he owed him and thought the best opportunity would be when the count was alone after the meal which he was in the habit of taking at three but as he was very anxious to find the count entirely by himself he begged his cousin to make him a sign when the time came fabrizio had agreed and we had arranged to stroll about the piazza till we saw him we came across our friends to me they looked different from everyone else i wondered that people as they passed did not stop them and ask what was disturbing them  at last one of the palace windows was opened and we saw fabrizio tornielli standing in it looking down on the piazza our opportunity has come my heart beat so violently against my chest that i had to put my hand to it besides matteo and myself marco scorsacana lodovico pansecchi and scipione moratini were to accompany checco into the palace checco took my arm and we walked slowly up the steps while the others followed on our heels the head of the orsi had a key of gold that is to say he was admitted to the rulers presence whenever he presented himself and without formality the guard at the door saluted as we passed making no question we ascended to girolamos private apartments and were admitted by a servant we found ourselves in an anteroom in one wall of which was a large doorway closed by curtains  wait for me here said checco i will go in to the count  the servant raised the curtain checco entered and the curtain fell back behind him  girolamo was alone leaning against the sill of an open window he stretched out his hand kindly  ah checco how goes it  well and you  oh i am always well when i get among my nymphs  he waved his hand to the frescoes on the walls they were the work of a celebrated artist and represented nymphs sporting bathing weaving garlands and offering sacrifice to pan the room had been christened the chamber of the nymphs  girolamo looked round with a contented smile  i am glad everything is finished at last he said eight years ago the stones with which the house is built had not been hewn out of the rock and now every wall is painted everything is carved and decorated and i can sit down and say it is finished  it is indeed a work to be proud of said checco  you dont know how i have looked forward to this checco until now i have always lived in houses which others had built and decorated and lived in but this one has grown up out of my own head i have watched every detail of its construction and i feel it mine as i have never felt anything mine before  he paused a minute looking at the room  sometimes i think i have lost in its completion for it gave me many pleasant hours to watch the progress the hammer of the carpenter the click of the trowel on the brick were music to my ears there is always a melancholy in everything that is finished with a house the moment of its completion is the commencement of its decay who knows how long it will be before these pictures have mouldered off the walls and the very walls themselves are crumbling to dust  as long as your family reigns in forli your palace will preserve its splendour  yes and it seems to me that as the family will preserve the house so the house will preserve the family i feel myself firmer and more settled in forli this seems like a rock to which my fortunes can cling but i am full of hope i am still young and strong i have a good thirty years of life before me and what can one not do in thirty years and then checco my children what a proud day it will be for me when i can take my son by the hand and say to him you are a fullgrown man and you are capable of taking up the sceptre when death takes it from my hand and it will be a good present i shall leave him my head is full of plans forli shall be rich and strong and its prince shall not need to fear his neighbours and the pope and florence shall be glad of his friendship  he looked into space as if he saw the future  but meanwhile i am going to enjoy life i have a wife whom i love a house to be proud of two faithful cities what more can i want  you are a fortunate man said checco  there was a short silence checco looked at him steadily the count turned away and checco put his hand to his dagger he followed him as he was approaching the count turned again with a jewel that he had just taken from the window sill  i was looking at this stone when you came he said bonifazio has brought it me from milan but i am afraid i cannot afford it it is very tempting  he handed it to checco to look at  i dont think it is better than the one you have on your neck he said pointing to the jewel which was set in a medallion of gold hanging from a heavy chain  oh yes said girolamo it is much finer look at the two together  checco approached the stone he held in his hand to the other and as he did so with his other fingers pressed against the counts chest he wanted to see whether by any chance he wore a coat of mail he did not mean to make the same mistake as the count he thought there was nothing but he wished to make quite sure  i think you are right he said but the setting shows off the other so that at first sight it seems more brilliant and no wonder for the chain is a masterpiece  he took it up as if to look at it and as he did so put his hand on the counts shoulder he was certain now  yes said girolamo that was made for me by the best goldsmith in rome it is really a work of art  here is your stone said checco handing it to him but awkwardly so that when girolamo wanted to take it it fell between their hands instinctively he bent down to catch it in a moment checco drew his dagger and buried it in the counts back he staggered forward and fell in a heap on his face  oh god he cried i am killed  it was the first thing we had heard outside we heard the cry the heavy fall the servant rushed to the curtain  they are killing my master he cried  be quiet you fool i said seizing his head from behind and with my hands on his mouth dragging him backwards at the same moment matteo drew his dagger and pierced the mans heart he gave a convulsive leap into the air and then as he fell i pushed him so that he rolled to one side  immediately afterwards the curtain was lifted and checco appeared leaning against the doorpost he was as pale as death and trembling violently he stood silent for a moment openmouthed so that i thought he was about to faint then with an effort he said in a hoarse broken voice  gentlemen we are free  a cry burst from us  liberty  lodovico pansecchi asked  is he dead  a visible shudder passed through checco as if he had been struck by an icy wind he staggered to a chair and groaned  oh god  i will go and see said pansecchi lifting the curtain and entering  we stood still waiting for him we heard a heavy sound and as he appeared he said  there is no doubt now  there was blood on his hands going up to checco he handed him the jewelled dagger  take this it will be more use to you than where you left it  checco turned away in disgust  here take mine said matteo i will take yours it will bring me good luck  the words were hardly out of his mouth when a step was heard outside scipione looked out cautiously  andrea framonti he whispered  good luck indeed said matteo  it was the captain of the guard he was in the habit of coming every day about this hour to receive the password from the count we had forgotten him he entered  goodday to you gentlemen are you waiting to see the count  he caught sight of the corpse lying against the wall  good god what is this what is  he looked at us and stopped suddenly we had surrounded him  treason he cried where is the count  he looked behind him scipione and matteo barred the door  treason he shouted drawing his sword  at the same moment we drew ours and rushed for him he parried a few of our blows but we were too many and he fell pierced with a dozen wounds  the sight of the fray had a magical effect on checco we saw him standing up drawn to his full height his cheeks aflame his eyes flashing  good my friends good luck is on our side he said now we must look alive and work give me my dagger matteo it is sacred now it has been christened in blood with the name of liberty liberty my friends liberty  we flourished our swords and shouted  liberty  now you filippo take lodovico pansecchi and marco and go to the apartment of the countess tell her that she and her children are prisoners and let no one enter or leave do this at any cost the rest of us will go out and rouse the people i have twenty servants armed whom i told to wait in the piazza they will come and guard the palace and give you any help you need come  i did not know the way to the countesss chamber but marco had been a special favourite and knew well the ins and outs of the palace he guided me to the door where we waited in a few minutes we heard cries in the piazza and shouts of liberty there came a tramp of feet up the stairs it was checcos armed servants some of them appeared where we were i sent marco to lead the others  clear the palace of all the servants drive them out into the piazza and if anyone resists kill him  marco nodded and went off the door of the countesss apartments was opened and a lady said  what is this noise  but immediately she saw us she gave a shriek and ran back then leaving two men to guard the door i entered with pansecchi and the rest the countess came forward  what is the meaning of this she said angrily who are you what are these men  madam i said the count your husband is dead and i have been sent to take you prisoner  the women began to weep and wail but the countess did not move a muscle she appeared indifferent to my intelligence  you i said pointing to the ladies and women servants you are to leave the palace at once the countess will be so good as to remain here with her children  then i asked where the children were the women looked at their mistress who said shortly  bring them  i signed to pansecchi who accompanied one of the ladies out of the room and reappeared with the three little children  now madam i said will you dismiss these ladies  she looked at me a moment hesitating the cries from the piazza were growing greater it was becoming a roar that mounted to the palace windows  you can leave me she said  they broke again into shrieks and cries and seemed disinclined to obey the order i had no time to waste  if you do not go at once i shall have you thrown out  the countess stamped her foot  go when i tell you go she said i want no crying and screaming  they moved to the door like a flock of sheep trampling on one another bemoaning their fate at last i had the room free  madam i said you must allow two soldiers to remain in the room  i locked the two doors of the chamber mounted a guard outside each and left her     xxiv   i went out into the piazza it was full of men but where was the enthusiasm we had expected the tumult the shouts of joy was not the tyrant dead but they stood there dismayed confounded like sheep and was not the tyrant dead i saw partisans of checco rushing through the crowd with cries of death to all tyrants and liberty liberty but the people did not move here and there were men mounted on barrows haranguing the people throwing out words of fire but the wind was still and they did not spread some of the younger ones were talking excitedly but the merchants kept calm seeming afraid they asked what was to happen nowwhat checco would do some suggested that the town should be offered to the pope others talked of lodovico sforza and the vengeance he would bring from milan  i caught sight of alessandra moratini  what news what news  oh god i dont know he said with an expression of agony they wont move i thought they would rise up and take the work out of our hands but they are as dull as stones  and the others i asked  they are going through the town trying to rouse the people god knows what success they will have  at that moment there was a stir at one end of the square and a crowd of mechanics surged in headed by a gigantic butcher flourishing a great meataxe they were crying liberty matteo went towards them and began to address them but the butcher interrupted him and shouted coarse words of enthusiasm at which they all yelled with applause  checco came on the scene accompanied by his servants a small crowd followed crying  bravo checco bravo  as soon as the mechanics saw him they rushed towards him surrounding him with cries and cheers the square was growing fuller every moment the shops had been closed and from all quarters came swarming artisans and apprentices i made my way to checco and whispered to him  the people fire them and the rest will follow  a leader of rabble  never mind i said make use of them give way to them now and they will do your will give them the body of the count  he looked at me then nodded and whispered  quickly  i ran to the palace and told marco scorsacana what i had come for we went into the hall of the nymphs the body was lying on its face almost doubled up and the floor was stained with a horrible stream of blood in the back were two wounds lodovico had indeed made sure that the count was safe we caught hold of the body it was not yet cold and dragged it to the window with difficulty we lifted it on to the sill  here is your enemy i cried  then hoisting him we pushed him out and he fell on the stones with a great dull thud a mighty shout burst from the mob as they rushed at the body one man tore the chain off his neck but as he was running away with it another snatched at it in the struggle it broke and one got away with the chain the other with the jewel then with cries of hate they set on the corpse they kicked him and slapped his face and spat on him the rings were wrenched off his fingers his coat was torn away they took his shoes his hose in less than a minute everything had been robbed and he was lying naked naked as when he was born they had no mercy those people they began to laugh and jeer and make foul jokes about his nakedness  the piazza was thronged and every moment people entered the women of the lower classes had come joining their shrill cries to the shouts of the men the noise was stupendous and above all rang the cries of liberty and death  the countess the countess  it became the general cry drowning the others and from all quarters  where is the countess bring her out death to the countess  a cry went up that she was in the palace and the shout became  to the palace to the palace  checco said to us  we must save her if they get hold of her she will be torn to pieces let her be taken to my house  matteo and pansecchi took all the soldiers they could and entered the palace in a few minutes they appeared with caterina and her children they had surrounded her and were walking with drawn swords  a yell broke from these thousands of throats and they surged towards the little band checco shouted out to them to let her go in peace and they held back a little but as she passed they hissed and cursed and called her foul names caterina walked proudly neither turning to the right nor to the left no sign of terror on her face not even a pallid cheek she might have been traversing the piazza amidst the homage of her people suddenly it occurred to a man that she had jewels concealed on her he pushed through the guards and put his hand to her bosom she lifted her hand and hit him in the face a cry of rage broke from the populace and they made a rush matteo and his men stopped closing together and he said  by god i swear i will kill any man who comes within my reach  they shrank back frightened and taking advantage of this the little band hurried out of the piazza  then the people looked at one another waiting for something to do not knowing where to begin their eyes were beginning to flame and their hands to itch for destruction checco saw their feeling and at once pointed to the palace  there are the fruits of your labours your money your jewels your taxes go and take back your own there is the palace we give you the palace  they broke into a cheer a rush was made and they struggled in by the great doors fighting their way up the stairs in search of plunder dispersing through the splendid rooms  checco looked at them disappearing through the gateway  now we have them at last  in a few minutes the stream at the palace gates became double for it consisted of those coming out as well as of those going in the confusion became greater and greater and the rival bands elbowed and struggled and fought the windows were burst open and things thrown outcoverlets linen curtains gorgeous silks oriental brocades satinsand the women stood below to catch them sometimes there was a struggle for possession but the objects were poured out so fast that everyone could be satisfied through the doors men could be seen coming with their arms full their pockets bulging and handing their plunder to their wives to take home while they themselves rushed in again all the little things were taken first and then it was the turn of the furniture people came out with chairs or coffers on their heads bearing them away quickly lest their claim should be disputed sometimes the entrance was stopped by two or three men coming out with a heavy chest or with the pieces of a bedstead then the shouting and pushing and confusion were worse than ever even the furniture gave out under the keen hands and looking round they saw that the walls and floors were bare but there was still something for them they made for the doors and wrenched them away from the piazza we saw men tear out the window frames even the hinges were taken and they streamed out of the palace heavily laden their hands bloody from the work of destruction  all over the town the bells were ringing and still people surged into the piazza thousands had got nothing from the palace and they cried out in anger against their companions envious at their good luck bands had formed themselves with chiefs and they were going about exciting the others checco stood among them unable to restrain them suddenly another cry rose from a thousand throats  the treasury  and irresistible as the sea they rushed to the gabella in a few minutes the same ruin had overtaken it and it was lying bare and empty  scarcely one of them remained in the piazza the corpse was lying on the cold stones naked the face close to the house in which the living man had taken such pride and the house itself with the gaping apertures from the stolen windows looked like a building which had been burnt with fire so that only the walls remained and it was empty but for a few rapacious men who were wandering about like scavengers to see whether anything had been left unfound  the body had done its work and it could rest in peace checco sent for friars who placed it on a stretcher covering its nakedness and bore it to their church  night came and with it a little peace the tumult with which the town was filled quietened down one by one the sounds ceased and over the city fell a troubled sleep     xxv   we were up betimes the town was ours except the citadel checco had gone to the fortress which stood above the town to one side and had summoned the castellan to surrender he had refused as we expected but we were not much troubled for we had caterina and her children in our power and by their means thought we could get hold of the castle  checco had called a meeting of the council to decide what should be done with the town it was purely a measure of politeness for he had already made up his mind and taken steps in accordance with the town so troubled the citadel still in our opponents hands and the armies of lodovico moro at milan it was hopeless to suggest standing alone and checco had decided to offer forli to the pope this would give a protection against external enemies and would not greatly interfere with the internal relations the real power would belong to the chief citizen and checco knew well enough whom that was further the lax grasp of the pope would soon be loosed by death and in the confusion of a long conclave and a change of rulers it would not be impossible to change the state of dependence into real liberty and for checco to add the rights and titles of lordship to the power on the previous night he had sent a messenger to the protonotary savello the papal governor of cesena with an account of what had happened and the offer of the town checco had requested an immediate reply and was expecting it every minute  the council was called for ten oclock at nine checco received savellos secret consent  the president of the council was niccolo tornielli and he opened the sitting by reminding his hearers of their object and calling for their opinions at first no one would speak they did not know what was in checcos mind and they had no wish to say anything that might be offensive to him the forlivesi are a cautious race after a while an old man got up and timidly expressed the thanks of the citizens for the freedom which checco had bestowed upon them suggesting also that he should speak first the lead thus given the worthies rose one after another and said the same things with an air of profound originality  then antonio sassi stood up it was he who had advised girolamo to impose the taxes on the town and he was known to be a deadly enemy of checco the others had been sufficiently astonished when they saw him enter the council chamber for it was thought that he had left the town as ercole piacentini and others of the counts favourites had done when he prepared to speak the surprise was universal  our good friend niccolo he said has called upon us to decide what shall be done with the town  your thoughts seem to be inclining to one foreign master or another but my thoughts are inclining to the liberty in whose name the town has been won  let us maintain the liberty which these men have conquered at the risk of their lives  why should we doubt our ability to preserve the liberty of our ancestors why should we think that we who are descended from such fathers born from their blood bred in their houses should have degenerated so far as to be incapable of seizing the opportunity which is presented to us  let us not fear that the mighty monarch who defends and protects him who walks the path of the just will fail to give us spirit and strength to introduce and firmly to implant in this city the blessed state of liberty  at the end of the sentence antonio sassi paused to see the effect on his auditors  he went on  but as the example of our master has shown us that the shepherd is necessary for the preservation of the flock and as he seems to point out our guardian by the success which he has granted to his arms in the extermination of the wolf i propose that we surrender our liberty to the hands of him who is best able to preserve itchecco dorsi  a cry of astonishment burst from the councillors was this antonio sassi they looked at checco but he was impassive not even the shadow of a thought could be read on his face they asked themselves whether this was prearranged whether checco had bought his enemy or whether it was a sudden device of antonio to make his peace with the victor one could see the agitation of their minds they were tortured they did not know what checco thought should they speak or be silent there was a look of supplication in their faces which was quite pitiful finally one of them made up his mind and rose to second antonio sassis motion then others took their courage in both hands and made speeches full of praise for checco begging him to accept the sovereignty  a grave smile appeared on checcos face but it disappeared at once when he thought there had been sufficient talking he rose to his feet and after thanking his predecessors for their eulogies said  it is true that we have conquered the city at the risk of our lives but it was for the city not for ourselves no thought of our own profit entered our minds but we were possessed by a grave sense of our duty towards our fellowmen our watchwords were liberty and the commonweal from the bottom of my heart i thank antonio sassi and all of you who have such confidence in me that you are willing to surrender the town to my keeping in their good opinion i find a sufficient reward for all i have done but god knows i have no desire to rule i want the love of my fellowcitizens not the fear of subjects i look with dismay upon the toils of a ruler and who would believe in my disinterestedness when he saw me take up the sceptre which the lifeless hand has dropped  forgive me i cannot accept your gift  but there is one who can and will the church is not wont to close her breast to him who seeks refuge beneath her sacred cloak and she will pardon us for having shaken from our necks the hard yoke of tyranny let us give ourselves to the holy father  he was interrupted by the applause of the councillors they did not want to hear further but agreed unanimously and it was forthwith arranged that an embassy should be sent to the governor of cesena to make the offer the meeting was broken up amidst shouts of praise for checco if he had been strong before he was ten times stronger now for the better classes had been afraid of the mob and angry that he should depend on them now they were won too  the people knew that the council was assembled to consult on the destinies of the town and they had come together in thousands outside the council house the news was made known to them at once and when checco appeared at the top of the stairs a mighty shout burst from them and they closed round him with cries and cheers  bravo bravo  he began to walk homewards and the crowd followed making the old grey streets ring with their shouts on each side people were thronging and stood on tiptoe to see him the men waving their caps and throwing them in the air the women madly flourishing handkerchiefs children were hoisted up that they might see the great man pass and joined their shrill cries to the tumult then it occurred to someone to spread his cloak for checco to walk on and at once everyone followed his example and the people pressed and struggled to lay their garments before his feet and baskets of flowers were obtained and scattered before him and the heavy scent of the narcissi filled the air the shouts were of all kinds but at last one arose and gathered strength and replaced the others till ten thousand throats were shouting  pater patriæ pater patriæ  checco walked along with bare head his eyes cast down his face quite white his triumph was so greatthat he was afraid  the great procession entered the street in which stood the palazzo orsi and at the same moment from the gates of the palace issued checcos wife and his children they came towards us followed by a troop of noble ladies they met and checco opening his arms clasped his wife to his breast and kissed her tenderly then with his arm round her waist the children on each side he proceeded towards his house if the enthusiasm had been great before now it was ten times greater the people did not know what to do to show their joy no words could express their emotion they could only give a huge deafening shout  pater patriæ pater patriæ     xxvi   after a while the formal embassy sent to cesena came back with the message that the protonotary savello had been filled with doubts as to whether he should accept the town or no but seeing the forlivesi firm in their desire to come under the papal rule and being convinced that their pious wish had been inspired by the most high ruler of kings he had not ventured to contradict the manifest will of heaven and therefore would come and take possession of the city in person  checco smiled a little as he heard of the worthy mans doubts and the arguments used by the ambassadors to persuade him but he fully agreed with monsignor savellos decision thinking the reasons very cogent  the protonotary was received with all due honour savello was a middlesized stout man with a great round belly and a fat red face doublechinned and bullnecked he had huge ears and tiny eyes like pigs eyes but they were very sharp and shrewd his eyebrows were pale and thin so that with the enormous expanse of shaven cheek his face had a look of almost indecent nakedness his hair was scanty and his crown quite bald and shiny he was gorgeously dressed in violet after the greetings and necessary courtesies he was informed of the state of things in forli he was vexed to find the citadel still in the hands of the castellan who had been summoned with great courtesy to surrender to the papal envoy but without any courtesy at all had very stoutly declined savello said he would speak to the countess and make her order the castellan to open his gates i was sent forward to inform caterina of the last occurrences and of the protonotarys desire for an interview  the countess had received apartments in the orsi palace and it was in one of these rooms that the good savello was ushered  he stopped on the threshold and lifting up his arm stretched out two fingers and in his thick fat voice said  the peace of god be upon you  caterina bowed and crossed herself he went up to her and took her hand in his  madam it has always been my hope that i should some day meet the lady whose fame has reached me as the most talented most beautiful and most virtuous of her time but i did not think that the day of our meeting would be one of such bitterness and woe  he expressed himself in measured tones grave and slow and very fit to the occasion  ah lady you do not know the grief i felt when i was made acquainted with your terrible loss i knew your dear husband in rome and i always felt for him a most profound affection and esteem  you are very kind she said  i can understand that you should be overwhelmed with grief and i trust you do not think my visit importunate i have come to offer you such consolation as is in my power for is it not the most blessed work that our divine master has imposed upon us to comfort the afflicted  i was under the impression that you had come to take over the city on behalf of the pope  ah lady i see that you are angry with me for taking the city from you but do not think i do it of myself ah no i am a slave i am but a servant of his holiness for my part i would have acted far otherwise not only for your own merits great as they are but also for the merits of the duke your brother  his unction was most devout he clasped his hand to his heart and looked up to heaven so earnestly that the pupils of his eyes disappeared beneath the lids and one could only see the whites in this attitude he was an impressive picture of morality  i beseech you madam bravely to bear your evil fortunes do we not know that fortune is uncertain if the city has been taken from you it is the will of god and as a christian you must with resignation submit yourself to his decrees remember that the ways of the almighty are inscrutable the soul of the sinner is purified by suffering we must all pass through the fire perhaps these misfortunes will be the means of saving your soul alive and now that this city has returned to the fold of the masterfor is not the holy father the vicar of christbe assured that the loss you have suffered will be made good to you in the love of his holiness and that eventually you will receive the reward of the sinner who has repented and sit amongst the elect singing hymns of praise to the glory of the master of all things  he paused to take breath i saw caterinas fingers convulsively close round the arm of her chair she was restraining herself with difficulty  but the greatest grief of all is the loss of your husband girolamo ah how beautiful is the grief of a widow but it was the will of god and what has he to complain of now let us think of him clad in robes of light with a golden harp in his hands ah lady he is an angel in heaven and we are miserable sinners upon earth how greatly to be envied is his lot he was a humble pious man and he has his reward ah  but she could hold back no longer she burst forth like a fury  oh how can you stand before me uttering these hypocrisies how dare you say these things to me when you are enjoying the fruits of his death and my misfortune hypocrite you are the vulture feeding with the crows and you come and whine and pray and talk to me of the will of god  she clasped her hands and lifted them passionately towards heaven  oh i hope that my turn will come and then i will show you what is the will of god let them take care  you are incensed dear lady and you know not what you say you will regret that you have accepted my consolations with disdain but i forgive you with a christian spirit  i do not want your forgiveness i despise you  she uttered the words like the hiss of a serpent savellos eyes sparkled a little and his thin lips were drawn rather thinner than before but he only sighed and said gently  you are beside yourself you should turn to the consoler of sorrow watch and pray  what is it you want with me she said taking no notice of his remark  savello hesitated looking at her she beat her foot impatiently  quick she said tell me and let me remain in peace i am sick of you  i came to offer you consolation and to bid you be of good faith  do you think i am a fool if you have no further business with mego  the priest now had some difficulty in containing himself his eyes betrayed him  i am a man of peace and i desire to spill no blood therefore i wished to propose that you should come with me and summon the castellan to give up the citadel which may be the means of avoiding much bloodshed and also of gaining the thanks of the holy father  i will not help you shall i aid you to conquer my own town  you must remember that you are in our hands fair lady he answered meekly  well  i am a man of peace but i might not be able to prevent the people from revenging themselves on you for your refusal it will be impossible to hide from them that you are the cause of the holding back of the citadel  i can well understand that you would hesitate at nothing  it is not i dear lady  ah no you are the servant of the pope it is the will of god  you would be wise to do as we request  there was a look of such ferocity in his face that one saw he would indeed hesitate at nothing caterina thought a little  very well she said to my intense surprise i will do my best  you will gain the gratitude of the holy father and my own thanks  i put an equal value upon both  and now madam i will leave you take comfort and apply yourself to pious exercises in prayer you will find a consolation for all your woes  he raised his hand as before and with the outstretched fingers repeated the blessing     xxvii   we went to the fortress in solemn procession the people as we passed mingling shouts of praise for checco with yells of derision for caterina she walked on with her stately indifference and when the protonotary addressed her repelled him with disdain  the castellan was summoned and the countess addressed him in the words which savello had suggested  as heaven has taken the count from me and also the city i beg you by the confidence i showed in choosing you as castellan to surrender this fortress to the ministers of his holiness the pope  there was a light tinge of irony in her voice and her lips showed the shadow of a smile  the castellan replied gravely  by the confidence you showed in choosing me as castellan i refuse to surrender this fortress to the ministers of his holiness the pope and as heaven has taken the count from you and also the city it may take the citadel too but by god madam no power on earth shall  caterina turned to savello  what shall i do  insist  she solemnly repeated her request and he solemnly made his reply  it is no good she said i know him too well he thinks i am speaking under compulsion he does not know that i am acting of my own will for the great love i bear the pope and the church  we must have the citadel said savello emphatically if we do not get it i cannot answer for your safety  she looked at him then an idea seemed to occur to her  perhaps if i went in and spoke to him he would consent to surrender  we cannot allow you out of our power said checco  you would have my children as hostages  that is true mused savello i think we can let her go  checco disapproved but the priest overruled him and the castellan was summoned again and ordered to admit the countess savello warned her  remember that we hold your children and shall not hesitate to hang them before your eyes if  i know your christian spirit monsignor she interrupted                                       but when she was inside she turned to us and from the ramparts addressed us with mocking laughter the fury which had been boiling within her burst out she hurled at us words of foul abuse so that one might have thought her a fishwife she threatened us with death and every kind of torture in revenge for the murder of her husband  we stood looking up at her with open mouths dumbfounded a cry of rage broke from the people matteo uttered an oath checco looked angrily at savello but said nothing the priest was furious his big red face grew purple and his eyes glistened like a serpents  bastard he hissed bastard  trembling with anger he ordered the children to be sent for and he cried out to the countess  do not think that we shall hesitate your sons shall be hanged before your very eyes  i have the means of making more she replied scornfully  she was lionhearted i could not help feeling admiration for the extraordinary woman surely she could not sacrifice her children and i wondered if a man would have had the courage to give that bold answer to savellos threats  savellos expression had become fiendish he turned to his assistants  let a double scaffold be erected here at once and quickly  the chiefs of the conspiracy retired to a sheltered place while the mob gathered in the piazza and soon the buzz of many voices mingled with hammering and the cries of workmen the countess stood above looking at the people watching the gradual erection of the scaffold  in a little while its completion was announced savello and the others came forward and the priest once more asked her whether she would surrender she did not deign to answer the two boys were brought forwardone was nine the other seven as the people looked upon their youth a murmur of pity passed through them my own heart began to beat a little they looked at the scaffold and could not understand but cesare the younger seeing the strange folk round him and the angry faces began to cry ottaviano was feeling rather tearful too but his superior age made him ashamed and he was making mighty efforts to restrain himself all at once cesare caught sight of his mother and he called to her ottaviano joined him and they both cried out  mother mother  she looked at them but made not the slightest motion she might have been of stone oh it was horrible she was too hard  once more i ask you said savello will you surrender the castle  nono  her voice was quite steady ringing clear as a silver bell  savello made a sign and two men approached the boys then suddenly they seemed to understand with a shriek they ran to checco and falling at his feet clasped his knees ottaviano could hold out no longer he burst into tears and his brother at the elders weakness redoubled his own cries  oh checco dont let them touch us  checco took no notice of them he looked straight in front of him and even when the count had just fallen under his dagger he had not been so ghastly pale the children were sobbing desperately at his knees the men hesitated but there was no pity in the man of god he repeated his sign more decisively than before and the men advanced the children clung to checcos legs crying  checco dont let them touch us  he made no sign he held his eyes straight in front of him as if he saw nothing heard nothing but his face never have i seen such agony  the children were torn from him their hands bound behind their backs how could they my heart was bursting within me but i dared say nothing they were led to the scaffold a sobbing cry came from the people and wailed through the heavy air  the countess stood still looking at her children she made not the slightest motion she might have been of stone  the children cried out  checco checco  it was heartbreaking  go on said savello  a groan burst from checco and he swayed to and fro as if he were going to fall  go on said savello  but checco could not bear it  oh god stopstop  what do you mean said savello angrily go on  i cannot untie them  you fool i threatened to hang them and i will go on  you shall not untie them i tell you  i am master here go on  checco strode towards him with clenched fists  by god master priest you shall go the way you came if you thwart me untie them  in a moment matteo and i had pushed aside the men who held them and cut their cords checco staggered towards the children and they with a bound threw themselves into his arms he clasped them to him passionately and covered them with kisses a shout of joy broke from the people and many burst into tears  suddenly we saw a commotion on the castle walls the countess had fallen back and men were pressing round her  she had fainted     xxviii   we went home rather troubled savello was walking alone very angry with a heavy frown between his eyes refusing to speak checco was silent and angry too half blaming himself for what he had done half glad and bartolomeo moratini was by his side talking to him matteo and i were behind with the children bartolomeo fell back and joined us  i have been trying to persuade checco to apologise to savello but he will not  neither would i said matteo  if they quarrel it will be the worse for the town  if i were checco i would say that the town might go to the devil but i would not apologise to that damned priest  when we reached the palazzo orsi a servant came out to meet us and told checco that a messenger was waiting with important news checco turned to savello and said gloomily  will you come it may need some consultation  the protonotary did not answer but walked sulkily into the house after a few minutes checco came to us and said  the duke of milan is marching against forli with five thousand men  no one spoke but the expression on the protonotarys face grew darker  it is fortunate we have preserved the children said bartolomeo they will be more useful to us alive than dead  savello looked at him and then as if trying to mend the breach but rather against his will said ungraciously  perhaps you were right checco in what you did i did not see at the moment the political wisdom of your act  he could not help the sneer checco flushed a little but on a look from bartolomeo answered  i am sorry if i was too quick of tongue the excitement of the moment and my temper made me scarcely responsible  checco looked as if it were a very bitter pill he had been forced to swallow but the words had a reasonable effect and the clouds began to clear away an earnest discussion was commenced on the future movements the first thing was to send for help against the duke lodovico savello said he would apply to rome checco counted on lorenzo de medici and messengers were forthwith despatched to both then it was decided to gather as much victuals as possible into the town and fortify the walls so that they might be prepared for a siege as to the citadel we knew it was impossible to take it by storm but it would not be difficult to starve it into surrender for on the news of the counts death the gates had been shut with such precipitation that the garrison could not have food for more than two or three days  then checco sent away his wife and children he tried to persuade his father to go too but the orso said he was too old and would rather die in his own town and palace than rush about the country in search of safety in the troubled days of his youth he had been exiled many times and now his only desire was to remain at home in his beloved forli  the news of lodovicos advance threw consternation into the town and when cartloads of provisions were brought in and the fortifications worked at day and night the brave citizens began to quake and tremble they were going to have a siege and would have to fight and it was possible that if they did not sufficiently hide themselves behind the walls they might be killed as i walked through the streets i noticed that the whole populace was distinctly paler it was as if a cold wind had blown between their shoulders and bleached and pinched their faces i smiled and said to them in myself  you have had the plunder of the palace and the customhouses my friends and you liked that very well now you will have to pay for your pleasure  i admired checcos wisdom in giving them good reasons for being faithful to him i imagined that if the beneficent rule of the countess returned it would fare ill with those who had taken part in the looting  checco had caused his family to leave the town as secretly as possible the preparations had been made with the greatest care and the departure effected under cover of night but it leaked out and then the care he had taken in concealing the affair made it more talked of they asked why checco had sent away his wife and children was he afraid of the siege did he intend to leave them himself at the idea of a betrayal anger mixed itself with their fear and they cried out against him and why did he want to do it so secretly why should he try to conceal it a thousand answers were given and all more or less discreditable to checco his wonderful popularity had taken long enough to reach the point when he had walked through the streets amidst showers of narcissi but it looked as if less days would destroy it than years had built it up already he could walk out without being surrounded by the mob and carried about in triumph the shouts of joy had ceased to be a burden to him and no one cried pater patriæ as he passed checco pretended to notice no change but in his heart it tormented him terribly the change had begun on the day of the fiasco at the fortress people blamed the leaders for letting the countess out of their hands and it was a perpetual terror to them to have the enemy in their very midst it would have been bearable to stand an ordinary siege but when they had their own citadel against them what could they do  the townspeople knew that help was coming from rome and florence and the general hope was that the friendly armies would arrive before the terrible duke strange stories were circulated about lodovico people who had seen him at milan described his sallow face with the large hooked nose and the broad heavy chin others told of his cruelty it was notorious that he had murdered his nephew after keeping him a prisoner for years they remembered how he had crushed the revolt of a subject town hanging in the marketplace the whole council young and old and afterwards hunting up everyone suspected of complicity and ruthlessly putting them to death so that a third of the population had perished the forlivesi shuddered and looked anxiously along the roads by which the friendly armies were expected  lorenzo de medici refused to help  there was almost a tumult in the town when the news was told he said that the position of florence made it impossible for him to send troops at the present moment but later he would be able to do whatever we wished it meant that he intended to wait and see how things turned out without coming to open war with the duke unless it was certain that victory would be on our side checco was furious and the people were furious with checco he had depended entirely on the help from florence and when it failed the citizens murmured openly against him saying that he had entered into this thing without preparation without thought of the future we begged checco not to show himself in the town that day but he insisted the people looked at him as he passed keeping perfect silence as yet they neither praised nor blamed but how long would it be before they refrained from cursing him they had blessed checco walked through with set face very pale we asked him to turn back but he refused slackening his pace to prolong the walk as if it gave him a certain painful pleasure to drain the cup of bitterness to the dregs in the piazza we saw two councillors talking together they crossed over to the other side pretending not to see us  now our only hope was in rome the pope had sent a messenger to say that he was preparing an army and bidding us keep steadfast and firm savello posted the notice up in the marketplace and the crowd that read broke out into praises of the pope and savello and as checcos influence diminished savellos increased the protonotary began to take greater authority in the councils and often he seemed to contradict checco for the mere pleasure of overbearing and humiliating him checco became more taciturn and gloomy every day  but the high spirits of the townsmen sank when it was announced that lodovicos army was within a days march and nothing had been heard from rome messengers were sent urging the pope to hasten his army or at least to send a few troops to divert the enemy and encourage the people the citizens mounted the ramparts and watched the two roadsthe road that led from milan and the road that led to rome the duke was coming nearer and nearer the peasants began to flock into the town with their families their cattle and such property as they had been able to carry with them they said the duke was approaching with a mighty army and that he had vowed to put all the inhabitants to the sword to revenge the death of his brother the fear of the fugitives spread to the citizens and there was a general panic the gates were closed and all grown men summoned to arms then they began to lament asking what inexperienced townsmen could do against the trained army of the duke and the women wept and implored their husbands not to risk their precious lives and above all rose the murmur against checco  when would the army come from rome they asked the country folk but they had heard of nothing they looked and looked but the road was empty  and suddenly over the hills was seen appearing the vanguard of the dukes army the troops wound down into the plain and others appeared on the brow of the hills slowly they marched down and others again appeared and others and others and still they appeared on the summit and wound down into the plain they wondered horrorstricken how large the army wasfive ten twenty thousand men would it never end they were panicstricken at last the whole army descended and halted there was a confusion of commands a rushing hither and thither a bustling a troubling it looked like a colony of ants furnishing their winter home the camp was marked out entrenchments were made tents erected and forli was in a state of siege     xxix   the night fell and was passed without sleep or rest the citizens were gathered together on the walls talking anxiously trying to pierce the darkness to see the rescuing army from rome now and then someone thought he heard the tramp of cavalry or saw a gleam of armour and then they stood still holding their breaths listening but they heard nothing saw nothing others were assembled in the piazza and with them a crowd of women and children the churches were full of women praying and weeping the night seemed endless at last a greater chilliness of the air told them that the dawn was at hand gradually the darkness seemed to thin away into a cold pallor and above a bank of cloud in the east appeared a sickly light more anxiously than ever our eyes turned towards rome the mist hid the country from us but some of the watchers thought they saw a black mass far away they pointed it out to the others and all watched eagerly but the black mass grew neither larger nor clearer nor nearer and as great yellow rays shot up above the clouds and the sun rose slowly we saw the road stretched out before us and it was empty empty empty  it was almost a sob that burst from them and moaningly they asked when help was coming at that moment a man ascended the ramparts and told us that the protonotary had received a letter from the pope in which he informed him that relief was on the way a cheer broke from us at last  the siege began in earnest with a simultaneous attack on the four gates of the town but they were well defended and the enemy easily beaten off but all at once we heard a great sound of firing and shouts and shrieks and we saw flames burst from the roof of a house in our thought of lodovico we had forgotten the enemy in our midst and a terrible panic broke out when it was found that the citadel had opened fire the castellan had turned his cannon on the houses surrounding the fortress and the damage was terrible the inhabitants hurried out for their lives taking with them their chattels and fled to safer parts of the town one house had been set on fire and for a while we feared that others would catch and a general conflagration be added to our woes people said it was a visitation of god they talked of divine vengeance for the murder of the count and when checco hurried to the scene of the fire they did not care to restrain themselves any longer but broke out into yells and hisses afterwards when the flames had been extinguished and checco was passing through the piazza they surrounded him hooting and would not let him pass  curs he hissed looking at them furiously with clenched fists then as if unable to contain himself he drew his sword shouting  let me pass  they shrank back and he went his way but immediately he had gone the storm redoubled and the place rang with their cries  by god said checco how willingly i would turn the cannon on them and mow them down like grass  they were the first words he had said of the change of feeling  it was the same with us when we walked through the streetsmatteo and i and the moratinithey hissed and groaned at us and a week before they would have licked our boots and kissed the ground we trod on  the bombardment continued outside and in and it was reported through the town that lodovico had vowed to sack the place and hang every third citizen they knew he was the man to keep his word the murmurs began to grow even louder and voices were heard suggesting a surrender it had occurred to all of them and when the most timid driven to boldness by their fear spoke the word they looked at one another guiltily they gathered together in little knots talking in undertones suspicious stopping suddenly if they saw near anyone who was known to be in favour of the party of liberty they discussed how to make terms for themselves some suggested giving up the town unconditionally others proposed an agreement at last they spoke of appeasing the duke by handing over to him the seventeen conspirators who had planned the murder of girolamo the thought frightened them at first but they soon became used to it they said the orsi had really had no thought of the common good but it was for their private ends that they had killed the count and brought this evil on the town they railed against checco for making them suffer for his own ambition they had lauded him to the skies for refusing the sovereignty but now they said he had only feigned and that he intended to seize the city at the first good opportunity and as to the others they had helped for greed and petty malice as they talked they grew more excited and soon they said it would only be justice to hand over to the duke the authors of their troubles  the day passed and the second night but there were no signs of the help from rome  another night passed by and still nothing came the dawn and the road was as empty as before  and the fourth night came and went and still there was nothing then a great discouragement fell upon the people the army was on the way but why did it not arrive suddenly here and there people were heard asking about the letter from the pope no one had seen the messenger how had it come and a horrible suspicion seized the people so that they rushed to the palazzo orsi asking for savello as soon as he appeared they broke out clamorously  show us the letter  savello refused they insisted they asked for the messenger who had brought it savello said he had been sent back none of us had seen letter or messenger the suspicion seized us too and checco asked  is there a letter  savello looked at him for a moment and answered  no  oh god why did you say there was  i felt sure the army was on the way i wanted to give them confidence  you fool now they will believe nothing you fool you have muddled everything  it is you you told me that the city was firm for the pope  so it was till you came with your lies and your treacheries  savello closed his fist and i thought he was going to strike checco a yell burst from the people  the letter the messenger  checco sprang to the window  there is no letter the protonotary has lied to you no help is coming from rome nor from florence  the people yelled again and another cry arose  surrender surrender  surrender at your pleasure shouted checco but do not think that the duke will forgive you for stripping the count and insulting his body and sacking his palace  savello was standing alone struck dumb in his rage checco turned to him and smiled mockingly     xxx   next day there was a secret meeting of the council of which neither checco nor his friends knew anything but it leaked out that they had been discussing terms which lodovico had offered and the dukes proposal was that riarios children should be surrendered to him and the town ruled by a commission appointed partly by him partly by the forlivesi about midday a servant came and told us that niccolo tornielli and the other members of the council were below seeking admission checco went down and as soon as he saw him niccolo said  checco we have decided that it will be better for us to have charge of the children of count girolamo and therefore we have come to summon you to give them into our hands  checcos answer was short and pointed  if that is all you came for niccolo you can go   at this antonio sassi broke in  we shall not go without the children  i imagine that depends on me and i intend to keep the children  take care checco remember that you are not our master  and who are you antonio i should like to know  i am a member of the council of forli just as you are no more no less  no said checco furiously i will tell you whom you are you are the miserable cur who pandered to the tyrant and helped him to oppress the people which i liberated and the people spat upon you you are the miserable cur who fawned upon me when i had killed the tyrant and in your slavish adulation you proposed to make me ruler in his stead and i spat upon you and now you are afraid again and you are trying to make peace with the duke by betraying me and it is from you that come the propositions to give me up to lodovico that is what you are look at yourself and be proud  antonio was about to give a heated answer but niccolo interrupted him  be quiet antonio now checco let us have the children  i will not i tell you i saved their lives and they are mine by right they are mine because i killed the count because i took them prisoners because i hold them and because they are necessary for my safety  they are necessary for our safety too and we the council of forli summon you checco dorsi to surrender them  and i checco dorsi refuse  then we shall take them by force  niccolo and antonio stepped forward checco whipped out his sword  by god i swear i will kill the first man who crosses this threshold  gradually the people had collected till behind the councillors there was a formidable crowd they watched with eagerness the dispute hailing with joy the opportunity of humiliating their old hero they had broken out in mocking laughter while checco was railing at antonio now they shouted  the children surrender the children  i will not i tell you  they began to hoot and hiss calling checco foul names accusing him of causing all their troubles naming him tyrant and usurper checco stood looking at them trembling with rage niccolo stepped forward once more  give them up checco or it will be the worse for you  advance one step further and i will kill you  the people grew suddenly exasperated a shower of stones fell on us and one striking checco caused a long streak of blood to flow down his forehead  give us the children give us the children  we will call the guard said antonio  the children shouted the mob he will kill them take them from him  there was a rush from behind the councillors and their supporters were driven forward they were met by our drawn swords in another moment it would have been too late and against two hundred we should have been helpless suddenly bartolomeo appeared at the head of the great staircase with the boys  stop he cried here are the children stop  checco turned round to him  i will not have them given up take them away  i have never asked you anything before checco said bartolomeo i have always done as you commanded but this time i implore you to give way  i joined my words to his  you must give way we shall all be massacred  checco stood for a moment undecided then without speaking he turned into a room looking on the court we took it for consent and bartolomeo handed the frightened children to the councillors a shout of joy broke from the people and they marched off with their prize in triumph  i sought checco and found him alone as he heard the shouts of the people a sob came from him in the misery of his humiliation                                       but jacopo ronchi and the two sons of bartolomeo were sent out to discover what was going on we could not think what had driven the council to their step but we felt sure they must have good reasons for acting so courageously we felt also that we had lost all power all hope the wheel had turned and now we were at the bottom after several hours alessandro moratini came back and said  the council has been meeting again and it has been receiving messengers but that is all i know everyone looks upon me with an evil eye and becomes silent at my approach i ask questions and they say they know nothing have seen nothing heard nothing  brutes said matteo  and for these people we risked our lives and fortunes said bartolomeo  checco looked at him curiously and like him i thought of our disinterestedness alessandro having given his news filled a glass with wine and sat down we all kept silence the time went on and the afternoon began to close the hours seemed interminable at last jacopo ronchi came panting  i have discovered everything he said the council has resolved to surrender the town to the duke who promises in return for the children to forgive everything and allow them to rule themselves with half the council appointed by him  we sprang up with a cry  i will not allow it said checco  if the conspirators make any disturbance they are to be outlawed and a price set upon their heads  how far have the negotiations gone i asked  the messengers have been sent to the duke now  in that case there is no time to lose i said  what do you mean said checco  we must escape  escape  or we shall be taken alive and you know what to expect from caterina and lodovico do not think of their promises of pardon  i put no trust in their promises said checco bitterly  filippo is right said bartolomeo we must escape  and quickly i said  i cannot throw up the game said checco and without me what will happen to my supporters  they may find forgiveness in submission but you can do no good here if you are in safety you may be of some assistance anyhow you will have life  checco buried his face in his hands  i cannot i cannot  the moratini and i insisted we adduced every argument finally he consented  we must go together i said we may have to fight our way through  yes said scipione let us meet at the gate by the riverat two  but go there separately if the people find we are attempting to escape they will set upon us  i wish they would said matteo it would give me such satisfaction to put my sword into half a score of their fat bellies  there is no moon  very well at two                                       the night was cloudy and if there had been a moon it would have been covered a thin cold rain was falling and it was pitch dark when i got to the river gate four or five of them were already there we felt too cold and miserable to speak we sat on our horses waiting as new arrivals came we peered into their faces and then on recognising them bent back and sat on silently we were all there but checco we waited for a time at last bartolomeo moratini whispered to matteo  where did you leave checco  in the house he told me to go on saying he would follow shortly two horses were saddled besides mine  whom was the second for  i dont know  we waited on the rain fell thin and cold it struck halfpast two immediately afterwards we heard the sound of hoofs and through the mist saw a black form coming towards us  is it you checco we whispered for the guard of the gate might have heard us we were standing in a little plot of waste ground ten yards from the walls  i cannot go with you said checco  why we cried  ssh said checco i intended to bring my father but he will not come  none of us had thought of old orso orsi  he says he is too old and will not leave his native town i did all i could to persuade him but he bade me go and said they would not dare to touch him i cannot leave him therefore go all of you and i will remain  you must come checco without you we are helpless  and what of your wife and children  your presence will exasperate the tyrants you can do no good only harm  i cannot leave my father unprotected  i will stay checco i said i am not well known as you are i will take care of your father and you can watch over your family and your interests in safety  no you must go it is too dangerous for you  not half so dangerous as for you i will do my best to preserve him let me stay  yes said the others let filippo stay he may escape detection but you would have no chance  the clock struck three  come come it is getting late we must be thirty miles away before daybreak  we had already arranged to go to città di castello which was my native place and in case of accident i had given them letters so that they might be housed and protected for the present  we must have you checco or we will all stay  you will take care of him said checco to me at last  i swear it  very well goodbye filippo and god bless you  they advanced to the gate and checco summoned the captain  open the gate he said shortly  the captain looked at them undecisively i stood behind in the shade so that i could not be seen  if you make a sound we will kill you said checco  they drew their swords he hesitated and checco repeated  open the gate  then he brought out the heavy keys the locks were turned the gate growled on its hinges and one by one they filed out then the gate swung back behind them i heard a short word of command and the clatter of horses hoofs i put the spurs to my own and galloped back into the town  in half an hour the bells were ringing furiously and it was announced from house to house that the conspirators had fled and the town was free     xxxi   in the morning the council met again and resolved that the town should return to its old obedience and by surrendering without conditions hoped to receive pardon for its offences lodovico moro entered in triumph and going to the fortress was received by caterina who came forth from the citadel and with him proceeded to the cathedral to hear mass the good forlivesi were getting used to ovations as the countess passed through the streets they received her with acclamation thronging the road on each side blessing her and her mother and all her ancestors she went her way as indifferent as when she had crossed the same streets a few days back amid the execrations of her faithful subjects the keen observers noticed the firm closing of her mouth which boded no particular good to the forlivesi and consequently redoubled their shouts of joy  the protonotary savello had mysteriously disappeared when the news of checcos flight had been brought him but caterina was soon informed that he had taken refuge in a dominican monastery a light smile broke over her lips as she remarked  one would rather have expected him to take refuge in a convent  then she sent people to him to assure him of her good will and beg him to join her the good man turned pale at the invitation but he dared not refuse it so comforting himself with the thought that she dared not harm the legate of the pope he clothed himself in all his courage and his most gorgeous robes and proceeded to the cathedral  when she saw him she lifted up two fingers and said solemnly  the peace of god be upon you  then before he could recover himself she went on  sir it has always been my hope that i should some day meet the gentleman whose fame has reached me as the most talented most beautiful and most virtuous of his day  madam he interrupted  sir i beseech you bravely to bear your evil fortunes do you not know that fortune is uncertain if the city has been taken from you it is the will of god and as a christian you must with resignation submit yourself to his decrees  it was the beginning of her revenge and one could see how sweet it was the courtiers were sniggering at caterinas speech and savello was the picture of discomfort  messer savello she proceeded on a previous meeting you made me some very excellent admonitions on the will of god now notwithstanding your order i am going to be so bold as to give you some equally excellent lessons on the same subject if you will take your place by my side you will have every opportunity of examining the ways of the almighty which as you may remember you remarked are inscrutable  savello bowed and advanced to the place pointed out to him     xxxii   the first thing i had done on returning to the palazzo orsi was to strip myself of my purple and fine linen shave my beard and moustache cut my hair short put on the clothes of a servingman and look at myself in a mirror if i had met in the street the image i saw i should have passed on without recognising it still i was not dissatisfied with myself and i smiled as i thought that it would not be too extraordinary if a ladys wench lost her heart to such a servingman  i went to the old orsos apartments and found everything quiet i lay down on a couch outside the doors and tried to sleep but my thoughts troubled me my mind was with the sad horsemen galloping through the night and i wondered what the morrow had in store for them and me i knew a price would be set upon my head and i had to remain here in the midst of my enemies as the only protection of an old man of eightyfive  in a little while i heard the bells which told the town that the conspirators had fled and at last i fell into a restless sleep at six i was awakened by a hurry and bustle in the house the servants told one another that checco had gone and the countess would come out of the fortress in a little while and then god only knew what would happen they cowered about whispering taking no notice of the new servingman who had appeared in the night they said that the palace would be given over to the vengeance of the people that the servants would suffer instead of the master and soon one of them gave the signal he said he would not stay and since his wages had not been paid he would take them with him he filled his pockets with such valuables as he could find and going down a back staircase slid out of a little side door and was lost in the labyrinth of streets the others were quick to follow his example and the palace was subjected to a looting in miniature the old steward stood by wringing his hands but they paid no attention to him thinking only of their safety and their pockets before the sun had had time to clear away the early mists they had all fled and besides the old man the house contained only the whitehaired steward a boy of twenty his nephew and myself and checco had been such a sweet and gentle master  we went in to the old orso he was seated in a large armchair by the fireside huddled up in a heavy dressinggown he had sunk his head down in his collar to keep warm so that one could only see the dead eyes the nose and the sunken wrinkled cheeks a velvet cap covered his hair and forehead he was holding his long shrivelled hands to the fire and the flames almost shone through them they trembled incessantly he looked up at the sound of our entrance  ah pietro he said to the steward then after a pause where is fabrizio  fabrizio was the servant in whose particular charge the orso had been put and the old man had become so fond of him that he would take food only from his hand and insisted on having him near at every moment of the day he had been among the first to fill his pockets and decamp  why does not fabrizio come he asked querulously tell him i want him i will not be neglected in this way  pietro did not know what to answer he looked about him in embarrassment  why does not fabrizio come now that checco is master here they neglect me it is scandalous i shall talk to checco about it where is fabrizio tell him to come immediately on pain of my displeasure  his voice was so thin and weak and trembling it was like that of a little child ill with some fever i saw that pietro had nothing to say and orso was beginning to moan feebly  fabrizio has been sent away i said and i have been put in his place  pietro and his nephew looked at me they noticed for the first time that my face was new and they glanced at one another with upraised brows  fabrizio sent away who sent him away i wont have him sent away  checco sent him away  checco had no right to send him away i am master here they treat me as if i were a child it is shameful where is fabrizio i will not have it i tell you it is shameful i shall speak to checco about it where is checco  none of us answered  why dont you answer when i speak to you where is checco  he raised himself in his chair and bent forward to look at us then he fell back  ah i remember now he murmured checco has gone he wanted me to go too but i am too old too old too old i told checco what it would be i know the forlivesi i have known them for eighty years they are more fickle and cowardly than any other people in this cesspool which they call gods earth i have been an exile fourteen times fourteen times i have fled from the city and fourteen times i have returned ah yes i have lived the life in my time but i am tired now i dont want to go out again and besides i am so old i might die before i returned and i want to die in my own house  he looked at the fire murmuring his confidences to the smouldering ashes then he seemed to repeat his talk with checco  no checco i will not come go alone they will not touch me i am orso orsi they will not touch me they dare not go alone and give my love to clarice  clarice was checcos wife he kept silence for a while then he broke out again  i want fabrizio  will i not do instead i asked  who are you  i repeated patiently  i am the servant placed here to serve you instead of fabrizio my name is fabio  your name is fabio he asked looking at me  yes  no it is not why do you tell me your name is fabio i know your face you are not a servingman  you are mistaken i said  no no you are not fabio i know your face who are you  i am fabio  who are you he asked again querulously i cannot remember whom you are why dont you tell me cant you see that i am an old man why dont you tell me  his voice broke into the moan and i thought he would cry he had only seen me twice but among his few visitors the faces of those he saw remained with him and he recognised me partly  i am filippo brandolini i said i have remained here to look after you and see that no harm happens checco wished to stay himself but we insisted on his going  oh you are a gentleman he answered i am glad of that  then as if the talk had tired him he sank deeper down in his chair and fell into a dose  i sent andrea the stewards nephew to see what was happening in the town and pietro and i sat in the large window talking in undertones suddenly pietro stopped and said  what is that  we both listened a confused roar in the distance it resembled the raging of the sea very far away i opened the window and looked out the roar became louder louder and at last we discovered that it was the sound of many voices  what is it asked pietro again  there was a scrambling up the stairs the noise of running feet the door was burst violently open and andrea rushed in  save yourselves he cried save yourselves  what is it  they are coming to sack the palace the countess has given them leave and the whole populace is up  the roar increased and we could distinctly hear the shouting  be quick cried andrea for gods sake be quick they will be here in a moment  i looked to the door and pietro seeing my thoughts said  not that way here is another door which leads along a passage into a side street  he lifted the tapestry and showed a tiny door which he opened i ran to old orso and shook him  wake up i said wake up and come with me  what is it he asked  never mind come with me  i took his arm and tried to lift him out of his chair but he caught hold of the handles and would not stir  i will not move he said what is it  the mob is coming to sack the palace and if they find you here they will kill you  i will not move i am orso orsi they dare not touch me  be quick be quick screamed andrea from the window the first of them have appeared in the street in a moment they will be here  quick quick cried pietro  now the roar had got so loud that it buzzed in ones ears and every instant it grew louder  be quick be quick  you must come i said and pietro joined his prayers to my commands but nothing would move the old man  i tell you i will not fly i am the head of my house i am orso orsi i will not fly like a dog before the rabble  for your sons sakefor our sake i implored we shall be killed with you  you may go the door is open for you i will stay alone  he seemed to have regained his old spirit it was as if a last flame were flickering up  we will not leave you i said i have been put by checco to protect you and if you are killed i must be killed too our only chance is to fly  quick quick cried andrea they are nearly here  oh master master cried pietro accept the means he offers you  be quick be quick  would you have me slink down a back passage like a thief in my own house never  they have reached the doors cried andrea  the noise was deafening below the gates had been closed and we heard a thunder of blows stones were thrown sticks beaten against the iron then they seemed to take some great instrument and pound against the locks again and again the blows were repeated but at last there was a crash a mighty shout broke from the people and we heard a rush i sprang to the door of the orsos room and locked and bolted it then calling the others to help me i dragged a heavy chest against it we placed another chest on the first and dragged the bedstead up pushing it against the chests  we were only just in time for like water rushing at once through every crevice the mob surged up and filled every corner of the house they came to our door and pushed it to their surprise it did not open outside someone cried  its locked  the hindrance excited them and the crowd gathered greater outside  break it open they cried  immediately heavy blows thundered down on the lock and handle  for gods sake come i said turning to orso he did not answer there was no time to lose and i could not conquer his obstinacy  then i shall force you i cried catching hold of both his arms and dragging him from the chair he held on as tight as he could but his strength was nothing against mine i caught hold of him and was lifting him in my arms when the door was burst open the rush of people threw down the barricade and the crowd surged into the room it was too late i made a rush for the little door with orso but i could not get to it they crowded round me with a shout  take him i cried to pietro while i defend you  i drew my sword but immediately a bludgeon fell on it and it smashed in two i gave a shout and rushed at my assailants but it was hopeless i felt a crushing blow on my head i sank down insensible     xxxiii   when i opened my eyes i found myself on a bed in a darkened room by my side was sitting a woman i looked at her and wondered who she was  who the devil are you i asked somewhat impolitely  at the words someone else stepped forward and bent over me i recognised andrea then i recollected what had occurred  where is the orso i asked is he safe  do you feel better he said  i am all right where is the orso i tried to sit up but my head swam i felt horribly sick and sank back  what is the matter i moaned  only a broken head said andrea with a little smile if you had been a real servingman instead of a fine gentleman masquerading you wouldnt think twice about it  have pity on my infirmities dear boy i murmured faintly i dont pretend that my head is as wooden as yours  then he explained  when you were beaten down they made a rush for the old master and bore him off  oh i cried i promised checco to look after him what will he think  it was not your fault at the same time he renewed the bandages round my head and put cooling lotions on  good boy i said as i enjoyed the cold water on my throbbing head  when i saw the blows come down on your head and you fall like a stone i thought you were killed with you softheaded people one never knows  it appears to amuse you i said but what happened afterwards  in the excitement of their capture they paid no attention to us and my uncle and i dragged you through the little door and eventually carried you here you are a weight  and where am i  in my mothers house where you are requested to stay as long as it suits your convenience  and orso  my uncle went out to see and reports that they have put him in prison as yet no harm has been done him the palace has been sacked nothing but the bare walls remain  at that moment pietro came in panting  two of the conspirators have been taken  my god not checco or matteo  no pietro albanese and marco scorsacana  how did the others escape  i dont know all i heard was that the horse of marco broke down and pietro refused to leave him at a village close to the frontier pietro was recognised and they were both arrested and sent here for the sake of the reward  my god  they were brought into the town on asses with their hands tied behind their backs and the mob yelled with derision and threw stones and refuse at them  and now  they have been taken to the prison and  well  the execution is to take place tomorrow  i groaned pietro albanese and marco had been like damon and pythias i shuddered as i thought of the fate in store for them they had been conspicuous in their hatred of the count and it was they who had helped to throw the body into the piazza i knew there would be no forgiveness in caterinas heart and all the night i wondered what vengeance she was meditating     xxxiv   next day i insisted on getting up andrea helped me to dress and we went out together  no one would mistake you for a gentleman today he laughed  my clothes were shabby enough in the first instance and in the scuffle of the previous day they had received usage which did not improve them moreover i had a two days beard and my head muffled up in bandages so that i could well imagine that my appearance was not attractive but i was too sore at heart to smile at his remark or make retort i could not help thinking of the terrible scene which awaited us  we found the piazza crowded opposite the riario palace was erected a stage on which were seats but these were empty the sky was blue the sun shone merrily on the people and the air was soft and warm nature was full of peace and goodwill but in mens hearts was lust of blood a flourish of trumpets announced the approach of caterina and her suite amid ringing cheers she entered the square accompanied by her halfbrother the duke of milan and by the protonotary savello they took their seats on the platform the duke on her right savello on her left she turned to the priest and talked most amiably to him he smiled and bowed but his agitation was shown by the twitching of his hands fidgeting with the lappet of his cloak  a beating of drums was heard followed by a sudden silence a guard of soldiers entered the piazza tramping steadily with heavy footsteps then two steps behind them a single figure without a doublet hatless his shirt all torn his hands tied behind his back it was marco scorsacana the foul mob broke out into a yell at the sight of him he walked slowly but with his head proudly erect paying no heed to the hooting and hissing which rang in his ears on each side walked a barefooted monk bearing a crucifix he was followed by another troop of soldiers and after them came another bareheaded figure his hands also tied behind his back but he kept his head bent over his chest and his eyes fixed on the ground shrinking at the yells of derision poor pietro he too was accompanied by the solemn monks the procession was finished by the drummers beating their drums incessantly maddeningly  they advanced to the platform and there the soldiers falling back the prisoners were left standing before their judges  marco scorsacana and pietro albanese said the countess in a clear calm voice you have been found guilty of murder and treason and as it was you who cast the body of my dear husband out of the palace window on to the hard stones of the piazza so you are sentenced to be hanged from that same window and your bodies cast down on to the hard stones of the piazza  a murmur of approval came from the populace pietro winced but marco turned to him and said something which i could not hear but i saw the glance of deep affection and the answering smile of pietro as he seemed to take courage  the countess turned to savello  do you not agree that the judgment is just  most just he whispered  the protonotary says most just she called aloud so that all should hear the man winced  marco looked at him scornfully and said i would ten times rather be in my place than in yours  the countess smiled at the priest and said you see i carry out the will of god in doing unto others as they themselves have done  she made a sign and the two men were led to the palace and up the stairs the window of the hall of nymphs was thrown open and a beam thrust out to which was attached a rope pietro appeared at the window with one end of the rope round his neck  goodbye sweet friend he said to marco  goodbye pietrino and marco kissed him  then two men hurled him from the sill and he swung in midair a horrible movement passed through his body and it swayed from side to side there was a pause a man stretched out with a sword and cut the rope from the people came a huge shout and they caught the body as it fell and tore it to pieces in a few minutes marco appeared at the window but he boldly sprang out into space needing no help in a little while he was a hanging corpse and in a little while more the mob had fallen on him like wolves i hid my face in my hands it was awful oh god oh god  then another beating of drums broke through the tumult i looked up wondering what was coming a troop of soldiers entered the square and after them an ass led by a fool with bells and bauble on the ass was a miserable old man orso orsi  oh i groaned what are they going to do to him  a shout of laughter burst from the mob and the clown flourished his bauble and bowed acknowledgments from side to side a halt was made before the stage and caterina spoke again  orso orsi you have been sentenced to see your palace destroyed before your eyesstone by stone  the people shouted and a rush was made for the orsi palace the old man said nothing and showed no sign of hearing or feeling i hoped that all sensation had left him the procession moved on until it came to the old house which stood already like a wreck for the pillagers had left nothing which could be moved then the work began and stone by stone the mighty building was torn to pieces orso looked on indifferently at the terrible work for no greater humiliation can be offered to the italian nobleman than this the orso palace had stood three hundred years and the most famous architects craftsmen and artists had worked on it and now it was gone  the old man was brought back into the piazza and once more the cruel woman spoke  you have received punishment for yourself orso and now you are to receive punishment for your son make room  and the soldiers repeating her words cried  make room  the people were pushed and hustled back till they were crammed against the house walls leaving in the centre an enormous empty space then a flourish of trumpets and the people made an opening at the end of the square to allow the passage of a horse and man the horsea huge black stallionprancing and plunging and on each side a man was holding the bridle on his back sat a big man dressed all in flaming red and a red hood covered his head and face leaving two apertures for the eyes a horrified whisper ran round the square  the hangman  in the centre of the piazza he stopped caterina addressed the orso  have you anything to say orso orsi  at last he seemed to hear he looked at her and then with all the strength he had hurled the word at her  bastard  she flushed angrily and made a sign two men seized the old man and dragged him off the mule they caught hold of his legs throwing him to the ground and with a thick rope tied his ankles together  at this i understood i was seized with sudden horror and i cried out obeying a sudden impulse i started forward i dont know what i was going to do i felt i must protect him or die with him i started forward but andrea threw his arms round me and held me back  let me go i said struggling  dont be a fool he whispered what can you do against all these  it was no use i gave way oh god that i should stand by and see this awful thing and be utterly powerless i wondered the people could suffer this last atrocity i thought they must scream and rush to save the wretched man but they watchedthey watched eagerly  by his feet they dragged him to the horse and the end of the rope round his ankles they tied to the horses tail and about the riders waist  ready cried the hangman  yes answered the soldiers  they all sprang back the hangman dug the spurs into his horse the people gave a huge shout and the fiery beast went careering round the square at full tilt the awful burden dragging behind terrified him and with head strained forward and starting eyes he galloped madly the mob urged him on with cries and his rider dug the spurs in deeply the pavement was scattered with blood  god knows how long the wretched man lived i hope he died at once at last the brutes furious career was stopped the ropes were cut the corpse fell back and the people again making passage horse and rider disappeared in the middle of the piazza in a pool of blood lay a shapeless mass it was ordered that it should be left there till nightfall as an example to evildoers  andrea wanted to come away but i insisted on staying to see what happened more but it was the end for caterina turned to savello and said  i do not forget that all power comes from god monsignor and i wish solemnly to render thanks to the divine majesty who has saved me my children and the state therefore i shall order a grand procession which shall march round the town and afterwards hear mass at the cathedral  it shows madam replied savello that you are a pious and truly christian woman     xxxv   when it was night and the piazza deserted andrea and i and the old steward went out and made our way to the place where the horrible corpse was lying we wrapped it in a long black cloth and took it up silently bearing it to the church where for generations the orsi had been buried a darkrobed monk met us in the nave and led the way to a door which he opened then as if frightened left us we found ourselves in the cloisters we laid the body down under an arch and advanced into the centre where was a plot of green scattered over with little crosses we took spades and began to dig a thin rain drizzled down and the ground was stiff and clayey it was hard work and i sweated i took off my coat and allowed the rain to fall on me unprotected i was soon wet to the skin silently andrea and i turned up the soil while pietro beneath the cloisters watched by the body and prayed we were knee deep now and still we threw up heavy spadefuls of clay at last i said  it is enough  we climbed out and went to the body we took it up and bore it to the grave and reverently we laid it in pietro placed a crucifix on the old masters breast and then we began to pile in the earth  and so without priests without mourning in the dead of night and by the drizzling rain was buried orso orsi the great head of the family in his time he had been excellent in war and in all the arts of peace he had been noted for his skill in commerce in politics he had been the first of his city and besides he had been a great and generous patron of the arts but he lived too long and died thus miserably  next day i set about thinking what i should do i could be of no more use to anyone in forli indeed i had never been of use for i had only stood by and watched while those i loved and honoured were being put to cruel deaths and now i must see that my presence did not harm my kind hosts caterina had thrown into prison some fifty of those who had taken part in the rebellion notwithstanding her solemn promise of amnesty and i knew well enough that if i were discovered pietro and andrea would suffer as severe a punishment as myself they gave no sign that my presence was a menace to them but in the womans eyes andreas mother i saw an anxious look and at any unexpected sound she would start and look fearfully at me i made up my mind to go immediately when i told andrea he insisted on coming with me and although i painted the danger in lively colours he would not be dissuaded the next day was marketday and we resolved to slip out in a cart as soon as the gates were opened we would be taken for tradesmen and no one would pay attention to us  i was anxious to see what was happening in the town and what people were talking of but i thought it prudent not to venture out for my disguise might be seen through and if i were discovered i knew well what to expect so i sat at home twiddling my thumbs and chattering with andrea at last getting tired of doing nothing and seeing the good woman about to scrub out her courtyard i volunteered to do it for her i got a broom and a pail of water and began sweeping away vigorously while andrea stood in the doorway scoffing for a little while i forgot the terrible scene in the piazza  there was a knock at the door we stopped and listened the knock was repeated and as no answer was given the latch was raised and the door opened a servantmaid walked in and carefully closed it behind her i recognised her at once it was giulias maid i shrank back and andrea stood in front of me his mother went forward  and pray madam what can i do for you  the maid did not answer but stepped past her  there is a servingman here for whom i have a message  she came straight towards me and handed me a piece of paper then without another word slid back to the door and slipped out  the note contained four words come to me tonight and the handwriting was giulias a strange feeling came over me as i looked at it and my hand trembled a little then i began pondering why did she want me i could not think and it occurred to me that perhaps she wished to give me up to the countess i knew she hated me but i could not think her as vile as that after all she was her fathers daughter and bartolomeo was a gentleman andrea looked at me questioningly  it is an invitation from my greatest enemy to put myself in her hands  but you will not  yes i said i will  why  because it is a woman  but do you think she would betray you  she might  and you are going to take the risk  i think i should be glad to prove her so utterly worthless  andrea looked at me openmouthed he could not understand an idea struck him  are you in love with her  no i was  and now  now i do not even hate her     xxxvi   the night came and when everyone had gone to bed and the town was quiet i said to andrea wait for me here and if i do not come back in two hours you will know  he interrupted me  i am coming with you  nonsense i said i dont know what danger there may be and there is no object in your exposing yourself to it  where you go i will go too  i argued with him but he was an obstinate youth  we walked along the dark streets running like thieves round corners when we heard the heavy footsteps of the watch the palazzo aste was all dark we waited outside a little while but no one came and i dared not knock then i remembered the side door i still had the key and i took it from my pocket  wait outside i said to andrea  no i am coming with you  perhaps there is an ambush  two are more likely to escape than one  i put the key in the lock and as i did so my heart beat and my hand trembled but not with fear the key turned and i pushed the door open we entered and walked up the stairs sensations which i had forgotten crowded upon me and my heart turned sick we came to an anteroom dimly lit i signed andrea to wait and myself passed into the room i knew too well it was that in which i had last seen giuliathe giulia i had lovedand nothing was altered in it the same couch stood in the centre and on it lay giulia sleeping she started up  filippo  at your service madam  lucia recognised you in the street yesterday and she followed you to the house in which you are staying  yes  my father sent me a message that you were still here and if i wanted help would give it me  i will do whatever i can for you  what a fool i was to come my head was in a whirl my heart was bursting my god she was beautiful i looked at her and suddenly i knew that all the dreary indifference i had built up had melted away at the first look into her eyes and i was terrified my love was not dead it was alive alive oh how i adored that woman i burned to take her in my arms and cover her soft mouth with kisses  oh why had i come i was mad i cursed my weakness and when i saw her standing there cold and indifferent as ever i felt so furious a rage within me that i could have killed her and i felt sick with love  messer filippo she said will you help me now i have been warned by one of the countesss women that the guard have orders to arrest me tomorrow and i know what the daughter of bartolomeo moratini may expect i must fly tonightat once  i will help you i answered  what shall i do  i can disguise you as a common woman the mother of my friend andrea will lend you clothes and andrea and i will accompany you or if you prefer after we have safely passed the gates he shall accompany you alone wherever you wish to go  why will you not come  i feared my presence would make the journey more tedious to you  and to you  to me it would be a matter of complete indifference  she looked at me a moment then she cried  no i will not come  why not  because you hate me  i shrugged my shoulders  i should have thought my sentiments were of no consequence  i will not be helped by you you hate me too much i will stay in forli  you are your own mistress why do you mind  why do i mind shall i tell you she came close up to me becausebecause i love you  my head swam and i felt myself stagger i did not know what was happening  filippo  giulia  i opened my arms and she fell into them and i held her close to my heart and i covered her with kisses i covered her mouth and eyes and neck with kisses  giulia giulia  but i wrenched myself away and taking hold of her shoulders said almost savagely  but this time i must have you altogether swear that you will  she lifted her sweet face and smiled and nestling close up to me whispered  will you marry me  i kissed her  i loved you always i said i tried to hate you but i could not  do you remember that night at the palace you said you had never cared for me  ah yes but you did not believe me  i felt it was not true but i did not know and it pained me and then claudia  i was so angry with you i would have done anything to revenge myself but still i loved you  but claudiayou loved her too  no i protested i hated her and despised her but i tried to forget you and i wanted you to feel certain that i no longer cared for you  i hate her  forgive me i said  i forgive you everything she answered  i kissed her passionately and i did not remember that i too had something to forgive  the time flew on and when a ray of light pierced through the windows i started up in surprise  we must make haste i said i went into the anteroom and found andrea fast asleep i shook him  at what time do the gates open i asked  he rubbed his eyes and on a repetition of the question answered five  it was halfpast four we had no time to lose i thought for a minute andrea would have to go to his mothers and find the needful clothes then come back it would all take time and time meant life and death then the sight of a young and beautiful woman might arouse the guards attention and giulia might be recognised  an idea struck me  undress i said to andrea  what  undress quickly  he looked at me blankly i signed to him and as he was not rapid enough i tore off his coat then he understood and in a minute he was standing in his shirt while i had walked off with his clothes i handed them to giulia and came back andrea was standing in the middle of the room the very picture of misery he looked very ridiculous  look here andrea i said i have given your clothes to a lady who is going to accompany me instead of you do you see  yes and what am i to do  you can stay with your mother for the present and then if you like you can join me at my house in città di castello  and now  oh now you can go home  he did not answer but looked at me dubiously then at his bare legs and his shirt then again at me i pretended not to understand  you seem troubled my dear andrea what is the matter  he pointed to his shirt  well i said  it is usual to go about in clothes  a broadminded youth like you should be free from such prejudice i answered gravely on such a morning you will find life much pleasanter without hose and doublet  common decency  my dear boy are you not aware that our first parents were content with figleaves and are you not satisfied with a whole shirt besides have you not a fine pair of legs and a handsome body what are you ashamed of  everyone will follow me  all the more reason to have something to show them  the guard will lock me up  how will the jailors daughter be able to resist you in that costume  then another idea struck me and i said  well andrea i am grieved to find you of so unpoetical a turn of mind but i will deny you nothing i went to giulia and taking the clothes she had just cast off brought them to andrea  there  he gave a cry of delight but on seizing them and discovering petticoats and flounces his face fell i leant against the wall and laughed till my sides ached  then giulia appeared a most fascinating servingboy  goodbye i cried and hurried down the stairs we marched boldly to the city gate and with beating hearts and innocent countenances passed through and found ourselves in the open country     xxxvii   the orsi and the moratini had taken my advice and gone to città di castello so it was to that city we directed our way and eventually reached it in safety i did not know where bartolomeo moratini was and i did not wish to take giulia to my own house so i placed her in a benedictine convent the superior of which on hearing my name promised to give her guest every care  then i went to the old palace which i had not seen for so many years i had been too excited to get really home to notice anything of the streets as i passed through them but as i came in view of the wellremembered walls i stopped overcome with strange emotions i remembered the day when news had been brought me that the old vitelli who was then ruler of castello had murmured certain things about me which caused my neck to itch uncomfortablyand upon this i had entrusted my little brother to a relative who was one of the canons of the cathedral and the palace to my steward and mounting my horse ridden off with all possible haste i had supposed that a few months would calm the angry vitelli but the months had lengthened out into years and his death had come before his forgiveness but now i really was back and i did not mean to go away my travels had taught me caution and my intrigues at forli given me enough excitement for some time besides i was going to marry and rear a family for as if fortune could not give scantily i had gained a love as well as a home and everything i wished was granted  my meditations were interrupted  corpo di bacco  it was matteo and in a moment i was in his arms  i was just asking myself what that fool was staring at this house for and thinking of telling him it was impolite to stare when i recognised the houses owner  i laughed and shook his hand again  well filippo i am sure we shall be very pleased to offer you hospitality  you are most kind  we have annexed the whole place but i daresay you will be able to find room somewhere but come in  thanks i said if you do not mind  i found checco bartolomeo and his two sons sitting together they jumped up when they saw me  what news what news they asked  then suddenly i remembered the terrible story i had to tell for in my own happiness i had forgotten everything that went before i suddenly became grave  bad news i said bad news  oh god i have been foreboding it every night i have dreamed awful things  checco i answered i have done all i could but alas it has been of no avail you left me as a protector and i have been able to protect no one  go on  then i began my story i told them how the council had opened the gates surrendering unconditionally and how the countess had sallied forth in triumph that was nothing if there had been no worse news for them than that but checco clenched his hands as i related the sacking of his palace and i told him how old orso had refused to fly and had been seized while i had lain senseless on the floor  you did your best filippo said checco you could do nothing more but afterwards  i told them how marco scorsacana and pietro had been taken prisoners and led into the town like thieves caught in the act how the crowd had gathered together and how they had been brought to the square and hanged from the palace window and their bodies torn to pieces by the people  oh god uttered checco and all this is my fault  i told them that the old orso was brought forward and taken to his palace and before his eyes it was torn down stone after stone till only a heap of ruins marked the site  checco gave a sob  my palace my home  and then as if the blow was too great he bent his head and burst into tears  do not weep yet checco i said you will have cause for tears presently  he looked up  what more  your father  filippo  he started up and stepping back stood against the wall his arms against it outstretched with white and haggard face and staring eyes like a hunted beast at bay  i told him how they had taken his father and bound him and thrown him down and tied him to the savage beast and how he had been dragged along till his blood spattered on the pavement and his soul left him  checco uttered a most awful groan and looking up to heaven as if to call it in witness cried  oh god  then sinking into a chair he buried his face in his hands and in his agony swayed from side to side matteo went up to him and put his hand on his shoulder trying to comfort him but he motioned him aside  let me be  he rose from his seat and we saw that his eyes were tearless for his grief was too great for weeping then with his hands before him like a blind man he staggered to the door and left us  scipione the weak man was crying     xxxviii   one does not really feel much grief at other peoples sorrows one tries and puts on a melancholy facethinking oneself brutal for not caring more but one cannot and it is better for if one grieved too deeply at other peoples tears life would be unendurable and every man has sufficient sorrows of his own without taking to heart his neighbours the explanation of all this is that three days after my return to città di castello i was married to giulia  now i remember nothing more i have a confused idea of great happiness i lived in an intoxication half fearing it was all a dream enchanted when anything occurred to assure me it was true but the details of our life i have forgotten i remember i was happy is it not a curious irony that we should recall our miseries with such plainness and that our happiness should pass over us so indistinctly that when it has gone we can scarcely realise that it ever existed it is as though fortune were jealous of the little happiness she has given us and to revenge herself blots it out of the memory filling the mind with miseries past  but some things i recollect about others i came across ercole piacentini and his wife claudia castello being his native place he had gone there on the death of the count and now although the riarii were restored to power he remained presumably to watch our movements and report them at forli i inquired whom he was and after some difficulty discovered that he was the bastard of a castello nobleman and the daughter of a tradesman i saw that he did not lie when he said he had in his veins as good blood as i still i did not think him a very desirable acquisition to the town and as i was in some favour with the new lord i determined to procure his expulsion matteo proposed picking a quarrel with him and killing him but that was difficult because the bold man had become singularly retiring and it was almost impossible to meet him the change was so noticeable that we could not help thinking he had received special instructions from forli and we determined to take care  i invited the moratini to live with me but they preferred to take a house of their own the old man when i asked him for his daughters hand told me he wished no better soninlaw and was very contented to see his daughter again settled under a mans protection scipione and alessandro were both most pleased and they redoubled the affection they had felt for me before it all made me extremely happy for after my long years of wandering i yearned very much for the love of others and the various affections that surrounded me soothed and comforted me from giulia i could ask for nothing more and i thought she really loved meof course not as i loved her for that would have been impossible but i was happy sometimes i wondered perplexedly at the incident which had separated us for i could understand nothing of it but i put it away from me i did not want to understand i wanted only to forget  then there were checco and matteo the orsi family had bought a palace in castello and there they could have settled themselves happily enough had they not been driven on by an unextinguishable desire to regain what they had lost checco was rich even now able to live as luxuriously as before and in a little while he might have gained in castello as much power as he had lost in forli for the young vitelli had been singularly attracted by him and was already inclined to give trust to his counsels but the wretched man was filled with sadness all day his thoughts were in the town he loved so well and now his love was increased tenfold sometimes he would think of forli before the troubles when he was living a peaceful life surrounded by his friends and in mind he wandered through the quiet streets every house of which he knew he would go from room to room in his palace looking at the pictures the statues the armour from the window at night he gazed upon the dark silent town with the houses rising like tall phantoms in the morning a silver mist covered the earth and as it rose left the air cool and fresh but when his house appeared before him a bare heap of ruins with the rain beating down on the roofless stones he would bury his face in his hands and so remain during long hours of misery sometimes he would review the stirring events which began with the attempted assassination of himself and ended with the ride out of the gate by the river in the cold open country beyond and as they passed before him he would wonder what he had done wrong what he might have done differently but he could alter nothing he saw no mistake other than of trusting the populace who vowed to follow him to death and of trusting the friends who promised to send him help he had done his part and what had followed was impossible to foresee fortune was against him and that was all  but he did not entirely give himself over to vain regrets he had opened up communication with forli and through his spies had learnt that the countess had imprisoned and put to death all those who had been in any way connected with the rebellion and that the town lay cowed submissive as a whipped dog and there was no hope for checco from within for his open partisans had suffered terrible punishments and the others were few and timid then checco turned his attention to the rival states but everywhere he received rebuffs for the power of milan overshadowed them all and they dared nothing while the duke lodovico was almighty wait they said till he has roused the jealousy of the greater states of florence and venice then will be your opportunity and then will we willingly give you our help but checco could not wait every lost day seemed to him a year he grew thin and haggard matteo tried to comfort him but gradually checcos troubles weighed on him too he lost his mirth and became as moody and silent as his cousin so passed a year full of anxiety and heartburning for them full of the sweetest happiness for me  one day checco came to me and said  filippo you have been very good to me now i want you to do me one more favour and that shall be the last i will ask you  what is it  then he expounded to me a scheme for interesting the pope in his affairs he knew how angry his holiness had been not only at the loss of the town but also at the humiliation he had received through his lieutenant there was a difficulty at the time between the duke of milan and rome respecting certain rights of the former and he did not think it unlikely that the pope would be willing to break off negotiations and recover his advantage by making a sudden attack on forli caterinas tyranny had become insupportable and there was no doubt that at the sight of checco leading the papal army they would open their gates and welcome him as the popes representative  i did not see of what use i could be and i was very unwilling to leave my young wife but checco was so anxious that i should come seeming to think i should be of such assistance that i felt it would be cruel to refuse moreover i reckoned a month would bring me back to castello and if the parting was bitter how sweet would be the return and i had certain business of my own in rome which i had delayed for months because i could not bear the thought of separation from giulia so i decided to go  a few days later we were riding towards rome i was sad for it was the first time i had left my wife since our marriage and the parting had been even more painful than i expected a thousand times i had been on the verge of changing my mind and saying i would not go but i could not for checcos sake i was also a little sad because i thought giulia was not so pained as i was but then i chid myself for my folly i expected too much after all it was only four short weeks and she was still too great a child to feel very deeply it is only when one is old or has greatly suffered that ones emotions are really powerful  we reached rome and set about soliciting an audience from the pope i cannot remember the countless interviews we had with minor officials how we were driven from cardinal to cardinal the hours we spent in anterooms waiting for a few words from some great man i used to get so tired that i could have dropped off to sleep standing but checco was so full of eagerness that i had to accompany him from place to place the month passed and we had done nothing i suggested going home but checco implored me to stay assuring me that the business would be finished in a fortnight i remained and the negotiations dragged their weary length through weeks and weeks now a ray of hope lightened our struggles and checco would become excited and cheerful now the hope would be dashed to the ground and checco begin to despair the month had drawn itself out into three and i saw clearly enough that nothing would come of our endeavours the conferences with the duke were still going on each party watching the other trying by means of untruth and deceit and bribery to gain the advantage the king of naples was brought in florence and venice began to send ambassadors to and fro and no one knew what would be the result of it all  at last one day checco came to me and threw himself on my bed  its no good he said in a tone of despair it is all up  im very sorry checco  you had better go home now you can do nothing here why should i drag you after me in my unhappiness  but you checco if you can do no good why will not you come too  i am better here than at castello here i am at the centre of things and i will take heart war may break out any day and then the pope will be more ready to listen to me  i saw it was no use that i should stay and i saw i could not persuade him to come with me so i packed up my things and bidding him goodbye started on the homeward journey     xxxix   what shall i say of the eagerness with which i looked forward to seeing my dear wife the rapture with which at last i clasped her in my arms                                       a little later i walked out to find matteo he was quite astonished to see me  we did not expect you so soon  no i answered i thought i should not arrive till after tomorrow but i was so impatient to get home that i hurried on without stopping and here i am  i shook his hand heartily i was so pleased and happy  erhave you been home  of course i answered smiling it was the first thing i thought of  i was not sure i thought a look of relief came over matteos face but why i could not understand but i thought it of no consequence and it passed from my memory i told matteo the news i had and left him i wished to get back to my wife  on my way i happened to see claudia piacentini coming out of a house i was very surprised for i knew that my efforts had succeeded and ercoles banishment decreed i supposed the order had not yet been issued i was going to pass the lady without acknowledgment for since my marriage she had never spoken to me and i could well understand why she did not want to to my astonishment she stopped me  ah messer filippo  i bowed profoundly  how is it that now you never speak to me are you so angry with me  no one can be angry with so beautiful a woman  she flushed and i felt i had said a stupid thing for i had made remarks too similar on another occasion i added but i have been away  i know will you not come in she pointed to the house from which she had just issued  but i shall be disturbing you for you were going out  she smiled as she replied i saw you pass my house a little while ago i guessed you were going to matteo dorsi and i waited for you on your return  you are most kind  i wondered why she was so anxious to see me perhaps she knew of her husbands approaching banishment and the cause of it  we went in and sat down  have you been home she asked  it was the same question as matteo had asked i gave the same answer  it was the first thing i thought of  your wife must have beensurprised to see you  and delighted  ah she crossed her hands and smiled  i wondered what she meant  you were not expected for two days i think  you know my movements very well i am pleased to find you take such interest in me  oh it is not i alone the whole town takes interest in you you have been a most pleasant topic of conversation  really i was getting a little angry and what has the town to say of me  oh i do not want to trouble your peace of mind  will you have the goodness to tell me what you mean  she shrugged her shoulders and smiled enigmatically  well i said  if you insist i will tell you they say that you are a complaisant husband  that is a lie  you are not polite she answered calmly  how dare you say such things you impudent woman  my good sir it is true perfectly true ask matteo  suddenly i remembered matteos question and his look of relief a sudden fear ran through me i took hold of claudias wrists and said  what do you mean what do you mean  leave go you hurt me  answer i tell you i know you are dying to tell me is this why you lay in wait for me and brought me here tell me  a sudden transformation took place in claudia rage and hate broke out and contorted her face so that one would not have recognised it  do you suppose you can escape the ordinary fate of husbands she broke into a savage laugh  it is a lie you slander giulia because you are yourself impure  you were willing enough to take advantage of that impurity do you suppose giulias character has altered because you have married her she made her first husband a cuckold and do you suppose that she has suddenly turned virtuous you fool  it is a lie i will not believe a word of it  the whole town has been ringing with her love for giorgio dall aste  i gave a cry it was for him that she abandoned me before  ah you believe me now  listen i said if this is not true i swear by all the saints that i will kill you  good if it is not true kill me but by all the saints i swear it is true true true she repeated the words in triumph and each one fell like the stab of a dagger in my heart  i left her as i walked home i fancied the people were looking at me and smiling once i was on the verge of going up to a man and asking him why he laughed but i contained myself how i was suffering i remembered that giulia had not seemed so pleased to see me at the time i chid myself and called myself exacting but was it true i fancied she turned away her lips when i was imprinting my passionate kisses on them i told myself i was a fool but was it true i remembered a slight movement of withdrawal when i clasped her in my arms was it true oh god was it true  i thought of going to matteo but i could not he knew her before her marriage he would be willing to accept the worst that was said of her how could i be so disturbed at the slanders of a wicked jealous woman i wished i had never known claudia never given her reason to take this revenge on me oh it was cruel but i would not believe it i had such trust in giulia such love she could not betray me when she knew what passionate love was poured down upon her it would be too ungrateful and i had done so much for her but i did not wish to think of that all that i had done had been for pure love and pleasure and i required no thanks but surely if she had no love she had at least some tender feeling for me she would not give her honour to another ah no i would not believe it but was it true oh god was it true  i found myself at home and suddenly i remembered the old steward whom i had left in charge of my house his name was fabio it was from him that i got the name when i presented myself as a servingman to old orso if anything had taken place in the house he must know it and she claudia said the whole town knew it  fabio  my master  he came into my room and i looked at him steadily  fabio have you well looked after all i left in your hands when i went to rome  your rents are paid your harvests taken in the olives all gathered  i left in your charge something more precious than cornfields and vineyards  my lord  i made you guardian of my honour what of that  he hesitated and his voice as he answered trembled  your honour isintact  i took him by the shoulders  fabio what is it i beseech you by your master my father to tell me  i knew he loved my fathers memory with more than human love he looked up to heaven and clasped his hands he could hardly speak  by my dear master your father nothingnothing  fabio you are lying i pressed his wrists which i was holding clenched in my hands  he sank down on his knees  oh master have mercy on me he buried his face in his hands i cannot tell you  speak man speak  at last with laments and groans he uttered the words  she hasoh god she has betrayed you  oh i staggered back  forgive me  why did you not tell me before  ah how could i you loved her as i have never seen man love woman  did you not think of my honour  i thought of your happiness it is better to have happiness without honour than honour without happiness  for you i groaned but not for me  you are of the same flesh and blood and you suffer as we do i could not destroy your happiness  oh giulia giulia then after a while i asked again but are you sure  alas there is no doubt  i cannot believe it oh god help me you dont know how i loved her she could not let me see it with my own eyes fabio  we both stood silent then a horrible thought struck me  do you knowwhen they meet i whispered  he groaned i asked again  god help me  you know i command you to tell me  they did not know you were coming back till after tomorrow  he is coming  today  oh i seized him by the hand take me and let me see them  what will you do he asked horrorstricken  never mind take me  trembling he led me through anterooms and passages till he brought me to a staircase we mounted the steps and came to a little door he opened it very quietly and we found ourselves behind the arras of giulias chamber i had forgotten the existence of door and steps and she knew nothing of them there was an opening in the tapestry to give exit  no one was in the room we waited holding our breath at last giulia entered she walked to the window and looked out and went back to the door she sat down but sprang up restlessly and again looked out of window whom was she expecting  she walked up and down the room and her face was full of anxiety i watched intently at last a light knock was heard she opened the door and a man came in a small slight thin man with a quantity of corncoloured hair falling over his shoulders and a pale fair skin he had blue eyes and a little golden moustache he looked hardly twenty but i knew he was older  he sprang forward seizing her in his arms and he pressed her to his heart but she pushed him back  oh giorgio you must go she cried he has come back  your husband  i hoped you would not come go quickly if he found you he would kill us both  tell me you love me giulia  oh yes i love you with all my heart and soul  for a moment they stood still in one anothers arms then she tore herself away  but go for gods sake  i go my love goodbye  goodbye beloved  he took her in his arms again and she placed hers around his neck they kissed one another passionately on the lips she kissed him as she had never kissed me  oh i gave a cry of rage and leaped out of my concealment in a bound i had reached him they hardly knew i was there and i had plunged my dagger in his neck giulia gave a piercing shriek as he fell with a groan the blood spattered over my hand then i looked at her she ran from me with terrorstricken face her eyes starting from her head i rushed to her and she shrieked again but fabio caught hold of my arm  not her not her too  i wrenched my hand away from him and thenthen as i saw her pallid face and the look of deathly terrori stopped i could not kill her  lock that door i said to fabio pointing to the one from which we had come then looking at her i screamed  harlot  i called to fabio and we left the room i locked the door and she remained shut in with her lover  i called my servants and bade them follow me and went out i walked proudly surrounded by my retainers and i came to the house of bartolomeo moratini he had just finished dinner and was sitting with his sons they rose as they saw me  ah filippo you have returned then seeing my pale face they cried but what is it what has happened  and bartolomeo broke in  what is that on your hand filippo  i stretched it out so that he might see  thatthat is the blood of your daughters lover  oh  i found them together and i killed the adulterer  bartolomeo kept silence a moment then he said  you have done well filippo he turned to his sons scipione give me my sword  he girded it on and then he spoke to me  sir he said i beg you to wait here till i come  i bowed  sir i am your servant  scipione alessandro follow me  and accompanied by his sons he left the room and i remained alone  the servants peeped in at the door looking at me as if i were some strange beast and fled when i turned round i walked up and down up and down i looked out of window in the street the people were going to and fro singing and talking as if nothing had happened they did not know that death was flying through the air they did not know that the happiness of living men had gone for ever  at last i heard the steps again and bartolomeo moratini entered the room followed by his sons and all three were very grave  sir he said the stain on your honour and mine has been effaced  i bowed more deeply than before  sir i am your very humble servant  i thank you that you allowed me to do my duty as a father and i regret that a member of my family should have shown herself unworthy of my name and yours i will detain you no longer  i bowed again and left them     xl   i walked back to my house it was very silent and as i passed up the stairs the servants shrunk back with averted faces as if they were afraid to look at me  where is fabio i asked  a page whispered timidly  in the chapel  i turned on my heel and passed through the rooms one after another till i came to the chapel door i pushed it open and entered a dim light came through the painted windows and i could hardly see in the centre were two bodies covered with a cloth and their heads were lighted by the yellow gleam of candles at their feet knelt an old man praying it was fabio  i advanced and drew back the cloth and i fell on my knees giulia looked as if she were sleeping i had so often leant over her watching the regular heaving of the breast and sometimes i had thought her features as calm and relaxed as if she were dead but now the breast would no more rise and fall and its wonderful soft whiteness was disfigured by a gaping wound her eyes were closed and her lips half parted and the only difference from life was the fallen jaw her face was very pale the rich waving hair encircled it as with an aureole  i looked at him and he too was pale and his fair hair contrasted wonderfully with hers he looked so young  then as i knelt there and the hours passed slowly i thought of all that had happened and i tried to understand the dim light from the window gradually failed and the candles in the darkness burnt out more brightly each was surrounded by a halo of light and lit up the dead faces throwing into deeper night the rest of the chapel  little by little i seemed to see into the love of these two which had been so strong that no ties of honour faith or truth had been able to influence it and this is what i imagined trying to console myself                                       when she was sixteen i thought they married her to an old man she had never seen and she met her husbands cousin a boy no older than herself and the love started and worked its way but the boy lived on his rich cousins charity from him he had received a home and protection and a thousand kindnesses he loved against his will but he loved all the same and she i thought had loved like a woman passionately thoughtless of honour and truth in the sensual violence of her love she had carried him away and he had yielded then with enjoyment had come remorse and he had torn himself away from the temptress and fled  i hardly knew what had happened when she was left alone pining for her lover scandal said evil things had she too felt remorse and tried to kill her love and had the attempt failed and was it then she flung herself into dissipation to drown her trouble perhaps he told her he did not love her and she in despair may have thrown herself in the arms of other lovers but he loved her too strongly to forget her at last he could not bear the absence and came back and again with enjoyment came remorse and ashamed he fled hating himself despising her  the years passed by and her husband died why did he not come back to her had he lost his love and was he afraid i could not understand  then she met me ah i wondered what she felt did she love me perhaps his long absence had made her partly forget him and she thought he had forgotten her she fell in love with me and ii loved her with all my heart i knew she loved me then she must have loved me but he came back he may have thought himself cured he may have said that he could meet her coldly and indifferently had i not said the same but as they saw one another the old love burst out again it burnt them with consuming fire and giulia hated me because i had made her faithless to the lover of her heart                                       the candles were burning low throwing strange lights and shadows on the faces of the dead                                       poor fool his love was as powerful as ever but he fought against it with all the strength of his weak will she was the evil one to him she took his youth from him his manhood his honour his strength he felt that her kisses degraded him and as he rose from her embrace he felt vile and mean he vowed never to touch her again and every time he broke the vow but her love was the same as everpassionate even heartless she cared not if she consumed him as long as she loved him for her he might ruin his life he might lose his soul she cared for nothing it was all and all for love  he fled again and she turned her eyes on me once more perhaps she felt sorry for my pain perhaps she fancied my love would efface the remembrance of him and we were married ah now that she was dead i could allow her good intentions she may have intended to be faithful to me she may have thought she could truly love and honour me perhaps she tried who knows but lovelove cares not for vows it was too strong for her too strong for him i do not know whether she sent for him or whether he in the extremity of his passion came to her but what had happened so often happened again they threw everything to the winds and gave themselves over to the love that kills  the long hours passed as i thought of these things and the candles were burnt to their sockets  at last i felt a touch on my shoulder and heard fabios voice  master it is nearly morning  i stood up and he added  they put him in the chapel without asking me you are not angry  they did well  he hesitated a moment and then asked  what shall i do  i looked at him not understanding  he cannot remain here and sheshe must be buried  take them to the church and lay them in the tomb my father builttogether  the man too he asked in your own tomb  i sighed and answered sadly  perhaps he loved her better than i  as i spoke i heard a sob at my feet a man i had not seen took hold of my hand and kissed it and i felt it wet with tears  who are you i asked  he has been here all the night said fabio  he was my master and i loved him replied the kneeling figure in a broken voice i thank you that you do not cast him out like a dog  i looked at him and felt deep pity for his grief  what will you do now i asked  alas now i am a wreck that tosses on the billows without a guide  i did not know what to say to him  will you take me as your servant i will be very faithful  do you ask me that i said do you not know  ah yes you took the life that he was glad to lose it was almost a kindness and now you bury him peacefully and for that i love you you owe it to me you have robbed me of a master give me another  no poor friend i want no servants now i too am like a wreck that drifts aimlessly across the seas with me too it is finished  i looked once more at giulia and then i replaced the white cloth and the faces were covered  bring me my horse fabio  in a few minutes it was waiting for me  will you have no one to accompany you he asked  no one  then as i mounted and arranged the reins in my hand he said  where are you going  and i despairingly answered  god knows     xli   and i rode away out of the town into the open country the day was breaking and everything was cold and grey i paid no heed to my course i rode along taking the roads as they came through broad plains eastwards towards the mountains in the increasing day i saw the little river wind sinuously through the fields and the country stretched flat before me with slender trees marked out against the sky now and then a tiny hill was surmounted by a village and once as i passed i heard the tinkling of a bell i stopped at an inn to water the horse and then hating the sight of men i hurried on the hours of coolness had passed and as we tramped along the shapeless roads the horse began to sweat and the thick white dust rose in clouds behind us  at last i came to a roadside inn and it was nearly midday i dismounted and giving the horse to the ostlers care i went inside and sat at a table the landlord came to me and offered food i could not eat i felt it would make me sick i ordered wine it was brought i poured some out and tasted it then i put my elbows on the table and held my head with both hands for it was aching so as almost to drive me mad  sir  i looked up and saw a franciscan friar standing by my side on his back he bore a sack i supposed he was collecting food  sir i pray you for alms for the sick and needy  i drew out a piece of gold and threw it to him  the roads are hard today he said  i made no answer  you are going far sir  when one gives alms to a beggar it is so that he may not importune one i said  ah no it is for the love of god and charity but i do not wish to importune you i thought i might help you  i want no help  you look unhappy  i beg you to leave me in peace  as you will my son  he left me and i returned to my old position i felt as if a sheet of lead were pressing upon my head a moment later a gruff voice broke in upon me  ah messer filippo brandolini  i looked up at the first glance i did not recognise the speaker but then as i cleared my mind i saw it was ercole piacentini what was he doing here then i remembered that it was on the road to forli i supposed he had received orders to leave castello and was on his way to his old haunts however i did not want to speak to him i bent down and again clasped my head in my hands  that is a civil way of answering he said messer filippo  i looked up rather bored  if i do not answer it is evidently because i do not wish to speak to you  and if i wish to speak to you  then i must take the liberty of begging you to hold your tongue  you insolent fellow  i felt too miserable to be angry  have the goodness to leave me i said you bore me intensely  i tell you that you are an insolent fellow and i shall do as i please  are you a beggar that you are so importunate what do you want  do you remember saying in forli that you would fight me when the opportunity presented itself it has and i am ready for i have to thank you for my banishment from castello  when i offered to fight you sir i thought you were a gentleman now that i know your condition i must decline  you coward  surely it is not cowardice to refuse a duel with a person like yourself  by this time he was wild with rage but i was cool and collected  have you so much to boast he asked furiously  happily i am not a bastard  cuckold  oh  i sprang up and looked at him with a look of horror he laughed scornfully and repeated  cuckold  now it was my turn the blood rushed to my head and a terrible rage seized me i picked up the tankard of wine which was on the table and flung it at him with all my might the wine splashed over his face and the cup hit him on the forehead and cut him so that the blood trickled down in a moment he had drawn his sword and at the same time i wrenched mine from its sheath  he could fight well  he could fight well but against me he was lost all the rage and agony of the last day gathered themselves together i was lifted up and cried aloud in the joy of having someone on whom to wreak my vengeance i felt as if i had against me the whole world and were pouring out my hate at the end of my sword my fury lent me the strength of a devil i drove him back i drove him back and i fought as i had never fought before in a minute i had beaten the sword from his hand and it fell to the floor as if his wrist were broken clattering down among the cups he staggered back against the wall and stood there with his head thrown back and his arms helplessly outspread  ah god i thank thee i cried exultingly now i am happy  i lifted my sword above my head to cleave his skull my arm was in the swingwhen i stopped i saw the staring eyes the white face blanched with terror he was standing against the wall as he had fallen shrinking away in his mortal anxiety i stopped i could not kill him  i sheathed my sword and said  go i will not kill you i despise you too much  he did not move but stood as if he were turned to stone still terrorstricken and afraid then in my contempt i took a horn of water and flung it over him  you look pale my friend i said here is water to mix with your wine  then i leant back and burst into a shout of laughter and i laughed till my sides ached and i laughed again  i threw down money to pay for my entertainment and went out but as i bestrode my horse and we recommenced our journey along the silent roads i felt my head ache worse than ever all enjoyment was gone i could take no pleasure in life how long would it last how long i rode along under the midday sun and it fell scorching on my head the wretched beast trotted with hanging head his tongue lolling out of his mouth parched and dry the sun beat down with all the power of august and everything seemed livid with the awful heat man and beast had shrunk away from the fiery rays the country folk were taking the noonday rest the cattle and the horses sheltered by barns and sheds the birds were silent and even the lizards had crept into their holes only the horse and i tramped along miserablyonly the horse and i there was no shade the walls on either side were too low to give shelter the road glaring and white and dusty i might have been riding through a furnace  everything was against me everything even the sun seemed to beat down his hottest rays to increase my misery what had i done that all this should come to me i clenched my fist and in impotent rage cursed god  at last i saw close to me a little hill covered with dark fir trees i came nearer and the sight of the sombre green was like a draught of cool water i could no longer bear the horror of the heat from the main road another smaller one led winding up the hill i turned my horse and soon we were among the trees and i took a long breath of delight in the coolness i dismounted and led him by the bridle it was enchanting to walk along the path soft with the fallen needles and a delicious green smell hovered in the air we came to a clearing where was a little pond i watered the poor beast and throwing myself down drank deeply then i tied him to a tree and advanced a few steps alone i came to a sort of terrace and going forward found myself at the edge of the hill looking over the plain behind the tall fir trees gave me shade and coolness i sat down looking at the country before me in the cloudless sky it seemed now singularly beautiful far away on one side i could see the walls and towers of some city and to it in broad curves wound a river the maze and corn vines and olive trees covered the land and in the distance i saw the soft blue mountains why should the world be so beautiful and i so miserable  it is indeed a wonderful scene  i looked up and saw the monk whom i had spoken with at the inn he put down his sack and sat by my side  you do not think me importunate he asked  i beg your pardon i replied i was not civil to you you must forgive me i was not myself  do not talk of it i saw you here and i came down to you to offer you our hospitality  i looked at him questioningly he pointed over his shoulder and looking i saw perched on the top of the hill piercing through the trees a little monastery  how peaceful it looks i said  it is indeed st francis himself used sometimes to come to enjoy the quiet  i sighed oh why could not i have done with the life i hated and also enjoy the quiet i felt the monk was watching me and looking up i met his glance he was a tall thin man with deeplysunken eyes and hollow cheeks and he was pale and worn from prayer and fasting but his voice was sweet and very gentle  why do you look at me i said  i was in the tavern when you disarmed the man and gave him his life  it was not for charity and mercy i said bitterly  i know he answered it was from despair  how do you know  i watched you and at the end i said god pity his unhappiness  i looked with astonishment at the strange man and then with a groan i said  oh you are right i am so unhappy  he took my hands in his and with the gentleness of the mother of god herself replied  come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden and i will give you rest  then i could suffer my woe no longer i buried my face in his bosom and burst into tears     epilogue   and now many years have passed and the noble gentleman filippo brandolini is the poor monk giuliano the gorgeous clothes velvets and satins have given way to the brown sackcloth of the seraphic father and instead of golden belts my waist is girt with a hempen cord and in me what changes have taken place the brown hair which women kissed is a little circlet in sign of the redeemers crown and it is as white as snow my eyes are dim and sunken my cheeks are hollow and the skin of my youth is ashy and wrinkled the white teeth of my mouth have gone but my toothless gums suffice for the monkish fare and i am old and bent and weak                                       one day in the spring i came to the terrace which overlooks the plain and as i sat down to warm myself in the sunshine gazing at the broad country which now i knew so well and the distant hills the wish came to me to write the history of my life  and now that too is done i have nothing more to tell except that from the day when i arrived weary of soul to the cool shade of the fir trees i have never gone into the world again i gave my lands and palaces to my brother in the hope that he would make better use of his life than i and to him i gave the charge of seeing that heirs were given to the ancient name i knew i had failed in everything my life had gone wrong i know not why and i had not the courage to adventure further i withdrew from the battle in my unfitness and let the world pass on and forget my poor existence                                       checco lived on scheming and intriguing wearing away his life in attempts to regain his fatherland and always he was disappointed always his hopes frustrated till at last he despaired and after six years worn out with his fruitless efforts mourning the greatness he had lost and pining for the country he loved so well he died of a broken heart an exile  matteo went back to his arms and the reckless life of the soldier of fortune and was killed bravely fighting against the foreign invader and died knowing that his efforts too had been in vain and that the sweet land of italy lay fallen and enslaved  and i do not know whether they had not the better lot for they are at peace while ii pursue my lonely pilgrimage through life and the goal is ever far off now it cannot be much longer my strength is failing and soon i shall have the peace i wished for oh god i do not ask you for crowns of gold and heavenly raiment i do not aspire to the bliss which is the portion of the saint but give me rest when the great release comes give me rest let me sleep the long sleep without awakening so that at last i may forget and be at peace o god give me rest  often as i trudged along the roads barefooted to gather food and alms have i wished to lay myself in the ditch by the wayside and die sometimes i have heard the beating of the wings of the angel of death but he has taken the strong and the happy and left me to wander on  the good man told me i should receive happiness i have not even received forgetfulness i go along the roads thinking of my life and the love that ruined me ah how weak i am but forgive me i cannot help myself sometimes when i have been able to do good i have felt a strange delight i have felt the blessed joy of charity and i love my people the poor folk of the country round they come to me in their troubles and when i can help them i share their pleasure but that is all i have ah mine has been a useless life i have wasted it and if of late i have done a little good to my fellowmen alas how little  i bear my soul in patience but sometimes i cannot help rising up against fate and crying out that it is hard that all this should happen to me why what had i done that i should be denied the little happiness of this world why should i be more unhappy than others but then i chide myself and ask whether i have indeed been less happy are they any of them happy or are those right who say that the world is misery and that the only happiness is to die who knows  ah giulia how i loved thee      o ciechi il tanto affaticar che giova     tutti
