32669051	the silverado squatters     the scene of this little book is on a high mountain  there are indeed many higher there are many of a nobler outline  it is no place of pilgrimage for the summary globetrotter but to one who lives upon its sides mount saint helena soon becomes a centre of interest  it is the mont blanc of one section of the californian coast range none of its near neighbours rising to onehalf its altitude  it looks down on much green intricate country  it feeds in the springtime many splashing brooks  from its summit you must have an excellent lesson of geography  seeing to the south san francisco bay with tamalpais on the one hand and monte diablo on the other to the west and thirty miles away the open ocean eastward across the cornlands and thick tule swamps of sacramento valley to where the central pacific railroad begins to climb the sides of the sierras and northward for what i know the white head of shasta looking down on oregon  three counties napa county lake county and sonoma county march across its cliffy shoulders  its naked peak stands nearly four thousand five hundred feet above the sea its sides are fringed with forest and the soil where it is bare glows warm with cinnabar  life in its shadow goes rustically forward  bucks and bears and rattlesnakes and former mining operations are the staple of mens talk  agriculture has only begun to mount above the valley and though in a few years from now the whole district may be smiling with farms passing trains shaking the mountain to the heart manywindowed hotels lighting up the night like factories and a prosperous city occupying the site of sleepy calistoga yet in the mean time around the foot of that mountain the silence of nature reigns in a great measure unbroken and the people of hill and valley go sauntering about their business as in the days before the flood  to reach mount saint helena from san francisco the traveller has twice to cross the bay  once by the busy oakland ferry and again after an hour or so of the railway from vallejo junction to vallejo  thence he takes rail once more to mount the long green strath of napa valley  in all the contractions and expansions of that inland sea the bay of san francisco there can be few drearier scenes than the vallejo ferry  bald shores and a low bald islet inclose the sea through the narrows the tide bubbles muddy like a river  when we made the passage bound although yet we knew it not for silverado the steamer jumped and the black buoys were dancing in the jabble the ocean breeze blew killing chill and although the upper sky was still unflecked with vapour the sea fogs were pouring in from seaward over the hilltops of marin county in one great shapeless silver cloud  south vallejo is typical of many californian towns  it was a blunder the site has proved untenable and although it is still such a young place by the scale of europe it has already begun to be deserted for its neighbour and namesake north vallejo  a long pier a number of drinking saloons a hotel of a great size marshy pools where the frogs keep up their croaking and even at high noon the entire absence of any human face or voicethese are the marks of south vallejo  yet there was a tall building beside the pier labelled the star flour mills and seagoing fullrigged ships lay close along shore waiting for their cargo  soon these would be plunging round the horn soon the flour from the star flour mills would be landed on the wharves of liverpool  for that too is one of englands outposts thither to this gaunt mill across the atlantic and pacific deeps and round about the icy horn this crowd of great threemasted deepsea ships come bringing nothing and return with bread  the frisby house for that was the name of the hotel was a place of fallen fortunes like the town  it was now given up to labourers and partly ruinous  at dinner there was the ordinary display of what is called in the west a twobit house  the tablecloth checked red and white the plague of flies the wire hencoops over the dishes the great variety and invariable vileness of the food and the rough coatless men devoting it in silence  in our bedroom the stove would not burn though it would smoke and while one window would not open the other would not shut  there was a view on a bit of empty road a few dark houses a donkey wandering with its shadow on a slope and a blink of sea with a tall ship lying anchored in the moonlight  all about that dreary inn frogs sang their ungainly chorus  early the next morning we mounted the hill along a wooden footway bridging one marish spot after another  here and there as we ascended we passed a house embowered in white roses  more of the bay became apparent and soon the blue peak of tamalpais rose above the green level of the island opposite  it told us we were still but a little way from the city of the golden gates already at that hour beginning to awake among the sandhills  it called to us over the waters as with the voice of a bird  its stately head blue as a sapphire on the paler azure of the sky spoke to us of wider outlooks and the bright pacific  for tamalpais stands sentry like a lighthouse over the golden gates between the bay and the open ocean and looks down indifferently on both  even as we saw and hailed it from vallejo seamen far out at sea were scanning it with shaded eyes and as if to answer to the thought one of the great ships below began silently to clothe herself with white sails homeward bound for england  for some way beyond vallejo the railway led us through bald green pastures  on the west the rough highlands of marin shut off the ocean in the midst in long straggling gleaming arms the bay died out among the grass there were few trees and few enclosures the sun shone wide over open uplands the displumed hills stood clear against the sky  but byandby these hills began to draw nearer on either hand and first thicket and then wood began to clothe their sides and soon we were away from all signs of the seas neighbourhood mounting an inland irrigated valley  a great variety of oaks stood now severally now in a becoming grove among the fields and vineyards  the towns were compact in about equal proportions of bright new wooden houses and great and growing forest trees and the chapel bell on the engine sounded most festally that sunny sunday as we drew up at one green town after another with the townsfolk trooping in their sundays best to see the strangers with the sun sparkling on the clean houses and great domes of foliage humming overhead in the breeze  this pleasant napa valley is at its north end blockaded by our mountain  there at calistoga the railroad ceases and the traveller who intends faring farther to the geysers or to the springs in lake county must cross the spurs of the mountain by stage  thus mount saint helena is not only a summit but a frontier and up to the time of writing it has stayed the progress of the iron horse     part iin the valley     chapter icalistoga    it is difficult for a european to imagine calistoga the whole place is so new and of such an accidental pattern the very name i hear was invented at a supperparty by the man who found the springs  the railroad and the highway come up the valley about parallel to one another  the street of calistoga joins the perpendicular to botha wide street with bright clean low houses here and there a verandah over the sidewalk here and there a horsepost here and there lounging townsfolk  other streets are marked out and most likely named for these towns in the new world begin with a firm resolve to grow larger washington and broadway and then first and second and so forth being boldly plotted out as soon as the community indulges in a plan  but in the meanwhile all the life and most of the houses of calistoga are concentrated upon that street between the railway station and the road  i never heard it called by any name but i will hazard a guess that it is either washington or broadway  here are the blacksmiths the chemists the general merchants and kong sam kee the chinese laundrymans here probably is the office of the local paper for the place has a paperthey all have papers and here certainly is one of the hotels cheeseboroughs whence the daring foss a man dear to legend starts his horses for the geysers  it must be remembered that we are here in a land of stagedrivers and highwaymen  a land in that sense like england a hundred years ago  the highway robberroadagent he is quaintly called is still busy in these parts  the fame of vasquez is still young only a few years go the lakeport stage was robbed a mile or two from calistoga  in 1879 the dentist of mendocino city fifty miles away upon the coast suddenly threw off the garments of his trade like grindoff in the miller and his men and flamed forth in his second dress as a captain of banditti  a great robbery was followed by a long chase a chase of days if not of weeks among the intricate hillcountry and the chase was followed by much desultory fighting in which severaland the dentist i believe amongst the numberbit the dust  the grass was springing for the first time nourished upon their blood when i arrived in calistoga  i am reminded of another highwayman of that same year he had been unwell so ran his humorous defence and the doctor told him to take something so he took the expressbox  the cultus of the stagecoachman always flourishes highest where there are thieves on the road and where the guard travels armed and the stage is not only a link between country and city and the vehicle of news but has a faint warfaring aroma like a man who should be brother to a soldier  california boasts her famous stagedrivers and among the famous foss is not forgotten  along the unfenced abominable mountain roads he launches his team with small regard to human life or the doctrine of probabilities flinching travellers who behold themselves coasting eternity at every corner look with natural admiration at their drivers huge impassive fleshy countenance  he has the very face for the driver in sam wellers anecdote who upset the election party at the required point  wonderful tales are current of his readiness and skill  one in particular of how one of his horses fell at a ticklish passage of the road and how foss let slip the reins and driving over the fallen animal arrived at the next stage with only three  this i relate as i heard it without guarantee  i only saw foss once though strange as it may sound i have twice talked with him  he lives out of calistoga at a ranche called fossville  one evening after he was long gone home i dropped into cheeseboroughs and was asked if i should like to speak with mr foss  supposing that the interview was impossible and that i was merely called upon to subscribe the general sentiment i boldly answered yes  next moment i had one instrument at my ear another at my mouth and found myself with nothing in the world to say conversing with a man several miles off among desolate hills foss rapidly and somewhat plaintively brought the conversation to an end and he returned to his nights grog at fossville while i strolled forth again on calistoga high street  but it was an odd thing that here on what we are accustomed to consider the very skirts of civilization i should have used the telephone for the first time in my civilized career  so it goes in these young countries telephones and telegraphs and newspapers and advertisements running far ahead among the indians and the grizzly bears  alone on the other side of the railway stands the springs hotel with its attendant cottages  the floor of the valley is extremely level to the very roots of the hills only here and there a hillock crowned with pines rises like the barrow of some chieftain famed in war and right against one of these hillocks is the springs hotelis or was for since i was there the place has been destroyed by fire and has risen again from its ashes  a lawn runs about the house and the lawn is in its turn surrounded by a system of little fiveroomed cottages each with a verandah and a weedy palm before the door  some of the cottages are let to residents and these are wreathed in flowers  the rest are occupied by ordinary visitors to the hotel and a very pleasant way this is by which you have a little country cottage of your own without domestic burthens and by the day or week  the whole neighbourhood of mount saint helena is full of sulphur and of boiling springs  the geysers are famous they were the great health resort of the indians before the coming of the whites lake county is dotted with spas hot springs and white sulphur springs are the names of two stations on the napa valley railroad and calistoga itself seems to repose on a mere film above a boiling subterranean lake  at one end of the hotel enclosure are the springs from which it takes its name hot enough to scald a child seriously while i was there  at the other end the tenant of a cottage sank a well and there also the water came up boiling it keeps this end of the valley as warm as a toast  i have gone across to the hotel a little after five in the morning when a sea fog from the pacific was hanging thick and gray and dark and dirty overhead and found the thermometer had been up before me and had already climbed among the nineties and in the stress of the day it was sometimes too hot to move about  but in spite of this heat from above and below doing one on both sides calistoga was a pleasant place to dwell in beautifully green for it was then that favoured moment in the californian year when the rains are over and the dusty summer has not yet set in often visited by fresh airs now from the mountain now across sonoma from the sea very quiet very idle very silent but for the breezes and the cattle bells afield  and there was something satisfactory in the sight of that great mountain that enclosed us to the north  whether it stood robed in sunshine quaking to its topmost pinnacle with the heat and brightness of the day or whether it set itself to weaving vapours wisp after wisp growing trembling fleeting and fading in the blue  the tangled woody and almost trackless foothills that enclose the valley shutting it off from sonoma on the west and from yolo on the eastrough as they were in outline dug out by winter streams crowned by cliffy bluffs and nodding pine treeswore dwarfed into satellites by the bulk and bearing of mount saint helena  she overtowered them by twothirds of her own stature she excelled them by the boldness of her profile  her great bald summit clear of trees and pasture a cairn of quartz and cinnabar rejected kinship with the dark and shaggy wilderness of lesser hilltops    chapter iithe petrified forest    we drove off from the springs hotel about three in the afternoon the sun warmed me to the heart  a broad cool wind streamed pauselessly down the valley laden with perfume  up at the top stood mount saint helena a bulk of mountain bare atop with tree fringed spurs and radiating warmth  once we saw it framed in a grove of tall and exquisitely graceful white oaks in line and colour a finished composition  we passed a cow stretched by the roadside her bell slowly beating time to the movement of her ruminating jaws her big red face crawled over by half a dozen flies a monument of content  a little farther and we struck to the left up a mountain road and for two hours threaded one valley after another green tangled full of noble timber giving us every now and again a sight of mount saint helena and the blue hilly distance and crossed by many streams through which we splashed to the carriagestep  to the right or the left there was scarce any trace of man but the road we followed i think we passed but one rancheros house in the whole distance and that was closed and smokeless  but we had the society of these bright streamsdazzlingly clear as is their wont splashing from the wheels in diamonds and striking a lively coolness through the sunshine  and what with the innumerable variety of greens the masses of foliage tossing in the breeze the glimpses of distance the descents into seemingly impenetrable thickets the continual dodging of the road which made haste to plunge again into the covert we had a fine sense of woods and springtime and the open air  our driver gave me a lecture by the way on californian treesa thing i was much in need of having fallen among painters who know the name of nothing and mexicans who know the name of nothing in english  he taught me the madrona the manzanita the buckeye the maple he showed me the crested mountain quail he showed me where some young redwoods were already spiring heavenwards from the ruins of the old for in this district all had already perished redwoods and redskins the two noblest indigenous living things alike condemned  at length in a lonely dell we came on a huge wooden gate with a sign upon it like an inn  the petrified forest  proprietor  c evans ran the legend  within on a knoll of sward was the house of the proprietor and another smaller house hard by to serve as a museum where photographs and petrifactions were retailed  it was a pure little isle of touristry among these solitary hills  the proprietor was a brave old whitefaced swede  he had wandered this way heaven knows how and taken up his acresi forget how many years agoall alone bent double with sciatica and with six bits in his pocket and an axe upon his shoulder  long useless years of seafaring had thus discharged him at the end penniless and sick  without doubt he had tried his luck at the diggings and got no good from that without doubt he had loved the bottle and lived the life of jack ashore  but at the end of these adventures here he came and the place hitting his fancy down he sat to make a new life of it far from crimps and the salt sea  and the very sight of his ranche had done him good  it was the handsomest spot in the californy mountains  isnt it handsome now he said every penny he makes goes into that ranche to make it handsomer then the climate with the seabreeze every afternoon in the hottest summer weather had gradually cured the sciatica and his sister and niece were now domesticated with him for companyor rather the niece came only once in the two days teaching music the meanwhile in the valley  and then for a last piece of luck the handsomest spot in the californy mountains had produced a petrified forest which mr evans now shows at the modest figure of half a dollar a head or twothirds of his capital when he first came there with an axe and a sciatica  this tardy favourite of fortunehobbling a little i think as if in memory of the sciatica but with not a trace that i can remember of the seathoroughly ruralized from head to foot proceeded to escort us up the hill behind his house  who first found the forest asked my wife  the first  i was that man said he  i was cleaning up the pasture for my beasts when i found thiskicking a great redwood seven feet in diameter that lay there on its side hollow heart clinging lumps of bark all changed into gray stone with veins of quartz between what had been the layers of the wood  were you surprised  surprised  no  what would i be surprised about  what did i know about petrifactionsfollowing the sea  petrifaction  there was no such word in my language  i knew about putrifaction though  i thought it was a stone so would you if you was cleaning up pasture  and now he had a theory of his own which i did not quite grasp except that the trees had not grewed there  but he mentioned with evident pride that he differed from all the scientific people who had visited the spot and he flung about such words as tufa and scilica with careless freedom  when i mentioned i was from scotland my old country he said my old countrywith a smiling look and a tone of real affection in his voice  i was mightily surprised for he was obviously scandinavian and begged him to explain  it seemed he had learned his english and done nearly all his sailing in scotch ships  out of glasgow said he or greenock but thats all the samethey all hail from glasgow and he was so pleased with me for being a scotsman and his adopted compatriot that he made me a present of a very beautiful piece of petrifactioni believe the most beautiful and portable he had  here was a man at least who was a swede a scot and an american acknowledging some kind allegiance to three lands  mr wallaces scotocircassian will not fail to come before the reader  i have myself met and spoken with a fifeshire german whose combination of abominable accents struck me dumb  but indeed i think we all belong to many countries  and perhaps this habit of much travel and the engendering of scattered friendships may prepare the euthanasia of ancient nations  and the forest itself  well on a tangled briery hillsidefor the pasture would bear a little further cleaning up to my eyes there lie scattered thickly various lengths of petrified trunk such as the one already mentioned  it is very curious of course and ancient enough if that were all  doubtless the heart of the geologist beats quicker at the sight but for my part i was mightily unmoved  sightseeing is the art of disappointment   theres nothing under heaven so blue thats fairly worth the travelling to   but fortunately heaven rewards us with many agreeable prospects and adventures by the way and sometimes when we go out to see a petrified forest prepares a far more delightful curiosity in the form of mr evans whom may all prosperity attend throughout a long and green old age    chapter iiinapa wine    i was interested in californian wine  indeed i am interested in all wines and have been all my life from the raisin wine that a schoolfellow kept secreted in his playbox up to my last discovery those notable valtellines that once shone upon the board of caesar  some of us kind old pagans watch with dread the shadows falling on the age  how the unconquerable worm invades the sunny terraces of france and bordeaux is no more and the rhone a mere arabia petraea  chateau neuf is dead and i have never tasted it hermitagea hermitage indeed from all lifes sorrowslies expiring by the river  and in the place of these imperial elixirs beautiful to every sense gemhued flowerscented dream compellers behold upon the quays at cette the chemicals arrayed behold the analyst at marseilles raising hands in obsecration attesting god lyoeus and the vats staved in and the dishonest wines poured forth among the sea  it is not pan only bacchus too is dead  if wine is to withdraw its most poetic countenance the sun of the white dinnercloth a deity to be invoked by two or three all fervent hushing their talk degusting tenderly and storing reminiscencesfor a bottle of good wine like a good act shines ever in the retrospectif wine is to desert us go thy ways old jack  now we begin to have compunctions and look back at the brave bottles squandered upon dinnerparties where the guests drank grossly discussing politics the while and even the schoolboy took his whack like liquorice water  and at the same time we look timidly forward with a spark of hope to where the new lands already weary of producing gold begin to green with vineyards  a nice point in human history falls to be decided by californian and australian wines  wine in california is still in the experimental stage and when you taste a vintage grave economical questions are involved  the beginning of vineplanting is like the beginning of mining for the precious metals  the winegrower also prospects one corner of land after another is tried with one kind of grape after another this is a failure that is better a third best  so bit by bit they grope about for their clos vougeot and lafite  those lodes and pockets of earth more precious than the precious ores that yield inimitable fragrance and soft fire those virtuous bonanzas where the soil has sublimated under sun and stars to something finer and the wine is bottled poetry  these still lie undiscovered chaparral conceals thicket embowers them the miner chips the rock and wanders farther and the grizzly muses undisturbed  but there they bide their hour awaiting their columbus and nature nurses and prepares them  the smack of californian earth shall linger on the palate of your grandson  meanwhile the wine is merely a good wine the best that i have tasted better than a beaujolais and not unlike  but the trade is poor it lives from hand to mouth putting its all into experiments and forced to sell its vintages  to find one properly matured and bearing its own name is to be fortunes favourite  bearing its own name i say and dwell upon the innuendo  you want to know why california wine is not drunk in the states a san francisco wine merchant said to me after he had shown me through his premises  well heres the reason  and opening a large cupboard fitted with many little drawers he proceeded to shower me all over with a great variety of gorgeously tinted labels blue red or yellow stamped with crown or coronet and hailing from such a profusion of clos and chateaux that a single department could scarce have furnished forth the names  but it was strange that all looked unfamiliar  chateau x said i  i never heard of that  i dare say not said he  i had been reading one of xs novels  they were all castles in spain  but that sure enough is the reason why california wine is not drunk in the states  napa valley has been long a seat of the winegrowing industry  it did not here begin as it does too often in the low valley lands along the river but took at once to the rough foothills where alone it can expect to prosper  a basking inclination and stones to be a reservoir of the days heat seem necessary to the soil for wine the grossness of the earth must be evaporated its marrow daily melted and refined for ages until at length these clods that break below our footing and to the eye appear but common earth are truly and to the perceiving mind a masterpiece of nature  the dust of richebourg which the wind carries away what an apotheosis of the dust  not man himself can seem a stranger child of that brown friable powder than the blood and sun in that old flask behind the faggots  a californian vineyard one of mans outposts in the wilderness has features of its own  there is nothing here to remind you of the rhine or rhone of the low cote dor or the infamous and scabby deserts of champagne but all is green solitary covert we visited two of them mr schrams and mr meckrons sharing the same glen  some way down the valley below calistoga we turned sharply to the south and plunged into the thick of the wood  a rude trail rapidly mounting a little stream tinkling by on the one hand big enough perhaps after the rains but already yielding up its life overhead and on all sides a bower of green and tangled thicket still fragrant and still flowerbespangled by the early season where thimbleberry played the part of our english hawthorn and the buckeyes were putting forth their twisted horns of blossom through all this we struggled toughly upwards canted to and fro by the roughness of the trail and continually switched across the face by sprays of leaf or blossom  the last is no great inconvenience at home but here in california it is a matter of some moment  for in all woods and by every wayside there prospers an abominable shrub or weed called poisonoak whose very neighbourhood is venomous to some and whose actual touch is avoided by the most impervious  the two houses with their vineyards stood each in a green niche of its own in this steep and narrow forest dell  though they were so near there was already a good difference in level and mr meckrons head must be a long way under the feet of mr schram no more had been cleared than was necessary for cultivation close around each oasis ran the tangled wood the glen enfolds them there they lie basking in sun and silence concealed from all but the clouds and the mountain birds  mr meckrons is a bachelor establishment a little bit of a wooden house a small cellar hard by in the hillside and a patch of vines planted and tended singlehanded by himself  he had but recently began his vines were young his business young also but i thought he had the look of the man who succeeds  he hailed from greenock  he remembered his father putting him inside mons meg and that touched me home and we exchanged a word or two of scotch which pleased me more than you would fancy  mr schrams on the other hand is the oldest vineyard in the valley eighteen years old i think yet he began a penniless barber and even after he had broken ground up here with his black malvoisies continued for long to tramp the valley with his razor now his place is the picture of prosperity  stuffed birds in the verandah cellars far dug into the hillside and resting on pillars like a bandits cave all trimness varnish flowers and sunshine among the tangled wildwood  stout smiling mrs schram who has been to europe and apparently all about the states for pleasure entertained fanny in the verandah while i was tasting wines in the cellar  to mr schram this was a solemn office his serious gusto warmed my heart prosperity had not yet wholly banished a certain neophite and girlish trepidation and he followed every sip and read my face with proud anxiety  i tasted all  i tasted every variety and shade of schramberger red and white schramberger burgundy schramberger schramberger hock schramberger golden chasselas the latter with a notable bouquet and i fear to think how many more  much of it goes to london most i think and mr schram has a great notion of the english taste  in this wild spot i did not feel the sacredness of ancient cultivation  it was still raw it was no marathon and no johannisberg yet the stirring sunlight and the growing vines and the vats and bottles in the cavern made a pleasant music for the mind  here also earths cream was being skimmed and garnered and the london customers can taste such as it is the tang of the earth in this green valley  so local so quintessential is a wine that it seems the very birds in the verandah might communicate a flavour and that romantic cellar influence the bottle next to be uncorked in pimlico and the smile of jolly mr schram might mantle in the glass  but these are but experiments  all things in this new land are moving farther on  the winevats and the miners blasting tools but picket for a night like bedouin pavillions and tomorrow to fresh woods  this stir of change and these perpetual echoes of the moving footfall haunt the land  men move eternally still chasing fortune and fortune found still wander  as we drove back to calistoga the road lay empty of mere passengers but its green side was dotted with the camps of travelling families  one cumbered with a great waggonful of household stuff settlers going to occupy a ranche they had taken up in mendocino or perhaps tehama county another a party in dust coats men and women whom we found camped in a grove on the roadside all on pleasure bent with a chinaman to cook for them and who waved their hands to us as we drove by    chapter ivthe scot abroad    a few pages back i wrote that a man belonged in these days to a variety of countries but the old land is still the true love the others are but pleasant infidelities  scotland is indefinable it has no unity except upon the map  two languages many dialects innumerable forms of piety and countless local patriotisms and prejudices part us among ourselves more widely than the extreme east and west of that great continent of america  when i am at home i feel a man from glasgow to be something like a rival a man from barra to be more than half a foreigner  yet let us meet in some far country and whether we hail from the braes of manor or the braes of mar some readymade affection joins us on the instant  it is not race  look at us  one is norse one celtic and another saxon  it is not community of tongue  we have it not among ourselves and we have it almost to perfection with english or irish or american  it is no tie of faith for we detest each others errors  and yet somewhere deep down in the heart of each one of us something yearns for the old land and the old kindly people  of all mysteries of the human heart this is perhaps the most inscrutable  there is no special loveliness in that gray country with its rainy seabeat archipelago its fields of dark mountains its unsightly places black with coal its treeless sour unfriendly looking cornlands its quaint gray castled city where the bells clash of a sunday and the wind squalls and the salt showers fly and beat  i do not even know if i desire to live there but let me hear in some far land a kindred voice sing out oh why left i my hame and it seems at once as if no beauty under the kind heavens and no society of the wise and good can repay me for my absence from my country  and though i think i would rather die elsewhere yet in my heart of hearts i long to be buried among good scots clods  i will say it fairly it grows on me with every year  there are no stars so lovely as edinburgh streetlamps  when i forget thee auld reekie may my right hand forget its cunning  the happiest lot on earth is to be born a scotchman  you must pay for it in many ways as for all other advantages on earth  you have to learn the paraphrases and the shorter catechism you generally take to drink your youth as far as i can find out is a time of louder war against society of more outcry and tears and turmoil than if you had been born for instance in england  but somehow life is warmer and closer the hearth burns more redly the lights of home shine softer on the rainy street the very names endeared in verse and music cling nearer round our hearts  an englishman may meet an englishman tomorrow upon chimborazo and neither of them care but when the scotch winegrower told me of mons meg it was like magic   from the dim shieling on the misty island mountains divide us and a world of seas yet still our hearts are true our hearts are highland and we in dreams behold the hebrides   and highland and lowland all our hearts are scotch  only a few days after i had seen meckron a message reached me in my cottage  it was a scotchman who had come down a long way from the hills to market  he had heard there was a countryman in calistoga and came round to the hotel to see him  we said a few words to each other we had not much to sayshould never have seen each other had we stayed at home separated alike in space and in society and then we shook hands and he went his way again to his ranche among the hills and that was all  another scotchman there was a resident who for the more love of the common country douce serious religious man drove me all about the valley and took as much interest in me as if i had been his son  more perhaps for the son has faults too keenly felt while the abstract countryman is perfectlike a whiff of peats  and there was yet another  upon him i came suddenly as he was calmly entering my cottage his mind quite evidently bent on plunder  a man of about fifty filthy ragged roguish with a chimneypot hat and a tail coat and a pursing of his mouth that might have been envied by an elder of the kirk  he had just such a face as i have seen a dozen times behind the plate  hullo sir i cried  where are you going  he turned round without a quiver  youre a scotchman sir he said gravely  so am i i come from aberdeen  this is my card presenting me with a piece of pasteboard which he had raked out of some gutter in the period of the rains  i was just examining this palm he continued indicating the misbegotten plant before our door which is the largest spacimen i have yet observed in califoarnia  there were four or five larger within sight  but where was the use of argument  he produced a tapeline made me help him to measure the tree at the level of the ground and entered the figures in a large and filthy pocketbook all with the gravity of solomon  he then thanked me profusely remarking that such little services were due between countrymen shook hands with me for add lang syne as he said and took himself solemnly away radiating dirt and humbug as he went  a month or two after this encounter of mine there came a scot to sacramentoperhaps from aberdeen  anyway there never was any one more scotch in this wide world  he could sing and dance and drink i presume and he played the pipes with vigour and success all the scotch in sacramento became infatuated with him and spent their spare time and money driving him about in an open cab between drinks while he blew himself scarlet at the pipes  this is a very sad story  after he had borrowed money from every one he and his pipes suddenly disappeared from sacramento and when i last heard the police were looking for him  i cannot say how this story amused me when i felt myself so thoroughly ripe on both sides to be duped in the same way  it is at least a curious thing to conclude that the races which wander widest jews and scotch should be the most clannish in the world  but perhaps these two are cause and effect  for ye were strangers in the land of egypt     part iiwith the children of israel     chapter ito introduce mr kelmar    one thing in this new country very particularly strikes a stranger and that is the number of antiquities  already there have been many cycles of population succeeding each other and passing away and leaving behind them relics  these standing on into changed times strike the imagination as forcibly as any pyramid or feudal tower  the towns like the vineyards are experimentally founded they grow great and prosper by passing occasions and when the lode comes to an end and the miners move elsewhere the town remains behind them like palmyra in the desert  i suppose there are in no country in the world so many deserted towns as here in california  the whole neighbourhood of mount saint helena now so quiet and sylvan was once alive with mining camps and villages  here there would be two thousand souls under canvas there one thousand or fifteen hundred ensconced as if for ever in a town of comfortable houses  but the luck had failed the mines petered out and the army of miners had departed and left this quarter of the world to the rattlesnakes and deer and grizzlies and to the slower but steadier advance of husbandry  it was with an eye on one of these deserted places pine flat on the geysers road that we had come first to calistoga  there is something singularly enticing in the idea of going rentfree into a readymade house  and to the british merchant sitting at home at ease it may appear that with such a roof over your head and a spring of clear water hard by the whole problem of the squatters existence would be solved  food however has yet to be considered i will go as far as most people on tinned meats some of the brightest moments of my life were passed over tinned mulli gatawney in the cabin of a sixteenton schooner stormstayed in portree bay but after suitable experiments i pronounce authoritatively that man cannot live by tins alone  fresh meat must be had on an occasion  it is true that the great foss driving by along the geysers road woodenfaced but glorified with legend might have been induced to bring us meat but the great foss could hardly bring us milk  to take a cow would have involved taking a field of grass and a milkmaid after which it would have been hardly worth while to pause and we might have added to our colony a flock of sheep and an experienced butcher  it is really very disheartening how we depend on other people in this life  mihi est propositum as you may see by the motto id quod regibus and behold it cannot be carried out unless i find a neighbour rolling in cattle  now my principal adviser in this matter was one whom i will call kelmar  that was not what he called himself but as soon as i set eyes on him i knew it was or ought to be his name i am sure it will be his name among the angels  kelmar was the storekeeper a russian jew goodnatured in a very thriving way of business and on equal terms one of the most serviceable of men  he also had something of the expression of a scotch country elder who by some peculiarity should chance to be a hebrew  he had a projecting under lip with which he continually smiled or rather smirked mrs kelmar was a singularly kind woman and the oldest son had quite a dark and romantic bearing and might be heard on summer evenings playing sentimental airs on the violin  i had no idea at the time i made his acquaintance what an important person kelmar was  but the jew storekeepers of california profiting at once by the needs and habits of the people have made themselves in too many cases the tyrants of the rural population  credit is offered is pressed on the new customer and when once he is beyond his depth the tune changes and he is from thenceforth a white slave  i believe even from the little i saw that kelmar if he choose to put on the screw could send half the settlers packing in a radius of seven or eight miles round calistoga  these are continually paying him but are never suffered to get out of debt  he palms dull goods upon them for they dare not refuse to buy he goes and dines with them when he is on an outing and no man is loudlier welcomed he is their family friend the director of their business and to a degree elsewhere unknown in modern days their king  for some reason kelmar always shook his head at the mention of pine flat and for some days i thought he disapproved of the whole scheme and was proportionately sad  one fine morning however he met me wreathed in smiles  he had found the very place for me silverado another old mining town right up the mountain  rufe hanson the hunter could take care of usfine people the hansons we should be close to the toll house where the lakeport stage called daily it was the best place for my health besides  rufe had been consumptive and was now quite a strong man aint it  in short the place and all its accompaniments seemed made for us on purpose  he took me to his back door whence as from every point of calistoga mount saint helena could be seen towering in the air there in the nick just where the eastern foothills joined the mountain and she herself began to rise above the zone of forest there was silverado  the name had already pleased me the high station pleased me still more  i began to inquire with some eagerness  it was but a little while ago that silverado was a great place  the minea silver mine of coursehad promised great things  there was quite a lively population with several hotels and boardinghouses and kelmar himself had opened a branch store and done extremely wellaint it he said appealing to his wife  and she said yes extremely well now there was no one living in the town but rufe the hunter and once more i heard rufes praises by the yard and this time sung in chorus  i could not help perceiving at the time that there was something underneath that no unmixed desire to have us comfortably settled had inspired the kelmars with this flow of words  but i was impatient to be gone to be about my kingly project and when we were offered seats in kelmars waggon i accepted on the spot  the plan of their next sundays outing took them by good fortune over the border into lake county  they would carry us so far drop us at the toll house present us to the hansons and call for us again on monday morning early    chapter iifirst impressions of silverado    we were to leave by six precisely that was solemnly pledged on both sides and a messenger came to us the last thing at night to remind us of the hour  but it was eight before we got clear of calistoga  kelmar mrs kelmar a friend of theirs whom we named abramina her little daughter my wife myself and stowed away behind us a cluster of ships coffeekettles  these last were highly ornamental in the sheen of their bright tin but i could invent no reason for their presence  our carriageful reckoned up as near as we could get at it some three hundred years to the six of us  four of the six besides were hebrews  but i never in all my life was conscious of so strong an atmosphere of holiday no word was spoken but of pleasure and even when we drove in silence nods and smiles went round the party like refreshments  the sun shone out of a cloudless sky  close at the zenith rode the belated moon still clearly visible and along one margin even bright  the wind blew a gale from the north the trees roared the corn and the deep grass in the valley fled in whitening surges the dust towered into the air along the road and dispersed like the smoke of battle  it was clear in our teeth from the first and for all the windings of the road it managed to keep clear in our teeth until the end  for some two miles we rattled through the valley skirting the eastern foothills then we struck off to the right through haugh land and presently crossing a dry watercourse entered the toll road or to be more local entered on the grade  the road mounts the near shoulder of mount saint helena bound northward into lake county  in one place it skirts along the edge of a narrow and deep canyon filled with trees and i was glad indeed not to be driven at this point by the dashing foss  kelmar with his unvarying smile jogging to the motion of the trap drove for all the world like a good plain country clergyman at home and i profess i blessed him unawares for his timidity  vineyards and deep meadows islanded and framed with thicket gave place more and more as we ascended to woods of oak and madrona dotted with enormous pines  it was these pines as they shot above the lower wood that produced that pencilling of single trees i had so often remarked from the valley  thence looking up and from however far each fir stands separate against the sky no bigger than an eyelash and all together lend a quaint fringed aspect to the hills  the oak is no baby even the madrona upon these spurs of mount saint helena comes to a fine bulk and ranks with forest treesbut the pines look down upon the rest for underwood  as mount saint helena among her foothills so these dark giants out top their fellowvegetables  alas if they had left the redwoods the pines in turn would have been dwarfed  but the redwoods fallen from their high estate are serving as family bedsteads or yet more humbly as field fences along all napa valley  a rough smack of resin was in the air and a crystal mountain purity  it came pouring over these green slopes by the oceanful the woods sang aloud and gave largely of their healthful breath gladness seemed to inhabit these upper zones and we had left indifference behind us in the valley  i to the hills lift mine eyes  there are days in a life when thus to climb out of the lowlands seems like scaling heaven  as we continued to ascend the wind fell upon us with increasing strength  it was a wonder how the two stout horses managed to pull us up that steep incline and still face the athletic opposition of the wind or how their great eyes were able to endure the dust ten minutes after we went by a tree fell blocking the road and even before us leaves were thickly strewn and boughs had fallen large enough to make the passage difficult  but now we were hard by the summit  the road crosses the ridge just in the nick that kelmar showed me from below and then without pause plunges down a deep thickly wooded glen on the farther side  at the highest point a trail strikes up the main hill to the leftward and that leads to silverado  a hundred yards beyond and in a kind of elbow of the glen stands the toll house hotel  we came up the one side were caught upon the summit by the whole weight of the wind as it poured over into napa valley and a minute after had drawn up in shelter but all buffetted and breathless at the toll house door  a watertank and stables and a gray house of two stories with gable ends and a verandah are jammed hard against the hillside just where a stream has cut for itself a narrow canyon filled with pines  the pines go right up overhead a little more and the stream might have played like a firehose on the toll house roof in front the ground drops as sharply as it rises behind  there is just room for the road and a sort of promontory of croquet ground and then you can lean over the edge and look deep below you through the wood  i said croquet ground not green for the surface was of brown beaten earth  the tollbar itself was the only other note of originality  a long beam turning on a post and kept slightly horizontal by a counterweight of stones  regularly about sundown this rude barrier was swung like a derrick across the road and made fast i think to a tree upon the farther side  on our arrival there followed a gay scene in the bar  i was presented to mr corwin the landlord to mr jennings the engineer who lives there for his health to mr hoddy a most pleasant little gentleman once a member of the ohio legislature again the editor of a local paper and now with undiminished dignity keeping the toll house bar  i had a number of drinks and cigars bestowed on me and enjoyed a famous opportunity of seeing kelmar in his glory friendly radiant smiling steadily edging one of the ships kettles on the reluctant corwin  corwin plainly aghast resisted gallantly and for that bout victory crowned his arms  at last we set forth for silverado on foot  kelmar and his jolly jew girls were full of the sentiment of sunday outings breathed geniality and vagueness and suffered a little vile boy from the hotel to lead them here and there about the woods  for three people all so old so bulky in body and belonging to a race so venerable they could not but surprise us by their extreme and almost imbecile youthfulness of spirit  they were only going to stay ten minutes at the toll house had they not twenty long miles of road before them on the other side  stay to dinner  not they put up the horses never  let us attach them to the verandah by a wisp of straw rope such as would not have held a persons hat on that blustering day  and with all these protestations of hurry they proved irresponsible like children  kelmar himself shrewd old russian jew with a smirk that seemed just to have concluded a bargain to its satisfaction intrusted himself and us devoutly to that boy  yet the boy was patently fallacious and for that matter a most unsympathetic urchin raised apparently on gingerbread  he was bent on his own pleasure nothing else and kelmar followed him to his ruin with the same shrewd smirk  if the boy said there was a hole there in the hilla hole pure and simple neither more nor lesskelmar and his jew girls would follow him a hundred yards to look complacently down that hole  for two hours we looked for houses and for two hours they followed us smelling trees picking flowers foisting false botany on the unwary  had we taken five with that vile lad to head them off on idle divagations for five they would have smiled and stumbled through the woods  however we came forth at length and as by accident upon a lawn sparse planted like an orchard but with forest instead of fruit trees  that was the site of silverado mining town  a piece of ground was levelled up where kelmars store had been and facing that we saw rufe hansons house still bearing on its front the legend silverado hotel  not another sign of habitation  silverado town had all been carted from the scene one of the houses was now the schoolhouse far down the road one was gone here one there but all were gone away  it was now a sylvan solitude and the silence was unbroken but by the great vague voice of the wind  some days before our visit a grizzly bear had been sporting round the hansons chickenhouse  mrs hanson was at home alone we found  rufe had been out after a bar had risen late and was now gone it did not clearly appear whither  perhaps he had had wind of kelmars coming and was now ensconced among the underwood or watching us from the shoulder of the mountain  we hearing there were no houses to be had were for immediately giving up all hopes of silverado  but this somehow was not to kelmars fancy  he first proposed that we should camp someveres around aint it waving his hand cheerily as though to weave a spell and when that was firmly rejected he decided that we must take up house with the hansons  mrs hanson had been from the first flustered subdued and a little pale but from this proposition she recoiled with haggard indignation  so did we who would have preferred in a manner of speaking death  but kelmar was not to be put by  he edged mrs hanson into a corner where for a long time he threatened her with his forefinger like a character in dickens and the poor woman driven to her entrenchments at last remembered with a shriek that there were still some houses at the tunnel  thither we went the jews who should already have been miles into lake county still cheerily accompanying us  for about a furlong we followed a good road alone the hillside through the forest until suddenly that road widened out and came abruptly to an end a canyon woody below red rocky and naked overhead was here walled across by a dump of rolling stones dangerously steep and from twenty to thirty feet in height  a rusty iron chute on wooden legs came flying like a monstrous gargoyle across the parapet it was down this that they poured the precious ore and below here the carts stood to wait their lading and carry it millward down the mountain  the whole canyon was so entirely blocked as if by some rude guerilla fortification that we could only mount by lengths of wooden ladder fixed in the hillside  these led us round the farther corner of the dump and when they were at an end we still persevered over loose rubble and wading deep in poison oak till we struck a triangular platform filling up the whole glen and shut in on either hand by bold projections of the mountain  only in front the place was open like the proscenium of a theatre and we looked forth into a great realm of air and down upon treetops and hilltops and far and near on wild and varied country  the place still stood as on the day it was deserted  a line of iron rails with a bifurcation a truck in working order a world of lumber old wood old iron a blacksmiths forge on one side half buried in the leaves of dwarf madronas and on the other an old brown wooden house  fanny and i dashed at the house  it consisted of three rooms and was so plastered against the hill that one room was right atop of another that the upper floor was more than twice as large as the lower and that all three apartments must be entered from a different side and level  not a windowsash remained  the door of the lower room was smashed and one panel hung in splinters  we entered that and found a fair amount of rubbish sand and gravel that had been sifted in there by the mountain winds straw sticks and stones a table a barrel a platerack on the wall two homemade bootjacks signs of miners and their boots and a pair of papers pinned on the boarding headed respectively funnel no 1 and funnel no 2 but with the tails torn away  the window sashless of course was choked with the green and sweetly smelling foliage of a bay and through a chink in the floor a spray of poison oak had shot up and was handsomely prospering in the interior  it was my first care to cut away that poison oak fanny standing by at a respectful distance  that was our first improvement by which we took possession  the room immediately above could only be entered by a plank propped against the threshold along which the intruder must foot it gingerly clutching for support to sprays of poison oak the proper product of the country  herein was on either hand a triple tier of beds where miners had once lain and the other gable was pierced by a sashless window and a doorless doorway opening on the air of heaven five feet above the ground  as for the third room which entered squarely from the ground level but higher up the hill and farther up the canyon it contained only rubbish and the uprights for another triple tier of beds  the whole building was overhung by a bold lionlike red rock poison oak sweet bay trees calcanthus brush and chaparral grew freely but sparsely all about it in front in the strong sunshine the platform lay overstrewn with busy litter as though the labours of the mine might begin again tomorrow in the morning  following back into the canyon among the mass of rotting plant and through the flowering bushes we came to a great crazy staging with a wry windless on the top and clambering up we could look into an open shaft leading edgeways down into the bowels of the mountain trickling with water and lit by some stray sungleams whence i know not  in that quiet place the still faraway tinkle of the waterdrops was loudly audible  close by another shaft led edgeways up into the superincumbent shoulder of the hill  it lay partly open and sixty or a hundred feet above our head we could see the strata propped apart by solid wooden wedges and a pine half undermined precariously nodding on the verge  here also a rugged horizontal tunnel ran straight into the unsunned bowels of the rock  this secure angle in the mountains flank was even on this wild day as still as my ladys chamber  but in the tunnel a cold wet draught tempestuously blew  nor have i ever known that place otherwise than cold and windy  such was our fist prospect of juan silverado  i own i had looked for something different  a clique of neighbourly houses on a village green we shall say all empty to be sure but swept and varnished a trout stream brawling by great elms or chestnuts humming with bees and nested in by songbirds and the mountains standing round about as at jerusalem  here mountain and house and the old tools of industry were all alike rusty and downfalling the hill was here wedged up and there poured forth its bowels in a spout of broken mineral man with his picks and powder and nature with her own great blasting tools of sun and rain labouring together at the ruin of that proud mountain  the view up the canyon was a glimpse of devastation dry red minerals sliding together here and there a crag here and there dwarf thicket clinging in the general glissade and over all a broken outline trenching on the blue of heaven  downwards indeed from our rock eyrie we behold the greener side of nature and the bearing of the pines and the sweet smell of bays and nutmegs commanded themselves gratefully to our senses  one way and another now the die was cast  silverado be it  after we had got back to the toll house the jews were not long of striking forward  but i observed that one of the hanson lads came down before their departure and returned with a ships kettle happy hansons  nor was it until after kelmar was gone if i remember rightly that rufe put in an appearance to arrange the details of our installation  the latter part of the day fanny and i sat in the verandah of the toll house utterly stunned by the uproar of the wind among the trees on the other side of the valley  sometimes we would have it it was like a sea but it was not various enough for that and again we thought it like the roar of a cataract but it was too changeful for the cataract and then we would decide speaking in sleepy voices that it could be compared with nothing but itself my mind was entirely preoccupied by the noise  i hearkened to it by the hour gapingly hearkened and let my cigarette go out sometimes the wind would make a sally nearer hand and send a shrill whistling crash among the foliage on our side of the glen and sometimes a backdraught would strike into the elbow where we sat and cast the gravel and torn leaves into our faces  but for the most part this great streaming gale passed unweariedly by us into napa valley not two hundred yards away visible by the tossing boughs stunningly audible and yet not moving a hair upon our heads  so it blew all night long while i was writing up my journal and after we were in bed under a cloudless starset heaven and so it was blowing still next morning when we rose  it was a laughable thought to us what had become of our cheerful wandering hebrews  we could not suppose they had reached a destination  the meanest boy could lead them miles out of their way to see a gopherhole  boys we felt to be their special danger none others were of that exact pitch of cheerful irrelevancy to exercise a kindred sway upon their minds  but before the attractions of a boy their most settled resolutions would be war  we thought we could follow in fancy these three aged hebrew truants wandering in and out on hilltop and in thicket a demon boy trotting far ahead their willothewisp conductor and at last about midnight the wind still roaring in the darkness we had a vision of all three on their knees upon a mountaintop around a glowworm    chapter iii the return    next morning we were up by halfpast five according to agreement and it was ten by the clock before our jew boys returned to pick us up  kelmar mrs kelmar and abramina all smiling from ear to ear and full of tales of the hospitality they had found on the other side  it had not gone unrewarded for i observed with interest that the ships kettles all but one had been placed three lake county families at least endowed for life with a ships kettle  come this was no misspent sunday  the absence of the kettles told its own story  our jews said nothing about them but on the other hand they said many kind and comely things about the people they had met  the two women in particular had been charmed out of themselves by the sight of a young girl surrounded by her admirers all evening it appeared they had been triumphing together in the girls innocent successes and to this natural and unselfish joy they gave expression in language that was beautiful by its simplicity and truth  take them for all in all few people have done my heart more good they seemed so thoroughly entitled to happiness and to enjoy it in so large a measure and so free from afterthought almost they persuaded me to be a jew  there was indeed a chink of money in their talk  they particularly commanded people who were well to do  he dont careaint it was their highest word of commendation to an individual fate and here i seem to grasp the root of their philosophyit was to be free from care to be free to make these sunday wanderings that they so eagerly pursued after wealth and all this carefulness was to be careless  the fine good humour of all three seemed to declare they had attained their end  yet there was the other side to it and the recipients of kettles perhaps cared greatly  no sooner had they returned than the scene of yesterday began again  the horses were not even tied with a straw rope this time it was not worth while and kelmar disappeared into the bar leaving them under a tree on the other side of the road  i had to devote myself  i stood under the shadow of that tree for i suppose hard upon an hour and had not the heart to be angry once some one remembered me and brought me out half a tumblerful of the playful innocuous american cocktail  i drank it and lo veins of living fire ran down my leg and then a focus of conflagration remained seated in my stomach not unpleasantly for quarter of an hour  i love these sweet fiery pangs but i will not court them  the bulk of the time i spent in repeating as much french poetry as i could remember to the horses who seemed to enjoy it hugely  and now it went    o ma vieille fontgeorges ou volent les rougesgorges   and again to a more trampling measure    et tout tremble irun coimbre sautander almodovar sitot quon entend le timbre des cymbales do bivar   the redbreasts and the brooks of europe in that dry and songless land brave old names and wars strong cities cymbals and bright armour in that nook of the mountain sacred only to the indian and the bear  this is still the strangest thing in all mans travelling that he should carry about with him incongruous memories  there is no foreign land it is the traveller only that is foreign and now and again by a flash of recollection lights up the contrasts of the earth  but while i was thus wandering in my fancy great feats had been transacted in the bar  corwin the bold had fallen kelmar was again crowned with laurels and the last of the ships kettles had changed hands  if i had ever doubted the purity of kelmars motives if i had ever suspected him of a single eye to business in his eternal dallyings now at least when the last kettle was disposed of my suspicions must have been allayed  i dare not guess how much more time was wasted nor how often we drove off merely to drive back again and renew interrupted conversations about nothing before the toll house was fairly left behind  alas and not a mile down the grade there stands a ranche in a sunny vineyard and here we must all dismount again and enter  only the old lady was at home mrs guele a brown old swiss dame the picture of honesty and with her we drank a bottle of wine and had an agelong conversation which would have been highly delightful if fanny and i had not been faint with hunger  the ladies each narrated the story of her marriage our two hebrews with the prettiest combination of sentiment and financial bathos abramina specially endeared herself with every word  she was as simple natural and engaging as a kid that should have been brought up to the business of a moneychanger  one touch was so resplendently hebraic that i cannot pass it over  when her old man wrote home for her from america her old mans family would not intrust her with the money for the passage till she had bound herself by an oathon her knees i think she saidnot to employ it otherwise  this had tickled abramina hugely but i think it tickled me fully more  mrs guele told of her homesickness up here in the long winters of her honest countrywoman troubles and alarms upon the journey how in the bank at frankfort she had feared lest the banker after having taken her cheque should deny all knowledge of ita fear i have myself every time i go to a bank and how crossing the luneburger heath an old lady witnessing her trouble and finding whither she was bound had given her the blessing of a person eighty years old which would be sure to bring her safely to the states  and the first thing i did added mrs guele was to fall downstairs  at length we got out of the house and some of us into the trap whenjudgment of heavenhere came mr guele from his vineyard so another quarter of an hour went by till at length at our earnest pleading we set forth again in earnest fanny and i white faced and silent but the jews still smiling  the heart fails me there was yet another stoppage  and we drove at last into calistoga past two in the afternoon fanny and i having breakfasted at six in the morning eight mortal hours before  we were a pallid couple but still the jews were smiling  so ended our excursion with the village usurers and now that it was done we had no more idea of the nature of the business nor of the part we had been playing in it than the child unborn  that all the people we had met were the slaves of kelmar though in various degrees of servitude that we ourselves had been sent up the mountain in the interests of none but kelmar that the money we laid out dollar by dollar cent by cent and through the hands of various intermediaries should all hop ultimately into kelmars tillthese were facts that we only grew to recognize in the course of time and by the accumulation of evidence  at length all doubt was quieted when one of the kettleholders confessed stopping his trap in the moonlight a little way out of calistoga he told me in so many words that he dare not show face therewith an empty pocket  you see i dont mind if it was only five dollars mr stevens he said but i must give mr kelmar something  even now when the whole tyranny is plain to me i cannot find it in my heart to be as angry as perhaps i should be with the hebrew tyrant  the whole game of business is beggar my neighbour and though perhaps that game looks uglier when played at such close quarters and on so small a scale it is none the more intrinsically inhumane for that  the village usurer is not so sad a feature of humanity and human progress as the millionaire manufacturer fattening on the toil and loss of thousands and yet declaiming from the platform against the greed and dishonesty of landlords if it were fair for cobden to buy up land from owners whom he thought unconscious of its proper value it was fair enough for my russian jew to give credit to his farmers  kelmar if he was unconscious of the beam in his own eye was at least silent in the matter of his brothers mote    the act of squatting    there were four of us squattersmyself and my wife the king and queen of silverado sam the crown prince and chuchu the grand duke  chuchu a setter crossed with spaniel was the most unsuited for a rough life  he had been nurtured tenderly in the society of ladies his heart was large and soft he regarded the sofacushion as a bedrook necessary of existence  though about the size of a sheep he loved to sit in ladies laps he never said a bad word in all his blameless days and if he had seen a flute i am sure he could have played upon it by nature  it may seem hard to say it of a dog but chuchu was a tame cat  the king and queen the grand duke and a basket of cold provender for immediate use set forth from calistoga in a double buggy the crown prince on horseback led the way like an outrider  bags and boxes and a secondhand stove were to follow close upon our heels by hansons team  it was a beautiful still day the sky was one field of azure  not a leaf moved not a speck appeared in heaven  only from the summit of the mountain one little snowy wisp of cloud after another kept detaching itself like smoke from a volcano and blowing southward in some high stream of air  mount saint helena still at her interminable task making the weather like a lapland witch  by noon we had come in sight of the mill  a great brown building halfway up the hill big as a factory two stories high and with tanks and ladders along the roof which as a pendicle of silverado mine we held to be an outlying province of our own  thither then we went crossing the valley by a grassy trail and there lunched out of the basket sitting in a kind of portico and wondering while we ate at this great bulk of useless building through a chink we could look far down into the interior and see sunbeams floating in the dust and striking on tier after tier of silent rusty machinery  it cost six thousand dollars twelve hundred english sovereigns and now here it stands deserted like the temple of a forgotten religion the busy millers toiling somewhere else  all the time we were there mill and mill town showed no sign of life that part of the mountainside which is very open and green was tenanted by no living creature but ourselves and the insects and nothing stirred but the cloud manufactory upon the mountain summit  it was odd to compare this with the former days when the engine was in fall blast the mill palpitating to its strokes and the carts came rattling down from silverado charged with ore  by two we had been landed at the mine the buggy was gone again and we were left to our own reflections and the basket of cold provender until hanson should arrive  hot as it was by the sun there was something chill in such a homecoming in that world of wreck and rust splinter and rolling gravel where for so many years no fire had smoked  silverado platform filled the whole width of the canyon  above as i have said this was a wild red stony gully in the mountains but below it was a wooded dingle  and through this i was told there had gone a path between the mine and the toll houseour natural northwest passage to civilization  i found and followed it clearing my way as i went through fallen branches and dead trees  it went straight down that steep canyon till it brought you out abruptly over the roofs of the hotel  there was nowhere any break in the descent  it almost seemed as if were you to drop a stone down the old iron chute at our platform it would never rest until it hopped upon the toll house shingles  signs were not wanting of the ancient greatness of silverado  the footpath was well marked and had been well trodden in the old clays by thirsty miners  and far down buried in foliage deep out of sight of silverado i came on a last outpost of the minea mound of gravel some wreck of wooden aqueduct and the mouth of a tunnel like a treasure grotto in a fairy story  a stream of water fed by the invisible leakage from our shaft and dyed red with cinnabar or iron ran trippingly forth out of the bowels of the cave and looking far under the arch i could see something like an iron lantern fastened on the rocky wall  it was a promising spot for the imagination  no boy could have left it unexplored  the stream thenceforward stole along the bottom of the dingle and made for that dry land a pleasant warbling in the leaves  once i suppose it ran splashing down the whole length of the canyon but now its head waters had been tapped by the shaft at silverado and for a great part of its course it wandered sunless among the joints of the mountain  no wonder that it should better its pace when it sees far before it daylight whitening in the arch or that it should come trotting forth into the sunlight with a song  the two stages had gone by when i got down and the toll house stood dozing in sun and dust and silence like a place enchanted my mission was after hay for bedding and that i was readily promised  but when i mentioned that we were waiting for rufe the people shook their heads  rufe was not a regular man any way it seemed and if he got playing pokerwell poker was too many for rufe  i had not yet heard them bracketted together but it seemed a natural conjunction and commended itself swiftly to my fears and as soon as i returned to silverado and had told my story we practically gave hanson up and set ourselves to do what we could find doable in our desertisland state  the lower room had been the assayers office  the floor was thick with debrispart human from the former occupants part natural sifted in by mountain winds  in a sea of red dust there swam or floated sticks boards hay straw stones and paper ancient newspapers above allfor the newspaper especially when torn soon becomes an antiquityand bills of the silverado boarding house some dated silverado some calistoga mine  here is one verbatim and if any one can calculate the scale of charges he has my envious admiration   calistoga mine may 3rd 1875 john stanley to s chapman cr to board from april 1st to april 30  25 75              may lst to 3rd      2 00                                        27 75   where is john stanley mining now  where is s chapman within whose hospitable walls we were to lodge  the date was but five years old but in that time the world had changed for silverado like palmyra in the desert it had outlived its people and its purpose we camped like layard amid ruins and these names spoke to us of prehistoric time  a bootjack a pair of boots a dog hutch and these bills of mr chapmans were the only speaking relics that we disinterred from all that vast silverado rubbish heap but what would i not have given to unearth a letter a pocketbook a diary only a ledger or a roll of names to take me back in a more personal manner to the past  it pleases me besides to fancy that stanley or chapman or one of their companions may light upon this chronicle and be struck by the name and read some news of their anterior home coming as it were out of a subsequent epoch of history in that quarter of the world  as we were tumbling the mingled rubbish on the floor kicking it with our feet and groping for these written evidences of the past sam with a somewhat whitened face produced a paper bag  whats this said he  it contained a granulated powder something the colour of gregorys mixture but rosier and as there were several of the bags and each more or less broken the powder was spread widely on the floor  had any of us ever seen giant powder  no nobody had and instantly there grew up in my mind a shadowy belief verging with every moment nearer to certitude that i had somewhere heard somebody describe it as just such a powder as the one around us  i have learnt since that it is a substance not unlike tallow and is made up in rolls for all the world like tallow candles  fanny to add to our happiness told us a story of a gentleman who had camped one night like ourselves by a deserted mine  he was a handy thrifty fellow and looked right and left for plunder but all he could lay his hands on was a can of oil  after dark he had to see to the horses with a lantern and not to miss an opportunity filled up his lamp from the oil can  thus equipped he set forth into the forest  a little while after his friends heard a loud explosion the mountain echoes bellowed and then all was still  on examination the can proved to contain oil with the trifling addition of nitroglycerine but no research disclosed a trace of either man or lantern  it was a pretty sight after this anecdote to see us sweeping out the giant powder  it seemed never to be far enough away  and after all it was only some rock pounded for assay  so much for the lower room  we scraped some of the rougher dirt off the floor and left it  that was our sittingroom and kitchen though there was nothing to sit upon but the table and no provision for a fire except a hole in the roof of the room above which had once contained the chimney of a stove  to that upper room we now proceeded  there were the eighteen bunks in a double tier nine on either hand where from eighteen to thirtysix miners had once snored together all night long john stanley perhaps snoring loudest  there was the roof with a hole in it through which the sun now shot an arrow  there was the floor in much the same state as the one below though perhaps there was more hay and certainly there was the added ingredient of broken glass the man who stole the windowframes having apparently made a miscarriage with this one  without a broom without hay or bedding we could but look about us with a beginning of despair the one bright arrow of day in that gaunt and shattered barrack made the rest look dirtier and darker and the sight drove us at last into the open  here also the handiwork of man lay ruined  but the plants were all alive and thriving the view below was fresh with the colours of nature and we had exchanged a dim human garret for a corner even although it were untidy of the blue hall of heaven  not a bird not a beast not a reptile  there was no noise in that part of the world save when we passed beside the staging and heard the water musically falling in the shaft  we wandered to and fro  we searched among that drift of lumber wood and iron nails and rails and sleepers and the wheels of tracks  we gazed up the cleft into the bosom of the mountain  we sat by the margin of the dump and saw far below us the green treetops standing still in the clear air  beautiful perfumes breaths of bay resin and nutmeg came to us more often and grew sweeter and sharper as the afternoon declined  but still there was no word of hanson  i set to with pick and shovel and deepened the pool behind the shaft till we were sure of sufficient water for the morning and by the time i had finished the sun had begun to go down behind the mountain shoulder the platform was plunged in quiet shadow and a chill descended from the sky  night began early in our cleft before us over the margin of the dump we could see the sun still striking aslant into the wooded nick below and on the battlemented pinebescattered ridges on the farther side  there was no stove of course and no hearth in our lodging so we betook ourselves to the blacksmiths forge across the platform  if the platform be taken as a stage and the outcurving margin of the dump to represent the line of the footlights then our house would be the first wing on the actors left and this blacksmiths forge although no match for it in size the foremost on the right  it was a low brown cottage planted close against the hill and overhung by the foliage and peeling boughs of a madrona thicket within it was full of dead leaves and mountain dust and rubbish from the mine  but we soon had a good fire brightly blazing and sat close about it on impromptu seats  chuchu the slave of sofa cushions whimpered for a softer bed but the rest of us were greatly revived and comforted by that good creaturefire which gives us warmth and light and companionable sounds and colours up the emptiest building with better than frescoes  for a while it was even pleasant in the forge with the blaze in the midst and a look over our shoulders on the woods and mountains where the day was dying like a dolphin  it was between seven and eight before hanson arrived with a waggonful of our effects and two of his wifes relatives to lend him a hand  the elder showed surprising strength  he would pick up a huge packingcase full of books of all things swing it on his shoulder and away up the two crazy ladders and the breakneck spout of rolling mineral familiarly termed a path that led from the carttrack to our house  even for a man unburthened the ascent was toilsome and precarious but irvine sealed it with a light foot carrying box after box as the hero whisks the stage child up the practicable footway beside the waterfall of the fifth act  with so strong a helper the business was speedily transacted  soon the assayers office was thronged with our belongings piled higgledypiggledy and upside down about the floor  there were our boxes indeed but my wife had left her keys in calistoga  there was the stove but alas our carriers had forgot the chimney and lost one of the plates along the road  the silverado problem was scarce solved  rufe himself was grave and goodnatured over his share of blame he even if i remember right expressed regret  but his crew to my astonishment and anger grinned from ear to ear and laughed aloud at our distress  they thought it real funny about the stovepipe they had forgotten real funny that they should have lost a plate  as for hay the whole party refused to bring us any till they should have supped  see how late they were  never had there been such a job as coming up that grade  nor often i suspect such a game of poker as that before they started  but about nine as a particular favour we should have some hay  so they took their departure leaving me still staring and we resigned ourselves to wait for their return  the fire in the forge had been suffered to go out and we were one and all too weary to kindle another  we dined or not to take that word in vain we ate after a fashion in the nightmare disorder of the assayers office perched among boxes  a single candle lighted us  it could scarce be called a housewarming for there was of course no fire and with the two open doors and the open window gaping on the night like breaches in a fortress it began to grow rapidly chill talk ceased nobody moved but the unhappy chuchu still in quest of sofacushions who tumbled complainingly among the trunks  it required a certain happiness of disposition to look forward hopefully from so dismal a beginning across the brief hours of night to the warm shining of tomorrows sun  but the hay arrived at last and we turned with our last spark of courage to the bedroom  we had improved the entrance but it was still a kind of ropewalking and it would have been droll to see us mounting one after another by candlelight under the open stars  the western doorthat which looked up the canyon and through which we entered by our bridge of flying plankwas still entire a handsome panelled door the most finished piece of carpentry in silverado  and the two lowest bunks next to this we roughly filled with hay for that nights use  through the opposite or eastern looking gable with its open door and window a faint disused starshine came into the room like mist and when we were once in bed we lay awaiting sleep in a haunted incomplete obscurity at first the silence of the night was utter  then a high wind began in the distance among the treetops and for hours continued to grow higher  it seemed to me much such a wind as we had found on our visit yet here in our open chamber we were fanned only by gentle and refreshing draughts so deep was the canyon so close our house was planted under the overhanging rock    the hunters family    there is quite a large race or class of people in america for whom we scarcely seem to have a parallel in england  of pure white blood they are unknown or unrecognizable in towns inhabit the fringe of settlements and the deep quiet places of the country rebellious to all labour and pettily thievish like the english gipsies rustically ignorant but with a touch of woodlore and the dexterity of the savage  whence they came is a moot point  at the time of the war they poured north in crowds to escape the conscription lived during summer on fruits wild animals and petty theft and at the approach of winter when these supplies failed built great fires in the forest and there died stoically by starvation  they are widely scattered however and easily recognized  loutish but not illlooking they will sit all day swinging their legs on a field fence the mind seemingly as devoid of all reflection as a suffolk peasants careless of politics for the most part incapable of reading but with a rebellious vanity and a strong sense of independence  hunting is their most congenial business or if the occasion offers a little amateur detection  in tracking a criminal following a particular horse along a beaten highway and drawing inductions from a hair or a footprint one of those somnolent grinning hodges will suddenly display activity of body and finesse of mind  by their names ye may know them the women figuring as loveina larsenia serena leanna orreana the men answering to alvin alva or orion pronounced orrion with the accent on the first  whether they are indeed a race or whether this is the form of degeneracy common to all backwoodsmen they are at least known by a generic byword as poor whites or lowdowners  i will not say that the hanson family was poor white because the name savours of offence but i may go as far as thisthey were in many points not unsimilar to the people usually socared  rufe himself combined two of the qualifications for he was both a hunter and an amateur detective  it was he who pursued russel and dollar the robbers of the lake port stage and captured them the very morning after the exploit while they were still sleeping in a hayfield  russel a drunken scotch carpenter was even an acquaintance of his own and he expressed much grave commiseration for his fate  in all that he said and did rufe was grave  i never saw him hurried  when he spoke he took out his pipe with ceremonial deliberation looked east and west and then in quiet tones and few words stated his business or told his story  his gait was to match it would never have surprised you if at any step he had turned round and walked away again so warily and slowly and with so much seeming hesitation did he go about  he lay long in bed in the morningrarely indeed rose before noon he loved all games from poker to clerical croquet and in the toll house croquet ground i have seen him toiling at the latter with the devotion of a curate  he took an interest in education was an active member of the local schoolboard and when i was there he had recently lost the schoolhouse key  his waggon was broken but it never seemed to occur to him to mend it  like all truly idle people he had an artistic eye  he chose the print stuff for his wifes dresses and counselled her in the making of a patchwork quilt always as she thought wrongly but to the more educated eye always with bizarre and admirable tastethe taste of an indian  with all this he was a perfect unoffending gentleman in word and act  take his clay pipe from him and he was fit for any society but that of fools  quiet as he was there burned a deep permanent excitement in his dark blue eyes and when this grave man smiled it was like sunshine in a shady place  mrs hanson nee if you please lovelands was more commonplace than her lord  she was a comely woman too plump faircoloured with wonderful white teeth and in her print dresses chosen by rufe and with a large sunbonnet shading her valued complexion made i assure you a very agreeable figure  but she was on the surface what there was of her outspoken and loudspoken  her noisy laughter had none of the charm of one of hansons rare slow spreading smiles there was no reticence no mystery no manner about the woman  she was a firstclass dairymaid but her husband was an unknown quantity between the savage and the nobleman  she was often in and out with us merry and healthy and fair he came far seldomeronly indeed when there was business or now and again to pay a visit of ceremony brushed up for the occasion with his wife on his arm and a clean clay pipe in his teeth these visits in our forest state had quite the air of an event and turned our red canyon into a salon  such was the pair who ruled in the old silverado hotel among the windy trees on the mountain shoulder overlooking the whole length of napa valley as the man aloft looks down on the ships deck there they kept house with sundry horses and fowls and a family of sons daniel webster and i think george washington among the number  nor did they want visitors  an old gentleman of singular stolidity and called breedlovei think he had crossed the plains in the same caravan with rufehoused with them for awhile during our stay and they had besides a permanent lodger in the form of mrs hansons brother irvine lovelands  i spell irvine by guess for i could get no information on the subject just as i could never find out in spite of many inquiries whether or not rufe was a contraction for rufus  they were all cheerfully at sea about their names in that generation  and this is surely the more notable where the names are all so strange and even the family names appear to have been coined  at one time at least the ancestors of all these alvins and alvas loveinas lovelands and breedloves must have taken serious council and found a certain poetry in these denominations that must have been then their form of literature  but still times change and their next descendants the george washingtons and daniel websters will at least be clear upon the point  and anyway and however his name should be spelt this irvine lovelands was the most unmitigated caliban i ever knew  our very first morning at silverado when we were full of business patching up doors and windows making beds and seats and getting our rough lodging into shape irvine and his sister made their appearance together she for neighbourliness and general curiosity he because he was working for me to my sorrow cutting firewood at i forget how much a day  the way that he set about cutting wood was characteristic  we were at that moment patching up and unpacking in the kitchen  down he sat on one side and down sat his sister on the other  both were chewing pinetree gum and he to my annoyance accompanied that simple pleasure with profuse expectoration  she rattled away talking up hill and down dale laughing tossing her head showing her brilliant teeth  he looked on in silence now spitting heavily on the floor now putting his head back and uttering a loud discordant joyless laugh  he had a tangle of shock hair the colour of wool his mouth was a grin although as strong as a horse he looked neither heavy nor yet adroit only leggy coltish and in the road  but it was plain he was in high spirits thoroughly enjoying his visit and he laughed frankly whenever we failed to accomplish what we were about  this was scarcely helpful  it was even to amateur carpenters embarrassing but it lasted until we knocked off work and began to get dinner  then mrs hanson remembered she should have been gone an hour ago and the pair retired and the ladys laughter died away among the nutmegs down the path  that was irvines first days work in my employmentthe devil take him  the next morning he returned and as he was this time alone he bestowed his conversation upon us with great liberality  he prided himself on his intelligence asked us if we knew the school maam he didnt think much of her anyway  he had tried her he had  he had put a question to her  if a tree a hundred feet high were to fall a foot a day how long would it take to fall right down  she had not been able to solve the problem  she dont know nothing he opined  he told us how a friend of his kept a school with a revolver and chuckled mightily over that his friend could teach school he could  all the time he kept chewing gum and spitting he would stand a while looking down and then he would toss back his shock of hair and laugh hoarsely and spit and bring forward a new subject  a man he told us who bore a grudge against him had poisoned his dog  that was a low thing for a man to do now wasnt it  it wasnt like a man that nohow  but i got even with him  i pisoned his dog  his clumsy utterance his rude embarrassed manner set a fresh value on the stupidity of his remarks  i do not think i ever appreciated the meaning of two words until i knew irvinethe verb loaf and the noun oaf between them they complete his portrait  he could lounge and wriggle and rub himself against the wall and grin and be more in everybodys way than any other two people that i ever set my eyes on  nothing that he did became him and yet you were conscious that he was one of your own race that his mind was cumbrously at work revolving the problem of existence like a quid of gum and in his own cloudy manner enjoying life and passing judgment on his fellows  above all things he was delighted with himself  you would not have thought it from his uneasy manners and troubled struggling utterance but he loved himself to the marrow and was happy and proud like a peacock on a rail  his selfesteem was indeed the one joint in his harness  he could be got to work and even kept at work by flattery  as long as my wife stood over him crying out how strong he was so long exactly he would stick to the matter in hand and the moment she turned her back or ceased to praise him he would stop  his physical strength was wonderful and to have a woman stand by and admire his achievements warmed his heart like sunshine  yet he was as cowardly as he was powerful and felt no shame in owning to the weakness  something was once wanted from the crazy platform over the shaft and he at once refused to venture theredid not like as he said foolen round them kind o places and let my wife go instead of him looking on with a grin  vanity where it rules is usually more heroic  but irvine steadily approved himself and expected others to approve him rather looked down upon my wife and decidedly expected her to look up to him on the strength of his superior prudence  yet the strangest part of the whole matter was perhaps this that irvine was as beautiful as a statue  his features were in themselves perfect it was only his cloudy uncouth and coarse expression that disfigured them  so much strength residing in so spare a frame was proof sufficient of the accuracy of his shape he must have been built somewhat after the pattern of jack sheppard but the famous housebreaker we may be certain was no lout  it was by the extraordinary powers of his mind no less than by the vigour of his body that he broke his strong prison with such imperfect implements turning the very obstacles to service irvine in the same case would have sat down and spat and grumbled curses  he had the soul of a fat sheep but regarded as an artists model the exterior of a greek god  it was a cruel thought to persons less favoured in their birth that this creature endowedto use the language of theatreswith extraordinary means should so manage to misemploy them that he looked ugly and almost deformed  it was only by an effort of abstraction and after many days that you discovered what he was  by playing on the oafs conceit and standing closely over him we got a path made round the corner of the dump to our door so that we could come and go with decent ease and he even enjoyed the work for in that there were boulders to be plucked up bodily bushes to be uprooted and other occasions for athletic display but cutting wood was a different matter  anybody could cut wood and besides my wife was tired of supervising him and had other things to attend to  and in short days went by and irvine came daily and talked and lounged and spat but the firewood remained intact as sleepers on the platform or growing trees upon the mountainside  irvine as a woodcutter we could tolerate but irvine as a friend of the family at so much a day was too bald an imposition and at length on the afternoon of the fourth or fifth day of our connection i explained to him as clearly as i could the light in which i had grown to regard his presence  i pointed out to him that i could not continue to give him a salary for spitting on the floor and this expression which came after a good many others at last penetrated his obdurate wits  he rose at once and said if that was the way he was going to be spoke to he reckoned he would quit  and no one interposing he departed  so far so good  but we had no firewood  the next afternoon i strolled down to rufes and consulted him on the subject  it was a very droll interview in the large bare north room of the silverado hotel mrs hansons patchwork on a frame and rufe and his wife and i and the oaf himself all more or less embarrassed rufe announced there was nobody in the neighbourhood but irvine who could do a days work for anybody  irvine thereupon refused to have any more to do with my service he wouldnt work no more for a man as had spoke to hims i had done  i found myself on the point of the last humiliationdriven to beseech the creature whom i had just dismissed with insult  but i took the high hand in despair said there must be no talk of irvine coming back unless matters were to be differently managed that i would rather chop firewood for myself than be fooled and in short the hansons being eager for the lads hire i so imposed upon them with merely affected resolution that they ended by begging me to reemploy him again on a solemn promise that he should be more industrious  the promise i am bound to say was kept  we soon had a fine pile of firewood at our door and if caliban gave me the cold shoulder and spared me his conversation i thought none the worse of him for that nor did i find my days much longer for the deprivation  the leading spirit of the family was i am inclined to fancy mrs hanson  her social brilliancy somewhat dazzled the others and she had more of the small change of sense  it was she who faced kelmar for instance and perhaps if she had been alone kelmar would have had no rule within her doors  rufe to be sure had a fine sober openair attitude of mind seeing the world without exaggerationperhaps we may even say without enough for he lacked along with the others that commercial idealism which puts so high a value on time and money  sanity itself is a kind of convention  perhaps rufe was wrong but looking on life plainly he was unable to perceive that croquet or poker were in any way less important than for instance mending his waggon  even his own profession hunting was dear to him mainly as a sort of play even that he would have neglected had it not appealed to his imagination  his huntingsuit for instance had cost i should be afraid to say how many bucksthe currency in which he paid his way  it was all befringed after the indian fashion and it was dear to his heart  the pictorial side of his daily business was never forgotten  he was even anxious to stand for his picture in those buckskin hunting clothes and i remember how he once warmed almost into enthusiasm his dark blue eyes growing perceptibly larger as he planned the composition in which he should appear with the horns of some real big bucks and dogs and a camp on a crick creek stream  there was no trace in irvine of this woodland poetry  he did not care for hunting nor yet for buckskin suits  he had never observed scenery  the world as it appeared to him was almost obliterated by his own great grinning figure in the foreground caliban malvolio  and it seems to me as if in the persons of these brothersinlaw we had the two sides of rusticity fairly well represented  the hunter living really in nature the clodhopper living merely out of society  the one bent up in every corporal agent to capacity in one pursuit doing at least one thing keenly and thoughtfully and thoroughly alive to all that touches it the other in the inert and bestial state walking in a faint dream and taking so dim an impression of the myriad sides of life that he is truly conscious of nothing but himself  it is only in the fastnesses of nature forests mountains and the back of mans beyond that a creature endowed with five senses can grow up into the perfection of this crass and earthy vanity  in towns or the busier country sides he is roughly reminded of other mens existence and if he learns no more he learns at least to fear contempt  but irvine had come scatheless through life conscious only of himself of his great strength and intelligence and in the silence of the universe to which he did not listen dwelling with delight on the sound of his own thoughts    the sea fogs    a change in the colour of the light usually called me in the morning  by a certain hour the long vertical chinks in our western gable where the boards had shrunk and separated flashed suddenly into my eyes as stripes of dazzling blue at once so dark and splendid that i used to marvel how the qualities could be combined  at an earlier hour the heavens in that quarter were still quietly coloured but the shoulder of the mountain which shuts in the canyon already glowed with sunlight in a wonderful compound of gold and rose and green and this too would kindle although more mildly and with rainbow tints the fissures of our crazy gable  if i were sleeping heavily it was the bold blue that struck me awake if more lightly then i would come to myself in that earlier and fairier fight  one sunday morning about five the first brightness called me  i rose and turned to the east not for my devotions but for air the night had been very still  the little private gale that blew every evening in our canyon for ten minutes or perhaps a quarter of an hour had swiftly blown itself out in the hours that followed not a sigh of wind had shaken the treetops and our barrack for all its breaches was less fresh that morning than of wont  but i had no sooner reached the window than i forgot all else in the sight that met my eyes and i made but two bounds into my clothes and down the crazy plank to the platform  the sun was still concealed below the opposite hilltops though it was shining already not twenty feet above my head on our own mountain slope  but the scene beyond a few near features was entirely changed  napa valley was gone gone were all the lower slopes and woody foothills of the range and in their place not a thousand feet below me rolled a great level ocean  it was as though i had gone to bed the night before safe in a nook of inland mountains and had awakened in a bay upon the coast  i had seen these inundations from below at calistoga i had risen and gone abroad in the early morning coughing and sneezing under fathoms on fathoms of gray sea vapour like a cloudy skya dull sight for the artist and a painful experience for the invalid  but to sit aloft ones self in the pure air and under the unclouded dome of heaven and thus look down on the submergence of the valley was strangely different and even delightful to the eyes  far away were hilltops like little islands  nearer a smoky surf beat about the foot of precipices and poured into all the coves of these rough mountains  the colour of that fog ocean was a thing never to be forgotten  for an instant among the hebrides and just about sundown i have seen something like it on the sea itself  but the white was not so opaline nor was there what surprisingly increased the effect that breathless crystal stillness over all even in its gentlest moods the salt sea travails moaning among the weeds or lisping on the sand but that vast fog ocean lay in a trance of silence nor did the sweet air of the morning tremble with a sound  as i continued to sit upon the dump i began to observe that this sea was not so level as at first sight it appeared to be  away in the extreme south a little hill of fog arose against the sky above the general surface and as it had already caught the sun it shone on the horizon like the topsails of some giant ship  there were huge waves stationary as it seemed like waves in a frozen sea and yet as i looked again i was not sure but they were moving after all with a slow and august advance  and while i was yet doubting a promontory of the some four or five miles away conspicuous by a bouquet of tall pines was in a single instant overtaken and swallowed up  it reappeared in a little with its pines but this time as an islet and only to be swallowed up once more and then for good  this set me looking nearer and i saw that in every cove along the line of mountains the fog was being piled in higher and higher as though by some wind that was inaudible to me  i could trace its progress one pine tree first growing hazy and then disappearing after another although sometimes there was none of this forerunning haze but the whole opaque white ocean gave a start and swallowed a piece of mountain at a gulp  it was to flee these poisonous fogs that i had left the seaboard and climbed so high among the mountains  and now behold here came the fog to besiege me in my chosen altitudes and yet came so beautifully that my first thought was of welcome  the sun had now gotten much higher and through all the gaps of the hills it cast long bars of gold across that white ocean  an eagle or some other very great bird of the mountain came wheeling over the nearer pinetops and hung poised and something sideways as if to look abroad on that unwonted desolation spying perhaps with terror for the eyries of her comrades  then with a long cry she disappeared again towards lake county and the clearer air  at length it seemed to me as if the flood were beginning to subside the old landmarks by whose disappearance i had measured its advance here a crag there a brave pine tree now began in the inverse order to make their reappearance into daylight  i judged all danger of the fog was over  this was not noahs flood it was but a morning spring and would now drift out seaward whence it came  so mightily relieved and a good deal exhilarated by the sight i went into the house to light the fire  i suppose it was nearly seven when i once more mounted the platform to look abroad  the fog ocean had swelled up enormously since last i saw it and a few hundred feet below me in the deep gap where the toll house stands and the road runs through into lake county it had already topped the slope and was pouring over and down the other side like driving smoke  the wind had climbed along with it and though i was still in calm air i could see the trees tossing below me and their long strident sighing mounted to me where i stood  half an hour later the fog had surmounted all the ridge on the opposite side of the gap though a shoulder of the mountain still warded it out of our canyon  napa valley and its bounding hills were now utterly blotted out  the fog sunny white in the sunshine was pouring over into lake county in a huge ragged cataract tossing treetops appearing and disappearing in the spray the air struck with a little chill and set me coughing  it smelt strong of the fog like the smell of a washinghouse but with a shrewd tang of the sea salt  had it not been for two thingsthe sheltering spur which answered as a dyke and the great valley on the other side which rapidly engulfed whatever mountedour own little platform in the canyon must have been already buried a hundred feet in salt and poisonous air  as it was the interest of the scene entirely occupied our minds  we were set just out of the wind and but just above the fog we could listen to the voice of the one as to music on the stage we could plunge our eyes down into the other as into some flowing stream from over the parapet of a bridge thus we looked on upon a strange impetuous silent shifting exhibition of the powers of nature and saw the familiar landscape changing from moment to moment like figures in a dream  the imagination loves to trifle with what is not  had this been indeed the deluge i should have felt more strongly but the emotion would have been similar in kind  i played with the idea as the child flees in delighted terror from the creations of his fancy  the look of the thing helped me  and when at last i began to flee up the mountain it was indeed partly to escape from the raw air that kept me coughing but it was also part in play  as i ascended the mountainside i came once more to overlook the upper surface of the fog but it wore a different appearance from what i had beheld at daybreak  for first the sun now fell on it from high overhead and its surface shone and undulated like a great norland moor country sheeted with untrodden morning snow and next the new level must have been a thousand or fifteen hundred feet higher than the old so that only five or six points of all the broken country below me still stood out  napa valley was now one with sonoma on the west  on the hither side only a thin scattered fringe of bluffs was unsubmerged and through all the gaps the fog was pouring over like an ocean into the blue clear sunny country on the east  there it was soon lost for it fell instantly into the bottom of the valleys following the watershed and the hilltops in that quarter were still clear cut upon the eastern sky  through the toll house gap and over the near ridges on the other side the deluge was immense  a spray of thin vapour was thrown high above it rising and falling and blown into fantastic shapes the speed of its course was like a mountain torrent  here and there a few treetops were discovered and then whelmed again and for one second the bough of a dead pine beckoned out of the spray like the arm of a drowning man  but still the imagination was dissatisfied still the ear waited for something more  had this indeed been water as it seemed so to the eye with what a plunge of reverberating thunder would it have rolled upon its course disembowelling mountains and deracinating pines  and yet water it was and seawater at thattrue pacific billows only somewhat rarefied rolling in mid air among the hilltops  i climbed still higher among the red rattling gravel and dwarf underwood of mount saint helena until i could look right down upon silverado and admire the favoured nook in which it lay  the sunny plain of fog was several hundred feet higher behind the protecting spur a gigantic accumulation of cottony vapour threatened with every second to blow over and submerge our homestead but the vortex setting past the toll house was too strong and there lay our little platform in the arms of the deluge but still enjoying its unbroken sunshine  about eleven however thin spray came flying over the friendly buttress and i began to think the fog had hunted out its jonah after all  but it was the last effort  the wind veered while we were at dinner and began to blow squally from the mountain summit and by halfpast one all that world of sea fogs was utterly routed and flying here and there into the south in little rags of cloud  and instead of a lone seabeach we found ourselves once more inhabiting a high mountainside with the clear green country far below us and the light smoke of calistoga blowing in the air  this was the great russian campaign for that season  now and then in the early morning a little white lakelet of fog would be seen far down in napa valley but the heights were not again assailed nor was the surrounding world again shut off from silverado    the toll house    the toll house standing alone by the wayside under nodding pines with its streamlet and watertank its backwoods tollbar and well trodden croquet ground the ostler standing by the stable door chewing a straw a glimpse of the chinese cook in the back parts and mr hoddy in the bar gravely alert and serviceable and equally anxious to lend or borrow booksdozed all day in the dusty sunshine more than half asleep  there were no neighbours except the hansons up the hill  the traffic on the road was infinitesimal only at rare intervals a couple in a waggon or a dusty farmer on a springboard toiling over the grade to that metropolitan hamlet calistoga and at the fixed hours the passage of the stages  the nearest building was the schoolhouse down the road and the schoolmaam boarded at the toll house walking thence in the morning to the little brown shanty where she taught the young ones of the district and returning thither pretty weary in the afternoon  she had chosen this outlying situation i understood for her health  mr corwin was consumptive so was rufe so was mr jennings the engineer  in short the place was a kind of small davos  consumptive folk consorting on a hilltop in the most unbroken idleness  jennings never did anything that i could see except now and then to fish and generally to sit about in the bar and the verandah waiting for something to happen  corwin and rufe did as little as possible and if the schoolmaam poor lady had to work pretty hard all morning she subsided when it was over into much the same dazed beatitude as all the rest  her special corner was the parloura very genteel room with bible prints a crayon portrait of mrs corwin in the height of fashion a few years ago another of her son mr corwin was not represented a mirror and a selection of dried grasses  a large book was laid religiously on the tablefrom palace to hovel i believe its namefull of the raciest experiences in england  the author had mingled freely with all classes the nobility particularly meeting him with open arms and i must say that traveller had ill requited his reception  his book in short was a capital instance of the penny messalina school of literature and there arose from it in that cool parlour in that silent wayside mountain inn a rank atmosphere of gold and blood and jenkins and the mysteries of london and sickening inverted snobbery fit to knock you down  the mention of this book reminds me of another and far racier picture of our island life  the latter parts of rocambole are surely too sparingly consulted in the country which they celebrate  no mans education can be said to be complete nor can he pronounce the world yet emptied of enjoyment till he has made the acquaintance of the reverend patterson director of the evangelical society  to follow the evolutions of that reverend gentleman who goes through scenes in which even mr duffield would hesitate to place a bishop is to rise to new ideas but alas there was no patterson about the toll house  only alongside of from palace to hovel a sixpenny ouida figured so literature you see was not unrepresented  the schoolmaam had friends to stay with her other schoolmaams enjoying their holidays quite a bevy of damsels  they seemed never to go out or not beyond the verandah but sat close in the little parlour quietly talking or listening to the wind among the trees  sleep dwelt in the toll house like a fixture  summer sleep shallow soft and dreamless  a cuckooclock a great rarity in such a place hooted at intervals about the echoing house and mr jenning would open his eyes for a moment in the bar and turn the leaf of a newspaper and the resting schoolmaams in the parlour would be recalled to the consciousness of their inaction  busy mrs corwin and her busy chinaman might be heard indeed in the penetralia pounding dough or rattling dishes or perhaps rufe had called up some of the sleepers for a game of croquet and the hollow strokes of the mallet sounded far away among the woods  but with these exceptions it was sleep and sunshine and dust and the wind in the pine trees all day long  a little before stage time that castle of indolence awoke  the ostler threw his straw away and set to his preparations  mr jennings rubbed his eyes happy mr jennings the something he had been waiting for all day about to happen at last  the boarders gathered in the verandah silently giving ear and gazing down the road with shaded eyes  and as yet there was no sign for the senses not a sound not a tremor of the mountain road  the birds to whom the secret of the hooting cuckoo is unknown must have set down to instinct this premonitory bustle  and then the first of the two stages swooped upon the toll house with a roar and in a cloud of dust and the shock had not yet time to subside before the second was abreast of it  huge concerns they were wellhorsed and loaded the men in their shirtsleeves the women swathed in veils the long whip cracking like a pistol and as they charged upon that slumbering hostelry each shepherding a dust storm the dead place blossomed into life and talk and clatter  this the toll housewith its city throng its jostling shoulders its infinity of instant business in the bar  the mind would not receive it  the heartfelt bustle of that hour is hardly credible the thrill of the great shower of letters from the post bag the childish hope and interest with which one gazed in all these strangers eyes  they paused there but to pass  the blue clad chinaboy the san francisco magnate the mystery in the dust coat the secret memoirs in tweed the ogling wellshod lady with her troop of girls they did but flash and go they were hulldown for us behind lifes ocean and we but hailed their topsails on the line  yet out of our great solitude of four and twenty mountain hours we thrilled to their momentary presence gauged and divined them loved and hated and stood lightheaded in that storm of human electricity  yes like piccadilly circus this is also one of lifes crossingplaces  here i beheld one man already famous or infamous a centre of pistolshots  and another who if not yet known to rumour will fill a column of the sunday paper when he comes to hanga burly thickset powerful chinese desperado six long bristles upon either lip redolent of whiskey playing cards and pistols swaggering in the bar with the lowest assumption of the lowest european manners rapping out blackguard english oaths in his canorous oriental voice and combining in one person the depravities of two races and two civilizations  for all his lust and vigour he seemed to look cold upon me from the valley of the shadow of the gallows  he imagined a vain thing and while he drained his cocktail holbeins death was at his elbow  once too i fell in talk with another of these flitting strangerslike the rest in his shirtsleeves and all begrimed with dustand the next minute we were discussing paris and london theatres and wines  to him journeying from one human place to another this was a trifle but to me  no mr lillie i have not forgotten it  and presently the citytide was at its flood and began to ebb life runs in piccadilly circus say from nine to one and then there also ebbs into the small hours of the echoing policeman and the lamps and stars  but the toll house is far up stream and near its rural springs the bubble of the tide but touches it  before you had yet grasped your pleasure the horses were put to the loud whips volleyed and the tide was gone  north and south had the two stages vanished the towering dust subsided in the woods but there was still an interval before the flush had fallen on your cheeks before the ear became once more contented with the silence or the seven sleepers of the toll house dozed back to their accustomed corners  yet a little and the ostler would swing round the great barrier across the road and in the golden evening that dreamy inn begin to trim its lamps and spread the board for supper  as i recall the placethe green dell below the spires of pine the sunwarm scented air that gray gabled inn with its faint stirrings of life amid the slumber of the mountainsi slowly awake to a sense of admiration gratitude and almost love  a fine place after all for a wasted life to doze away inthe cuckoo clock hooting of its far home country the croquet mallets eloquent of english lawns the stages daily bringing news ofthe turbulent world away below there and perhaps once in the summer a salt fog pouring overhead with its tale of the pacific    a starry drive    in our rule at silverado there was a melancholy interregnum  the queen and the crown prince with one accord fell sick and as i was sick to begin with our lone position on mount saint helena was no longer tenable and we had to hurry back to calistoga and a cottage on the green  by that time we had begun to realize the difficulties of our position  we had found what an amount of labour it cost to support life in our red canyon and it was the dearest desire of our hearts to get a chinaboy to go along with us when we returned  we could have given him a whole house to himself selfcontained as they say in the advertisements and on the money question we were prepared to go far  kong sam kee the calistoga washerman was entrusted with the affair and from day to day it languished on with protestations on our part and mellifluous excuses on the part of kong sam kee  at length about halfpast eight of our last evening with the waggon ready harnessed to convey us up the grade the washerman with a somewhat sneering air produced the boy  he was a handsome gentlemanly lad attired in rich dark blue and shod with snowy white but alas he had heard rumours of silverado  he know it for a lone place on the mountainside with no friendly washhouse near by where he might smoke a pipe of opium o nights with other chinaboys and lose his little earnings at the game of tan and he first backed out for more money and then when that demand was satisfied refused to come pointblank  he was wedded to his wash houses he had no taste for the rural life and we must go to our mountain servantless  it must have been near half an hour before we reached that conclusion standing in the midst of calistoga high street under the stars and the chinaboy and kong sam kee singing their pigeon english in the sweetest voices and with the most musical inflections  we were not however to return alone for we brought with us joe strong the painter a most goodnatured comrade and a capital hand at an omelette  i do not know in which capacity he was most valuedas a cook or a companion and he did excellently well in both  the kong sam kee negotiation had delayed us unduly it must have been halfpast nine before we left calistoga and night came fully ere we struck the bottom of the grade  i have never seen such a night  it seemed to throw calumny in the teeth of all the painters that ever dabbled in starlight  the sky itself was of a ruddy powerful nameless changing colour dark and glossy like a serpents back  the stars by innumerable millions stuck boldly forth like lamps  the milky way was bright like a moonlit cloud half heaven seemed milky way  the greater luminaries shone each more clearly than a winters moon  their light was dyed in every sort of colourred like fire blue like steel green like the tracks of sunset and so sharply did each stand forth in its own lustre that there was no appearance of that flat starspangled arch we know so well in pictures but all the hollow of heaven was one chaos of contesting luminariesa hurryburly of stars against this the hills and rugged treetops stood out redly dark  as we continued to advance the lesser lights and milky ways first grew pale and then vanished the countless hosts of heaven dwindled in number by successive millions those that still shone had tempered their exceeding brightness and fallen back into their customary wistful distance and the sky declined from its first bewildering splendour into the appearance of a common night slowly this change proceeded and still there was no sign of any cause  then a whiteness like mist was thrown over the spurs of the mountain  yet a while and as we turned a corner a great leap of silver light and net of forest shadows fell across the road and upon our wondering waggonful and swimming low among the trees we beheld a strange misshapen waning moon halftilted on her back  where are ye when the moon appears so the old poet sang half taunting to the stars bent upon a courtly purpose   as the sunlight round the dim earths midnight tower of shadow pours streaming past the dim wide portals viewless to the eyes of mortals till it floods the moons pale islet or the mornings golden shores   so sings mr trowbridge with a noble inspiration  and so had the sunlight flooded that pale islet of the moon and her lit face put out one after another that galaxy of stars  the wonder of the drive was over but by some nice conjunction of clearness in the air and fit shadow in the valley where we travelled we had seen for a little while that brave display of the midnight heavens  it was gone but it had been nor shall i ever again behold the stars with the same mind  he who has seen the sea commoved with a great hurricane thinks of it very differently from him who has seen it only in a calm  and the difference between a calm and a hurricane is not greatly more striking than that between the ordinary face of night and the splendour that shone upon us in that drive  two in our waggon knew night as she shines upon the tropics but even that bore no comparison  the nameless colour of the sky the hues of the starfire and the incredible projection of the stars themselves starting from their orbits so that the eye seemed to distinguish their positions in the hollow of spacethese were things that we had never seen before and shall never see again  meanwhile in this altered night we proceeded on our way among the scents and silence of the forest reached the top of the grade wound up by hansons and came at last to a stand under the flying gargoyle of the chute  sam who had been lying back fast asleep with the moon on his face got down with the remark that it was pleasant to be home  the waggon turned and drove away the noise gently dying in the woods and we clambered up the rough path calibans great feat of engineering and came home to silverado  the moon shone in at the eastern doors and windows and over the lumber on the platform  the one tall pine beside the ledge was steeped in silver  away up the canyon a wild cat welcomed us with three discordant squalls  but once we had lit a candle and began to review our improvements homely in either sense and count our stores it was wonderful what a feeling of possession and permanence grow up in the hearts of the lords of silverado  a bed had still to be made up for strong and the mornings water to be fetched with clinking pail and as we set about these household duties and showed off our wealth and conveniences before the stranger and had a glass of wine i think in honour of our return and trooped at length one after another up the flying bridge of plank and lay down to sleep in our shattered moon pierced barrack we were among the happiest sovereigns in the world and certainly ruled over the most contented people  yet in our absence the palace had been sacked  wild cats so the hansons said had broken in and carried off a side of bacon a hatchet and two knives    episodes in the story of a mine    no one could live at silverado and not be curious about the story of the mine  we were surrounded by so many evidences of expense and toil we lived so entirely in the wreck of that great enterprise like mites in the ruins of a cheese that the idea of the old din and bustle haunted our repose  our own house the forge the dump the chutes the rails the windlass the mass of broken plant the two tunnels one far below in the green dell the other on the platform where we kept our wine the deep shaft with the sunglints and the waterdrops above all the ledge that great gaping slice out of the mountain shoulder propped apart by wooden wedges on whose immediate margin high above our heads the one tall pine precariously noddedthese stood for its greatness while the doghutch bootjacks old boots old tavern bills and the very beds that we inherited from bygone miners put in human touches and realized for us the story of the past  i have sat on an old sleeper under the thick madronas near the forge with just a look over the dump on the green world below and seen the sun lying broad among the wreck and heard the silence broken only by the tinkling water in the shaft or a stir of the royal family about the battered palace and my mind has gone back to the epoch of the stanleys and the chapmans with a grand tutti of pick and drill hammer and anvil echoing about the canyon the assayer hard at it in our diningroom the carts below on the road and their cargo of red mineral bounding and thundering down the iron chute  and now all goneall fallen away into this sunny silence and desertion  a family of squatters dining in the assayers office making their beds in the big sleeping room erstwhile so crowded keeping their wine in the tunnel that once rang with picks  but silverado itself although now fallen in its turn into decay was once but a mushroom and had succeeded to other mines and other flitting cities  twenty years ago away down the glen on the lake county side there was a place jonestown by name with two thousand inhabitants dwelling under canvas and one roofed house for the sale of whiskey  round on the western side of mount saint helena there was at the same date a second large encampment its name if it ever had one lost for me  both of these have perished leaving not a stick and scarce a memory behind them  tide after tide of hopeful miners have thus flowed and ebbed about the mountain coming and going now by lone prospectors now with a rush  last in order of time came silverado reared the big mill in the valley founded the town which is now represented monumentally by hansons pierced all these slaps and shafts and tunnels and in turn declined and died away   our noisy years seem moments in the wake of the eternal silence   as to the success of silverado in its time of being two reports were current  according to the first six hundred thousand dollars were taken out of that great upright seam that still hung open above us on crazy wedges  then the ledge pinched out and there followed in quest of the remainder a great drifting and tunnelling in all directions and a great consequent effusion of dollars until all parties being sick of the expense the mine was deserted and the town decamped  according to the second version told me with much secrecy of manner the whole affair mine mill and town were parts of one majestic swindle  there had never come any silver out of any portion of the mine there was no silver to come  at midnight trains of packhorses might have been observed winding by devious tracks about the shoulder of the mountain  they came from far away from amador or placer laden with silver in old cigar boxes  they discharged their load at silverado in the hour of sleep and before the morning they were gone again with their mysterious drivers to their unknown source  in this way twenty thousand pounds worth of silver was smuggled in under cover of night in these old cigar boxes mixed with silverado mineral carted down to the mill crushed amalgated and refined and despatched to the city as the proper product of the mine  stock jobbing if it can cover such expenses must be a profitable business in san francisco  i give these two versions as i got them  but i place little reliance on either my belief in history having been greatly shaken  for it chanced that i had come to dwell in silverado at a critical hour great events in its history were about to happen did happen as i am led to believe nay and it will be seen that i played a part in that revolution myself  and yet from first to last i never had a glimmer of an idea what was going on and even now after full reflection profess myself at sea  that there was some obscure intrigue of the cigarbox order and that i in the character of a wooden puppet set pen to paper in the interest of somebody so much and no more is certain  silverado then under my immediate sway belonged to one whom i will call a mr ronalds  i only knew him through the extraordinarily distorting medium of local gossip now as a momentous jobber now as a dupe to point an adage and again and much more probably as an ordinary christian gentleman like you or me who had opened a mine and worked it for a while with better and worse fortune  so through a defective windowpane you may see the passerby shoot up into a hunchbacked giant or dwindle into a potbellied dwarf  to ronalds at least the mine belonged but the notice by which he held it would ran out upon the 30th of juneor rather as i suppose it had run out already and the month of grace would expire upon that day after which any american citizen might post a notice of his own and make silverado his  this with a sort of quiet slyness rufe told me at an early period of our acquaintance there was no silver of course the mine wasnt worth nothing mr stevens but there was a deal of old iron and wood around and to gain possession of this old wood and iron and get a right to the water rufe proposed if i had no objections to jump the claim  of course i had no objection  but i was filled with wonder  if all he wanted was the wood and iron what in the name of fortune was to prevent him taking them  his right there was none to dispute  he might lay hands on all tomorrow as the wild cats had laid hands upon our knives and hatchet  besides was this mass of heavy mining plant worth transportation  if it was why had not the rightful owners carted it away  if it was would they not preserve their title to these movables even after they had lost their title to the mine  and if it were not what the better was rufe  nothing would grow at silverado there was even no wood to cut beyond a sense of property there was nothing to be gained lastly was it at all credible that ronalds would forget what rufe remembered  the days of grace were not yet over  any fine morning he might appear paper in hand and enter for another year on his inheritance  however it was none of my business all seemed legal rufe or ronalds all was one to me  on the morning of the 27th mrs hanson appeared with the milk as usual in her sunbonnet  the time would be out on tuesday she reminded us and bade me be in readiness to play my part though i had no idea what it was to be  and suppose ronalds came we asked she received the idea with derision laughing aloud with all her fine teeth  he could not find the mine to save his life it appeared without rufe to guide him  last year when he came they heard him up and down the road a hollerin and a raisin cain and at last he had to come to the hansons in despair and bid rufe jump into your pants and shoes and show me where this old mine is anyway  seeing that ronalds had laid out so much money in the spot and that a beaten road led right up to the bottom of the clump i thought this a remarkable example  the sense of locality must be singularly in abeyance in the case of ronalds  that same evening supper comfortably over joe strong busy at work on a drawing of the dump and the opposite hills we were all out on the platform together sitting there under the tented heavens with the same sense of privacy as if we had been cabined in a parlour when the sound of brisk footsteps came mounting up the path  we pricked our ears at this for the tread seemed lighter and firmer than was usual with our country neighbours  and presently sure enough two town gentlemen with cigars and kid gloves came debauching past the house  they looked in that place like a blasphemy  good evening they said  for none of us had stirred we all sat stiff with wonder  good evening i returned and then to put them at their ease a stiff climb i added  yes replied the leader but we have to thank you for this path  i did not like the mans tone  none of us liked it  he did not seem embarrassed by the meeting but threw us his remarks like favours and strode magisterially by us towards the shaft and tunnel  presently we heard his voice raised to his companion  we drifted every sort of way but couldnt strike the ledge  then again it pinched out here  and once more  every minor that ever worked upon it says theres bound to be a ledge somewhere  these were the snatches of his talk that reached us and they had a damning significance  we the lords of silverado had come face to face with our superior  it is the worst of all quaint and of all cheap ways of life that they bring us at last to the pinch of some humiliation  i liked well enough to be a squatter when there was none but hanson by before ronalds i will own i somewhat quailed i hastened to do him fealty said i gathered he was the squattee and apologized  he threatened me with ejection in a manner grimly pleasantmore pleasant to him i fancy than to me and then he passed off into praises of the former state of silverado  it was the busiest little mining town you ever saw a population of between a thousand and fifteen hundred souls the engine in full blast the mill newly erected nothing going but champagne and hope the order of the day  ninety thousand dollars came out a hundred and forty thousand were put in making a net loss of fifty thousand  the last days i gathered the days of john stanley were not so bright the champagne had ceased to flow the population was already moving elsewhere and silverado had begun to wither in the branch before it was cut at the root  the last shot that was fired knocked over the stove chimney and made that hole in the roof of our barrack through which the sun was wont to visit slugabeds towards afternoon  a noisy last shot to inaugurate the days of silence  throughout this interview my conscience was a good deal exercised and i was moved to throw myself on my knees and own the intended treachery  but then i had hanson to consider  i was in much the same position as old rowley that royal humourist whom the rogue had taken into his confidence  and again here was ronalds on the spot  he must know the day of the month as well as hanson and i if a broad hint were necessary he had the broadest in the world for a large board had been nailed by the crown prince on the very front of our house between the door and window painted in cinnabarthe pigment of the countrywith doggrel rhymes and contumelious pictures and announcing in terms unnecessarily figurative that the trick was already played the claim already jumped and master sam the legitimate successor of mr ronalds but no nothing could save that man quem deus vult perdere prius dementat  as he came so he went and left his rights depending  late at night by silverado reckoning and after we were all abed mrs hanson returned to give us the newest of her news  it was like a scene in a ships steerage  all of us abed in our different tiers the single candle struggling with the darkness and this plump handsome woman seated on an upturned valise beside the bunks talking and showing her fine teeth and laughing till the rafters rang  any ship to be sure with a hundredth part as many holes in it as our barrack must long ago have gone to her last port  up to that time i had always imagined mrs hansons loquacity to be mere incontinence that she said what was uppermost for the pleasure of speaking and laughed and laughed again as a kind of musical accompaniment  but i now found there was an art in it i found it less communicative than silence itself  i wished to know why ronalds had come how he had found his way without rufe and why being on the spot he had not refreshed his title  she talked interminably on but her replies were never answers  she fled under a cloud of words and when i had made sure that she was purposely eluding me i dropped the subject in my turn and let her rattle where she would  she had come to tell us that instead of waiting for tuesday the claim was to be jumped on the morrow  how  if the time were not out it was impossible  why  if ronalds had come and gone and done nothing there was the less cause for hurry  but again i could reach no satisfaction  the claim was to be jumped next morning that was all that she would condescend upon  and yet it was not jumped the next morning nor yet the next and a whole week had come and gone before we heard more of this exploit that day week however a day of great heat hanson with a little roll of paper in his hand and the eternal pipe alight breedlove his large dull friend to act i suppose as witness mrs hanson in her sunday best and all the children from the oldest to the youngestarrived in a procession tailing one behind another up the path  caliban was absent but he had been chary of his friendly visits since the row and with that exception the whole family was gathered together as for a marriage or a christening strong was sitting at work in the shade of the dwarf madronas near the forge and they planted themselves about him in a circle one on a stone another on the waggon rails a third on a piece of plank  gradually the children stole away up the canyon to where there was another chute somewhat smaller than the one across the dump and down this chute for the rest of the afternoon they poured one avalanche of stones after another waking the echoes of the glen  meantime we elders sat together on the platform hanson and his friend smoking in silence like indian sachems mrs hanson rattling on as usual with an adroit volubility saying nothing but keeping the party at their ease like a courtly hostess  not a word occurred about the business of the day  once twice and thrice i tried to slide the subject in but was discouraged by the stoic apathy of rufe and beaten down before the pouring verbiage of his wife  there is nothing of the indian brave about me and i began to grill with impatience  at last like a highway robber i cornered hanson and bade him stand and deliver his business  thereupon he gravely rose as though to hint that this was not a proper place nor the subject one suitable for squaws and i following his example led him up the plank into our barrack  there he bestowed himself on a box and unrolled his papers with fastidious deliberation  there were two sheets of notepaper and an old mining notice dated may 30th 1879 part print part manuscript and the latter much obliterated by the rains  it was by this identical piece of paper that the mine had been held last year  for thirteen months it had endured the weather and the change of seasons on a cairn behind the shoulder of the canyon and it was now my business spreading it before me on the table and sitting on a valise to copy its terms with some necessary changes twice over on the two sheets of notepaper  one was then to be placed on the same cairna mound of rocks the notice put it and the other to be lodged for registration  rufe watched me silently smoking till i came to the place for the locators name at the end of the first copy and when i proposed that he should sign i thought i saw a scare in his eye  i dont think thatll be necessary he said slowly just you write it down  perhaps this mighty hunter who was the most active member of the local school board could not write  there would be nothing strange in that  the constable of calistoga is and has been for years a bedridden man and if i remember rightly blind  he had more need of the emoluments than another it was explained and it was easy for him to depytize with a strong accent on the last so friendly and so free are popular institutions  when i had done my scrivening hanson strolled out and addressed breedlove will you step up here a bit and after they had disappeared a little while into the chaparral and madrona thicket they came back again minus a notice and the deed was done  the claim was jumped a tract of mountainside fifteen hundred feet long by six hundred wide with all the earths precious bowels had passed from ronalds to hanson and in the passage changed its name from the mammoth to the calistoga  i had tried to get rufe to call it after his wife after himself and after garfield the republican presidential candidate of the hoursince then elected and alas deadbut all was in vain  the claim had once been called the calistoga before and he seemed to feel safety in returning to that  and so the history of that mine became once more plunged in darkness lit only by some monster pyrotechnical displays of gossip  and perhaps the most curious feature of the whole matter is this  that we should have dwelt in this quiet corner of the mountains with not a dozen neighbours and yet struggled all the while like desperate swimmers in this sea of falsities and contradictions  wherever a man is there will be a lie    toils and pleasures    i must try to convey some notion of our life of how the days passed and what pleasure we took in them of what there was to do and how we set about doing it in our mountain hermitage  the house after we had repaired the worst of the damages and filled in some of the doors and windows with white cotton cloth became a healthy and a pleasant dwellingplace always airy and dry and haunted by the outdoor perfumes of the glen  within it had the look of habitation the human look  you had only to go into the third room which we did not use and see its stones its sifting earth its tumbled litter and then return to our lodging with the beds made the plates on the rack the pail of bright water behind the door the stove crackling in a corner and perhaps the table roughly laid against a mealand mans order the little clean spots that he creates to dwell in were at once contrasted with the rich passivity of nature  and yet our house was everywhere so wrecked and shattered the air came and went so freely the sun found so many portholes the golden outdoor glow shone in so many open chinks that we enjoyed at the same time some of the comforts of a roof and much of the gaiety and brightness of al fresco life  a single shower of rain to be sure and we should have been drowned out like mice  but ours was a californian summer and an earthquake was a far likelier accident than a shower of rain  trustful in this fine weather we kept the house for kitchen and bedroom and used the platform as our summer parlour  the sense of privacy as i have said already was complete  we could look over the clump on miles of forest and rough hilltop our eyes commanded some of napa valley where the train ran and the little country townships sat so close together along the line of the rail  but here there was no man to intrude  none but the hansons were our visitors  even they came but at long intervals or twice daily at a stated hour with milk  so our days as they were never interrupted drew out to the greater length hour melted insensibly into hour the household duties though they were many and some of them laborious dwindled into mere islets of business in a sea of sunny daytime and it appears to me looking back as though the far greater part of our life at silverado had been passed propped upon an elbow or seated on a plank listening to the silence that there is among the hills  my work it is true was over early in the morning  i rose before any one else lit the stove put on the water to boil and strolled forth upon the platform to wait till it was ready  silverado would then be still in shadow the sun shining on the mountain higher up a clean smell of trees a smell of the earth at morning hung in the air  regularly every day there was a single bird not singing but awkwardly chirruping among the green madronas and the sound was cheerful natural and stirring  it did not hold the attention nor interrupt the thread of meditation like a blackbird or a nightingale it was mere woodland prattle of which the mind was conscious like a perfume  the freshness of these morning seasons remained with me far on into the day  as soon as the kettle boiled i made porridge and coffee and that beyond the literal drawing of water and the preparation of kindling which it would be hyperbolical to call the hewing of wood ended my domestic duties for the day  thenceforth my wife laboured singlehanded in the palace and i lay or wandered on the platform at my own sweet will  the little corner near the forge where we found a refuge under the madronas from the unsparing early sun is indeed connected in my mind with some nightmare encounters over euclid and the latin grammar  these were known as sams lessons  he was supposed to be the victim and the sufferer but here there must have been some misconception for whereas i generally retired to bed after one of these engagements he was no sooner set free than he dashed up to the chinamans house where he had installed a printing press that great element of civilization and the sound of his labours would be faintly audible about the canyon half the day  to walk at all was a laborious business the foot sank and slid the boots were cut to pieces among sharp uneven rolling stones when we crossed the platform in any direction it was usual to lay a course following as much as possible the line of waggon rails thus if water were to be drawn the watercarrier left the house along some tilting planks that we had laid down and not laid down very well  these carried him to that great highroad the railway and the railway served him as far as to the head of the shaft  but from thence to the spring and back again he made the best of his unaided way staggering among the stones and wading in low growth of the calcanthus where the rattlesnakes lay hissing at his passage  yet i liked to draw water  it was pleasant to dip the gray metal pail into the clean colourless cool water pleasant to carry it back with the water ripping at the edge and a broken sunbeam quivering in the midst  but the extreme roughness of the walking confined us in common practice to the platform and indeed to those parts of it that were most easily accessible along the line of rails  the rails came straight forward from the shaft here and there overgrown with little green bushes but still entire and still carrying a truck which it was sams delight to trundle to and fro by the hour with various ladings  about midway down the platform the railroad trended to the right leaving our house and coasting along the far side within a few yards of the madronas and the forge and not far of the latter ended in a sort of platform on the edge of the dump there in old days the trucks were tipped and their load sent thundering down the chute  there besides was the only spot where we could approach the margin of the dump  anywhere else you took your life in your right hand when you came within a yard and a half to peer over  for at any moment the dump might begin to slide and carry you down and bury you below its ruins  indeed the neighbourhood of an old mine is a place beset with dangers  for as still as silverado was at any moment the report of rotten wood might tell us that the platform had fallen into the shaft the dump might begin to pour into the road below or a wedge slip in the great upright seam and hundreds of tons of mountain bury the scene of our encampment  i have already compared the dump to a rampart built certainly by some rude people and for prehistoric wars  it was likewise a frontier  all below was green and woodland the tall pines soaring one above another each with a firm outline and full spread of bough  all above was arid rocky and bald  the great spout of broken mineral that had dammed the canyon up was a creature of mans handiwork its material dug out with a pick and powder and spread by the service of the tracks  but nature herself in that upper district seemed to have had an eye to nothing besides mining and even the natural hillside was all sliding gravel and precarious boulder  close at the margin of the well leaves would decay to skeletons and mummies which at length some stronger gust would carry clear of the canyon and scatter in the subjacent woods even moisture and decaying vegetable matter could not with all natures alchemy concoct enough soil to nourish a few poor grasses  it is the same they say in the neighbourhood of all silver mines the nature of that precious rock being stubborn with quartz and poisonous with cinnabar  both were plenty in our silverado  the stones sparkled white in the sunshine with quartz they were all stained red with cinnabar  here doubtless came the indians of yore to paint their faces for the warpath and cinnabar if i remember rightly was one of the few articles of indian commerce  now sam had it in his undisturbed possession to pound down and slake and paint his rude designs with  but to me it had always a fine flavour of poetry compounded out of indian story and hawthorndens allusion   desire alas i desire a zeuxis new from indies borrowing gold from eastern skies most bright cinoper      yet this is but half the picture our silverado platform has another side to it  though there was no soil and scarce a blade of grass yet out of these tumbled gravelheaps and broken boulders a flower garden bloomed as at home in a conservatory calcanthus crept like a hardy weed all over our rough parlour choking the railway and pushing forth its rusty aromatic cones from between two blocks of shattered mineral  azaleas made a big snowbed just above the well  the shoulder of the hill waved white with mediterranean heath  in the crannies of the ledge and about the spurs of the tall pine a red flowering stoneplant hung in clusters  even the low thorny chaparral was thick with pealike blossom  close at the foot of our path nutmegs prospered delightful to the sight and smell  at sunrise and again late at night the scent of the sweet bay trees filled the canyon and the downblowing night wind must have borne it hundreds of feet into the outer air  all this vegetation to be sure was stunted  the madrona was here no bigger than the manzanita the bay was but a stripling shrub the very pines with four or five exceptions in all our upper canyon were not so tall as myself or but a little taller and the most of them came lower than my waist  for a prosperous forest tree we must look below where the glen was crowded with green spires  but for flowers and ravishing perfume we had none to envy  our heap of roadmetal was thick with bloom like a hawthorn in the front of june our red baking angle in the mountain a laboratory of poignant scents  it was an endless wonder to my mind as i dreamed about the platform following the progress of the shadows where the madrona with its leaves the azalea and calcanthus with their blossoms could find moisture to support such thick wet waxy growths or the bay tree collect the ingredients of its perfume  but there they all grew together healthy happy and happymaking as though rooted in a fathom of black soil  nor was it only vegetable life that prospered  we had indeed few birds and none that had much of a voice or anything worthy to be called a song  my morning comrade had a thin chirp unmusical and monotonous but friendly and pleasant to hear  he had but one rival  a fellow with an ostentatious cry of near an octave descending not one note of which properly followed another  this is the only bird i ever knew with a wrong ear but there was something enthralling about his performance  you listened and listened thinking each time he must surely get it right but no it was always wrong and always wrong the same way  yet he seemed proud of his song delivered it with execution and a manner of his own and was charming to his mate  a very incorrect incessant human whistler had thus a chance of knowing how his own music pleased the world  two great birdseagles we thoughtdwelt at the top of the canyon among the crags that were printed on the sky  now and again but very rarely they wheeled high over our heads in silence or with a distant dying scream and then with a fresh impulse winged fleetly forward dipped over a hilltop and were gone  they seemed solemn and ancient things sailing the blue air  perhaps cooeval with the mountain where they haunted perhaps emigrants from rome where the glad legions may have shouted to behold them on the morn of battle  but if birds were rare the place abounded with rattlesnakesthe rattlesnakes nest it might have been named  wherever we brushed among the bushes our passage woke their angry buzz  one dwelt habitually in the woodpile and sometimes when we came for firewood thrust up his small head between two logs and hissed at the intrusion  the rattle has a legendary credit it is said to be aweinspiring and once heard to stamp itself for ever in the memory  but the sound is not at all alarming the hum of many insects and the buzz of the wasp convince the ear of danger quite as readily  as a matter of fact we lived for weeks in silverado coming and going with rattles sprung on every side and it never occurred to us to be afraid  i used to take sunbaths and do calisthenics in a certain pleasant nook among azalea and calcanthus the rattles whizzing on every side like spinning wheels and the combined hiss or buzz rising louder and angrier at any sudden movement but i was never in the least impressed nor ever attacked  it was only towards the end of our stay that a man down at calistoga who was expatiating on the terrifying nature of the sound gave me at last a very good imitation and it burst on me at once that we dwelt in the very metropolis of deadly snakes and that the rattle was simply the commonest noise in silverado immediately on our return we attacked the hansons on the subject they had formerly assured us that our canyon was favoured like ireland with an entire immunity from poisonous reptiles but with the perfect inconsequence of the natural man they were no sooner found out than they went off at score in the contrary direction and we were told that in no part of the world did rattlesnakes attain to such a monstrous bigness as among the warm flowerdotted rocks of silverado  this is a contribution rather to the natural history of the hansons than to that of snakes  one person however better served by his instinct had known the rattle from the first and that was chuchu the dog  no rational creature has ever led an existence more poisoned by terror than that dogs at silverado  every whiz of the rattle made him bound his eyes rolled he trembled he would be often wet with sweat one of our great mysteries was his terror of the mountain  a little away above our nook the azaleas and almost all the vegetation ceased  dwarf pines not big enough to be christmas trees grew thinly among loose stone and gravel scaurs  here and there a big boulder sat quiescent on a knoll having paused there till the next rain in his long slide down the mountain  there was here no ambuscade for the snakes you could see clearly where you trod and yet the higher i went the more abject and appealing became chuchus terror  he was an excellent master of that composite language in which dogs communicate with men and he would assure me on his honour that there was some peril on the mountain appeal to me by all that i held holy to turn back and at length finding all was in vain and that i still persisted ignorantly foolhardy he would suddenly whip round and make a bee line down the slope for silverado the gravel showering after him what was he afraid of  there were admittedly brown bears and california lions on the mountain and a grizzly visited rufes poultry yard not long before to the unspeakable alarm of caliban who dashed out to chastise the intruder and found himself by moonlight face to face with such a tartar  something at least there must have been  some hairy dangerous brute lodged permanently among the rocks a little to the northwest of silverado spending his summer thereabout with wife and family  and there was or there had been another animal  once under the broad daylight on that open stony hillside where the baby pines were growing scarcely tall enough to be a badge for a macgregors bonnet i came suddenly upon his innocent body lying mummified by the dry air and sun  a pigmy kangaroo  i am ingloriously ignorant of these subjects had never heard of such a beast thought myself face to face with some incomparable sport of nature and began to cherish hopes of immortality in science  rarely have i been conscious of a stranger thrill than when i raised that singular creature from the stones dry as a board his innocent heart long quiet and all warm with sunshine  his long hind legs were stiff his tiny forepaws clutched upon his breast as if to leap his poor life cut short upon that mountain by some unknown accident  but the kangaroo rat it proved was no such unknown animal and my discovery was nothing  crickets were not wanting  i thought i could make out exactly four of them each with a corner of his own who used to make night musical at silverado  in the matter of voice they far excelled the birds and their ringing whistle sounded from rock to rock calling and replying the same thing as in a meaningless opera thus children in full health and spirits shout together to the dismay of neighbours and their idle happy deafening vociferations rise and fall like the song of the crickets  i used to sit at night on the platform and wonder why these creatures were so happy and what was wrong with man that he also did not wind up his days with an hour or two of shouting but i suspect that all longlived animals are solemn  the dogs alone are hardly used by nature and it seems a manifest injustice for poor chuchu to die in his teens after a life so shadowed and troubled continually shaken with alarm and the tear of elegant sentiment permanently in his eye  there was another neighbour of ours at silverado small but very active a destructive fellow  this was a black ugly flya bore the hansons called himwho lived by hundreds in the boarding of our house  he entered by a round hole more neatly pierced than a man could do it with a gimlet and he seems to have spent his life in cutting out the interior of the plank but whether as a dwelling or a storehouse i could never find  when i used to lie in bed in the morning for a restwe had no easychairs in silveradoi would hear hour after hour the sharp cutting sound of his labours and from time to time a dainty shower of sawdust would fall upon the blankets  there lives no more industrious creature than a bore  and now that i have named to the reader all our animals and insects without exceptiononly i find i have forgotten the flieshe will be able to appreciate the singular privacy and silence of our days it was not only man who was excluded  animals the song of birds the lowing of cattle the bleating of sheep clouds even and the variations of the weather were here also wanting and as day after day the sky was one dome of blue and the pines below us stood motionless in the still air so the hours themselves were marked out from each other only by the series of our own affairs and the suns great period as he ranged westward through the heavens  the two birds cackled a while in the early morning all day the water tinkled in the shaft the bores ground sawdust in the planking of our crazy palaceinfinitesimal sounds and it was only with the return of night that any change would fall on our surroundings or the four crickets begin to flute together in the dark  indeed it would be hard to exaggerate the pleasure that we took in the approach of evening  our day was not very long but it was very tiring  to trip along unsteady planks or wade among shifting stones to go to and fro for water to clamber down the glen to the toll house after meat and letters to cook to make fires and beds were all exhausting to the body  life out of doors besides under the fierce eye of day draws largely on the animal spirits  there are certain hours in the afternoon when a man unless he is in strong health or enjoys a vacant mind would rather creep into a cool corner of a house and sit upon the chairs of civilization about that time the sharp stones the planks the upturned boxes of silverado began to grow irksome to my body i set out on that hopeless neverending quest for a more comfortable posture i would be fevered and weary of the staring sun and just then he would begin courteously to withdraw his countenance the shadows lengthened the aromatic airs awoke and an indescribable but happy change announced the coming of the night  the hours of evening when we were once curtained in the friendly dark sped lightly  even as with the crickets night brought to us a certain spirit of rejoicing  it was good to taste the air good to mark the dawning of the stars as they increased their glittering company good too to gather stones and send them crashing down the chute a wave of light  it seemed in some way the reward and the fulfilment of the day  so it is when men dwell in the open air it is one of the simple pleasures that we lose by living cribbed and covered in a house that though the coming of the day is still the most inspiriting yet days departure also and the return of night refresh renew and quiet us and in the pastures of the dusk we stand like cattle exulting in the absence of the load  our nights wore never cold and they were always still but for one remarkable exception  regularly about nine oclock a warm wind sprang up and blew for ten minutes or maybe a quarter of an hour right down the canyon fanning it well out airing it as a mother airs the night nursery before the children sleep  as far as i could judge in the clear darkness of the night this wind was purely local  perhaps dependant on the configuration of the glen at least it was very welcome to the hot and weary squatters and if we were not abed already the springing up of this lilliputian valleywind would often be our signal to retire  i was the last to go to bed as i was still the first to rise many a night i have strolled about the platform taking a bath of darkness before i slept  the rest would be in bed and even from the forge i could hear them talking together from bunk to bunk  a single candle in the neck of a pint bottle was their only illumination and yet the old cracked house seemed literally bursting with the light  it shone keen as a knife through all the vertical chinks it struck upward through the broken shingles and through the eastern door and window it fell in a great splash upon the thicket and the overhanging rock  you would have said a conflagration or at the least a roaring forge and behold it was but a candle  or perhaps it was yet more strange to see the procession moving bedwards round the corner of the house and up the plank that brought us to the bedroom door under the immense spread of the starry heavens down in a crevice of the giant mountain these few human shapes with their unshielded taper made so disproportionate a figure in the eye and mind  but the more he is alone with nature the greater man and his doings bulk in the consideration of his fellowmen  miles and miles away upon the opposite hilltops if there were any hunter belated or any traveller who had lost his way he must have stood and watched and wondered from the time the candle issued from the door of the assayers office till it had mounted the plank and disappeared again into the miners dormitory
