and the mecklenburgs and the muckendorfs and all such puppets and princelings is that they should be made to work and not made to work in the glittering and glorious sense as generals and chiefs of staff and legislators and landbarons but in the plain and humble part of laborers looking for a job that they should carry a hod and wield a trowel and swing a pick and at the days end be glad of a humble supper and a nights rest that they should work in short as millions of poor emigrants out of germany have worked for generations past that there should be about them none of the prestige of fallen grandeur that if it were possible by some trick of magic or change of circumstance the world should know them only as laboring men with the dignity and divinity of kingship departed out of them that as such they should stand or fall live or starve as best they might by the work of their own hands and brains could this be done the world would have a better idea of the thin stuff out of which autocratic kingship is fashioned  it is a favourite fancy of mine to imagine this transformation actually brought about and to picture the hohenzollerns as an immigrant family departing for america their trunks and boxes on their backs their bundles in their hands  the fragments of a diary that here follow present the details of such a picture it is written or imagined to be written by the former princess frederica of hohenzollern i do not find her name in the almanach de gotha perhaps she does not exist but from the text below she is to be presumed to be one of the innumerable nieces of the german emperor     chapter i  on board the ss america wednesday  at last our embarkation is over and we are at sea i am so glad it is done it was dreadful to see poor uncle william and uncle henry and cousin willie and cousin ferdinand of bulgaria coming up the gangplank into the steerage with their boxes on their backs they looked so different in their rough clothes uncle william is wearing an old blue shirt and a red handkerchief round his neck and his hair looks thin and unkempt and his moustache draggled and his face unshaved his eyes seem watery and wandering and his little withered arm so pathetic is it possible he was always really like that  at the top of the gangplank he stood still a minute his box still on his back and said this then is the pathway to saint helena i heard an officer down on the dock call up now then my man move on there smartly please and i saw some young roughs pointing at uncle and laughing and saying look at the old guy with the red handkerchief is he batty eh  the forward deck of the steamer the steerage deck which is the only place that we are allowed to go was crowded with people all poor and with their trunks and boxes and paper bags all round them when uncle set down his box there was soon quite a little crowd around him so that i could hardly see him but i could hear them laughing and i knew that they were taking a rise out of him as they call itjust as they did in the emigration sheds on shore i heard uncle say let wine be brought i am faint and some one else said yes let it and there arose a big shout of laughter  cousin willie had sneaked away with his box down to the lower deck i thought it mean of him not to stay with his father i never noticed till now what a sneaking face cousin willie has in his uniform as crown prince it was different but in his shabby clothes among these rough people he seems so changed he walks with a mean stoop and his eyes look about in such a furtive way never still i saw one of the ships officers watching him very closely and sternly  cousin karl of austria and cousin ruprecht of bavaria are not here we thought they were to come on this ship but they are not here we could hardly believe that the ship would sail without them  i managed to get uncle william out of the crowd and down below he was glad to get off the deck he seemed afraid to look at the sea and when we got into the big cabin he clutched at the cover of the port and said shut it help me shut it shut out the sound of the sea and then for a little time he sat on one of the bunks all hunched up and muttering dont let me hear the sea dont let me hear it his eyes looked so queer and fixed that i thought he must be in a sort of fit or seizure but uncle henry and cousin willie and cousin ferdinand came into the cabin and he got better again  cousin ferdinand has got hold of a queer long overcoat with the sleeves turned up and a little round hat and looks exactly like a jew he says he traded one of our empty boxes for the coat and hat i never noticed before how queer and thick cousin ferdinands speech is and how much he gesticulates with his hands when he talks i am sure that when i visited at sofia nobody ever noticed it and he called uncle william and uncle henry mister and said that on the deck he had met two fine gentlemen thats what he called them who are in the clothing trade in new york it was with them he traded for the coat  cousin ferdinand who is very clever at figures is going to look after all our money because the american money is too difficult for uncle william and cousin willie to understand we have only a little money but cousin ferdinand said that we would put it all together and make it a pool but when uncle henry laughed and turned his pockets out and had no money at all cousin ferdinand said that it would not be a pool he said he would make it on shares and explained it but i couldnt understand what it meant  while he was talking i saw cousin willie slip one of the pieces of money out of the pile into his pocket at least i think i saw it but he did it so quickly that i was not sure and didnt like to say anything  then a bell rang and we went to eat in a big saloon all crowded with common people and very stuffy the food was wretched and i could not eat i suppose uncle was famished from the long waiting and the bad food in the emigrant shed it was dreadful to see the hungry way that he ate the greasy stew they gave us with his head down almost in his plate and his moustache all unkempt this ragout is admirable he said let the chef be informed that i said it  cousin ferdinand didnt sit with us he sat beside his two new friends and they had their heads all close together and talked with great excitement i never knew before that cousin ferdinand talked yiddish i remember him at sofia on horseback addressing his army and i dont think he talked to his troops in yiddish he was telling them i remember how sorry he was that he couldnt accompany them to the front but for business in sofia he said he would like to be in the very front trenches the foremost of all it was thought very brave of him  when we got up from supper the ship was heaving and rolling quite a bit a young man a steward told us that we were now out of the harbor and in the open sea uncle william told him to convey his compliments to the captain on his proper navigation of the channel the young man looked very closely at uncle and said sure ill tell him right away but he said it kindly then he said to me when uncle couldnt hear your pa aint quite right is he miss hohen i didnt know what he meant but of course i said that uncle william was only my uncle hohen is i should explain the name by which we are known now the young man said that he wasnt really a steward only just for the trip he said that because i had a strange feeling that i had met him before and asked him if i hadnt seen him at one of the courts but he said he had never been up before one in his life he said he lives in new york and drives an icewagon and is an iceman he said he was glad to have the pleasure of our acquaintance he is i think the first iceman i have ever met he reminds me very much of the romanoffs the grand dukes of the younger branch i mean but he says he is not connected with them so far as he knows he said his name is peters we have no almanach de gotha here on board the steamer so i cannot look up his name   ss america thursday  we had a dreadful experience last night in the middle of the night uncle henry came and called me and said that uncle william was ill so i put on an old shawl and went with him the ship was pitching and heaving with a dreadful straining and creaking noise a dim light burned in the cabin and outside there was a great roaring of the wind and the wild sound of the sea surging against the ship  uncle william was half sitting up in his rough bunk with the tattered gray blankets over him one hand was clutched on the side of the bed and there was a great horror in his eyes the sea the sea he kept saying dont let me hear it its their voices listen theyre beating at the sides of the ship keep them from me keep them out  he was quiet for a minute until there came another great rush of the sea against the sides of the ship and a roar of water against the port then he broke out almost screaminghenry brother henry keep them back dont let them drag me down i never willed it i never wanted it their death is not at my door it was necessity henry brother henry tell them not to drag me below the sea  like that he raved for perhaps an hour and we tried to quiet him cousin willie had slipped away i dont know where cousin ferdinand was in his bunk with his back turned  do i slip tonight at all he kept growling or do i not say mister do i get any slip at all  but no one minded him  then daylight came and uncle fell asleep his face looked drawn and gray and the cords stood out on his withered hand which was clutched against his shirt  so he slept it seemed so strange there was no court physician no bulletins to reassure the world that he was sleeping quietly  later in the morning i saw the ships doctor and the captain all in uniform with gold braid walking on their inspection round  you had some trouble here last night i heard the captain say  no nothing the doctor answered only one of the steerage passengers delirious in the night  later in the morning the storm had gone down and the sea was calm as glass and uncle henry and i got uncle william up on deck mr peters the steward that i think i spoke about before got us a steamer chair from the first class that had been thrown awayquite good except for one legand uncle william sat in it with his face away from the sea he seemed much shaken and looked gray and tired but he talked quite quietly and rationally about our going to america and how we must all work because work is mans lot he himself he says will take up the presidency of harvard university in new york and uncle henry who of course was our own grand admiral and is a sailor will enter as admiral of the navy of one of the states probably uncle says the navy of missouri or else that of colorado  it was pleasant to hear uncle william talk in this way just as quietly and rationally as at berlin and with the same grasp of political things he only got excited once and that was when he was telling uncle henry that it was his particular wish that uncle should go to the captain and offer to take over the navigation of the vessel uncle henry is a splendid sailor and in all our cruises in the baltic he used to work out all the navigation of the vessel except of course the arithmeticwhich was beneath him  uncle henry laughed he is always so good natured and said that he had had enough of being admiral to last him all his life but when uncle william insisted he said he would see what he could do   ss america friday  all yesterday and today the sea was quite calm and we could sit on deck i was glad because in the cabin where i am there are three other women and it is below the waterline and is very close and horrid so when it is rough i can only sit in the alleyway with my knitting there the light is very dim and the air bad but i do not complain it is womans lot uncle william and cousin willie have both told me thisthat it is womans lot to bear and to suffer and they said it with such complete resignation that i feel i ought to imitate their attitude  cousin ferdinand too is very brave about the dirt and the discomfort of being on board the ship he doesnt seem to mind the dirt at all and his new friends mr sheehan and mr mosenhammer seem to bear it so well too uncle henry goes and washes his hands and face at one of the ships pumps before every meal with a great noise and splashing but cousin ferdinand says for me the pump no he says that nothing like that matters now and that his only regret is that he did not fall at the head of his troops as he would have done if he had not been detained by business  i caught sight of cousin karl of austria so it seems he is on the ship after all he was up on the promenade deck where the first class passengers are and of which you can just see one end from down here in the steerage cousin karl had on a waiters suit and was bringing something to drink to two men who were in steamer chairs on the deck i dont know whether he saw me or not but if he did he didnt give any sign of recognizing me one of the men gave cousin karl a piece of money and i was sure it was he from the peculiar cringing way in which he bowed it was just the manner that he used to have at vienna with his cousin franz ferdinand and with dear old uncle franz joseph  we always thought we girls i mean that it was cousin karl who had cousin franz ferdinand blown up at serajevo i remember once we dared cousin zita karls wife to ask uncle william if it really was karl but uncle william spoke very gravely and said that it was not a thing for us to discuss and that if karl did it it was an act of state and no doubt very painful to cousin karl to have to do zita asked uncle if karl poisoned dear old uncle franz joseph because some of karls best and most intimate friends said that he did but uncle said very positively no that dear old uncle franz joseph had not needed any poison but had died very naturally under the hands of uncle williams own physician who was feeling his windpipe at the time  of course all these things seem very far away now but seeing cousin karl on the upper deck reminded me of all the harmless gossip and tattle that used to go on among us girls in the old days   friday afternoon  i saw cousin willie on the deck this afternoon i had not seen him all day yesterday as he seems to keep out of sight his eyes looked bloodshot and i was sure that he had been drinking  i asked him where he had been in the storm while uncle william was ill he gave a queer sort of leering chuckle and said over there and pointed backwards with his thumb towards the first class part of the ship then he said come here a minute and he led me round a corner to where no one could see and showed me a gold brooch and two diamond rings he told me not to tell the others and then he tried to squeeze my hand and to pull me towards him in such a horrid way but i broke away and went back since then i have been trying to think how he could have got the brooch and the rings but i cannot think   ss america saturday  today when i went up on deck the first thing i saw was uncle henry i hardly recognized him he had on an old blue sailors jersey and was cleaning up a brass rail with a rag i asked him why he was dressed like that and uncle henry laughed and said he had become an admiral i couldnt think what he meant as i never guess things with a double meaning so he explained that he has got work as a sailor for the voyage across i thought he looked very nice in his sailors jersey much nicer than in the coat with gold facings when he was our high admiral he reminded me very much of those big fairhaired norwegian sailors that we used to see when we went on the meteor to flekkefyord and gildeskaale i am sure that he will be of great service to this english captain in helping to work the ship across  when cousin ferdinand came up on deck with his two friends mr mosenhammer and mr sheehan he was very much interested in uncle henrys having got work he made an arrangement right away that he would borrow uncle henrys wages and that mr sheehan would advance them and he would then add it to our capital and then he would take it and keep it uncle henry is to get what is called in the new money one seventyfive a day and to get it for four days and cousin ferdinand says that comes to four dollars and a quarter cousin ferdinand is very quick with figures he says that he will have to take out a small commission for managing the money for uncle henry and that later on he will tell uncle henry how much will be left after taking it out uncle henry said all right and went on with his brass work it is strange how his clothes seem to change him he looks now just like a rough common sailor   ss america tuesday  today our voyage is to end i am so glad when we came on deck mr peters told me that we were in sight of land he told me the names of the places but they were hard and difficult to remember like long island and sandy hook not a bit like our dear old simple german names  so we were all told to put our things together and get ready to land i got out of one of our boxes an old frock coat for uncle william it is frayed at the ends of the sleeves and it shines a little but i had stitched it here and there and it looked quite nice he put it on with a pair of gray trousers that are quite good and not very much bagged and i had knitted for him a red necktie that he wears over his blue shirt with a collar called a celluloid collar that american gentlemen wear  the sea is so calm that uncle doesnt mind being on deck now and he even came close to the bulwarks which he wouldnt do all the way across he stood there in quite an attitude with his imperfect hand folded into his coat he looked something but not quite as he used to look on the deck of the meteor in the baltic  presently he said henry your arm and walked up and down with uncle henry i could see that the other passengers were quite impressed with the way uncle looked and it pleased him i heard some rough young loafers saying catch on to the old dutch will you eh what  uncle henry is going ashore just as he is in his blue jersey but cousin ferdinand has put on a bright red tie that mr mosenhammer has loaned to him for three hours  cousin willie only came on deck at the very last minute and he seemed anxious to slink behind the other passengers and to keep out of sight i think it must have something to do with the brooch that he showed me and the rings his eyes looked very red and bloodshot and his face more crooked and furtive than ever i am sure that he had been drinking again  i have written the last lines of this diary sitting on the deck we have just passed a huge statue that rises out of the water the name of which they mentioned but i cant remember as it was not anything i ever heard of before  just thinkin a little while we shall land in america     chapter ii  city new york 2nd avenue  we came off the steamer late yesterday afternoon and came across the city to a pension on second avenue where we are now only here they dont call it a pension but a boarding house cousin ferdinand and cousin willie drove across in the cart with our boxes and uncle william and uncle henry and i came on a street car it cost us fifteen cents a cent is four and onesixth pfennigs we tried to reckon what it came to but we couldnt but uncle henry thinks it could be done  this house is a tall house in a mean street crowded and noisy with carts and streetsellers i think it would be better to have all the boarding houses stand far back from the street with elm trees and fountains and lawns where peacocks could walk up and down i am sure it would be much better  we have taken a room for uncle william and uncle henry on the third floor at the back and a small room in the front for me of the kind called a hall bedroom which i dont ever remember seeing before there were none at sans souci and none i think at any of the palaces cousin willie has a room at the top of the house and cousin ferdinand in the basement  the landlady of this house is very stout and reminds me very much of the grand duchess of sondersburgaugustenburg her manner when she showed us the rooms was very like that of the grand duchess only perhaps a little firmer and more authoritative but it appears that they are probably not related as the landladys name is mrs ohalloran which is i think scotch  when we arrived it was already time for dinner so we went downstairs to it at once the diningroom was underground in the basement it was very crowded and stuffy and there was a great clatter of dishes and a heavy smell of food most of the people were already seated but there was an empty place at the head of one of the tables and uncle william moved straight towards that uncle was wearing as i said his frock coat and his celluloid collar and he walked into the room with quite an air in something of the way that he used to come into the great hall of the neues palais at potsdam only that in these clothes it looked different as uncle entered the room he waved his hand and said let no one rise i remember that when uncle said this at the big naval dinner at kiel it made a great sensation as an example of his ready tact he realised that if they had once risen there would have been great difficulty in their order of procedure for sitting down again he was afraid that the same difficulty might have been felt here in the boarding house but i dont think it would and i dont think that they were going to stand up anyway they just went on eating i noticed one cheaplooking young man watching uncle with a sort of half smile as he moved towards his seat i heard him say to his neighbour some scout eh  the food was so plain and so greasy that i could hardly eat it but i have noticed that it is a strange thing about uncle that he doesnt seem to know what he eats at all he takes all this poor stuff that they put before him to be the same delicacies that we had at the neues palais and sans souci is this a pheasant he asked when the servant maid passed him his dish of meat i heard the mean young man whisper i guess not presently some hash was brought in and uncle said ha a salmi ha excellent i could see that mrs ohalloran the landlady who sat at the other end of the table was greatly pleased  i was surprised to findbecause it is so hard to get used to the change of things in our new lifethat all the people went on talking just the same after uncle sat down at the palace at potsdam nobody ever spoke at dinner unless uncle william first addressed him and then he was supposed to give a sort of bow and answer as briefly as possible so as not to interrupt the flow of uncle williams conversation generally uncle talked and all the rest listened his conversation was agreed by everybody to be wonderful princes admirals bishops artists scholars and everybody united in declaring that uncle william showed a range of knowledge and a brilliance of language that was little short of marvellous so naturally it was a little disappointing at first to find that these people just went on talking to one another and didnt listen to uncle william at all or merely looked at him in an inquisitive sort of way and whispered remarks to one another but presently i dont just know how uncle began to get the attention of the table and one after the other the people stopped talking to listen to him i was very glad of this because uncle was talking about america and i was sure that it would interest them as what he said was very much the same as the wonderful speech that he made to the american residents of berlin at the time when the first exchange professor was sent over to the university i remember that all the americans who heard it said that uncle told them things about their own country that they had never known or even suspected before so i was glad when i heard uncle explaining to these people the wonderful possibilities of their country he talked of the great plains of connecticut and the huge seaports of pittsburg and colorado springs and the tobacco forests of idaho till one could just see it all he said that the mississippi which is a great river here as large as the weser should be dammed back and held while a war of extermination was carried on against the indians on the other side of it with a view to christianizing them the people listened their faces flushed with eating and with the close air here and there some of them laughed or nudged one another and said get on to this will you but i remember that when uncle william made this speech in berlin the turkish ambassador said after it that he now knew so much about america that he wanted to die and that the shah of persia wrote a letter to uncle all in his own writing except the longest words and said that he had ordered uncles speech on america to be printed and read aloud by all the schoolmasters in persia under penalty of decapitation nearly all of them read it   wednesday  this morning we had a great disappointment it had been pretty well arranged on board the ship that uncle would take over the presidency of harvard university uncle henry and cousin ferdinand and cousin willie had all consented to it and we looked upon it as done now it seems there is a mistake first of all harvard university is not in new york as we had always thought in germany that it was i remember that when uncle henry came home from his great tour in america in which he studied american institutions so profoundly and made his report he said that harvard university was in new york uncle had this information filed away in our secret service department  but it seems that it is somewhere else the university here is called columbia so uncle decided that he would be president of that in the old days all the great men of learning used to assure uncle that if fate had not made him an emperor he would have been better fitted than any living man to be the head of a great university uncle admitted this himself though he resented being compared only to the living ones  so it was a great disappointment today when they refused to give him the presidency i went with him to the college but i cannot quite understand what happened or why they wont give it to him we walked all the way up and i carried a handbag filled with uncles degrees and diplomas from oxford and all over the world all the way up uncle talked about the majesty and the freedom of learning and what he would do to the college when he was made president and how all the professors should sit up and obey him at times he got so excited that he would stop on the street and wave his hands and gesticulate so that people turned and looked at him at potsdam we never realized that uncle was excited all the time and in any case with his uniform on and his sabre clattering as he walked it all seemed different but here in the street in his faded frock coat and knitted tie and with his face flushed and his eyes rambling people seemed to mistake it and thought that his mind was not quite right  so i think he made a wrong impression when we went into the offices of the college uncle was still quite excited from his talking let the trustees be brought he said in a peremptory way to the two young men in black frock coats secretaries of some sort i suppose who received us then he turned to me princess he said my diplomas he began pulling them out of the bag and throwing them on the table in a wild sort of way the other people waiting in the room were all staring at him then the young men took uncle by the arm and led him into an inner room and i went out into the corridor and waited presently one of the young men came out and told me not to wait as uncle had been sent home in a cab he was very civil and showed me where to go to get the elevated railroad but while i was waiting i had overheard some of the people talking about uncle one said thats that same old german that was on board our ship last week in the steeragehas megalomania or something of the sort they say and thinks hes the former emperor i saw the kaiser once at a review in berlinnot much resemblance is there     chapter iii  for weeks and weeks i have written nothing in my diary because it has been so discouraging after uncle williams offer to take over the presidency of columbia university had been refused he debated with uncle henry and with cousin ferdinand of bulgaria who is not living in our boarding house now but who comes over quite often in the evenings whether he would accept the presidency of harvard cousin ferdinand looked up the salary in a book and told him not to take it cousin ferdinand has little books with all the salaries of people in america and he says that these books are fine and much better than the almanach de gotha which we used to use in europe to hunt people up he says that if he ever goes back to be king of bulgaria again he is going to introduce books like these cousin ferdinand is getting very full of american ideas and he says that what you want to know about a man is not his line of descent but his line of credit and he says that the whole king business in europe has been mismanaged he says that there should have been millions in it i forgot to say in my diary sooner that cousin ferdinands two friends mr mosenhammer and mr sheehan took him into their clothing business at once as a sort of partner the reason was that they found that he could wear clothes the effect on the customers when they see cousin ferdinand walking up and down in front of the store is wonderful of course all kings can wear clothes and in the old days in the potsdam palace we thought nothing of it but cousin ferdinand says that the kings should have known enough to stop trying to be soldiers and to put themselves at the head of the export clothing trade he wishes he says that he had some of his bulgarian generals here now in their blue coats trimmed with black fur he says that with a little alteration which he showed us how to do he could have sent them out on the road wherever that is and have made the biggest boom in gentlemens winter fur trimmings that the trade ever saw  cousin ferdinand when he comes over in the evenings now is always beautifully dressed and i can notice that mrs ohalloran the landlady is much impressed with him i am glad of this because we have not yet been able to pay her any money and i was afraid she might say something about it but what is stranger is that now that cousin ferdinand has good clothes uncle william and uncle henry seem much impressed too uncle henry looks so plain and common in his sailors jersey and uncle william in his old frock coat looks faded and shabby and his face always vacant and wondering so now when cousin ferdinand comes in they stand up and get a chair for him and listen to his advice on everything  so as i said cousin ferdinand looked up the salary of the president of harvard in a book and he was strongly against uncle williams taking the position but uncle william says this kind of position is the nearest thing in this country to what he had in germany he thinks that he could do for harvard what he did for germany he has written out on a big sheet of paper all the things that he calls the chief needs of america because he is always busy like this and never still i forget the whole list especially as he changes it every day according to the way that people treat uncle william on the street but the things that he always puts first are culture religion and light these he says he can supply and he thought that the presidency of harvard would be the best place to do it from in the end he accepted the position against cousin ferdinands advice or at least i mean he said that he would be willing to take it and he told uncle henry to pack up all his degrees and diplomas and to send them to harvard and say that he was coming  so it was dreadfully disappointing when all the diplomas came back again by the next post there was a letter with them but i didnt see it as uncle william tore it into fragments and stamped on it he said he was done with american universities for ever i have never seen him so furious he named over on his fingers all the american professors that he had fed at berlin one meal each and sometimes even twouncle has a wonderful memory for things like thatand yet this was their gratitude he walked up and down his room and talked so wildly and incoherently that if i had not known and been told so often by our greatest authorities in germany how beautifully balanced uncle williams brain is i should have feared that he was wandering  but presently he quieted down and said with deep earnestness that the american universities must now go to ruin in their own way he was done with them he said he would go into a cloister and spend his life in quiet adoration provided that he could find anything to adore which he said in his station was very doubtful but half an hour later he was quite cheerful againit is wonderful how quickly uncle williams brain recovers itselfand said that a cloister was too quiet and that he would take a position as governor of a state there are a great many of these in this country and uncle spent days and days writing letters to them and when the answers came in though some never answered at alluncle william got into the same state of fury as about the presidency of harvard so naturally each day seemed more disappointing than the last especially with the trouble that we have been having with cousin willie of which i have not spoken yet and i was getting quite disheartened until last evening when everything seemed to change  we all knew of course that uncle william is the greatest artist in the world but no one liked to suggest that he should sell his pictures for money a thing that no prince was ever capable of doing yet i could not but feel glad when uncle decided yesterday that he would stoop to make his living by art it cost him a great struggle to make this decision but he talked it over very fully last night with uncle henry after uncle henry came home from work and the resolution is taken  of course uncle always had a wonderful genius for painting i remember how much his pictures used to be admired at the court at berlin i have seen some of the best painters stand absolutely entrancedthey said so themselvesin front of uncles canvasses i remember one of the greatest of our artists saying one day to uncle in the potsdam gallery now which of these two pictures is yours and which is michel angelos i never can tell you two apart uncle gave him the order of the red swan another painter once said that if uncles genius had been developed he would have been the greatest painter of modern times uncle william i remember was dreadfully angry he said it was developed  so it seemed only natural that uncle should turn to art to make our living but he hesitated because there is some doubt whether a person of noble birth can sell anything for money but uncle says tintoretto the great italian artist had two quarterings of nobility and velasquez had two and a half  luckily we have with us among our things uncles easel and his paints that he used in berlin he had always to have special things because he doesnt use little brushes and tubes of colour as ordinary artists do but had a big brush and his paint in a tin can so that he can work more quickly fortunately we have with us three of uncles pictures rolled up in the bottom of our boxes he is going to sell these first and after that he says that he will paint one or two every day one of the three canvasses that we have is an allegorical picture called progress in which progress is seen coming out of a cloud in the background with uncle william standing in the foreground another is called modern science and in this science is seen crouched in the dark in the background and uncle william standing in the light in the foreground the other is called midnight in the black forest uncle william did it in five minutes with a pot of black paint they say it is impressionistic  so all the evening uncle william and uncle henry talked about the new plan it is wonderful how uncle william enters into a thing he got me to fetch him his old blue blouse which was with the painting things and he put it on over his clothes and walked up and down the room with a long paintbrush in his hand we painters my dear henry he said must not be proud america needs art very good she shall have it  i could see of course that uncle william did not like the idea of selling pictures for money but he is going to make that side of it less objectionable by painting a picture a very large picture for nothing and giving it to the big metropolitan art gallery which is here uncle has already partly thought it out it is to be called the spirit of america and in it the spirit of america will be seen doubled up in the background uncle has not yet fully thought out the foreground but he says he has an idea  in any case he is going to refuse to take anything more than a modest price for his pictures beyond that he says not one pfennig  so this morning uncle rolled up his three canvasses under his arm and has gone away to sell them  i am very glad as we have but little money indeed hardly any except uncle henrys wages and i have been so worried too and surprised since we came here about cousin willie he hardly is with the rest of us at all he is out all night and sleeps in the day time and often i am sure that he has been drinking one morning when he came back to the house at about breakfast time he showed me quite a handful of money but wouldnt say where he got it he said there was lots more where it came from i asked him to give me some to pay mrs ohalloran but he only laughed in his leering way and said that he needed it all at another time when i went up to cousin willies room one day when he was out i saw quite a lot of silver things hidden in a corner of the cupboard they looked like goblets and silver dinner things and there was a revolver and a sheathknife hidden with them i began to think that he must have stolen all these things though it seemed impossible for a prince i have spoken to uncle william several times about cousin willie but he gets impatient and does not seem to care uncle never desires very much to talk of people other than himself i think it fatigues his mind in any case he says that he has done for willie already all that he could he says he had him confined to a fortress three times and that four times he refused to have him in his sight for a month and that twice he banished him to a country estate for six weeks his duty he says is done i said that i was afraid that cousin willie had been stealing and told him about the silver things hidden in the cupboard but uncle got very serious and read me a very severe lecture no prince he said ever stole his son he explained might very well be collecting souvenirs as memorials of his residence in america all the hohenzollerns collected souvenirs some of our most beautiful art things at potsdam and sans souci were souvenirs collected by our ancestors in france fifty years ago uncle said that if the great war had turned out as it should and if his soldiers had not betrayed him by getting killed we should have had more souvenirs than ever after that he dismissed the subject from his mind uncle william can dismiss things from his mind more quickly than anybody i ever knew   the same day later  i was so surprised this afternoon when i happened to go down to the door to see mr peters the ice gentleman that was on the ship with his ice cart delivering ice into the basement i knew that he delivered ice in this part of the city because he said so and i think he had mentioned this street and two or three times i thought i had seen him from the window but it did seem surprising to happen to go down to the door i forget what i went for at the moment that he was there he looked very fine in his big rough suit of overalls it is not quite like a military uniform but i think it looks better mr peters knew me at once good afternoon miss hohen he said that is the name as i think i said that we have here how are all the folks  so we talked for quite a little time and i told him about uncle trying to get work and how hard it was and how at last he had got work or at least had gone out to get it as a painter mr peters said that that was fine he said that painters do well here he has a lot of friends who are painters and they get all the way from sixty to seventyfive cents an hour it seems so odd to think of them being paid by the hour i dont think the court artists at home were paid like that it will be very nice if uncle william can mingle with mr peterss artist friends mr peters asked if he might take me out some sunday and i said that i would ask uncle william and uncle henry and cousin ferdinand and cousin willie and if they all consented to come i would go i hope it was not a forward thing to do  i forgot when i was talking of work to say that uncle henry got work the very second day that we were here he works down at the docks where the ships are i think he supervises the incoming and outgoing of the american navy it is called being a stevedore and no doubt his being an admiral helped him to get it he hopes to get a certificate presently to be a barge master which will put him in charge of the canals but there is a very difficult examination to go through and uncle henry is working for it at night out of a book he has to take up vulgar fractions which of course none of our high seas command were asked to learn but uncle henry is stooping to them  so now i think everything will go well     chapter iv  uncles art has failed it was only yesterday that i was writing in my memoirs of how cheerful and glad i felt to think that uncle william was going to be able to make his living by art and now everything is changed again all the time that uncle was out on his visit to the picture dealers i was making plans and thinking what we would do with the money when it came in so it is very disappointing to have it all come to nothing i dont know just what happened because uncle william never gives any details of things his mind moves too rapidly for that but he came home with his pictures still under his arm in a perfect fury and raged up and down his room using very dreadful language  but after a little while when he grew calmer he explained to me that the americans are merely swineheads and that art especially art such as his is wasted on them uncle says that he has no wish to speak harshly of the americans but they are pigdogs he bears them no illwill he says for what they have done and his heart is free of any spirit of vengeance but he wishes he had his heel on their necks for about half a minute he said this with such a strange dreadful snarl that for the moment his face seemed quite changed but presently when he recovered himself he got quite cheerful again and said that it was perhaps unseemly in him as the guest of the american people to say anything against them it is strange how uncle always refers to himself as the guest of the american people living in this poor place in these cheap surroundings it seems so odd often at our meals in the noisy diningroom down in the basement in the speeches that he makes to the boarders he talks of himself as the guest of america and he says what does america ask in return nothing i can see that mrs ohalloran the landlady doesnt like this because we have not paid her anything for quite a long time and she has spoken to me about it in the corridor several times  but when uncle william makes speeches in the diningroom i think the whole room becomes transformed for him into the banquet room of a palace and the cheap bracket lamps against the wall turn into a blaze of light and the boarders are all courtiers and he becomes more and more grandiloquent he waves his hand towards uncle henry and refers to him as my brother the admiral and to me as the princess at my side some of the people the meaner ones begin to laugh and to whisper and others look uncomfortable and sorry and it is always on these occasions that uncle william refers to himself as americas guest and refers to the americans as the hospitable nation who have taken him to their heart i think that when uncle says this he really believes it uncle can believe practically anything if he says it himself  so as i say when he came home yesterday after failing to sell his pictures he was at first furious and then he fell into his other mood and he said that as the guest of a great people he had found out at last the return he could make to them he said that he would organise a school of art and as soon as he had got the idea he was carried away with it at once and seized a pencil and paper and began making plans for the school and drawing up a list of the instructors needed he asked first who could be principal or president of the school and decided that he would have to be that himself as he knew of no one but himself who had the peculiar power of organisation needed for it all the technical instructors he said must be absolutely the best each one a master in his own line so he wrote down at the top of his list instructor in oils and reflected a little with his head in his hand as to who could do that presently he sighed and said that as far as he knew there was no one hed have to do that himself then he wrote down instructor in water colour and as soon as he had written it he said right off that he would have to take that over too there was no one else that he could trust it to then he said now let me see perspective freehand and crayon work i need three men three men of the first class can i get them i doubt it let me think what can be done  he walked up and down the room a little with his hands behind his back and his head sunk in thought while he murmured three men three men but ha why three why not if sufficiently gifted one man  but just when he was saying this there was a knock at the door and mrs ohalloran came in i knew at once what she had come for because she had been threatening to do it and so i felt dreadfully nervous when she began to say that our bill at the house had gone unpaid too long and that we must pay her at once what we owed her it took some time before uncle william understood what she was talking about but when he did he became dreadfully frigid and polite he said let me understand clearly madame just what it is that you wish to say do i apprehend that you are saying that my account here for our maintenance is now due and payable mrs ohalloran said yes she was and uncle said let me endeavour to grasp your meaning exactly am i correct in thinking that you mean i owe you money mrs ohalloran said that was what she meant uncle said let me try to apprehend just as accurately as possible what it is that you are trying to tell me is my surmise correct that you are implying that it is time that i settled up my bill  mrs ohalloran said yes but i could see that by this time she was getting quite flustered because there was something so dreadfully chilling in uncles manner his tone in a way was courtesy itself but there was something in it calculated to make mrs ohalloran feel that she had committed a dreadful breach in what she had done uncle william told me afterwards that to mention money to a prince is not a permissible thing and that no true hohenzollern has ever allowed the word bill to be said in his presence and that for this reason he had tried out of courtesy to give the woman every chance to withdraw her words and had only administered a reprimand to her when she failed to do so certainly it was a dreadful rebuke that he gave her he told her that he must insist on this topic being dismissed and never raised again that he could allow no such discussion the subject was one he said that he must absolutely refuse to entertain he did not wish he said to speak with undue severity but he had better make it plain that if there were any renewal of this discussion he should feel it impossible to remain in the house  while uncle william was saying all this mrs ohalloran was getting more and more confused and angry and when uncle finally opened the door for her with cold dignity she backed out of it and found herself outside the room without seeming to know what she was doing presently i could hear her down in the scullery below rattling dishes and saying that she was just as good as anybody  but uncle william seemed to be wonderfully calmed and elevated after this scene and said princess bring me my flute i brought it to him and he sat by the window and leaned his head out over the back lane and played our dear old german melodies till somebody threw a boot at him the people about here are not musical but meantime uncle william had forgotten all about the school of art and he said no more about it   next day  today a dreadful thing has happened the police have come into the house and have taken cousin willie away he is now in a place called the tombs and mr peters says that he will be sent to the great prison at singsing he is to be tried for robbery and for stabbing with intent to kill  it was very dreadful when they came to take him i was so glad that uncle william was not here to see it all but it was in the morning and he had gone out to see a steamship company about being president of it and i was tidying up our rooms because mrs ohalloran wont tidy them up any more or let the coloured servant tidy them up until we pay her more money she said that to me but i think she is afraid to say it to uncle william so i mean to do the work now while uncle is out and not let him know  this morning in the middle of the morning while i was working all of a sudden i heard the street door open and slam and some one rushing up the stairway and then cousin willie broke into the room all panting and excited and his face grey with fright and gasping out hide me hide me he ran from room to room whining and hysterical and his breath coming in a sort of sob but he seemed incapable of deciding what to do i would have hidden him if i could but at the very next moment i heard the policemen coming in below and the voice of the landlady then they came upstairs big stronglooking men in blue any one of whom could have choked cousin willie with one hand cousin willie ran to and fro like a cornered rat and two of the men seized him and then i think he must have been beside himself with fear for i saw his teeth bite into the mans hand that held him and one of the policemen struck him hard with his wooden club across the head and he fell limp to the floor they dragged him down the stairway like that and i followed them down but there was nothing that i could do i saw them lift cousin willie into a closed black wagon that stood at the street door with quite a little crowd of people gathered about it already all excited and leering as if it were a show and then they drove away with him and i came in and went upstairs and sat down in uncles room but i could not work any more a little later on mr peters came to the housei dont know why because it was not for the ice as he had his other clothes onand he came upstairs and sat down and told me about what had happened it seemed a strange thing to receive him upstairs in uncles bedroom like that but i was so upset that i did not think about it at the time mr peters had been on our street with his ice wagon when the police came though i did not see him but he saw me he said standing at the door and i think he must have gone home and changed his things and come back again but i did not ask him  he told me that cousin willie had stabbed a man or at least a boy that was in charge of a jewelry shop and that the boy might die cousin willie mr peters says has been stealing jewelry nearly ever since we came here and the police have been watching him but he did not know this and so he had grown quite foolhardy and this morning in broad daylight he went into some sort of jewelry or pawn shop where there was only a boy watching the shop and the boy was a cripple cousin willie had planned to hide the things under his coat and to sneak out but the boy saw what he was doing and cried out and when cousin willie tried to break out of the shop he hobbled to the door and threw himself in the way and then it was that cousin willie stabbed him with his sheathknifethe one that i had seen in his roomand ran but already there was a great outcry and the people followed on his tracks and shouted to the police and so they easily ran him down  all of this mr peters told me but he couldnt stay very long and had to go again he says he is going to see what can be done for cousin willie but i am afraid that he doesnt feel very sorry for him but after mr peters had gone i could not help going on thinking about it all and it seemed to me as if cousin willie had not altogether had a fair chance in life common people are brought up in fear of prison and punishment and they learn to do what they should but cousin willie was brought up as a prince and was above imprisonment and things like that and in any case he seemed when the big men seized hold of him such a paltry and miserable thing  later on in the day uncle william came home and i had to tell him all about cousin willie i had feared that he would be dreadfully upset but he was much less disturbed than i had thought indeed it is quite wonderful the way in which uncle can detach his mind from things  i told him that mr peters had said that cousin willie must go to singsing and uncle said ha a fortress so i told him that i thought it was after that he asked if cousin willie was in his uniform at the time and when i said that he was not uncle said that may make it more difficult of course cousin willie has no uniform here in america and doesnt wear any but i notice that uncle william begins to mix up our old life with our life here and seems sometimes quite confused and wandering at least other people would think him so he went on talking quite a long time about what had happened and he said that there is an almost exact precedent for the incident thats what he calls it in the zabern case i dont remember much about that as it was years ago before the war but uncle william said that it was a similar case of an officer finding himself compelled to pass his sword once through a cripple only once uncle says in order to clear himself a way on the sidewalk uncle quoted a good many other precedents for passing swords through civilians but he says that this is the best one  in the evening cousin ferdinand and uncle henry came over uncle henry seemed very gloomy and depressed about what had happened and said very little but cousin ferdinand was very much excited and angry he said what is the good of all his honesty and his industry if he is to be disgraced like this he asked of what use is his uprightness and business integrity if he is to have a first cousin in singsing he said that if it was known that he had a cousin there it would damage him with his best trade to an incalculable extent but later on he quieted down and said that perhaps with a certain part of his trade it would work the other way uncle ferdinand has grown to be much interested in what is called here advertisinga thing that he says all kings ought to studyand he decided after he had got over his first indignation that cousin willie being in singsing would be a very good advertisement for him it might bring him he said quite a lot of new business especially if it was known that he refused to help cousin willie in any way or to have anything more to do with any of the rest of us and not to give us any money he said that this was a point of view which people could respect and admire  so before he went home he said that we must not expect to see or hear from him any more unless of course things should in some way brighten up in which case he would come back     chapter v  it is a long timenearly three monthssince i have added anything to my memoirs the truth is i find it very hard to write memoirs here for one thing nobody else seems to do it mrs ohalloran tells me that she never thinks of writing memoirs at all at the potsdam palace it was different we all wrote memoirs eugenia of pless did and cecilia did and i did and all of us we all had our memoir books with little silver padlocks and keys we were brought up to do it because it helped us to realise how important everything was that we did and how important all the people about us were it was wonderful to realise that in the old life one met every day great world figures like prince rasselwitzwindischkopf the grand falconer of reuss and the grand duke of schlitzinmein and field marshall topoff generalinchief of the army of schwarzburgrudolstadt there are no such figures as these in america  but another reason for not writing has been that things have been going so badly with us uncle william still has no work and he seems to be getting older and more broken and stranger in his talk every day he is very shabby now in spite of all i can do with my needle but he becomes more grandiloquent and consequential all the time some of the mean looking young men at this boarding house have christened him the emperorwhich seems a strange thing for them to have picked upon and they draw him out in his talk and when they meet him they make mock salutes to him which uncle returns with very great dignity quite a lot of the people on the nearby streets have taken it up and when they see uncle come along they make him military salutes uncle gets quite pleased and flushed as he goes along the street and answers the salutes with a sort of military bow  he is quite happy when he is out of doors explaining to me with his stick the plans he has for rebuilding new york and turning the hudson river to make it run the other way but when he comes in he falls into the most dreadful depression and sometimes at night i hear him walking up and down in his room far into the night two or three times he has had the same dreadful kind of seizures that he had on board the ship when we came over and this is always when there is a great wind blowing from the ocean and a storm raging out at sea  of course as uncle has not any work or any position we are getting poorer and poorer cousin willie has been sent to the fortress at singsing and cousin ferdinand of bulgaria refuses to know us any more though from what we hear he is getting on wonderfully well in the clothing business and is very soon to open a big new store of which he is to be the general manager cousin karl is now the third assistant headwaiter at the king george hotel and in the sphere in which he moves it is impossible for him to acknowledge any relationship with us i dont know what we should do but that uncle henry manages to give us enough of his wages to pay for our board and lodging uncle henry has passed his naval examination and is now appointed to a quite high command it is called a barge master they refused to accept his certificate of a german admiral so he had to study very hard but at last he got his qualification and is now in charge of long voyages on the canals  i am very glad that uncle henrys command turned out to be on canals instead of on the high seas as it makes it so much more german of course uncle henry had splendid experience in the kiel canal all through the four years of the war and it is bound to come in so he goes away now on quite long voyages often of two or three weeks at a time and for all this time he is in chief charge of his barge and has to work out all the navigation sometimes uncle henry takes bricks and sometimes sand he says it is a great responsibility to feel oneself answerable for the safety of a whole bargefull of bricks or sand it is quite different from what he did in the german navy because there it was only a question of the sailors and for most of the time as i have heard uncle william and uncle henry say we had plenty of them but here with bricks and sand it is different uncle henry says that if his barge was wrecked he would lose his job this makes it a very different thing from being a royal admiral  but uncle william all through the last three months has failed first at one thing and then at another after all his plans for selling pictures had come to nothing he decided very reluctantly that he would go into business he only reached this decision after a great deal of anxious thought because of course business is a degradation it involves taking money for doing things and this uncle william says no prince can consent to do but at last after deep thought uncle said the die is cast and sat down and wrote a letter offering to take over the presidency of the united states steel corporation we spent two or three anxious days waiting for the answer uncle was very firm and kept repeating i have set my hand to it and i will do it but i was certain that he was sorry about it and it was a great relief when the answer came at lastit took days and days evidently for them to decide about itin which the corporation said that they would worry along as they were uncle explained to me what worrying along meant and he said that he admired their spirit but that ended all talk of his going into business and i am sure that we were both glad  after that uncle william decided that it was necessary for me to marry in a way to restore our fortunes and he decided to offer me to a state governor he asked me if i had any choice of states and i said no of course i should not have wished to marry a state governor but i knew my duty towards uncle william and i said nothing so uncle got a map of the united states and he decided to marry me to the governor of texas he told me that i could have two weeks to arrange my supply of household linen and my trousseau to take to texas and he wrote at once to the governor he showed me what he wrote and it was a very formal letter i think that uncles mind gets more and more confused as to where he is and what he is and he wrote in quite the old strain and i noticed that he signed himself your brother william perhaps it was on that account that we had no answer to the letter uncle seemed to forget all about it very soon and i was glad that it was so and that i had escaped going to the court of texas  all this time mr peters has been very kind he comes to the house with his ice every day and sometimes when uncle henry is here he comes in with him and smokes in the evenings one day he brought a beautiful bunch of chrysanthemums for uncle william and another day a lovely nosegay of violets for uncle henry and one sunday he took us out for a beautiful drive with one of his icehorses in a carriage called a buggy with three seats uncle william sat with mr peters in the front seat and uncle henry and cousin ferdinand it was the last time he came to see us sat behind them and there was a little seat at the back in which i sat it was a lovely drive and uncle william pointed out to mr peters all the things of interest and cousin ferdinand smoked big cigars and told uncle henry all about the clothing trade and i listened to them all and enjoyed it very much indeed but i was afraid afterwards that it was a very bold and unconventional thing to do and perhaps mr peters felt that he had asked too much because he did not invite me to drive again  but he is always very kind and thoughtful  one sunday afternoon he came to see us thinking by mistake that uncle william and uncle henry were there but they werent and his manner seemed so strange and constrained that i was certain that there was something that he was trying to say and it made me dreadfully nervous and confused and at last quite suddenly he said that there was something that he wanted to ask me if i wouldnt think it a liberty my breath stopped and i couldnt speak and then he went on to ask if he might lend us twentyfive dollars he got very red in the face when he said it and he began counting out the money on the sofa and somehow i hadnt expected that it was money and began to cry but i told mr peters that of course we couldnt think of taking any money and i begged him to pick it up again and then i began to try to tell him about how hard it was to get along and to ask him to get work for uncle william but i started to cry again mr peters came over to my chair and took hold of the arm of it and told me not to cry somehow his touch on the arm of the chair thrilled all through me and though i knew that it was wrong i let him keep it there and even let him stroke the upholstery and i dont know just what would have happened but at that very minute uncle william came in he was most courteous to mr peters and expressed his apologies for having been out and said that it must have been extremely depressing for mr peters to find that he was not at home and he thanked him for putting himself to the inconvenience of waiting and a little while after that mr peters left   the next day  mr peters came back this morning and said that he had got work for uncle william so i was delighted he said that uncle will make a first class street man and that he has arranged for a line of goods for him and that he has a territory that uncle can occupy he showed me a flat cardboard box filled with lead pencils and shoestrings and little badges and buttons with inscriptions on them and he says these are what is called a line and that uncle can take out this line and do splendidly i dont quite understand yet who makes the appointment to be a street man or what influence it takes or what it means to have a territory but mr peters explained that there is a man who is retiring from being a street man and that uncle can take his place and can have both sides of the bowery which sounds very pretty indeed  at first i didnt understandbecause mr peters hesitated a good deal in telling me about itthat if uncle gets this appointment it will mean that he will sell things in the street but as soon as i understood this i felt that uncle william would scorn to do anything like this as the degradation would be the same as being president of the steel corporation so i was much surprised to find that when uncle came in he didnt look at it that way at all he looked at the box of badges and buttons and things and he said at once ha orders of distinction an excellent idea he picked up a silly little white button with the motto welcome to new york and he said admirable that shall be the first class and there was a little lead spoon with souvenir of the bowery that he made the second class he started arranging and rearranging all the things in the box just as he used to arrange the orders and decorations at the palace only those were real things such as the order of the red feather and the insignia of the black duck and these were only poor tin baubles but i could see that uncle no longer knows the difference and as his fingers fumbled among these silly things he was quite trembling and eager to begin like a child waiting for tomorrow     chapter vi  it is a year or nearly a year since i wrote in my memoirs and i only add to them now because things have happened which mean that i shall never write any more  mr peters and i were married last autumn he asked me if i would marry him the day that he held the arm of my chair in the boarding house where we used to live at first i never thought that uncle william would permit it because of the hopeless difference of birth but it turned out that there was no difficulty at all uncles mind was always so wonderful that he could find a way out of anything provided that he wanted to so he conferred on mr peters an order that raised him right up in birth so that he came level with me uncle said that he could have lifted him higher still if need be but that as i was only in our old life of a younger branch of the family it was not necessary to lift mr peters to the very top he takes precedence uncle said just below uncle henry of prussia and just above an archbishop  it is so pleasant to thinknow that poor uncle william is gonethat my marriage was with his full consent  but even after uncle william had given his formal consent i didnt want to get married till i could leave him safely only he got along so well in his territory of the bowery from the very start that he was soon quite all right he used to go out every morning with his trayful of badges and pencils and shoestrings and he was a success at once all the people got to know him by sight and they would say when they saw him here comes the emperor or here comes old dutch and very often there would be quite a little crowd round him buying his things uncle regarded himself always as conferring a great dignity on any one that he sold a badge to but he was very capricious and he had certain buttons and badges that he would only part with as a very special favour and honour uncle got on so fast that presently cousin ferdinand decided that it would be all right to know him again and so he came over and made a reconciliation and took away uncles moneyit was all in small coinsin a bag to invest for him  so when everything was all right with uncle william mr peters and i were married and it was on our wedding morning that uncle conferred the order on my husband which made me very proud that was a year ago and since then we have lived in a very fine place of our own with four rooms all to ourselves and a gallery at the back i have cooked all the meals and done all the work of our apartment except just at the time when our little boy was born we both think he is a very wonderful child at first i wanted to call him after the hohenzollerns and to name him william frederick charles mary augustus francis felix but somehow it seemed out of place and so we have called him simply joe peters i think it sounds better uncle william drew up an act of abnegation of joe whereby he gives up all claim to a reversion of the throne of prussia brunswick and waldeck i was sorry for this at first but uncle said that all the hohenzollerns had done it and had made just as great a sacrifice as joe has in doing it but my husband says that under the constitution of the united states joe can be president which i think i will like better  it was one day last week that uncle william met with the accident that caused his death he had walked far away from his territory up to where the great park is because in this lovely spring weather he liked to wander about and he came to where there was a great crowd of people gathered to see the unveiling of a new monument it is called the lusitania monument and it is put up in memory of the people that were lost when one of our war boats fought the english cruiser lusitania there were a lot of soldiers lining the streets and regiments of cavalry riding between and it seems that when uncle william saw the crowd and the soldiers he was drawn nearer and nearer by a sort of curiosity and when he saw the great white veil drawn away from the monument and read the word lusitania that is carved in large letters across the base he screamed out in a sudden fear and clashed among the horses of the cavalry and was ridden down  they carried him to the hospital but he never spoke again and died on the next day but one my husband would not let me go to see him as he was not conscious and it could do no good but after uncle william was dead they let me see him in his coffin  lying there he seemed such a pitiful and ghastly lump of clay that it seemed strange that he could in his old life have vexed the world as he did  i had thought that when uncle william died there would have been long accounts of him in the papers at least i couldnt help thinking so by a sort of confusion of mind as it is hard to get used to things as they are and to remember that our other life is unknown here and that we are known only as ourselves  but though i looked in all the papers i could find nothing except one little notice which i cut out of an evening paper and which i put in here as a conclusion to my memoirs      the emperor dead     unique character of the east side passes away     a unique and interesting character a familiar figure    of the east side of the city has been lost from our    streets with the death of william hohen lost thursday    in the pauper hospital to which he had been brought    as the result of injuries sustained in a street accident    at the lusitania celebration hohen who was about    sixtyfive years of age was an immigrant out of    germany after the troubles of the great war he had    been for a year or more a street pedler on the bowery    where he sold souvenir buttons and various little    trinkets the old man appears to have been the victim    of a harmless hallucination whereby he thought himself    a person of royal distinction and in his fancy converted    the box of wares that he carried into orders of chivalry    and decorations of knighthood the effect of this    strange fancy was heightened by an attempt at military    bearing which comic though it was in so old and ragged    a figure was not without a touch of pathos some    fancied resemblance to the former kaiser had earned    for hohen the designation of the emperor of which    he appeared inordinately proud but those who knew    hohen by sight assure us that the resemblance to the    former ruler of germany who with all his faults made    a splendid and imposing appearance was of a purely    superficial character it would alas have been well    for the world if the lot of william hohenzollern had    fallen on the lines of the simple and pathetic emperor    of the bowery     iiwith the bolsheviks in berlin  two years ago as my readers will rememberbut of course they donti made a secret visit to germany during the height of the war it was obviously quite impossible at that time to disclose the means whereby i made my way across the frontier i therefore adopted the familiar literary device of professing to have been transported to germany in a dream in that state i was supposed to be conducted about the country by my friend count boob von boobenstein whom i had known years before as a waiter in toronto to see germany from within and to report upon it in the allied press  what i wrote attracted some attention so the german governmentfeeling perhaps that the prestige of their own spy system was at stakepublished a white paper or a green paperi forget whichin denial of all my adventures and disclosures in this they proved 1 that all entry into germany by dreams had been expressly forbidden of the high general command 2 that astral bodies were prohibited and 3 that nobody else but the kaiser was allowed to have visions they claimed therefore 1 that my article was a fabrication and 2 that for all they knew it was humorous there the matter ended until it can be taken up at the general peace table  but as soon as i heard that the peoples revolution had taken place in berlin i determined to make a second visit  this time i had no difficulty about the frontier whatever i simply put on the costume of a british admiral and walked in  three cheers for the british navy said the first official whom i met he threw his hat in the air and the peasants standing about raised a cheer it was my first view of the marvellous adaptability of this great people i noticed that many of them were wearing little buttons with pictures of jellicoe and beatty  at my own request i was conducted at once to the nearest railway station  so your excellency wishes to go to berlin said the stationmaster  yes i replied i want to see something of the peoples revolution  the stationmaster looked at his watch  that revolution is over he said  too bad i exclaimed  not at all a much better one is in progress quite the best revolution that we have had it is calledjohann hand me that proclamation of yesterdaythe workmen and soldiers revolution  whats it about i asked  the basis of it said the stationmaster or what we germans call the fundamental ground foundation is universal love they hanged all the leaders of the old revolution yesterday  when can i get a train i inquired  your excellency shall have a special train at once sir he continued with a sudden burst of feeling while a tear swelled in his eye the sight of your uniform calls forth all our gratitude my three sons enlisted in our german navy for four years they have been at kiel comfortably fed playing dominos they are now at home all safe and happy had your brave navy relaxed its vigilance for a moment those boys might have had to go out on the sea a thing they had never done please god concluded the good old man removing his hat a moment no german sailor now will ever have to go to sea  i pass over my journey to berlin interesting and varied as were the scenes through which i passed they gave me but little light upon the true situation of the country indeed i may say without exaggeration that they gave me as littleor even more soas the press reports of our talented newspaper correspondents the food situation seemed particularly perplexing a welltodo merchant from bremen who travelled for some distance in my train assured me that there was plenty of food in germany except of course for the poor distress he said was confined entirely to these similarly a prussian gentleman who looked very like a soldier but who assured me with some heat that he was a commercial traveller told me the same thing there were no cases of starvation he said except among the very poor  the aspect of the people too at the stations and in the towns we passed puzzled me there were no uniforms no soldiers but i was amazed at the number of commercial travellers lutheran ministers photographers and so forth and the odd resemblance they presented in spite of their innocent costumes to the arrogant and ubiquitous military officers whom i had observed on my former visit  but i was too anxious to reach berlin to pay much attention to the details of my journey  even when i at last reached the capital i arrived as i had feared too late  your excellency said a courteous official at the railway station to whom my naval uniform acted as a sufficient passport the revolution of which you speak is over its leaders were arrested yesterday but you shall not be disappointed there is a better one it is called the comrades revolution of the bolsheviks the chief executive was installed yesterday  would it be possible for me to see him i asked  nothing simpler excellency he continued as a tear rose in his eye my four sons  i know i said your four sons are in the german navy it is enough can you take me to the leader  i can and will said the official he is sitting now in the free palace of all the german people once usurped by the hohenzollern tyrant the doors are guarded by machine guns but i can take you direct from here through a back way come  we passed out from the station across a street and through a maze of little stairways and passages into the heart of the great building that had been the offices of the imperial government  enter this room do not knock said my guide good bye  in another moment i found myself face to face with the chief comrade of the bolsheviks  he gave a sudden start as he looked at me but instantly collected himself  he was sitting with his big boots up on the mahogany desk a cigar at an edgeways angle in his mouth his hair under his sheepskin cap was shaggy and his beard stubbly and unshaven his dress was slovenly and there was a big knife in his belt a revolver lay on the desk beside him i had never seen a bolshevik before but i knew at sight that he must be one  you say you were here in berlin once before he questioned and he added before i had time to answer when you speak dont call me excellency or sereneness or anything of that sort just call me brother or comrade this is the era of freedom youre as good as i am or nearly  thank you i said  dont be so damn polite he snarled no good comrade ever says thank you so you were here in berlin before  yes i answered i was here writing up germany from within in the middle of the war  the war the war he murmured in a sort of wail or whine take notice comrade that i weep when i speak of it if you write anything about me be sure to say that i cried when the war was mentioned we germans have been so misjudged when i think of the devastation of france and belgium i weep  he drew a greasy red handkerchief from his pocket and began to sob to think of the loss of all those english merchant ships  oh you neednt worry i said its all going to be paid for  oh i hope so i do hope so said the bolshevik chief what a regret it is to us germans to think that unfortunately we are not able to help pay for it but you englishyou are so generoushow much we have admired your noble heartsso kind so generous to the vanquished  his voice had subsided into a sort of whine  but at this moment there was a loud knocking at the door the bolshevik hastily wiped the tears from his face and put away his handkerchief  how do i look he asked anxiously not humane i hope not soft  oh no i said quite tough  thats good he answered thats good but am i tough enough  he hastily shoved his hands through his hair  quick he said hand me that piece of chewing tobacco now then come in  the door swung open  a man in a costume much like the leaders swaggered into the room he had a bundle of papers in his hands and seemed to be some sort of military secretary  ha comrade he said with easy familiarity here are the death warrants  death warrants said the bolshevik of the leaders of the late revolution excellent and a good bundle of them one moment while i sign them  he began rapidly signing the warrants one after the other  comrade said the secretary in a surly tone you are not chewing tobacco  yes i am yes i am said the leader or at least i was just going to  he bit a huge piece out of his plug with what seemed to me an evident distaste and began to chew furiously  it is well said the other remember comrade that you are watched it was reported last night to the executive committee of the circle of the brothers that you chewed no tobacco all day yesterday be warned comrade this is a free and independent republic we will stand for no aristocratic nonsense but whom have you here he added breaking off in his speech as if he noticed me for the first time what dog is this  hush said the leader he is a representative of the foreign press a newspaper reporter  your pardon said the secretary i took you by your dress for a prince a representative of the great and enlightened press of the allies i presume how deeply we admire in germany the press of england let me kiss you  oh dont trouble i said its not worth while  say at least when you write to your paper that i offered to kiss you will you not  meantime the leader had finished signing the papers the secretary took them and swung on his heels with something between a military bow and a drunken swagger remember comrade he said in a threatening tone as he passed out you are watched  the bolshevik leader looked after him with something of a shudder  excuse me a moment he said while i go and get rid of this tobacco  he got up from his chair and walked away towards the door of an inner room as he did so there struck me something strangely familiar in his gait and figure conceal it as he might there was still the stiff wooden movement of a prussian general beneath his assumed swagger the poise of his head still seemed to suggest the pointed helmet of the prussian i could without effort imagine a military cloak about his shoulders instead of his bolshevik sheepskin  then all in a moment as he reentered the room i recalled exactly who he was  my friend i said reaching out my hand pardon me for not knowing you at once i recognize you now  hush said the bolshevik dont speak i never saw you in my life  nonsense i said i knew you years ago in canada when you were disguised as a waiter and you it was who conducted me through germany two years ago when i made my war visit you are no more a bolshevik than i am you are general count boob von boobenstein  the general sank down in his chair his face pale beneath its plaster of rouge  hush he said if they learn it it is death  my dear boob i said not a word shall pass my lips  the general grasped my hand the true spirit he said the true english comradeship how deeply we admire it in germany  i am sure you do i answered but tell me what is the meaning of all this why are you a bolshevik  we all are said the count dropping his assumed rough voice and speaking in a tone of quiet melancholy its the only thing to be but come he added getting up from his chair i took you once through berlin in war time let me take you out again and show you berlin under the bolsheviks  i shall be only too happy i said  i shall leave my pistols and knives here said boobenstein and if you will excuse me i shall change my costume a little to appear as i am would excite too much enthusiasm i shall walk out with you in the simple costume of a gentleman its a risky thing to do in berlin but ill chance it  the count retired and presently returned dressed in the quiet bellshaped purple coat the simple scarlet tie the peagreen hat and the white spats that mark the german gentleman all the world over  bless me count i said you look just like bernstorff  hush said the count dont mention him hes here in berlin  whats he doing i asked  hes a bolshevik one of our leaders hes just been elected president of the scavengers union they say hes the very man for it but come along and by the way when we get into the street talk english and only english theres getting to be a prejudice here against german  we passed out of the door and through the spacious corridors and down the stairways of the great building all about were little groups of ferocious looking men dressed like stage russians all chewing tobacco and redolent of alcohol  who are all these people i said to the count in a low voice  bolsheviks he whispered at least they arent really you see that group in the corner  the ones with the long knives i said  yes they are or at least they were the orchestra of the berlin opera they are now the bolshevik music commission they are here this morning to see about getting their second violinist hanged  why not the first i asked  they had him hanged yesterday both cases are quite clear the men undoubtedly favoured the war one at least of them openly spoke in disparagement of president wilson but come along let me show you our new city  we stepped out upon the great square which faced the building how completely it was changed from the berlin that i had known my attention was at once arrested by the new and glaring signboards at the shops and hotels and the streamers with mottos suspended across the streets i realised as i read them the marvellous adaptability of the german people and their magnanimity towards their enemies conspicuous in huge lettering was hotel president wilson and close beside it cabaret queen mary english dancing the square itself which i remembered as the kaiserplatz was now renamed on huge signboards grand square of the british navy not far off one noticed the restaurant marshal foch side by side with the roosevelt saloon and the beer garden george v  but the change in the appearance and costume of the men who crowded the streets was even more notable the uniforms and the pointed helmets of two years ago had vanished utterly the men that one saw retained indeed their german stoutness their flabby faces and their big spectacles but they were now dressed for the most part in the costume of the russian monjik while some of them appeared in american wideawakes and kentucky frock coats or in english stovepipe hats and morning coats a few of the stouter were in highland costume  you are amazed said boobenstein as we stood a moment looking at the motley crowd what does it mean i asked  one moment said the count i will first summon a taxi it will be more convenient to talk as we ride  he whistled and there presently came lumbering to our side an ancient and decrepit vehicle which would have excited my laughter but for the seriousness of the counts face the top of the conveyance had evidently long since been torn off leaving only the frame the copper fastenings had been removed the tires were gone the doors were altogether missing  our new 1919 model said the count observe the absence of the oldfashioned rubber tires still used by the less progressive peoples our chemists found that riding on rubber was bad for the eyesight note too the time saved by not having any doors  admirable i said  we seated ourselves in the crazy conveyance the count whispered to the chauffeur an address which my ear failed to catch and we started off at a lumbering pace along the street  and now tell me boobenstein i said what does it all mean the foreign signs and the strange costumes  my dear sir he replied it is merely a further proof of our german adaptability having failed to conquer the world by war we now propose to conquer it by the arts of peace those people for example that you see in scotch costumes are members of our highland mission about to start for scotland to carry to the scotch the good news that the war is a thing of the past that the german people forgive all wrongs and are prepared to offer a line of manufactured goods as per catalogue sample  wonderful i said  is it not said von boobenstein we call it the from germany out movement it is being organised in great detail by our step from under committee they claim that already four million german voters are pledged to forget the war and to forgive the allies all that we now ask is to be able to put our hands upon the villains who made this war no matter how humble their station may be and execute them after a fair trial or possibly before  the count spoke with great sincerity and earnestness but come along he added i want to drive you about the city and show you a few of the leading features of our new national reconstruction we can talk as we go  but von boobenstein i said you speak of the people who made the war surely you were all in favour of it  in favour of it we were all against it  but the kaiser i protested  the kaiser my poor master how he worked to prevent the war day and night even before anybody else had heard of it boob he said to me one day with tears in his eyes this war must be stopped which war your serenity i asked the war that is coming next month he answered i look to you count boobenstein he continued to bear witness that i am doing my utmost to stop it a month before the english government has heard of it  while we were thus speaking our taxi had taken us out of the roar and hubbub of the main thoroughfare into the quiet of a side street it now drew up at the door of an unpretentious dwelling in the window of which i observed a large printed card with the legend     reverend mr tibbits    private tuition english navigation    and other branches  we entered and were shown by a servant into a little front room where a venerable looking gentleman evidently a lutheran minister was seated in a corner at a writing table he turned on our entering and at the sight of the uniform which i wore jumped to his feet with a vigorous and unexpected oath  it is all right admiral said count von boobenstein my friend is not really a sailor  ah said the other you must excuse me the sight of that uniform always gives me the jumps  he came forward to shake hands and as the light fell upon him i recognized the grand old seaman perhaps the greatest sailor that germany has ever produced or ever will admiral von tirpitz  my dear admiral i said warmly i thought you were out of the country our papers said that you had gone to switzerland for a rest  no said the admiral i regret to say that i find it impossible to get away  your allied press interjected the count has greatly maligned our german patriots by reporting that they have left the country where better could they trust themselves than in the bosom of their own people you noticed the cabman of our taxi he was the former chancellor von hertling you saw that stout woman with the apple cart at the street corner frau bertha krupp von bohlen all are here helping to make the new germany but come admiral our visitor here is much interested in our plans for the restoration of the fatherland i thought that you might care to show him your designs for the new german navy  a new navy i exclaimed while my voice showed the astonishment and admiration that i felt here was this gallant old seaman having just lost an entire navy setting vigorously to work to make another but how can germany possibly find the money in her present state for the building of new ships  there are not going to be any ships said the great admiral that was our chief mistake in the past in insisting on having ships in the navy ships as the war has shown us are quite unnecessary to the german plan they are not part of what i may call the german idea the new navy will be built inland and elevated on piles and will consist  but at this moment a great noise of shouting and sudden tumult could be heard as if from the street  some one is coming said the admiral hastily reach me my bible  no no said the count seizing me by the arm the sound comes from the great square there is trouble we must hasten back at once  he dragged me from the house  we perceived at once as soon as we came into the main street again from the excited demeanour of the crowd and from the anxious faces of people running to and fro that something of great moment must be happening  everybody was asking of the passerby what is loose what is it ramshack taxis similar to the one in which we had driven forced their way as best they could through the crowded thoroughfare moving evidently in the direction of the government buildings  hurry hurry said von boobenstein clutching me by the arm or we shall be too late it is as i feared  what is it i said whats the matter  fool that i was said the count to leave the building i should have known and in this costume i am helpless  we made our way as best we could through the crowd of people who all seemed moving in the same direction the count evidently a prey to the gravest anxiety talking as if to himself and imprecating his own carelessness  we turned the corner of a street and reached the edge of the great square it was filled with a vast concourse of people at the very moment in which we reached it a great burst of cheering rose from the crowd we could see over the heads of the people that a man had appeared on the balcony of the government building holding a paper in his hand his appearance was evidently a signal for the outburst of cheers accompanied by the waving of handkerchiefs the man raised his hand in a gesture of authority german training is deep silence fell instantly upon the assembled populace we had time in the momentary pause to examine as closely as the distance permitted the figure upon the balcony the man was dressed in the blue overall suit of a workingman he was bareheaded his features so far as we could tell were those of a man well up in years but his frame was rugged and powerful then he began to speak  friends and comrades he called out in a great voice that resounded through the square i have to announce that a new revolution has been completed  a wild cheer woke from the people  the bolsheviks republic is overthrown the bolsheviks are aristocrats let them die  thank heaven for this costume i heard count boobenstein murmur at my side then he seized his peagreen hat and waved it in the air shouting down with the bolsheviks  all about us the cry was taken up  one saw everywhere in the crowd men pulling off their sheepskin coats and tramping them under foot with the shout down with bolshevism to my surprise i observed that most of the men had on blue overalls beneath their russian costumes in a few moments the crowd seemed transformed into a vast mass of mechanics  the speaker raised his hand again we have not yet decided what the new government will be  a great cheer from the people  nor do we propose to state who will be the leaders of it  renewed cheers  but this much we can say it is to be a free universal pangerman government of love  cheers  meantime be warned whoever speaks against it will be shot anybody who dares to lift a finger will be hanged a proclamation of brotherhood will be posted all over the city if anybody dares to touch it or to discuss it or to look at or to be seen reading it he will be hanged to a lamp post  loud applause greeted this part of the speech while the faces of the people to my great astonishment seemed filled with genuine relief and beamed with unmistakable enthusiasm  and now continued the speaker i command you you dogs to disperse quietly and go home move quickly swine that you are or we shall open fire upon you with machine guns  with a last outburst of cheering the crowd broke and dispersed like a vast theatre audience on all sides were expressions of joy and satisfaction excellent wunderschoen he calls us dogs thats splendid swine did you hear him say swine this is true german government again at last  then just for a moment the burly figure reappeared on the balcony  a last word he called to the departing crowd i omitted to say that all but one of the leaders of the late government are already caught as soon as we can lay our thumb on the chief executive rest assured that he will be hanged  hurrah shouted boobenstein waving his hat in the air then in a whisper to me let us go he said while the going is still good  we hastened as quickly and unobtrusively as we could through the dispersing multitude turned into a side street and on a sign from the count entered a small cabaret or drinking shop newly named as its sign showed the glory of the british colonies cafe  the count with a deep sigh of relief ordered wine  you recognized him of course he said  who i asked you mean the big workingman that spoke who is he  so you didnt recognize him said the count well well but of course all the rest did workingman it is field marshal hindenburg it means of course that the same old crowd are back again that was ludendorf standing below i saw it all at once perhaps it is the only way but as for me i shall not go back i am too deeply compromised it would be death  boobenstein remained for a time in deep thought his fingers beating a tattoo on the little table then he spoke  do you remember he said the old times of long ago when you first knew me  very well indeed i answered you were one of the german waiters or rather one of the german officers disguised as waiters at mcconkeys restaurant in toronto  i was said the count i carried the beer on a little tray and opened oysters behind a screen it was a wunderschoen life do you think my good friend you could get me that job again  boobenstein i exclaimed i can get you reinstated at once it will be some small return for your kindness to me in germany  good said the count let us sail at once for canada  one thing however i said you may not know that since you left there are no longer beer waiters in toronto because there is no beer all is forbidden  let me understand myself said the count in astonishment no beer  none whatever  wine then  absolutely not all drinking except of water is forbidden  the count rose and stood erect his figure seemed to regain all its oldtime prussian rigidity he extended his hand  my friend he said i bid you farewell  where are you going to i asked  my choice is made said von boobenstein there are worse things than death i am about to surrender myself to the german authorities     iiiafternoon tea with the sultan  a study of reconstruction in turkey  on the very day following the events related in the last chapter i was surprised and delighted to receive a telegram which read come on to constantinople and write us up too from the signature i saw that the message was from my old friend abdul aziz the sultan  i had visited himas of course my readers will instantly recollectduring the height of the war and the circumstances of my departure had been such that i should have scarcely ventured to repeat my visit without this express invitation but on receipt of it i set out at once by rail for constantinople  i was delighted to find that under the new order of things in going from berlin to constantinople it was no longer necessary to travel through the barbarous and brutal populations of germany austria and hungary the way now runs though i believe the actual railroad is the same through the thuringian republic czechoslovakia and magyaria it was a source of deep satisfaction to see the scowling and hostile countenances of germans austrians and hungarians replaced by the cheerful and honest faces of the thuringians the czechoslovaks and the magyarians moreover i was assured on all sides that if these faces are not perfectly satisfactory they will be altered in any way required  it was very pleasant too to find myself once again in the flagstoned halls of the yildiz kiosk the sultans palace my little friend abdul aziz rose at once from his cushioned divan under a lemon tree and came shuffling in his big slippers to meet me a smile of welcome on his face he seemed to my surprise radiant with happiness the disasters attributed by the allied press to his unhappy country appeared to sit lightly on the little man  how is everything going in turkey i asked as we sat down side by side on the cushions  splendid said abdul i suppose youve heard that were bankrupt  bankrupt i exclaimed  yes continued the sultan rubbing his hands together with positive enjoyment we cant pay a cent isnt it great have some champagne  he clapped his hands together and a turbaned attendant appeared with wine on a tray which he served into longnecked glasses  id rather have tea i said  no no dont take tea he protested weve practically cut out afternoon tea here its part of our turkish thrift movement were taking champagne instead tell me have you a thrift movement like that where you come fromcanada i think it is isnt it  yes i answered we have one just like that  this war finance is glorious stuff isnt it continued the sultan how much do you think we owe  i havent an idea i said  wait a minute said abdul he touched a bell and at the sound of it there came shuffling into the room my venerable old acquaintance toomuch koffi the royal secretary but to my surprise he no longer wore his patriarchal beard his flowing robe and his girdle he was clean shaven and close cropped and dressed in a short jacket like an american bell boy  you remember toomuch i think said abdul ive reconstructed him a little as you see  the peace of allah be upon thine head said toomuch koffi to the sultan commencing a deep salaam what wish sits behind thy forehead that thou shouldst ring the bell for this humble creature of clay to come into the sunlight of thy presence tell me o lord if perchance  here here interrupted the sultan impatiently cut all that stuff out please that ancient courtesy business wont do not if this country is to reconstruct itself and come abreast of the great modern democracies say to me simply whats the trouble  toomuch bowed and abdul continued look in your tablets and see how much our public debt amounts to in american dollars  the secretary drew forth his tablets and bowed his head a moment in some perplexity over the figures that were scribbled on them multiplication i heard him murmur is an act of the grace of heaven let me invoke a blessing on five the perfect number whereby the pound turkish is distributed into the american dollar  he remained for a few moments with his eyes turned as if in supplication towards the vaulted ceiling  have you got it asked abdul  yes  and what do we owe adding it all together  forty billion dollars said toomuch  isnt that wonderful exclaimed abdul with delight radiating over his countenance who would have thought that before the war forty billion dollars arent we the financiers arent we the bulwark of monetary power can you touch that in canada  no i said we cant we dont owe two billion yet  oh never mind never mind said the little man in a consoling tone you are only a young country yet youll do better later on and in any case i am sure you are just as proud of your one billion as we are of our forty  oh yes i said we certainly are  come come thats something anyway youre on the right track and you must not be discouraged if youre not up to the turkish standard yet you must remember as i told you before that turkey leads the world in all ideas of government and finance take the present situation here we are bankruptpass me the champagne toomuch and sit down with usthe very first nation of the lot its a great feather in the cap of our financiers it gives us a splendid start for the new era of reconstruction that we are beginning on as you perhaps have heard we are all hugely busy about it you notice my books and papers do you not the sultan added very proudly waving his hand towards a great pile of blue books pamphlets and documents that were heaped upon the floor beside him  why i never knew before that you ever read anything i exclaimed in amazement  never did but everythings changed now isnt it toomuch i sit and work here for hours every morning its become a delight to me after all said abdul lighting a big cigar and sticking up his feet on his pile of papers with an air of the deepest comfort what is there like work so stimulating so satisfying i sit here working away just like this most of the day theres nothing like it  what are you working at i asked  reconstruction said the little man puffing a big cloud from his cigar reconstruction  what kind of reconstruction  all kindsfinancial industrial political social its great stuff by the way he continued with great animation would you like to be my minister of labour no well im sorry i half hoped you would were having no luck with them the last one was thrown into the bosphorous on monday heres the report on itno thats the one on the shooting of the minister of religionah here it isreport on the drowning of the minister of labour let me read you a bit of this i call this one of the best reports of its kind that have come in  no no i said dont bother to read it just tell me who did it and why  workingmen said the sultan very cheerfully a delegation they withheld their reasons  so you are having labour troubles here too i asked  labour troubles exclaimed the little sultan rolling up his eyes i should say so the whole of turkey is bubbling with labour unrest like the rosewater in a narghile look at your tablets toomuch and tell me what new strikes there have been this morning  the aged secretary fumbled with his notes and began to murmurtruly will i try with the aid of allah  now now said abdul warningly that wont do say simply sure now tell me  the secretary looked at a little list and read the strikes of today comprisethe wigmakers the dog fanciers the conjurers the snake charmers and the soothsayers  you hear that said abdul proudly that represents some of the most skilled labour in turkey  i suppose it does i said but tell me abdulwhat about the really necessary trades the coal miners the steel workers the textile operatives the farmers and the railway people are they working  the little sultan threw himself back on his cushions in a paroxysm of laughter in which even his ancient secretary was feign to join  my dear sir my dear sir he laughed dont make me die of laughter working those people working surely you dont think we are so behind hand in turkey as all that all those workers stopped absolutely months ago it is doubtful if theyll ever work again theres a strong movement in turkey to abolish all necessary work altogether  but who then i asked is working  look on the tablets toomuch and see  the aged secretary bowed turned over the leaves of his tablets which i now perceived on a closer view to be merely an american ten cent memorandum book then he read  the following o all highest still workthe beggars the poets the missionaries the salvation army and the instructors of the youths of light in the american presbyterian college  but dear me abdul i exclaimed surely this situation is desperate what can your nation subsist on in such a situation  pooh pooh said the sultan the interest on our debt alone is two billion a year everybody in turkey great or small holds bonds to some extent at the worst they can all live fairly well on the interest this is finance is it not toomuch koffi  the very best and latest said the aged man with a profound salaam  but what steps are you taking i asked to remedy your labour troubles  we are appointing commissions said abdul we appoint one for each new labour problem how many yesterday toomuch  fortythree answered the secretary  thats below our average is it not said abdul a little anxiously try to keep it up to fifty if you can  and these commissions what do they do  they make reports said abdul beginning to yawn as if the continued brain exercise of conversation were fatiguing his intellect excellent reports we have had some that are said to be perfect models of the very best turkish  and what do they recommend  i dont know said the sultan we dont read them for that we like to read them simply as turkish  but what i urged do you do with them what steps do you take  we send them all replied the little man puffing at his pipe and growing obviously drowsy as he spoke to woodrow wilson he can deal with them he is the great conciliator of the world let him havehow do you say it in english it is a turkish phraselet him have his stomach full of conciliation  abdul dozed on his cushions for a moment then he reopened his eyes is there anything else you want to know he asked before i retire to the inner harem  just one thing i said if you dont mind how do you stand internationally are you coming into the new league of nations  the sultan shook his head  no he said were not coming in we are starting a new league of our own  and who are in it  ourselves and the armeniansand let me seethe irish are they not toomuchand the bulgariansare there any others toomuch  there is talk said the secretary of the yugohebrovians and the scaroovians  who are they i asked  we dont know said abdul testily they wrote to us they seem all right havent you got a lot of people in your league that you never heard of  i see i said and what is the scheme that your league is formed on  very simple said the sultan each member of the league gives its word to all the other members then they all take an oath together then they all sign it that is absolutely binding  he rolled back on his cushions in an evident state of boredom and weariness  but surely i protested you dont think that a league of that sort can keep the peace  peace exclaimed abdul waking into sudden astonishment peace i should think not our league is for war every member gives its word that at the first convenient opportunity it will knock the stuff out of any of the others that it can  the little sultan again subsided then he rose with some difficulty from his cushions  toomuch he said take our inquisitive friend out into the town take him to the bosphorous take him to the island where the dogs are take him anywhere he paused to whisper a few instructions into the ear of the secretary you understand he said well take him as for mehe gave a great yawn as he shuffled away i am about to withdraw into my inner harem goodbye i regret that i cannot invite you in  so do i i said goodbye     ivechoes of the war   1the boy who came back  the war is over the soldiers are coming home on all sides we are assured that the problem of the returned soldier is the gravest of our national concerns  so i may say it without fear of contradictionsince everybody else has seen itthat up to the present time the returned soldier is a disappointment he is not turning out as he ought according to all the professors of psychology he was to come back bloodthirsty and brutalised soaked in militarism and talking only of slaughter in fact a widespread movement had sprung up warmly supported by the business men of the cities to put him on the land it was thought that central nevada or northern idaho would do nicely for him at the same time an agitation had been started among the farmers with the slogan back to the city the idea being that farm life was so rough that it was not fair to ask the returned soldier to share it  all these anticipations turn out to be quite groundless  the first returned soldier of whom i had direct knowledge was my nephew tom when he came back after two years in the trenches we asked him to dine with us now remember i said to my wife tom will be a very different being from what he was when he went away he left us as little more than a school boy only in his first year at college in fact a mere child you remember how he used to bore us with baseball talk and that sort of thing and how shy he was you recall his awful fear of professor razzler who used to teach him mathematics all that of course will be changed now tom will have come back a man we must ask the old professor to meet him it will amuse tom to see him again just think of the things he must have seen but we must be a little careful at dinner not to let him horrify the other people with brutal details of the war  tom came i had expected him to arrive in uniform with his pocket full of bombs instead of this he wore ordinary evening dress with a dinner jacket i realised as i helped him to take off his overcoat in the hall that he was very proud of his dinner jacket he had never had one before he said he wished the boys could see him in it i asked him why he had put off his lieutenants uniform so quickly he explained that he was entitled not to wear it as soon as he had his discharge papers signed some of the fellows he said kicked them off as soon as they left the ship but the rule was he told me that you had to wear the thing till your papers were signed  then his eye caught a glimpse sideways of professor razzler standing on the hearth rug in the drawing room say he said is that the professor i could see that tom was scared all the signs of physical fear were written on his face when i tried to lead him into the drawing room i realised that he was as shy as ever three of the women began talking to him all at once tom answered yes or nowith his eyes down i liked the way he stood though so unconsciously erect and steady the other men who came in afterwards with easy greetings and noisy talk somehow seemed loudvoiced and selfassertive  tom to my surprise refused a cocktail it seems as he explained that he got into the way of taking nothing over there i noticed that my friend quiller who is a war correspondent or i should say a war editorial writer took three cocktails and talked all the more brilliantly for it through the opening courses of the dinner about the story of the smashing of the hindenburg line he decided after his second burgundy that it had been simply a case of sticking it out i say burgundy because we had substituted burgundy the sparkling kind for champagne at our dinners as one of our little war economies  tom had nothing to say about the hindenburg line in fact for the first half of the dinner he hardly spoke i think he was worried about his left hand there is a deep furrow across the back of it where a piece of shrapnel went through and there are two fingers that will hardly move at all i could see that he was ashamed of its clumsiness and afraid that someone might notice it so he kept silent professor razzler did indeed ask him straight across the table what he thought about the final breaking of the hindenburg line but he asked it with that same fierce look from under his bushy eyebrows with which he used to ask tom to define the path of a tangent and tom was rattled at once he answered something about being afraid that he was not well posted owing to there being so little chance over there to read the papers  after that professor razzler and mr quiller discussed for us most energetically the strategy of the lorraine sector tom served there six months but he never said so and high explosives and the possibilities of aerial bombs tom was buried by an aerial bomb but of course he didnt break in and mention it  but we did get him talking of the war at last towards the end of the dinner or rather the girl sitting next to him did and presently the rest of us found ourselves listening the strange thing was that the girl was a mere slip of a thing hardly as old as tom himself in fact my wife was almost afraid she might be too young to ask to dinner girls of that age my wife tells me have hardly sense enough to talk to men and fail to interest them this is a proposition which i think it better not to dispute  but at any rate we presently realized that tom was talking about his war experiences and the other talk about the table was gradually hushed into listening  this as nearly as i can set it down is what he told us that the french fellows picked up baseball in a way that is absolutely amazing they were not much good it seems at the bat at any rate not at first but at running bases they were perfect marvels some of the french made good pitchers too tom knew a poilu who had lost his right arm who could pitch as good a ball with his left as any man on the american side at the port where tom first landed and where they trained for a month they had a dandy ball ground a regular peach a former parade ground of the french barracks on being asked which port it was tom said he couldnt remember he thought it was either boulogne or bordeaux or brestat any rate it was one of those places on the english channel the ball ground they had behind the trenches was not so good it was too much cut up by long range shells but the ball ground at the base hospital where tom was sent for his second wound was an a1 ground the french doctors it appears were perfectly rotten at baseball not a bit like the soldiers tom wonders that they kept them tom says that baseball had been tried among the german prisoners but they are perfect dubs he doubts whether the germans will ever be able to play ball they lack the national spirit on the other hand tom thinks that the english will play a great game when they really get into it he had two weeks leave in london and went to see the game that king george was at and says that the king if they will let him will make the greatest rooter of the whole bunch  such was toms war talk  it grieved me to note that as the men sat smoking their cigars and drinking liqueur whiskey we have cut out port at our house till the final peace is signed tom seemed to have subsided into being only a boy again a firstyear college boy among his seniors they spoke to him in quite a patronising way and even asked him two or three direct questions about fighting in the trenches and wounds and the dead men in no mans land and the other horrors that the civilian mind hankers to hear about perhaps they thought from the boys talk that he had seen nothing if so they were mistaken for about three minutes not more tom gave them what was coming to them he told them for example why he trained his fellows to drive the bayonet through the stomach and not through the head that the bayonet driven through the face or skull sticks andbut there is no need to recite it here any of the boys like tom can tell it all to you only they dont want to and dont care to  theyve got past it  but i noticed that as the boy talkedquietly and reluctantly enoughthe older men fell silent and looked into his face with the realisation that behind his simple talk and quiet manner lay an inward vision of grim and awful realities that no words could picture  i think that they were glad when we joined the ladies again and when tom talked of the amateur vaudeville show that his company had got up behind the trenches  later on when the other guests were telephoning for their motors and calling up taxis tom said hed walk to his hotel it was only a mile and the light rain that was falling would do him he said no harm at all so he trudged off refusing a lift  oh no i dont think we need to worry about the returned soldier only let him return thats all when he does hes a better man than we are gunga dinn     2the war sacrifices of mr spugg  although we had been members of the same club for years i only knew mr spugg by sight until one afternoon when i heard him saying that he intended to send his chauffeur to the war  it was said quite quietlyno bombast or boasting about it mr spugg was standing among a little group of listening members of the club and when he said that he had decided to send his chauffeur he spoke with a kind of simple earnestness a determination that marks the character of the man  yes he said we need all the man power we can command this thing has come to a showdown and weve got to recognise it i told henry that its a showdown and that hes to get ready and start right away  well spugg said one of the members youre certainly setting us a fine example  what else can a man do said mr spugg  when does your chauffeur leave asked another man  right away i want him in the firing line just as quick as i can get him there  its a fine thing youre doing spugg said a third member but do you realise that your chauffeur may be killed  i must take my chance on that answered mr spugg firmly ive thought this thing out and made up my mind if my chauffeur is killed i mean to pay for himfull and adequate compensation the loss must fall on me not on him or say henry comes back mutilatedsay he loses a legsay he loses two legs  here mr spugg looked about him at his listeners with a look that meant that even three legs wouldnt be too much for him  whatever henry loses i pay for the loss shall fall on me every cent of it  spugg said a quiet looking neatly dressed man whom i knew to be the president of an insurance company and who reached out and shook the speaker by the hand this is a fine thing youre doing a big thing but we mustnt let you do it alone let our company take a hand in it were making a special rate now on chauffeurs footmen and houseservants sent to the war quite below the rate that actuarial figures justify it is our little war contribution he added modestly we like to feel that were doing our bit too we had a chauffeur killed last week we paid for him right off without demurwaived all question of who killed him i never signed a check as i took occasion to say in a little note i wrote to his people with greater pleasure  what do you do if henrys mutilated asked mr spugg turning his quiet eyes on the insurance man and facing the brutal facts of things without flinching what do you pay suppose i lose the use of henrys legs what then  its all right said his friend leave it to us whatever he loses we make it good  all right said spugg send me round a policy im going to see henry clear through on this  it was at this point that at my own urgent request i was introduced to mr spugg so that i might add my congratulations to those of the others i told him that i felt as all the other members of the club did that he was doing a big thing and he answered again in his modest way that he didnt see what else a man could do  my son alfred and i he said talked it over last night and we agreed that we can run the car ourselves or make a shot at it anyway after all its war time  what branch of the service are you putting your chauffeur in i asked  im not sure he answered i think ill send him up in the air its dangerous of course but its no time to think about that  so in due time mr spuggs chauffeur henry went overseas he was reported first as in england next he was right at the front at the very firing itself we knew theneverybody in the club knew that mr spuggs chauffeur might be killed at any moment but great as the strain must have been spugg went up and down to his office and in and out of the club without a tremor the situation gave him a new importance in our eyes something tense  this seems to be a terrific business i said to him one day at lunch this new german drive  my chauffeur said mr spugg was right in the middle of it  he was eh  yes he continued one shell burst in the air so near him it almost broke his wings  mr spugg told this with no false boasting or bravado eating his celery as he spoke of it here was a man who had nearly had his chauffeurs wings blown off and yet he never moved a muscle i began to realize the kind of resolute stuff that the man was made of  a few days later bad news came to the club  have you heard the bad news about spugg someone asked  no what  his chauffeurs been gassed  how is he taking it  fine hes sending off his gardener to take the chauffeurs place  so that was mr spuggs answer to the germans  we lunched together that day  yes he said henrys gassed how it happened i dont know he must have come down out of the air i told him i wanted him in the air but let it pass its done now  and youre sending your gardener  i am said spugg hes gone already i called him in from the garden yesterday i said william henrys been gassed our first duty is to keep up our man power at the front you must leave tonight  what are you putting william into i asked  infantry hell do best in the trenchesdigs well and is a very fair shot anyway i want him to see all the fighting thats going if the germans want give and take in this business they can have it theyll soon see who can stand it best i told william when he left i said william weve got to show these fellows that man for man were a match for them thats the way i look at it man for man  i watched mr spuggs massive face as he went on with his meal not a nerve of it moved if he felt any fear at least he showed no trace of it  after that i got war news from him at intervals in little scraps as i happened to meet him the war looks bad i said to him one day as i chanced upon him getting into his motor this submarine business is pretty serious  it is he said william was torpedoed yesterday  then he got into his car and drove away as quietly as if nothing had happened  a little later that day i heard him talking about it in the club yes he was saying a submarine it torpedoed williammy gardener i have both a chauffeur and a gardener at the war william was picked up on a raft hes in pretty bad shape my son alfred had a cable from him that hes coming home weve both telegraphed him to stick it out  the news was the chief topic in the club that day spuggs gardener has been torpedoed they said but spugg refuses to have him quit and come home well done spugg said everybody  after that we had news from time to time about both william and henry  henrys out of the hospital said spugg i hope to have him back in france in a few days williams in bad shape still i had a london surgeon go and look at him i told him not to mind the expense but to get william fixed up right away it seems that one arm is more or less paralysed ive wired back to him not to hesitate they say williams blood is still too thin for the operation ive cabled to them to take some of henrys i hate to do it but this is no time to stick at anything  a little later william and henry were reported both back in france this was at the very moment of the great offensive but spugg went about his daily business unmoved then came the worst news of all william and henry he said to me are both missing i dont know where the devil they are  missing i repeated  both of them the germans have caught them both i suppose i shant have either of them back now till the war is all over  he gave a slight sighthe only sign of complaint that ever i had heard come from him  but the next day we learned what was spuggs answer to the germans capture of william and henry  have you heard what spugg is doing the members of the club asked one another  what  hes sending over meadows his own man  there was no need to comment on it the cool courage of the thing spoke for itself meadowsspuggs own manhis house valet without whom he never travelled twenty miles  what else was there to do said mr spugg when i asked him if it was true that meadows was going i take no credit for sending meadows nor for the matter of that for anything that meadows may do over there it was a simple matter of duty my son and i had him into the dining room last night after dinner meadows we said henry and william are caught our man power at the front has got to be kept up theres no one left but ourselves and you theres no way out of it youll have to go  but how i protested can you get along with meadows your valet gone youll be lost  we must do the best we can weve talked it all over my son will help me dress and i will help him we can manage no doubt  so meadows went  after this mr spugg dressed as best he could manage it and taking turns with his son in driving his own motor was a pathetic but uncomplaining object  meadows meantime was reported as with the heavy artillery doing well i hope nothing happens to meadows spugg kept saying if it does were stuck we cant go ourselves were too busy weve talked it over and weve both decided that its impossible to get away from the officenot with business as brisk as it is now were busier than weve been in ten years and cant get off for a day we may try to take a month off for the adirondacks a little later but as for europe its out of the question  meantime one little bit of consolation came to help mr spugg to bear the burden of the war i found him in the lounge room of the club one afternoon among a group of men exhibiting two medals that were being passed from hand to hand  sent to me by the french government he explained proudly theyre for william and henry the motto means for conspicuous courage mr spugg drew himself up with legitimate pride i shall keep one and let alfred keep the other till they come back then he added as an afterthought they may never come back  from that day on mr spugg with his french medal on his watch chain was the most conspicuous figure in the club he was pointed out as having done more than any other one man in the institution to keep the flag flying but presently the limit of mr spuggs efforts and sacrifices was reached even patriotism such as his must have some bounds  on entering the club one afternoon i could hear his voice bawling vociferously in one of the telephone cabinets in the hall hello washington he was shouting is that washington long distance i want washington  fifteen minutes later he came up to the sitting room still flushed with indignation and excitement thats the limit he said the absolute limit  whats the matter i asked  they drafted my son alfred he answered  just imagine it when were so busy in the office that were getting down there at half past eight in the morning drafted alfred great caesar i said to them look here youve had my chauffeur and hes gassed and youve had my gardener and hes torpedoed and theyre both prisoners and last month i sent you my own man that i said is about the limit  what did they say i asked  oh its all right theyve fixed it all up and theyve apologized as well alfred wont go of course but it makes one realise that you can carry a thing too far why theyd be taking me next  oh surely not i said     3if germany had won  sometimes in the past we have grown a little impatient with our north american civilisation with its strident clamour its noisy elections its extremes of liberty its occasional corruption and the faults that we now see were the necessary accompaniments of its merits but let us set beside it a picture such as this taken from the new york imperial gazette of 1925or from any paper of the same period such as would have been published if germany had won    general boob of boobenstiff imperial governor of new york will attend divine imperial service on sunday morning next at the church of st john the imperial divine the subway cars will be stopped while the general is praying all subway passengers are enjoined befohlen during the thustobeordered period of cessation to remain in a reverential attitude those in the seats will keep the head bowed those holding to the straps will elevate one leg keeping the knee in the air  on monday evening general boob von boobenstiff imperial governor of new york will be graciously pleased to attend a performance at the imperial winter garden on upper imperial broadway it is ordered that on the entrance of his excellency the audience will spontaneously rise and break into three successive enthusiastic cheers mr al jolson will remain kneeling on the stage till the gubernatorial all highest has seated itself mr jolson will then by special imperial permission be allowed to make four jokes in german to be taken from a list supplied by the imperial censor of humour the governor accompanied by his military staff will then leave and the performance will close    it is ordered that on tuesday afternoon as a sign of thankfulness for the blessings of the german peace the business men of new york shall walk in procession from the battery to the bronx they will then be inspected by governor boobenstiff if the governor is delayed in arriving at the hereaftertobeindicated point of general putyourselfthere the procession will walk back to the battery and back again continuing so pro and con till the arrival of the governor    the approaching visit of his royal and imperial solemnity the prince apparent of bavaria shall be heralded in the imperial city of new york with general rejoicing the city shall be spontaneously decorated with flags smiles of cordial welcome shall appear on every face animated crowds of eager citizens shall move to and fro and shouts of welcome shall by order of the chief of police break from the lips among those who are expected to be in the imperial city to welcome his royal solemnity will be the hereditary grand duke of schlitzinmein formerly milwaukee the prince margrave of wisconsin and the hereditary chief constable of nevada    we are delighted to be able to chronicle that on the morning of the 14th there was born at the imperial residence of his simplicity the hereditary governor of the provinz formerly state of new york in the imperial city of albany a tenth son to the illustrious prince and princess who rule over us with such fatherly care the boy was christened yesterday at the imperial lutheran church and is to bear the name frederick wilhelm amelia mary johan heinrich ruprecht the whole city of albany is thrown into the wildest rejoicing the legislature has voted an addition of 400000 per annum to the civil list for the maintenance of the young prince joy suffuses every home this being the tenth son born to their highnesses in ten years it is felt that the future of the dynasty is more or less secured even the humblest home is filled with the reflected joy that streams out from the residency their royal highnesses appeared yesterday on the balcony amid the wild huzzoos of the people transported with joy his simplicity the prince wore the full dress uniform of an imperial jaeger of the adirondacks and her royal highness was attired as a colonel of artillery it is impossible to express the jubilation of the moment    we regret to report that owing to the jostling possibly accidental but none the less actual of an imperial officerfieldlieutenant schmidtat the entrance to brooklyn bridge the bridge is declared closed to the public until further notice we are proud to state the field lieutenant at once cut down his cowardly assailant with his saber it has pleased his unspeakable loftiness the german emperor to cable his congratulations to the lieutenant who will receive the order of the dead dog for the noble way in which he has maintained the traditions of his uniform    a striking feature of the nowtakingplace art exhibition at the kaiser wilhelm institute formerly metropolitan gallery in the thiergarten formerly central park is offered by the absolutely marvellous paintings exhibited by the princess marie paul cecilie hohenzollernstickitintothem a cousin of our noble governor the paintings which the princess has been preciously pleased to paint and has even stooped to exhibit to the filledwithwonder eye of the public have been immediately awarded the first prize in each class while it would be invidious even to suggest that any one of her high incipiencys pictures is better than any other our feeling is that especially the picture night on the hudson river is of so rare a quality both of technique and of inspiration that it supersedes the bounds of the hithertothoughttobepossible art in america the princesss conception of night black as a pall and yet luminous as a polished stove pipe is only equalled by her feeling towards the hudson which lies extended in soporific superficiality beneath the sable covering of darkness in which her highness has been pleased to overwhelm it throughout the day an eagertosee crowd of spectators were beaten back from the picture by the police with clubs    we are permitted officially to confirm the already gladlyfrommouthtomouthwhispered news of an approaching marriage between prince heinrich of texas and the princess amelia victoria louisa hereditary heir consumptive of the imperial provinz of maine the marriage so it is whispered although performed in accordance with the wishes of the emperor as expressed by cable is in every way a love match what lends a touch of romance to the betrothal of the royal younglings is that the prince had never even seen the princess amelia until the day when the legislature of the provinz of maine voted her a marriage portion of half a million dollars immediately on this news a secret visit was arranged the prince journeying to bangor incognito as the count of flimflam in the costume of an officer of the imperial scavengers on receipt of the emperors telegram the happy pair fell in love with one another at once what makes the approaching union particularly auspicious for the whole country is that it brings with it the union of maine and texas henceforth to form a single grateful provinz the royal pair it is understood will live alternately in each province a month at a time and the legislature the executive officials the courts of law and the tax collectors will follow them to and fro  we cannot but contrast this happy issue with the turbulence and disorder in which our country lived before the great war of liberation    we are delighted to learn from our despatches from boston that the hohenzollern institute formerly harvard university is to be opened next autumn by express permission of the imperial government classes in english will be permitted for half an hour each day  by the clemency of the emperor the sentences of w h taft and w wilson have been commuted from the sentence of fifty years imprisonment to imprisonment for life we hope in a special supplement to be able to add the full list of sentences executions imprisonments fines and attainders that have been promulgated in honour of the birthday of our imperial sovereign     4war and peace at the galaxy club  the great peace kermesse at the galaxy club to which i have the honour to belong held with a view to wipe out the peace deficit of the club has just ended for three weeks our club house has been a blaze of illumination we have had four orchestras in attendance there have been suppers and dances every night our members have not spared themselves  the kermesse is now over we have time as our lady members are saying to turn round  for the moment we are sitting listening amid bursts of applause to our treasurers statement as we hear it we realise that this peace kermesse has proved the culmination and crown of four winters war work  but i must explain from the beginning  our efforts began with the very opening of the war we felt that a rich organisation like ours ought to do something for the relief of the belgians at the same time we felt that our members would rather receive something in the way of entertainment for their money than give it straight out of their pockets  we therefore decided first to hold a public lecture in the club and engaged the services of professor dry to lecture on the causes of the war  in view of the circumstances professor dry very kindly reduced his lecture fee which he assured us is generally two hundred and fifty dollars to two hundred and forty  the lecture was most interesting professor dry traced the causes of the war backwards through the middle ages he showed that it represented the conflict of the brachiocephalic culture of the wendic races with the dolichocephalic culture of the alpine stock at the time when the lights went out he had got it back to the eighth century before christ  unfortunately the night being extremely wet was unfavourable few of our members care to turn out to lectures in wet weather the treasurer was compelled to announce to the committee a net deficit of two hundred dollars some of the ladies of the committee moved that the entire deficit be sent to the belgians but were overruled by the interference of the men  but the error was seen to have been in the choice of the lecturer our members were no longer interested in the causes of the war the topic was too old we therefore held another public lecture in the club on the topic what will come after the war it was given by a very talented gentleman a mr guess a most interesting speaker who reduced his fee as the thing was a war charity by onehalf leaving it at three hundred dollars unhappily the weather was against us it was too fine our members scarcely care to listen to lectures in fine weather and it turned out that our members are not interested in what will come after the war the topic is too new our receipts of fifty dollars left us with a net deficit of two hundred and fifty our treasurer therefore proposed that we should carry both deficits forward and open a special patriotic entertainment account showing a net total deficit of four hundred and fifty dollars  in the opinion of the committee our mistake had been in engaging outside talent it was felt that the cost of this was prohibitive it was better to invite the services of the members of the club themselves a great number of the ladies expressed their willingness to take part in any kind of war work that took the form of public entertainment  accordingly we presented a play it was given in the ball room of the club house a stage being specially put up for us by a firm of contractors the firm as a matter of patriotism did the whole thing for us at cost merely charging us with the labour the material the time the thought and the anxiety that they gave to the job but for nothing else in fact the whole staging including lights plumbing and decorations was merely a matter of five hundred dollars the plumbers very considerately made no charge for their time but only for their work  it was felt that it would be better to have a new play than an old we selected a brilliant little modern drawingroom comedy never yet presented the owner of the copyright a theatrical firm let us use it for a merely nominal fee of two hundred dollars including the sole right to play the piece forever there being only twentyeight characters in it it was felt to be more suitable than a more ambitious thing the tickets were placed at one dollar no one being admitted free except the performers themselves and the members who very kindly acted as scene shifters curtain lifters ushers doorkeepers programme sellers and the general committee of management all the performers at their own suggestion supplied their own costumes charging nothing to the club except the material and the cost of dressmaking beyond this there was no expense except for the fee very reasonable of mr skip the professional coach who trained the performers and who asked us in view of the circumstances less than half of what he would have been willing to accept  the proceeds were to be divided between the belgian fund and the red cross giving fifty per cent to each a motion in amendment from the ladies financial committee to give fifty per cent to the belgian fund and sixty per cent to the red cross was voted down  unfortunately it turned out that the idea of a play was a mistake in judgment our members it seemed did not care to go to see a play except in a theatre a great number of them however very kindly turned out to help in shifting the scenery and in acting as ushers  our treasurer announced as the result of the play a net deficit of twelve hundred dollars he moved with general applause that it be carried forward  the total deficit having now reached over sixteen hundred dollars there was a general feeling that a very special effort must be made to remove it it was decided to hold weekly patriotic dances in the club ball room every saturday evening no charge was made for admission to the dances but a war supper was served at one dollar a head  unfortunately the dances as first planned proved again an error it appeared that though our members are passionately fond of dancing few if any of them cared to eat at night the plan was therefore changed the supper was served first and was free and for the dancing after supper a charge was made of one dollar per person this again was an error it seems that after our members have had supper they prefer to go home and sleep after one winter of dancing the treasurer announced a total patriotic relief deficit of five thousand dollars to be carried forward to next year this sum duly appeared in the annual balance sheet of the club the members especially the ladies were glad to think that we were at least doing something for the war  at this point some of our larger men themselves financial experts took hold they said that our entertainments had been on too small a scale they told us that we had been undermined by overhead expenses the word overhead was soon on everybodys lips we were told that if we could distribute our overhead it would disappear it was therefore planned to hold a great war kermesse with a view to spreading out the overhead so thin that it would vanish  but it was at this very moment that the armistice burst upon us in a perfectly unexpected fashion everyone of our members was undoubtedly delighted that the war was over but there was a very general feeling that it would have been better if we could have had a rather longer notice of what was coming it seemed as many of our members said such a leap in the dark to rush into peace all at once it was said indeed by our best business men that in financial circles they had been fully aware that there was a danger of peace for some time and had taken steps to discount the peace risk  but for the club itself the thing came with a perfect crash the whole preparation of the great kermesse was well under way when the news broke upon us for a time the members were aghast it looked like ruin but presently it was suggested that it might still be possible to save the club by turning the whole affair into a peace kermesse and devoting the proceeds to some suitable form of relief luckily it was discovered that there was still a lot of starvation in russia and fortunately it turned out that in spite of the armistice the turks were still killing the armenians  so it was decided to hold the kermesse and give all the profits realised by it to the victims of the peace everybody set to work again with a will the kermesse indeed had to be postponed for a few months to make room for the changes needed but it has now been held and in a certain sense it has been the wildest kind of success the club as i said has been a blaze of light for three weeks we have had four orchestras in attendance every evening there have been booths draped with the flags of all the allies except some that we were not sure about in every corridor of the club there have been dinner parties and dances every evening the members especially the ladies have not spared themselves many of them have spent practically all their time at the kermesse not getting home until two in the morning  and yet somehow one has felt that underneath the surface it was not a success the spirit seemed gone out of it the members themselves confessed in confidence that in spite of all they could do their hearts were not in it peace had somehow taken away all the old glad sense of enjoyment as to spending money at the kermesse all the members admitted frankly that they had no heart for it this was especially the case when the rumour got abroad that the armenians were a poor lot and that some of the turks were quite gentlemanly fellows it was said too that if the russians did starve it would do them a lot of good  so it was known even before we went to hear the financial report that there would be no question of profits on the kermesse going to the armenians or the russians  and tonight the treasurer has been reading out to a general meeting the financial results as nearly as they can be computed  he has put the net patriotic deficit as nearly as he can estimate it at fifteen thousand dollars though he has stated with applause from the ladies that the gross deficit is bigger still  the ladies financial committee has just carried a motion that the whole of the deficit both net and gross be now forwarded to the red cross society sixty per cent the belgian relief fund fifty per cent and the remainder invested in the war loan  but there is a very general feeling among the male members that the club will have to go into liquidation peace has ruined us not a single member so far as i am aware is prepared to protest against the peace or is anything but delighted to think that the war is over at the same time we do feel that if we could have had a longer notice six months for instance we could have braced ourselves better to stand up against it and meet the blow when it fell  i think too that our feeling is shared outside     5the war news as i remember it  everybody i think should make some little contribution towards keeping alive the memories of the great war in the larger and heroic sense this is already being done but some of the minor things are apt to be neglected when the record of the war has been rewritten into real history we shall be in danger of forgetting what war news was like and the peculiar kind of thrill that accompanied its perusal  hence in order to preserve it for all time i embalm some little samples of it selected of course absolutely at randomas such things always arein the pages of this book  let me begin with     ithe cable news from russia  this was the great breakfasttable feature for at least three years towards the end of the war some people began to complain of it they said that they questioned whether it was accurate here for example is one fortnight of it  petrograd april 14 word has reached here that the    germans have captured enormous quantities of grain on    the ukrainian border april 15 the germans have captured no grain on the    ukrainian border the country is swept bare april 16 everybody in petrograd is starving april 17 there is no lack of food in petrograd april 18 the death of general korniloff is credibly    reported this morning april 19 it is credibly reported this morning that    general korniloff is alive april 20 it is credibly reported that general    korniloff is hovering between life and death april 21 the bolsheviki are overthrown april 22 the bolsheviki got up again april 23 the czar died last night april 24 the czar did not die last night april 25 general kaleidescope and his cossacks    are moving north april 26 general kaleidescope and his cossacks    are moving south april 27 general kaleidescope and his cossacks    are moving east april 28 general kaleidescope and his cossacks    are moving west april 29 it is reported that the cossacks under general    kaleidescope have revolted they demand the maximum    general kaleidescope hasnt got it april 30 the national panrussian constituent universal    duma which met this morning at tenthirty was    dissolved at twentyfive minutes to eleven  my own conclusion reached with deep regret is that the russians are not yet fit for the blessings of the magna carta and the oklahama constitution of 1907 they ought to remain for some years yet under the interstate commerce commission     iisample of special correspondence  new york through london via holland and coming out at madrid mr o howe lurid our special correspondent writing from somewhere near somewhere and describing the terrific operations of which he has just been an eyewitness says  from the crest where i stood the whole landscape about me was illuminated with the fierce glare of the bursting shells while the ground on which i stood quivered with the thunderous detonation of the artillery  nothing in the imagination of a dante could have equalled the lurid and pyrogriffic grandeur of the scene streams of fire rose into the sky falling in bifurcated crystallations in all directions disregarding all personal danger i opened one eye and looked at it  i found myself now to be the very centre of the awful conflict while not stating that the whole bombardment was directed at me personally i am pretty sure that it was  i admit that there was a time at the very beginning of the war when i liked this kind of thing served up with my bacon and eggs every morning in the days when a man could eat bacon and eggs without being labelled a progerman later on i came to prefer the simple statements as to the same scene and event given out by sir douglas haig and general pershingafter this fashion  last night at tenthirty pm our men noticed signs of a light bombardment apparently coming from the german lines     iiithe technical war despatches  the best of these as i remember them used to come from the italian front and were done after this fashion  tintino near trombono friday april 3 the germans as i foresaw last month they would have crossed the piave in considerable force their position as i said it would be is now very strong the mountains bordering the valley runjust as i foresaw they wouldfrom northwest to southeast the country in front is as i anticipated flat venice is as i assured my readers it would be about thirty miles distant from the piave which falls as i expected it would into the adriatic     ivthe war prophecies  startling prophecy in paris all paris is wildly excited over the extraordinary prophecy of madame cleo de clichy that the war will be over in four weeks madame cleo who is now as widely known as a diseuse a liseuse a friseuse and a clairvoyante leaped into sudden prominence last november by her startling announcement that the seven letters in the kaisers name w i l h e l m represented the seven great beasts of the apocalypse in the next month she electrified all paris by her disclosure that the four letters of the word c z a rby substituting the figure 1 for c 9 for z 1 for a and 7 for r produce the date 1917 and indicated a revolution in russia the salon of madame cleo is besieged by eager crowds night and day she may prophesy again at any minute  startling forecast a russian peasant living in semipalatinsk has foretold that the war will end in august the wildest excitement prevails not only in semipalatinsk but in the whole of it  extraordinary prophecy rumbumbabad india april 1 the whole neighbourhood has been thrown into a turmoil by the prophecy of ram slim a yogi of this district who has foretold that the war will be at an end in september people are pouring into rumbumbabad in oxcarts from all directions business in rumbumbabad is at a standstill  excitement in midgeville ohio william bessemer jones a retired farmer of cuyahoga ohio has foretold that the war will end in october people are flocking into midgeville in lumber wagons from all parts of the country jones who bases his prophecy on the bible had hitherto been thought to be halfwitted this is now recognised to have been a wrong estimate of his powers business in midgeville is at a standstill  dogs foot wyoming april 1 an indian of the cheyenne tribe has foretold that the war will end in december business among the indians is at a standstill     vdiplomatic revelations  these were sent out in assortments and labelled vienna via london through stockholm after reading them with feverish eagerness for nearly four years i decided that they somehow lack definiteness here is the way they ran  special correspondence i learn from a very high authority whose name i am not at liberty to mention speaking to me at a place which i am not allowed to indicate and in a language which i am forbidden to usethat austriahungary is about to take a diplomatic step of the highest importance what this step is i am forbidden to say but the consequences of itwhich unfortunately i am pledged not to disclosewill be such as to effect results which i am not free to enumerate     via new german peace formula  dr hertling the imperial chancellor speaking through his hat in the reichstag said that he wished to state in the clearest language of which he was capable that the german peace plan would not only provide the fullest self determination of all ethnographic categories but would predicate the political self consciousness politisches selbstbewusztsein of each geographical and entomological unit subject only to the necessary rectilinear guarantees for the seismographic action of the german empire the entire reichstag especially the professorial section of it broke into unrestrained applause it is felt that the new formula is the equivalent of a german magna cartaor as near to it as they can get     viithe financial news  the war finance as i remember it always supplied items of the most absorbing interest i do not mean to say that i was an authority on finance or held any official position in regard to it but i watched it i followed it in the newspapers when the war began i knew nothing about it but i picked up a little bit here and a little bit there until presently i felt that i had a grasp on it not easily shaken off  it was a simple matter anyway take the case of the rouble it rose and it fell but the reason was always perfectly obvious the russian news ran as i got it in my newspapers like this  m touchusoff the new financial secretary of the soviet has declared that russia will repay her utmost liabilities roubles rose  m touchusoff the late financial secretary of the soviet was thrown into the neva last evening roubles fell  m gorky speaking in london last night said that russia was a great country roubles rose  a dutch correspondent who has just beat his way out of russia reports that nothing will induce him to go back roubles fell  mr arthur balfour speaking in the house of commons last night paid a glowing tribute to the memory of peter the great roubles rose  the local bolsheviki of new york city at the panrussian congress held in murphys rooms fourth avenue voted unanimously in favor of a free russia roubles never budged  with these examples in view anybody i think could grasp the central principles of russian finance all that one needed to know was what m touchusoff and such people were going to say and who would be thrown into the neva and the rise and fall of the rouble could be foreseen to a kopeck in speculation by shrewd people with proper judgment as to when to buy and when to sell the rouble large fortunes could be made or even lost in a day  but after all the russian finance was simple that of our german enemies was much more complicated and yet infinitely more successful that at least i gathered from the little news items in regard to german finance that used to reach us in cables that were headed via timbuctoo and ran thus  the fourth imperial war loan of four billion marks to be known as the kaisers war loan was oversubscribed today in five minutes investors thronged the banks with tears in their eyes bringing with them everything that they had the bank managers themselves stained with tears took everything that was offered each investor received a button proudly displayed by the toohappyforwords outofthebankhustling recipient     6some just complaints about the war  no patriotic man would have cared to lift up his voice against the government in war time personally i should not want to give utterance even now to anything in the way of criticism but the complaints which were presented below came to me unsought and unsolicited and represented such a variety of sources and such just and unselfish points of view that i think it proper for the sake of history to offer them to the public  i give them just as they reached me without modifications of any sort   the just complaint of mr threadler my tailor as expressed while measuring me for my winthewar autumn suit  complaint sir oh no we have no complaint to make in our line of business none whatever fortytwo mr jephson it would hardly become us to complain side pockets mr jephson but we think perhaps it is rather a mistake for the government thirtythree on the leg to encourage the idea of economy in dress our attitude is that the well dressed man a little fuller in the chest yes a little fuller in the chest please mr jephson is better able to serve his country than the man who goes about in an old suit the motto of our trade is thrift with taste it was made up in our spring convention of five hundred members in a four day sitting we feel it to be twentyeight very appropriate our feeling is that a gentleman wearing one of our thrift worsteds under one of our winthewar light overcoats mr jephson please show that new winthewar overcoating is really helping to keep things going we like to reflect sir nothing in shirtings today that were doing our bit too in presenting to the enemy an undisturbed nation of well dressed men nothing else sir the week after next ah if we can sir but were greatly rushed with our new and patriotic thrift orders good morning sir   the just complaint of madame pavalucini the celebrated contralto as interviewed incidentally in the palmroom of the slitz hotel over a cup of tea one dollar french winthewar pastry one fifty and helpthenavy cigarettes fifty  i would not want to creetecize ze gouvermen ah non that would be what you call a skonk treeck hein madame pavalucini comes from missouri and dares not talk any other kind of english than this while on tour with any strangers listening but i ask myself ees it not just a leetle wrong to discourage and tax ze poor artistes we are doing our beet hein we seeng we recite i seeng so many beautiful sings to ze soldiers sings about love and youth and passion and spring and kisses and the men are carried off their feet they rise they rush to the war i have seen them in my patriotic concerts where i accept nothing but my expenses and my fee and give all that is beyond to the war only last night one arose right in the front rankthe fauteuils dorchestre i do not know how you call them in english let me out of zis he scream me for the war me for the trenches was it not magnifiquewhat you call splendide hein  and then ze gouvermen come and tell me i must pay zem ten thousan dollars when i make only seexty thousan dollars at ze opera anozzer skonk treeck hein   the just complaint of mr grunch income tax payer as imparted to me over his own port wine after dinner  no i shouldnt want to complain i mean in any way that would reach the outsidereach it that is in connection with my name though i think that the thing ought to be said by somebody i think you might say it let me pour you out another glass of this conquistador yes its the old 87 but i suppose well never get any more of it on this side they say that the rich spaniards are making so much money theyre buying up every cask of it and it will never be exported again just another illustration of the way that the war hits everybody alike but as i was saying i think if you were to raise a complaint about the income tax youd find the whole countryi mean all the men with incomesbehind you i dont suppose theyd want you to mention their names but theyd be behind you see theyd all be there will you try one of these googoolias theyre the very best but i guess well never see them again they say the rich cubans are buying them up so the war hits us there too as i see it the income tax is the greatest mistake the government ever made it hits the wrong man it falls on the man with an income and lets the other man escape the way i look at it and the way all the men that will be behind you look at it is that if a man sticks tight to it and goes on earning all the income he can hes doing his bit in his own way to win the war all we ask is to be let alone dont put that in your notes as from me but you can say it let us alone to go on quietly piling up income till we get the germans licked but if you start to take away our income you discourage us you knock all the patriotism out of us to my mind a mans income and his patriotism are the same thing but of course dont say that i said that   the just complaint of my barber as expressed in the pauses of his operations  im not saying nothing against the government any facial massage this morning i guess they know their own business or theyd ought to anyway but i kick at all this talk against the barber business in war time will i singe them ends a bit the papers are full of it all the time i dont see much else in them last week i saw where a feller said that all the barber shops ought to be closed up bay rum till the war was over say id like to have him right here in this chair with a razor at his throat the way i have you as i see it the barber business is the most necessary business in the whole war a manll get along without everything else just about but he cant get along without a shave can heor not without losing all the pep and selfrespect that keeps him going they say them fellers over in france has to shave every morning by military order if they didnt the germans would have em beat i say the barber is doing his bit as much as any man i was to washington four months last winter and i done all the work of three senators and two congressmen will i clip that neck and i done the work of a united states admiral every saturday night if that aint war work show me what is but i dont kick i just go along if a man appreciates what i do and likes to pay a little extra for it why so much the better but if hes low enough to get out of this chair youre in and walk off without giving a cent more than he has to why let him go but sometimes when i get thinking about all this outcry about barbers work in war time i feel like following the man to the door and slitting his throat for him thank you sir thank you sir good morning next   the just complaint of mr singlestoneformerly mr einstein theatre proprietor  i would be the last man the very last to say one word against the government i think they are doing fine i think the boys in the trenches are doing fine i think the nation is doing fine but if theres just one thing where theyre wrong its in the matter of the theatres i think it would be much better for the government not to attempt to cut down or regulate theatres in any way the theatre is the peoples recreation it builds them up its all part of a great machine to win the war i like to stand in the box office and see the money come in and feel that the theatre is doing its bit but mind you i think the president is doing fine so all i say is i think the theatres ought to be allowed to do fine too   the just complaint of mr silas heck farmer as interviewed by me incognito at the counter of the gold dollar saloon  yes sir i say the governments in the wrong and i dont care who hears me say is that feller in the slick overcoat listening lets move along a little further theyre right to carry on the war for all the nation is worth thats sound and im with em but they ought not to take the farmer offen his farm there im agin them the farmer is the one man necessary for the country they say they want bacon for the allies well the way i look at it is if you want bacon you need hogs and if there are no men left in the country like me whatll you do for hogs  thanks was you paying for that i guess we wont have another eh two of them things might be bad for a feller  so when i used to listen to the complaints of this sort that rose on every side i was glad that i was not president of the united states  at the same time i do think that the government makes a mistake in taxing the profits of the poor book writers under the absurd name of income but let that go the kaiser would probably treat us worse     isome startling side effects of the war  there is no doubt said mr taft recently that the war is destined to effect the most profound uplift and changes not only in our political outlook but upon our culture our thought and most of all upon our literature  i am not absolutely certain that mr taft really said this he may not have said uplift but i seem to have heard something about uplift somewhere at any rate there is no doubt of the fact that our literature has movedup or down yes the war is not only destined to affect our literature but it has already done so the change in outlook in literary style in mode of expression even in the words themselves is already here  anybody can see it for himself by turning over the pages of our fashionable novels or by looking at the columns of our great american and english newspapers and periodicals  but stoplet me show what i mean by examples i have them here in front of me take for example the london spectator everybody recognised in it a model of literary dignity and decorum even those who read it least admitted this most willingly in fact perhaps all the more so in its pages today one finds an equal dignity of thought yet somehow the wording seems to have undergone an alteration one cannot say just where the change comes in it is what the french call a je ne sais quoi a something insaisissable a sort of nuance not amounting of course to a lueur but stillhow shall one put itsomething  the example that is given below was taken almost word for word indeed some of the words actually were so from the very latest copy of the spectator   editorial from the london spectator  showing the stimulating effect of the war on its literary style  there is no doubt that our boys and the americans are going some on the western front we have no hesitation in saying that last weeks scrap was a cinch for the boys it is credibly reported by our correspondent at the hague that the german emperor the crown prince and a number of other guys were eye witnesses of the fight if so they got the surprise of their young lives while we should not wish to show anything less than the chivalrous consideration for a beaten enemy which has been a tradition of our nation we feel it is but just to say that for once the dirty pups got what was coming to them we are glad to learn from official quarters that his majesty king george has been graciously pleased to telegraph to general pershing soak it to emand then some  meantime the situation from the point of view both of terrain and of tactics remains altogether in our favour the deep salient driven into the german lines near soissons threatens to break up their communications and force a withdrawal on a wide front we cannot make the position clearer to our english readers than by saying that our new lines occupy as it were the form of a baseball diamond with soissons at second base and with our headquarters at the home plate and our artillery support at third our readers will at once grasp the fact that with our advance pivoted on the pitchers box and with adequate cover at short the thing is a leadpipe cinch in fact we have them lashed to the mast  meantime the mood of the hour should be one not of undue confidence or boastfulness but of quiet resolution and deep thankfulness as the archbishop of canterbury so feelingly put it in his sermon in westminster abbey last sunday now that we have them by the neck let us go on in deep and steadfast purpose till we have twisted the gizzard out of them  the archbishops noble words should and will reecho in every english home  critical people may be inclined to doubt the propriety or even the propinquity of some of the literary changes due to the war but there can be no doubt of the excellent effect of one of them namely the increasing knowledge and use among us of the pleasant language of france it is no exaggeration to say that before the war few people in the united states even among the colored population spoke french with ease in fact in some cases the discomfort was so obvious as to be almost painful this is now entirely altered thanks to our military guidebooks and to the general feeling of the day our citizens are setting themselves to acquire the language of our gallant ally and the signs are that they will do it one hears every day in metropolitan society such remarks as have you read soo le foo oh you mean that book by haingri barbooze no i have not read it yet but i have read mong swassant quinz you know by that other man  this is hopeful indeed nor need we wonder that our best magazines are reflecting the same tendency  here for instance are the opening sentences of a very typical serial now running in one of our best periodicals for all i know the rest of the sentences may be like them at any rate any magazine reader will recognize them at once   bonne mere pitou  a conte of old normandy  bonne mere pitou sat spinning beside the porte of the humble chaumiere in which she dwelt from time to time her eyes looked up and down the gran route that passed her door  il ne vient pas she murmured he does not come  she rose wearily and went dedans presently she came out again dehors il ne vient toujours pas she sighed he still does not come  about her in the tall trees of the allee the percherons twittered while the soft roucoulement of the bees murmured drowsily in the tall calice of the choufleur  il nest pas venu she said perfect tense third singular he is not or has not come  can we blame him if he didnt no doubt he was still studying his active verb before tackling mere pitou  but there let it pass in any case it is not only the magazines but the novels themselves that are being transformed by the war witness this   by one of our most popular novelists  it was in the summer house at the foot of the old garden that the awaited declaration came edwin kneeled at angelinas feet at last they were alone the successful barrage of conversation which he had put up at breakfast had compelled her mother to remain in her trenches and had driven her father to the shelter of his dugout her younger brother he had camouflaged with the present of a new fishing rod thus inducing him to retire to the river the communications with the servants had been cut of the strict neutrality of the gardener he was already assured edwin felt that the moment had come for going over the top yet being an able strategist he was anxious not to attempt to advance on too wide a front  angelina he exclaimed raising himself to one knee with his hands outstretched toward her the girl started as at the sound of an air bomb for a moment she elevated her eyes and looked him full in the tangent then she lowered them again but continued to observe him through her mental periscope  angelina he repeated i have a declaration to make  as from what date she questioned quietly edwin drew his watch from his pocket  as from this morning at tenfortysix he said then emboldened by her passive attitude he continued with rising passion in his tone  ever since i first met you i have felt that i could not live without you i am a changed man my calibre is altered i feel ten centimeters wider in the mouth than i did six weeks ago i feel that my path is altered i have a new range and an angle of elevation such as i never experienced before i have hidden my love as best i could till now i have worn a moral gasmask before your family i can do so no longer angelina will you be mine forming with me a single unit drawing our rations from the same field kitchen and occupying the same divisional headquarters  the girl seemed to hesitate she raised her eyes to his  we know one another so little she murmured  edwin felt that his offensive was failing he therefore hastened to bring up his means of support  i have an ample income of my own he pleaded  angelina raised her eyes again it was evident that she was about to surrender but at this moment her mothers voice was heard calling angelina angelina my dear where are you  the barrage had broken down  quick said the girl mobilize yourself pick up that tennis racket and let us hurry to the court and dig ourselves in  but my declaration urged edwin eagerly  accepted she said as from eleventwo this morning     vother impossibilities   1the art of conversation   ihow to introduce two people to one another  nothing is more important in introducing two people to each other than to employ a fitting form of words the more usually recognized forms are easily learned and committed to memory and may be utilized as occasion requires i pass over such rudimentary formulas as ed shake hands with jim taylor or boys this is pete the new hand pete get hold of the end of that canthook in fact we are speaking only of polite society as graced by the fair sex the only kind that we need care about   the third avenue procedure  a very neat and convenient form is that in vogue in third avenue circles new york as for instance at a fiftycentsahead dance ladies free in the hall of the royal knights of benevolence  miss summerside meet mr ohara after which miss summerside says very distinctly mr ohara and mr ohara says with equal clearness miss summerside in this circle a mark of exquisite breeding is found in the request to have the name repeated i dont quite catch the name says mr ohara critically then he catches it and repeats itmiss summerside  catching the name is a necessary part of this social encounter if not caught the first time it must be put over again the peculiar merit of this introduction is that it lets miss summerside understand clearly that mr ohara never heard of her before that helps to keep her in her place  in superior circles however introduction becomes more elaborate more flattering more unctuous it reaches its acme in what everyone recognizes at once as   the clerical method  this is what would be instinctively used in anglican circlesas for example by the episcopal bishop of boof in introducing a canon of the church to one of the lady workers of the congregation meaning a lady too rich to work who is expected to endow a crib in the diocesan home for episcopal cripples a certain quantity of soul has to be infused into this introduction anybody who has ever heard it can fill in the proper accentuation which must be very rich and deep  oh mrs putitover may i introduce my very dear old friend canon cutitout the canon mrs putitover is one of my dearest friends mrs putitover my dear canon is quite one of our most enthusiastic workers  after which outburst of soul the bishop is able to add will you excuse me im afraid i simply must run  personally i have never known or met a bishop in society in any other situation than just about to run where they run to i do not know but i think i understand what they run from   the lounge room of the club  equally high in the social scale but done quite differently is the club introduction it is done by a club man who for the life of him cant remember the names of either of the two club men whom he is introducing and who each for the life of him cant think of the name of the man they are being introduced by it runs  oh i say i beg your pardoni thought of course you two fellows knew one another perfectly welllet me introduceurrwurr  later on after three whiskeyandsodas each of the three finds out the names of the other two surreptitiously from the hall porter but it makes no difference they forget them again anyway now let us move up higher in fact very high let us approach the real thing   introduction to he the viceroy of india kcb kcsi sos  the most exalted form of introduction is seen in the presentation of mr tomkins american tourist to he the viceroy of india an aidedecamp in uniform at the foot of a grand staircase shouts mr tomkins an aidedecamp at the top one minute later calls mr thompson another aide four feet further on calls mr torps  then a military secretary standing close to his excellency takes mr tomkins by the neck and bends him down toward the floor and says very clearly and distinctly mr torpentine then he throws him out by the neck into the crowd beyond and calls for another the thing is done mr tomkins wipes the perspiration from his hair with his handkerchief and goes back at full speed to the hoogli hotel calcutta eager for stationery to write at once to ohio and say that he knows the viceroy   the office introduction onesided  this introduction comes into our office slipping past whoever keeps the door with a packet of books under its arm it says  ledd me introduze myself the book proposition vidge i am introduzing is one vidge ve are now pudding on the market  then of two things one  either a crash of glass is heard as the speaker is hurled through the skylight or he walks out twenty minutes later bowing profusely as he goes and leaving us gazing in remorse at a signed document entitling us to receive the masterpieces of american poetry in sixty volumes   on the stage  everything on the stage is done far better than in real life this is true of introductions there is a warmth a soul in the stage introduction not known in the chilly atmosphere of everyday society let me quote as an example of a stage introduction the formula used in the best melodramatic art in the kitchenlivingroom stove right centre of the new england farm  neighbour jephsons son this is my little gal as good and sweet a little gal as mindful of her old father as youll find in all new england neighbour jephsons son shes been my all in all to me this little gal since i laid her mother in the ground five christmases ago the speaker is slightly overcome and leans against a cardboard clock for strength he recovers and goes onhope this is neighbour jephsons son new back from over the seas as fine a lad gal if hes like the folk that went before him as ever followed the sea hope your hand my boy your hand see to his comfort hope while i go and read the good book a spell in the barnyard   the indian formula  many people tired of the empty phrases of society look back wistfully to the simple direct speech of savage life such persons will find useful the usual form of introduction the shorter form prevalent among our north american indians at least as gathered from the best literary model     friends and comrades who are worthy    see and look with all your eyesight    listen with your sense of hearing    gather with your apprehension    bow your heads o trees and hearken    hush thy rustling corn and listen    turn thine ear and give attention    ripples of the running water    pause a moment in your channels    here i bring youhiawatha  the last line of this can be changed to suit the particular case it can just as easily read at the end here is henry edward eastwood or here is hal mcgiverin junior or anything else all names fit the sense that in fact was the wonderful art of longfellowthe sense being independent of the words   the platform introduction  here is a form of introduction cruelly familiar to those who know it it is used by the sourlooking villain facetiously called in newspaper reports the genial chairman of the meeting while he is saying it the victim in his little chair on the platform is a target for the eyes of a thousand people who are wondering why he wears odd socks  the next speaker ladies and gentlemen is one who needs no introduction to this gathering his name here the chairman consults a little card is one that has become a household word his achievements in here the chairman looks at his card again studies it turns it upside down and adds in many directions are familiar to all of you there is a feeble attempt at applause and the chairman then lifts his hand and says in a plain businesslike tonewill those of the audience who are leaving kindly step as lightly as possible he is about to sit down but then adds as a pleasant afterthought for the speaker to brood overi may say while i am on my feet that next week our society is to have a real treat in hearinget cetera and so forth     iihow to open a conversation  after the ceremony of introduction is completed the next thing to consider is the proper way to open a conversation the beginning of conversation is really the hardest part it is the social equivalent to going over the top it may best be studied in the setting and surroundings of the evening reception where people stand upright and agonise balancing a dish of icecream here conversation reaches its highest pitch of social importance one must talk or die something may be done to stave it off a little by vigorous eating but the food at such affairs is limited there comes a point when it is absolutely necessary to say something  the beginning as i say is the hardest problem other communities solve it better than we do   the chinese system  in china conversation between strangers after introduction is always opened by the question and how old are you this strikes me as singularly apt and sensible here is the one thing that is common ground between any two people high or low rich or poorhow far are you on your pilgrimage in life   the penetentiary method  compare with the chinese method the grim but very significant formula that is employed i believe it is a literal fact in the exercise yards of the american penitentiaries what have you brought asks the san quentin or sing sing convict of the new arrival meaning and how long is your sentence there is the same human touch about this the same common ground of interest as in the chinese formula   polite society  but in our polite society we have as yet found no better method than beginning with a sort of medical diagnosishow do you do this admits of no answer convention forbids us to reply in detail that we are feeling if anything slightly lower than last week but that though our temperature has risen from ninetyonefifty to ninetyoneseventyfive our respiration is still normal  still worse is the weather as an opening topic for it either begins and ends as abruptly as the medical diagnosis or it leads the two talkers on into a long and miserable discussion of the weather of yesterday of the day before yesterday of last month of last year and the last fifty years  let one beware however of a conversation that begins too easily   the mutual friends opening  this can be seen at any evening reception as when the hostess introduces two people who are supposed to have some special link to unite them at once with an instantaneous snap as when for instance they both come from the same town  let me introduce mr sedley said the hostess i think you and mr sedley are from the same town miss smiles miss smiles mr sedley  off they go at a gallop im so delighted to meet you says mr sedley its good to hear from anybody who comes from our little town if hes a rollicking humourist mr sedley calls it his little old burg  oh yes answers miss smiles im from winnipeg too i was so anxious to meet you to ask if you knew the mcgowans theyre my greatest friends at home  thewho asks mr sedley  the mcgowanson selkirk avenue  noo i dont think i do i know the prices on selkirk avenue of course you know them  the prices no i dont believe i doi dont think i ever heard of the prices you dont mean the pearsons i know them very well  no i dont know the pearsons the prices live just near the reservoir  no then im sure i dont know them the pearsons live close to the college  close to the college is it near the william kennedys  i dont think i know the william kennedys  this is the way the conversation goes on for ten minutes both mr sedley and miss smiles are getting desperate their faces are fixed their sentences are reduced to  do you know the petersons  no do you know the applebys  no do you know the willie johnsons  no  then at last comes a rift in the clouds one of them happens to mention beverley dixon the other is able to cry exultingly  beverley dixon oh yes rather at least i dont know him but i used often to hear the applebys speak of him  and the other exclaims with equal delight  i dont know him very well either but i used to hear the willie johnsons talk about him all the time  they are saved  half an hour after they are still standing there talking of beverly dixon   the etiquette book  personally i have suffered so much from inability to begin a conversation that not long ago i took the extreme step of buying a book on the subject i regret to say that i got but little light or help from it it was written by the comtesse de z according to the preface the comtesse had moved in the highest circles of all the european capitals if so let her go on moving there i for one after trying her book shall never stop her this is how the comtesse solves the problem of opening a conversation  in commencing a conversation the greatest care should be devoted to the selection of a topic good taste demanding that one should sedulously avoid any subject of which ones visavis may be in ignorance nor are the mere words alone to be considered in the art of conversation much depends upon manner the true conversationalist must in opening invest himself with an atmosphere of interest and solicitude he must as we say in french be prepared to payer les rais de la conversation in short he must give himself an air  there go and do it if you can i admit that i cant i have no idea what the french phrase above means but i know that personally i cannot invest myself with an atmosphere of interest i might manage about two per cent on five hundred dollars but what is that in these days of plutocracy  at any rate i tried the comtesses directions at a reception last week on being introduced to an unknown lady and they failed i cut out nearly all the last part and confined myself merely to the proposed selection of a topic endeavouring to pick it with as much care as if i were selecting a golf club out of a bag naturally i had to confine myself to the few topics that i know about and on which i can be quite interesting if i get started  do you know any mathematics i asked  no said the lady  this was too bad i could have shown her some good puzzles about the squares of the prime numbers up to fortyone  i paused and gave myself more air  how are you i asked on hydrostatics  i beg your pardon she said evidently she was ignorant again  have you ever studied the principles of aerial navigation i asked  no she answered  i was pausing again and trying to invest myself with an air of further interest when another man was introduced to her quite evidently from his appearance a vapid jackass without one tenth of the brain calibre that i have  oh how do you do he said i say ive just heard that harvard beat princeton this afternoon great isnt it  in two minutes they were talking like old friends how do these silly asses do it   when dressed hogs are dull  an equally unsuccessful type of conversation often overheard at receptions is where one of the two parties to it is too surly too stupid or too selfimportant and too rich to talk and the other labours in vain  the surly one is let us say a middleaged thickset man of the type that anybody recognizes under the name money hog this kind of person as viewed standing in his dress suit mannerless and stupid too rich to have to talk and too dull to know how to always recalls to my mind the headline of the market reports in the newspapers dressed hogs are dull  the other party to the conversation is a winsome and agreeable woman trying her best to do her social duty  but tenez as the comtesse of z would say i can exactly illustrate the position and attitude of the two of them from a recollection of my childhood i remember that in one of my nursery books of forty years ago there was a picture entitled the lady in love with a swine a willowy lady in a shimmering gown leaned over the rail of a tessellated pigsty in which an impossibly clean hog stood in an attitude of illmannered immobility with the picture was the rhyming legend     there was a lady in love with a swine    honey said she will you be mine    ill build you a silver sty    and in it you shall lie    honk said he  there was something as i recall it in the sweet willingness of the lady that was singularly appealing and contrasted with the dull mannerless passivity of the swine  in each of the little stanzas that followed the pretty advances of the lady were rebuffed by a surly and monosyllabic honk from the hog  here is the social counterpart of the scene in the picturebook mr grunt capitalist is standing in his tessellated stythe tessellated sty being represented by the hardwood floor of a fashionable drawingroom his face is just the same as the face of the pig in the picturebook the willowy lady in the same shimmering clothes and with the same pretty expression of eagerness is beside him  oh mr grunt she is saying how interesting it must be to be in your place and feel such tremendous power our hostess was just telling me that you own practically all the shoemaking machinery factoriesit is shoemaking machinery isnt iteast of pennsylvania  honk says mr grunt  shoemaking machinery goes on the willowy lady she really knows nothing and cares less about it must be absolutely fascinating is it not  honk says mr grunt  but still you must find it sometimes a dreadful strain do you not i mean so much brain work and that sort of thing  honk says mr grunt  i should love so much to see one of your factories they must be so interesting  honk says mr grunt then he turns and moves away sideways into his little piggy eyes has come a fear that the lady is going to ask him to subscribe to something or wants a block of his common stock or his name on a board of directors so he leaves her yet if he had known it she is probably as rich as he is or richer and hasnt the faintest interest in his factories and never intends to go near one only she is fit to move and converse in polite society and mr grunt is not     2heroes and heroines  what are you reading i asked the other day of a blueeyed boy of ten curled up among the sofa cushions  he held out the book for me to see  dauntless ned among the cannibals he answered  is it exciting i enquired  not very said the child in a matteroffact tone but its not bad  i took the book from him and read aloud at the opened page  in a compact mass the gigantic savages rushed upon our hero shrieking with rage and brandishing their huge clubs ned stood his ground fearlessly his back to a banana tree with a sweep of his cutlass he severed the head of the leading savage from his body while with a back stroke of his dirk he stabbed another to the heart but resistance against such odds was vain by sheer weight of numbers ned was borne to the ground his arms were then pinioned with stout ropes made of the fibres of the boobooda tree with shrieks of exultation the savages dragged our hero to an opening in the woods where a huge fire was burning over which was suspended an enormous caldron of bubbling oil boil him boil him yelled the savages now wrought to the point of frenzy  that seems fairly exciting isnt it i said  oh he wont get boiled said the little boy hes the hero  so i knew that the child has already taken his first steps in the disillusionment of fiction  of course he was quite right as to ned this wonderful youth the hero with whom we all begin an acquaintance with books passes unhurt through a thousand perils cannibals apache indians war battles shipwrecks leave him quite unscathed at the most ned gets a flesh wound which is healed in exactly one paragraph by that wonderful drug called a simple  but the most amazing thing about this particular hero the boy ned is the way in which he turns up in all the great battles and leading events of the world  it was ned for example who at the critical moment at gettysburg turned in his saddle to general meade and said quietly general the day is ours if it is answered meade as he folded his field glass you alone ned have saved it  in the same way ned was present at the crossing of the delaware with washington thus  what do you see ned said washington as they peered from the leading boat into the driving snow  ice said ned my boy said the great american general and a tear froze upon his face as he spoke you have saved us all  here is ned at runningmede when king john with his pen in hand was about to sign the magna carta  for a moment the king paused irresolute the uplifted quill in his hand while his crafty furtive eyes indicated that he might yet break his plighted faith with the assembled barons  ned laid his mailed hand upon the parchment  sign it he said sternly or take the consequences  the king signed  ned said the baron de bohun as he removed his iron vizor from his bronze face thou hast this day saved all england  in the stories of our boyhood in which ned figured there was no such thing as a heroine or practically none at best she was brought in as an afterthought it was announced on page three hundred and one that at the close of neds desperate adventures in the west indies he married the beautiful daughter of don diego the spanish governor of portobello or else at the end of the great war with napoleon that he married a beautiful and accomplished french girl whose parents had perished in the revolution  ned generally married away from home in fact his marriages were intended to cement the nations torn asunder by neds military career but sometimes he returned to his native town all sunburned scarred and bronzed from battle the bronzing effect of being in battle is always noted he had changed from a boy to a man that is from a boy of fifteen to a man of sixteen in such a case ned marries in his own home town it is done after this fashion  but who is this who advances smiling to greet him as he crosses the familiar threshold of the dear old house can this tall beautiful girl be gwendoline the childplaymate of his boyhood  well can it i ask it of every experienced readercan it or can it not  ned had his day in the boyhood of each of us we presently passed him by i am speaking of course of those of us who are of maturer years and can look back upon thirty or forty years of fiction reading ned flourishes still i understand among the children of today but now he flies in aeroplanes and dives in submarines and gives his invaluable military advice to general joffre and general pershing  but with the oncoming of adolescent years something softer was needed than ned with his howling cannibals and his fusillade of revolver shots  so the ned of the adventure books was supplanted by the romantic heroine of the victorian age and the longwinded immaculate who accompanied her as the hero  i do not know when these two first opened their twin career whether fenimore cooper or walter scott began them i cannot say but they had an undisputed run on two continents for half a century  this heroine was a sylph her chiefest charm lay in her physical feebleness she was generally presented to us in some such words as these  let us now introduce to our readers the fair madeline of rokewood slender and graceful and of a form so fragile that her frame scarce fitted to fulfil its bodily functionsshe appeared rather as one of those ethereal beings of the air who might visit for a brief moment this terrestrial scene than one of its earthly inhabitants her large wondering eyes looked upon the beholder in childlike innocence  sounds simple doesnt it one might suspect there was something wrong with the girls brain but listen to this  the mind of madeline elegantly formed by the devoted labours of the venerable abbe her tutor was of a degree of culture rarely found in one so young though scarce eighteen summers had flown over her head at the time when we introduce her to our readers she was intimately conversant with the french italian spanish and provencal tongues the abundant pages of history both ancient and modern sacred and profane had been opened for her by her devoted instructor in music she played with exquisite grace and accuracy upon both the spinet and the harpsichord while her voice though lacking something in compass was sweet and melodious to a degree  from such a list of accomplishments it is clear that madeline could have matriculated even at the harvard law school with five minutes preparation is it any wonder that there was a wild rush for madeline in fact right after the opening description of the heroine there follows an ominous sentence such as this  it was this exquisite being whose person lord rip de viperous a man whose reputation had shamed even the most licentious court of the age and had led to his banishment from the presence of the king had sworn to get within his power  personally i dont blame lord rip a particle it must have been very rough on him to have been banished from the presence of the kingenough to inflame a man to do anything  with two such characters in the story the scene was set and the plot and adventures followed as a matter of course lord rip de viperous pursued the heroine but at every step he is frustrated he decoys madeline to a ruined tower at midnight her innocence being such and the gaps left in her education by the abbe being so wide that she is unaware of the danger of ruined towers after ten thirty pm in fact tempted by the exquisite clarity and fulness of the moon which magnificent orb at this season spread its widest effulgence over all nature she accepts the invitation of her wouldbebetrayer to gather upon the battlements of the ruined keep the strawberries which grew there in wild profusion  but at the critical moment lord de viperous is balked at the very instant when he is about to seize her in his arms madeline turns upon him and says in such icy tones titled villain that you are unhand me that the man is cowed he slinks down the ruined stairway cowed and at every later turn at each renewed attempt madeline cows him in like fashion  moreover while lord de viperous is being thus cowed by madeline the heroine he is also being dogged by the hero this counterpart of madeline who shared her popularity for fifty years can best be described as the longwinded immaculate hero entirely blameless in his morals and utterly virtuous in his conduct he possessed at least one means of defending himself he could make speeches this he did on all occasions with these speeches he dogged lord de viperous here is the style of them  my lord said markham incidentally let it be explained that this particular brand of hero was always known by his surname and his surname was always markham my lord the sentiments that you express and the demeanour which you have evinced are so greatly at variance with the title that you bear and the lineage of which you spring that no authority that you can exercise and no threats that you are able to command shall deter me from expressing that for which however poor and inadequate my powers of speech all these of whom and for what i am what i am shall answer to it for the integrity of that which whether or not is at least as it is my lord i have done or shall i speak more plainly still  is it to be wondered that after this harangue lord rip sank into a chair a hideous convulsion upon his face murmuringit is enough  but successful as they were as hero and heroine markham and madeline presently passed off the scene where they went to i do not know perhaps markham got elected in the legislature of massachusetts at any rate they disappeared from fiction  there followed in place of madeline the athletic sunburned heroine with the tennis racket she was generally called kate middleton or some such plain straightforward designation she wore strong walking boots and leather leggings she ate beef steak she shot with a rifle for a while this boots and beef heroine of the middle nineties made a tremendous hit she climbed crags in the rockies she threw steers in colorado with a lariat she came out strong in sea scenes and shipwrecks and on sinking steamers where she cowed the trembling stewards and dogged the mutinous sailors in the same fashion that madeline used to cow and dog lord rip de viperous  with the boots and beef heroine went as her running mate the outofdoors man whose face had been tanned and whose muscles had been hardened into tempered steel in wild rides over the pampas of patagonia and who had learned every art and craft of savage life by living among the wild hoodoos of the himalayas this airandgrassman as he may be called is generally supposed to write the story he was i all through and he had an irritating modesty in speaking of his own prowess instead of saying straight out that he was the strongest and bravest man in the world he implied it indirectly on every page  here for example is a typical scene in which i and kate figure in a desperate adventure in the rocky mountains pursued by indians  we are about to descend on a single cord from the summit of a lofty crag our sole chance of escape and a frightfully small chance at that from the roving band of apaches  with my eye i measured the fearsome descent below us  hold fast to the line miss middleton i said as i set my foot against a projecting rock please note that the airandgrass hero in these stories always calls the heroine miss middleton right up to the very end  the noble girl seized the knotted end of the buckskin line all right mr smith she said with quiet confidence  i braced myself for the effort my muscles like tempered steel responded to the strain i lowered a hundred fathoms of the line i could already hear the voice of kate far down the cliff  dont let go the line miss middleton i called here was an excellent piece of advice  the girls clear voice floated up to me all right mr smith she called i wont  of course they landed safely at the foot of the cliff after the manner of all heroes and heroines and here it is that kate in her turn comes out strong at the evening encampment frying bacon over a blazing fire of pine branches while the firelight illuminates her leather leggings and her rough but picturesque costume  the circumstances might seem a little daring and improper but the reader knows that it is all right because the hero and heroine always call one another miss middleton and mr smith  not till right at the end when they are just getting back again to the confines of civilization do they depart from this  here is the scene that happens the hero and heroine are on the platform of the wayside depot where they are to part kate to return to the luxurious home of her aunt mrs van der kyper of new york and the airandgrass man to start for the pampas of patagonia to hunt the hoopoo the airandgrass man is about to say goodbye then kate i said as i held the noble girls gloved hand in mine a moment she looked me in the face with the full frank fearless gaze of a sister  yes she answered  kate i repeated do you know what i was thinking of when i held the line while you were half way down the cliff  no she murmured while a flush suffused her cheek  i was thinking kate i said that if the rope broke i should be very sorry  edward she exclaimed  i clasped her in my arms  shall i make a confession said kate looking up timidly half an hour later as i tenderly unclasped the noble girl from my encircling arms i was thinking the same thing too  so kate and edward had their day and then as tennyson says they passed or as less cultivated people put it they were passed up in the air  as the years went by they failed to please kate was a great improvement upon madeline but she wouldnt do the truth was if one may state it openly kate wasnt tough enough in fact she wasnt tough at all she turned out to be in reality just as proper and just as virtuous as madeline  so too with the airandgrass hero for all of his tempered muscles and his lariat and his winchester rifle he was presently exposed as a fraud he was just as longwinded and just as immaculate as the victorian hero that he displaced  what the public really wants and has always wanted in its books is wickedness fiction was recognised in its infancy as being a work of the devil  so the popular novel despairing of real wickedness among the cannibals and in the ruined tower at midnight and on the openair of the prairies shifted its scenes again it came indoors it came back to the city and it gave us the new crop of heroes and heroines and the scenes and settings with which the fiction of today has replaced the heroes and heroines of yesterday the lure of the city is its theme it pursues its course to the music of the ukalele in the strident racket of the midnight cabaret here move the harvard graduate in his dinner jacket drunk at one in the morning here is the hard face of big business scowling at its desk and here the glittering heroine of the hour in her dress of shimmering sequins making such tepid creatures as madeline and kate look like the small change out of a twentyfive cent shinplaster     3the discovery of america     being done into moving pictures and out again  no greater power for education said president shurman the other day has come among us during the last forty years than the moving picture  i am not certain that it was president shurman and he may not have said it the other day nor do i feel absolutely sure that he referred to the last forty years indeed now that i come to think of it i dont believe it was shurman in fact it may have been expresident eliot or was it perhaps president hadley of yale or did i say it myself judging by the accuracy and force of the language i think i must have i doubt if shurman or hadley could have put it quite so neatly theres a touch about it that i recognise  but let that pass at any rate it is something that everybody is saying and thinking all our educators have turned their brains towards the possibility of utilising moving pictures for the purpose of education it is being freely said that history and geography and even arithmetic instead of being taught by the slow and painful process of books and memory can be imparted through the eye  i had no sooner heard of this idea than i became impassioned to put it into practice i have therefore prepared or am preparing a film especially designed for the elementary classes of our schools to narrate the story of the discovery of america  this i should like the reader to sit and see with me in the eye of his imagination but let me first give the plain unvarnished account of the discovery of america as i took it from one of our school histories     christopher columbus otherwise christoforo colombo    the celebrated discoverer of america was born of poor    but honest parents in the italian city of genoa his    mother teresa colombo seems to have been a woman of    great piety and intelligence of his father bartolomeo    colombo nothing is recorded from his earliest youth    the boy christopher developed a passion for mathematics    astronomy geodesy and the other sciences of the    day  but nostop i am going too fast the reader will get it better if we turn it into pictures bit by bit as we go on let the reader therefore imagine himself seated before the curtain in the lighted theatre all ready very good let the music beginstar spangled banner pleaseflip off the lights now then  discovery of america authorized by the board of censors of new york state  there we are that gives the child the correct historical background right away now what goes on next let me see ah yes of course we throw an announcement on the screen thus  christopher columbus mr quinn  here the face of mr quinn in a bowler hat is thrown on the screen and fades out again  we follow him up with  spirit of america miss e dickenson  now we are ready to begin in earnest let us make the scenario together first idea to be expressed  christopher columbus was the son of poor but honest parents  this might seem difficult to a beginner but to those of us who frequent the movies it is nothing the reel spins and we seea narrow roomit is always narrow in the moviesto indicate straitened circumstancescardboard furniturehigh chairs with carved backstwo cardboard beams across the ceiling all this means the middle agesa long dinner tableall the little columbuses seated at itteresa colombo cutting bread at one end of itgives a slice to each one slice that means poverty in the moviesteresa rolls her eyes upall the little children put their hands together and say grace this registers honesty the thing is done let us turn back to the history book and see what is to be put in next  the father of christopher bartolomeo colombo was a man of no especial talent of whom nothing is recorded  thats easy first we announce him on the screen  bartolomeo colombo mr henderson  then we stick him on the film on a corner of the room leaning up against the cardboard clock and looking at the children this attitude in the movies always indicates a secondary character of no importance his business is to look at the others and to indicate forgetfulness of self incompetence unimportance vacuity simplicity note how this differs from the attitudes of important characters if a movie characterone of importanceis plotting or scheming he seats himself at a little round table drums on it with his fingers and half closes one eye if he is being talked to or having a letter or document or telegram read to him he stands facing full and working his features up and down to indicate emotion sweeping over them if he is being exposed which is done by pointing fingers at him he hunches up like a snake in an angle of the room with both eyes half shut and his mouth set as if he had just eaten a lemon but if he has none of these things to express and is only in the scene as a background for the others then he goes over and leans in an easy attitude against the tall cardboard clock  that then is the place for bartolomeo colombo to the clock with him  now what comes next  the young christopher developed at an early age a passion for study and especially for astronomy geometry geodesy and the exact science of the day  quite easy on spins the film young christopher in a garret room all movie study is done in garrets the cardboard ceiling slopes within six inches of his head this shows that the boy never rises from his books he cant on a table in front of him is a little globe and a pair of compasses christopher spins the globe round then he makes two circles with the compasses one after the other very carefully this is the recognised movie symbol for mathematical research  so there we have christopherpoor honest studious full of circles  now to the book again  the young columbus received his education at the monastery of the franciscan monks at genoa here he spent seven years  yes but we can put that on the screen in seven seconds  turn on the film  movie monasteryexterior done in grey cardboardding dong ding dong man in the orchestra with triangle and stickprocession of movie friarsfaces more like thugs but never mindthey are friars because they walk two and two in a procession singing out of hymn books  now for the book again  fra giacomo the prior of the monastery delighted with the boys progress encourages his studies  wait a minute  fra giacomo mr edward sims  mr simss face cleanshaved under a round hat fades in and out then the picture goes on movie monastery interioryoung christopher still at a table with compassesbenevolent friar bending over himchristopher turns the compasses and looks up with a whatdoyouknowaboutthat lookastonishment and delight of friar registered by opening his eyes like a bull frog all this shows study progress application the friars are delighted with the boy  christopher after seven years of study reaches the firm conviction that the world is round  picture christopherwith his globejumps up from tablepasses his fingers round and round the globeregisters the joy of inventionseats himself at table and draws circles with his compasses furiously he fades out  fired with his discovery christopher sets out from the monastery  stop a minute this is a little hard fired how can we show christopher fired we cant perhaps hell be fired if the film is no good but we must omit it just now  he sets out  one second only for this monastery door double cardboard with iron across itchristopher leavingcarries a wallet to mean distance fra giacomo blessing himfade out  for eighteen years columbus vainly travelled through the world on foot offering his discovery at the courts of europe in vain though asking nothing in return for it except a fleet of ships two hundred men and provisions for two years  to anybody not used to scenarios this looks a large order eighteen years seems difficult to put on the screen in reality this is exactly where the trained movie man sees his chance here he can put in anything and everything that he likes bringing in in a slightly mediaeval form all his favourite movie scenes  thus for example here we have first the good old midnight cabaret supper scenethinly disguised as the court of the king of sardinia to turn a cabaret into a court the movie men merely exchange their fifth avenue evening dress for short coats and knee breeches heavily wadded and quilted and wear large wigs quilted pants and wigs register courtiers the courtiers of anybodycharlemagne queen elizabeth peter the great louis quatorze anybody and everybody who ever had courtiers just as men with bare legs mean romans men in peajackets mean detectives and young men drunk in evening dress harvard graduates  the ladies at the court of sardinia wear huge paper frills round their necks otherwise it is the cabaret scene with the familiar little tables and the ukaleles going like mad in one corner and black sarsaparilla being poured foaming into the glasses  in this scene columbus moves up and down twirling his little globe and looking appealingly in their faces all laugh at him his part is just the same as that of the poor little girl trying to sell upstate violets in the midnight cabaret  the court of sardinia fades and the film shows columbus vainly soliciting financial aid from lorenzo the magnificent  stop one minute please  lorenzo the magnificent mr l evans  this scene again is old and familiar it is the wellknown interior representing the grinding capitalist or the bitter banker refusing aid to the boy genius who has invented a patent pearake the only change is that lorenzo wears a huge wig has no telephone and handles a large quill pen to register middle ages which he wiggles furiously up and down on a piece of parchment  so the eighteen years with scenes of this sort turn out the easiest part of the whole show  but let us to the book again  after eighteen years columbus now past the prime of life is presented at the court of queen isabella of spain  just half a moment  queen isabella miss janet briggs  there will be very probably at this point a slight applause from the back of the hall miss briggs was here last week or her astral body wasas maggie of the cattle ranges the impression that she made is passed on to isabella  the queen and her consort king ferdinand of aragon  stop stick him on the film  ferdinand of aragon mr edward giles  large wig flat velvet cap and square whiskerssame makeup as for ferdinand of bulgaria ferdinand of bohemia or any of the ferdinands  were immediately seized with enthusiasm for the marvellous discovery of the genoese adventurer  picture columbus hands his globe to isabella and his compasses to ferdinand they register delight and astonishment the queen turns the globe round and round and holds it up to ferdinand both indicate with their faces wellwhatdoyouknowaboutthis ferdinand makes a circle with the compasses on a tablethe courtiers fickle creatures crowd around they are still dressed as in sardinia eighteen years ago in fact one recognises quite a lot of them when ferdinand draws the circle they fall back in wild astonishment gesticulating frantically what they mean is its a circle its a circle  the king and queen at once place three ships at the disposal of columbus  on with the picture the harbour of the port of palos ships bobbing up and down it is really the oyster boats in baltimore bay but it looks just like palos or near enough notice queen isabella on the right at the top of a flight of steps extending her hand and looking at columbus her gesture means pick a ship any ship you like any colour just as if she were saying pick a card any card you like  we turn again to the history  christopher columbus now arrived at the height of his desire sets out upon his memorable voyage accompanied by a hundred companions in three caravels the pinta the nina and the espiritu santo  ah here we have the movie workthe real thing cardboard caravel tossing on black waterseen first right close to uswe are almost on board of it notice the movie sailors with black whiskers and bare feet bare feet in the movies always means a sailor and black whiskers mean spaniards now we see the caravel a little way outwhoop how she bobs up and down they give her that jolt its done with the machine itself to mean danger there are all three caravelshooperoo see them go up and downstormy night coming all right see the sun setting in the west over the water theyre heading straight for it goodnight columbustake care of yourself out there in the blackness  during the voyage columbus remained continually on deck sleeping at the prow his face towards the new world he saw already in his dreams the accomplishment of his hopes  on goes the picture christopher in the prow of the caravel in the movies a prow is made by putting two little board fences together and propping up a bowsprit lengthwise over them columbus sits up peers intently into the darkness his hand to his browregisters a look do i see america no lies down shuts his eyes and falls into an instantaneous movie sleep his face fades out slowly to music which means that he is going to dream then on the screen the announcement is shown  spirit of america miss e dickenson  and here we have miss dickenson floating in the air above columbus she wears nothing except mosquito netting but she has got on enough of it to get past the censor of the state of new york just enough apparently  miss e dickenson is joined by a whole troop of miss dickensons all in white mosquito netting they go through a series of beautiful evolutions floating over the sleeping figure of columbus the dance they do is meant to typify or rather to signifyas a matter of fact we neednt worry much about what it signified it is an allegory done in white mosquito netting that is generally held to be quite enough let us go back to the book  after a stormtossed voyage of three months  wait a bit turn on the picture again and toss the caravels up and down  during which the food supply threatened to fail  put that on the screen please columbus surrounded by ten sailors dividing up a potato  the caravels arrived in safety at the beautiful island of san salvador columbus bearing the banner of spain stepped first ashore surrounded by a wondering crowd of savages he prostrated himself upon the beach and kissed the soil of the new world that he had discovered  all this is so easy that its too easy it runs into pictures of itself anybody accustomed to the movies can see columbus with his banner and the movie savages hopping up and down around him movie savages are gay gladsome creatures anyway and hopping up and down is their chief mode of expressing themselves add to them a sandy beach with palm trees waving visibly in the wind it is always windy in the movies and the thing is done  just one further picture is needed to complete the film  columbus who returned to europe to lay at the feet of the spanish sovereigns the world he had discovered fell presently under the disfavour of the court and died in poverty and obscurity a victim of the ingratitude of princes  last picture columbus dying under the poignant circumstances known only in the moviesa garret roomceiling lower than evera truckle bed narrow enough to kill him if all else failedteresa colombo his aged mother alone at his bedsideshe offers him medicine in a long spoonthis shows if nothing else would that the man is illhe shakes his headputs out his hand and rests it on the little globereaches feebly for his compassescant manage itrolls up his eyes and fades  the music plays softly and the inexorable film like the reel of life itself spins on announcing     at this theatre    all next week     maggie may       and    walter curran       in    is it worth it  and after that i can imagine the audience dispersing and the now educated children going off to their homes and one saying as he enters  gee i seen a great picture show at school today  yes says his mother and what was it  oh it was all about a gink that went round the cabarets trying to sell an invention what hed got but nobody wouldnt look at it till at last one dame gave him three oyster boats see and so he and a lot of other guys loaded them up and hiked off across the ocean  and where did he go to  africa and he and the other guys had a great stand in with the natives and hed have sold his invention all right but one old dame got him alone in a hut and poisoned him and took it off him  that i think is about the way the film would run when it is finished i must get president shurman or whoever it was to come and see it     4politics from within  to avoid all error as to the point of view let me say in commencing that i am a liberal conservative or if you will a conservative liberal with a strong dash of sympathy with the socialist idea a friend of labour and a believer in progressive radicalism i do not desire office but would take a seat in the canadian senate at five minutes notice  i believe there are ever so many people of exactly this way of thinking  let me say further than in writing of politics i am only dealing with the lights and shadows that flicker over the surface and am not trying to discuss still less to decry the deep and vital issues that lie below  yet i will say that vital though the issues may be below the surface there is more claptrap insincerity and humbug on the surface of politics than over any equal area on the face of any institution  the candidate as such is a humbug the voters as votersnot as fathers brothers or sonsare humbugs the committees are humbugs and the speeches to the extent of about ninety per cent are pure buncombe but oddly enough out of the silly babel of talk that accompanies popular government we get after all pretty good governmentinfinitely better than the government of an autocratic king between democracy and despotic kingship lies all the difference between genial humbug and black sin  for the candidate for popular office i have nothing but sympathy and sorrow it has been my fortune to walk round at the heels of half a dozen of them in different little canadian towns watching the candidate try in vain to brighten up his face at the glad sight of a party voter  one in particular i remember nature had meant him to be a sour man a hard man a man with but little joy in the company of his fellows fate had made him a candidate for the house of commons so he was doing his best to belie his nature  hullo william he would call out as a man passed driving a horse and buggy got the little sorrel out for a spin eh  then he would turn to me and say in a low rasping voice  there goes about the biggest skunk in this whole constituency  a few minutes later he would wave his hand over a little hedge in friendly salutation to a man working in a garden  hullo jasper thats a fine lot of corn youve got there  jasper replied in a growl and when we were well past the house the candidate would say between his teeth  thats about the meanest whelp in the riding  our conversation all down the street was of that pattern  good morning edward giving the potatoes a dose of paris green eh  and in an undertone  i wish to heaven hed take a dose of it himself  and so on from house to house  i counted up from one end of the street to the other that there were living in it seven skunks fourteen low whelps eight mean hounds and two dirty skinflints and all of these merely among the conservative voters it made me wish to be a liberal especially as the liberal voters by the law of the perversity of human affairs always seemed to be the finer lot as they were not voting for our candidate they were able to meet him in a fair and friendly way whereas william and jasper and edward and our bunch were always surly and hardly deigned to give more than a growl in answer to the candidates greeting without even looking up at him  but a liberal voter would stop him in the street and shake hands and say in a frank cordial way  mr grouch im sorry indeed that i cant vote for you and id like to be able to wish you success but of course you know im on the other side and always have been and cant change now  whereupon the candidate would say thats all right john i dont expect you to i can respect a mans convictions all right i guess  so they would part excellent friends the candidate saying as we moved off  that man john winter is one of the straightest men in this whole county  then he would add  now well just go into this house for a minute theres a dirty pup in here thats one of our supporters  my opinion of our own supporters went lower every day and my opinion of the liberal voters higher till it so happened that i went one day to an old friend of mine who was working on the liberal side i asked him how he liked it  oh well enough he said as a sort of game but in this constituency youve got all the decent voters our voters are the lowest bunch of skunks i ever struck  just then a man passed in a buggy and looked sourly at my friend the liberal worker  hullo john he called with a manufactured hilarity got the little mare out for a turn eh  john grunted  theres one of them said my friend the lowest pup in this county john winter  come along said the candidate to me one morning i want you to meet my committee  youll find them he said confidingly as we started down the street towards the committee rooms an awful bunch of mutts  too bad i said whats wrong with them  oh i dont knowtheyre just a pack of simps they dont seem to have any punch in them the one youll meet first is the chairmanhes about the worst dub of the lot i never saw a man with so little force in my life hes got no magnetism thats whats wrong with himno magnetism  a few minutes later the candidate was introducing me to a roomful of heavy looking committee men committee men in politics i notice have always a heavy bovine look they are generally in a sort of daze or doped from smoking free cigars  now i want to introduce you first said the candidate to our chairman mr frog mr frog is our old battle horse in this constituency and this is our campaign secretary mr bughouse and mr dope and mr mudd et cetera  those may not have been their names  it is merely what the names sounded like when one was looking into their faces  the candidate introduced them all as battle horses battle axes battle leaders standard bearers flagholders and so forth if he had introduced them as hatracks or cigar holders it would have been nearer the mark  presently the candidate went out and i was left with the battleaxes  what do you think of our chances i asked  the battleaxes shook their heads with dubious looks  pretty raw deal said the chairman the convention wishing him on us he pointed with his thumb over his shoulder to indicate the departed candidate  whats wrong with him i asked  mr frog shook his head again  no punch he said  none at all agreed all the battle horses  ill tell you said the campaign secretary mr bughouse a voluble man with wandering eyesthe trouble is he has no magnetism no personal magnetism  i see i said  now you take this man shortis that the liberals have got hold of continued mr bughouse hes full of magnetism he appeals  all the other committee men nodded  thats so they murmured magnetism our man hasnt a darned ounce of it  i met shortis the other night in the street went on mr bughouse and he said come on up to my room in the hotel oh i said i cant very well nonsense he said youre on the other side but what does that matter well we went up to his room and there he had whiskey and gin and lagereverything now he says name your drinkwhat is it there he was right in his room breaking the law without caring a darn about it well you know the voters like that kind of thing it appeals to them  well said another of the committee meni think it was the one called mr dope i wouldnt mind that so much but the chief trouble about our man to my mind is that he cant speak  he cant i exclaimed  all the committee shook their heads  not for sour apples asserted mr dope positively now in this riding that wont do our people here are used to first class speaking they expect it i suppose there has been better speaking in this constituency than anywhere else in the whole dominion not lately perhaps not in the last few elections but i can remember and so can some of the boys here the election when sir john a spoke here when the old mackenzie government went out  he looked around at the circle several nodded  remember it as well assented mr mudd as if it were yesterday  well sir continued mr dope ill never forget sir john a speaking here in the odd fellows hall eh  the committee men nodded and gurgled in corroboration  my but he was plastered we had him over at pete robinsons hotel all afternoon and i tell you he was plastered for fair we all were i remember i was so pickled myself i could hardly help sir john up the steps of the platform so were you mudd do you remember  i certainly was said mr mudd proudly committee men who would scorn to drink lager beer in 1919 take a great pride i have observed in having been pickled in 1878  yes sir continued mr dope you certainly were pickled i remember just as well as anything when they opened the doors and let the crowd in all the boys had been bowling up and were pretty well soused you never saw such a crowd old dr greenway boys you remember the old doc was in the chair and he was pretty well spifflocated well sir sir john a got up in that hall and he made the finest most moving speech i ever listened to do you remember when he called old trelawney an ashbarrel and when he made that appeal for a union of hearts and said that the sight of mcguire the liberal candidate made him sick i tell you those were great days you dont get speaking like that now and you dont get audiences like that now either not the same calibre  all the committee shook their heads  well anyway boys said the chairman as he lighted a fresh cigar tomorrow will decide one way or the other weve certainly worked hard enoughhere he passed the box of cigars round to the othersi havent been in bed before two any night since the work started  neither have i said another of the workers i was just saying to the wife when i got up this morning that i begin to feel as if i never wanted to see the sight of a card again  well i dont regret the work said the secretary so long as we carry the riding you see he added in explanation to me were up against a pretty hard proposition here this riding really is liberal theyve got the majority of voters though we have once or twice swung it conservative but whether we can carry it with a man like grouch is hard to say one thing is certain boys if he does carry it he doesnt owe it to himself  all the battle horses agreed on this a little after that we dispersed  and twentyfour hours later the vote was taken and to my intense surprise the riding was carried by grouch the conservative candidate  i say to my surprise but apparently not to anybody else  for it appeared this was in conversations after the election that grouch was a man of extraordinary magnetism he had so they said punch shortis the liberal it seemed lacked punch absolutely even his own supporters admitted that he had no personality whatever some wondered how he had the nerve to run  but my own theory of how the election was carried is quite different  i feel certain that all the conservative voters despised their candidate so much that they voted liberal and all the liberals voted conservative  that carried the riding  meantime grouch left the constituency by the first train next day for ottawa except for paying taxes on his house he will not be back in the town till they dissolve parliament again     5the lost illusions of mr sims  in the club to which i belong in a quiet corner where the sunlight falls in sideways there may be seen sitting of an afternoon my good friend of thirty years standing mr edward sims being somewhat afflicted with gout he generally sits with one foot up on a chair on a brass table beside him are such things as mr sims needs but they are few wealthy as he is the needs of mr sims reach scarcely further than martini cocktails and egyptian cigarettes such poor comforts as these brought by a deferential waiter with let us say a folded newspaper at five oclock suffice for all his wants here sits mr sims till the shadows fall in the street outside when a limousine motor trundles up to the club and rolls him home  and here of an afternoon mr sims talks to me of his college days when he was young the last thirty years of his life have moved in so gentle a current upon so smooth a surface that they have been without adventure it is the stormy period of his youth that preoccupies my friend as he sits looking from the window of the club at the waving leaves in the summer time and the driving snow in the winter  i am of that habit of mind that makes me prone to listen and for this perhaps mr sims selects me as the recipient of the stories of his college days it is it seems the fixed belief of my good friend that when he was young he belonged at college to a particularly nefarious crowd or group that exists in his mind under the name of the old gang the same association or corporate body or whatever it should be called is also designated by mr sims the old crowd or more simply and affectionately the boys in the recollection of my good friend this old gang were of a devilishness since lost off the earth work they wouldnt sleep they despised while indoors they played poker in a blue haze of tobacco smoke with beer in jugs and mugs all round them all night they were out of doors on the sidewalk with linked arms singing songs in chorus and jeering at the city police  yet in spite of life such as this which might appear to an outsider wearing to the intellect the old gang as recollected by mr sims were of a mental brilliancy that eclipses everything previous or subsequent mcgregor of the class of 85 graduated with a gold medal in philosophy after drinking twelve bottles of lager before sitting down to his final examination ned purvis the football halfback went straight from the football field after a hard game with his ankle out of joint drank half a bottle of bourbon rye and then wrote an examination in greek poetry that drew tears from the president of the college  mr sims is perhaps all the more prone to talk of these early days insomuch that since his youth life in the mere material sense has used him all too kindly at an early age indeed at about the very time of his graduation mr sims came into moneynot money in the large and frenzied sense of a speculative fortune begetting care and breeding anxiety but in the warm and comfortable inheritance of a family brewery about as old and as wellestablished as the constitution of the united states in this brewery even today mr sims i believe spends a certain part though no great part of his time he is carried to it i understand in his limousine in the sunnier hours of the morning for an hour or so each day he moves about among the warm smell of the barley and the quiet hum of the machinery murmuring among its dust  there is too somewhere in the upper part of the city a huge silent residence where a noiseless butler adjusts mr simss leg on a chair and serves him his dinner in isolated luxury  but the residence and the brewery and with them the current of mr simss life move of themselves  thus has care passed mr sims by leaving him stranded in a club chair with his heavy foot and stick beside him  mr sims is a bachelor nor is he likely now to marry but this through no lack of veneration or respect for the sex it arises apparently from the fact that when mr sims was young during his college days the beauty and charm of the girls who dwelt in his college town was such as to render all later women mere feeble suggestions of what might have been there was as there always is one girl in particular i have not heard my friend speak much of her but i gather that kate dashaway was the kind of girl who might have made a fit mate even for the sort of intellectual giant that flourished at mr simss college she was not only beautiful all the girls remembered by mr sims were that but she was in addition a good head and a good sport two of the highest qualities that in mr simss view can crown the female sex she had he said no nonsense about her by which term mr sims indicated religion she drank lager beer played tennis as well as any man in the college and smoked cigarettes a whole generation in advance of the age  mr sims so i gather never proposed to her nor came within a measurable distance of doing so a man so prone as is my friend to spend his time in modest admiration of the prowess of others is apt to lag behind miss dashaway remains to mr sims as all else does a retrospect and a regret  but the chief peculiarities of the old gangas they exist in the mind of mr simsis the awful fate that has overwhelmed them it is not merely that they are scattered to the four corners of the continent that might have been expected but apparently the most awful moral ruin has fallen upon them that at least is the abiding belief of mr sims  do you ever hear anything of mcgregor now i ask him sometimes  no he says shaking his head quietly i understand he went all to the devil  how was that  booze says mr sims there is a quiet finality about the word that ends all discussion  poor old curly says mr sims in speaking of another of his classmates i guess hes pretty well down and out these days  whats the trouble i say  mr sims moves his eyes sideways as he sits it is easier than moving his head  booze he says  even apparent success in life does not save mr simss friends  i see i said one day that they have just made arthur stewart a chief justice out west  poor old artie murmured mr sims hell have a hard time holding it down i imagine hes pretty well tanked up all the time these days  when mr sims has not heard of any of his associates for a certain lapse of years he decides to himself that they are down and out it is a form of writing them off there is a melancholy satisfaction in it as the years go by mr sims is coming to regard himself and a few others as the lonely survivors of a great flood all the rest brilliant as they once were are presumed to be boozed tanked burnt out bustup and otherwise consumed  after having heard for so many years the reminiscences of my good friend about the old gang it seemed almost incredible that one of them should step into actual living being before my eyes yet so it happened  i found mr sims at the club one day about to lunch there a thing contrary to his wont and with him was a friend a sallow insignificant man in the middle fifties with ragged sandy hair wearing thin  shake hands with tommy vidal said mr sims proudly  if he had said shake hands with aristotle he couldnt have spoken with greater pride  this then was tommy vidal the intellectual giant of whom i had heard a hundred times tommy had at college so mr sims had often assured me the brightest mind known since the age of pericles he took the prize in latin poetry absolutely without opening a book latin to tommy vidal had been by a kind of natural gift born in him in latin he was a whale indeed in everything he had passed his graduation examination with first class honours plastered he had to be held in his seat so it was recorded while he wrote  tommy it seemed had just blown in to town that morning it was characteristic of mr simss idea of the old gang that the only way in which any of them were supposed to enter a town was to blow in  when did you say you blew in tommy he asked about half a dozen times during our lunch in reality the reckless devilmaycare fellow vidal had blown in to bring his second daughter to a boarding schoola thing no doubt contemplated months ahead but mr sims insisted in regarding tommys movements as purely fortuitous the sport of chance he varied his question by asking when do you expect to blow out tommy tommys answers he forgot at once  we sat and talked after lunch and it pained me to notice that tommy vidal was restless and anxious to get away mr sims offered him cigars thick as ropes and black as night but he refused them it appeared that he had long since given up smoking it affected his eyes he said the deferential waiter brought brandy and curacoa in long thin glasses but mr vidal shook his head he hadnt had a drink he said for twenty years he found it affected his hearing coffee too he refused it affected so it seemed his sense of smell he sat beside us ill at ease and anxious as i could see to get back to his second daughter and her schoolmistresses mr sims who is geniality itself in his heart but has no great powers in conversation would ask tommy if he remembered how he acted as antigone in the college play and was plastered from the second act on mr vidal had no recollection of it but wondered if there was any good bookstore in town where he could buy his daughter an algebra he rose when he decently could and left us as mr sims saw it he blew out  mr sims is kindliness itself in his judgments he passed no word of censure on his departed friend but a week or so later he mentioned to me in conversation that tommy vidal had turned into a kind of stiff the vocabulary of mr sims holds no term of deeper condemnation than the word stiff to be a stiff is the last form of degradation  it is strange that when a thing happens once it forthwith happens twice or even more for years no member of the old gang had come in touch with mr sims yet the visit of tommy vidal was followed at no great distance of time by the blowing in of ned purvis  well well said mr sims as he opened one afternoon a telegram that the deferential waiter brought upon a tray this beats all old ned purvis wires that hes going to blow in to town tonight at seven  forthwith mr sims fell to ordering dinner for the three of us in a private room with enough of an assortment of gin cocktails and scotch highballs to run a distillery and enough vichy water and imported soda for a bath i know old ned he said as he added item after item to the list  at seven oclock the waiter whispered as in deep confidence that there was a gentleman below for mr sims  it so happened that on that evening my friends foot was in bad shape and rested on a chair at his request i went from the lounge room of the club downstairs to welcome the new arrival  purvis i knew all about my friend had spoken of him a thousand times he had played halfback on the football teama big hulking brute of a fellow in fact he was as pictured by mr sims a perfect colossus and he played footballas did all mr simss college chumsplastered old ned so mr sims would relate was pretty well soused when the game started but we put a hose at him at halftime and got him into pretty good shape all men in any keen athletic contest as remembered by mr sims were pretty well tanked up for the lighter nimbler games such as tennis they were reported spifflocated and in that shape performed prodigies of agility  youll know ned said mr sims by his big shoulders i went downstairs  the reception room below was empty except for one man a little gentlelooking man with spectacles he wore black clothes with a waistcoat reaching to the throat a white tie and a collar buttoned on backwards ned purvis was a clergyman his great hulking shoulders had gone the way of all my good friends reminiscences  i brought him upstairs  for a moment in the half light of the room mr sims was still deceived  well ned he began heartily with a struggle to rise from his chairthen he saw the collar and tie of the rev mr purvis and the full horror of the thing dawned upon him nor did the three gin cocktails which mr sims had had stationed ready for the reunion greatly help its geniality yet it had been a maxim in the recollections of mr sims that when any of the boys blew in anywhere the bringing of drinks must be instantaneous and uproarious  our dinner that night was very quiet  mr purvis drank only water that with a little salad made his meal he had a meeting to address that evening at eight a meeting of womendear women he called themwho had recently affiliated their society with the work that some of the dear women in mr purviss own town were carrying on the work as described boded no good for breweries mr purviss wife so it seemed was with him and would also take the platform  as best we could we made conversation  i didnt know that you were married said mr sims  yes said mr purvis married and with five dear boys and three dear girls the eight of them he told us were a great blessing so too was his wifea great social worker it seemed in the cause of womens rights and a marvellous platform speaker in the temperance crusade  by the way mr sims said mr purvis they had called one another mr after the first five minutes you may remember my wife i think perhaps you knew her in our college days she was a miss dashaway  mr sims bowed his head over his plate as another of his lost illusions vanished into thin air  after mr purvis had gone my friend spoke out his mindonce and once only and more in regret than anger  im afraid he said that old ned has turned into a sissy  it was only to be expected that the visits of later friendsthe boys who happened to blow inwere disappointments art hamilton who came next and who had been one of the most brilliant men of the class of 86 had turned somehow into a complete mutt jake todd who used to write so brilliantly in the college paper as recollected by mr sims was now the editor of a big new york daily good things might have been expected of him but it transpired that he had undergone wizening of the brain in fact a number of mr simss former friends had suffered from this cruel disease consisting apparently of a shrinkage or contraction of the cerebellum  mr sims spoke little of his disappointments but i knew that he thought much about them they set him wondering there were changes here that to the thoughtful mind called for investigation  so i was not surprised when he informed me that it was his intention to visit the old place and have a look at it the old place called also the old shop indicated as i knew mr simss college the original scene of the exploits of the old gang in the thirty years since he had graduated though separated from it only by two hundred miles mr sims had never revisited it so is it always with the most faithful of the sons of learning the illumination of the inner eye is better than the crude light of reality college reunions are but for the noisy lip service of the shallow and the interested the deeper affection glows in the absent heart  my friend invited me to come along we would he said blow in upon the place and have a look at it  it was in the fullness of the spring time that we went when the leaves are out on the college campus and when commencement draws near and when all the college even the students are busy  mr sims i noted when i joined him at the train was dressed as for the occasion he wore a round straw hat with a coloured ribbon and light grey suit and a necktie with the garish colours of the college itself thus dressed he leaned as lightly as his foot allowed him upon a yellow stick and dreamed himself again an undergraduate  i had thought the purpose of his visit a mere curiosity bred in his disappointment it appeared that i was wrong on the train mr sims unfolded to me that his idea in blowing in upon his college was one of benefaction he had it in his mind he said to do something for the old place no less a thing than to endow a chair he explained to me modestly as was his wont the origin of his idea the brewing business it appeared was rapidly reaching a stage when it would have to be wound up the movement of prohibition would necessitate said mr sims the closing of the plant the prospect in the financial sense occasioned my friend but little excitement i was given to understand that prohibition in the case of mr simss brewery had long since been written off or written up or at least written somewhere where it didnt matter and the movement itself mr sims does not regard as permanent prohibition he says is bound to be washed out by a turn of the tide in fact he speaks of this returning wave of moral regeneration much as martin luther might have spoken of the protestant reformation but for the time being the brewery will close mr sims had thought deeply it seemed about putting his surplus funds into the manufacture of commercial alcohol itself a noble profession for some time his mind has wavered between that and endowing a chair of philosophy there is and always has been a sort of natural connection between the drinking of beer and deep quiet thought mr sims as a brewer felt that philosophy was the proper thing  we left the train walked through the little town and entered the university gates  gee said mr sims pausing a moment and leaning on his stick were the gates only as big as that  we began to walk up the avenue  i thought there were more trees to it than these said mr sims  yes i answered you often said that the avenue was a quarter of a mile long  so the thing used to be he murmured  then mr sims looked at the campus a dinky looking little spot he said  didnt you say i asked that the arts building was built of white marble  always thought it was he answered looks like rough cast from here doesnt it  well have to go in and see the president i suppose continued mr sims he said it with regret something of his undergraduate soul had returned to his body although he had never seen the president this one in his life and had only read of his appointment some five years before in the newspapers mr sims was afraid of him  now i tell you he went on well just make a break in and then a quick getaway dont lets get anchored in there see if the old fellow gets talking hell go on for ever i remember the way it used to be when a fellow had to go in to see prexy in my time the old guy would start mooning away and quoting latin and keep us there half the morning  at this moment two shabbylooking insignificant men who had evidently come out from one of the buildings passed us on the sidewalk  i wonder who those guys are said mr sims look like bums dont they  i shook my head some instinct told me that they were professors but i didnt say so  my friend continued his instructions  when the president asks us to lunch he said ill say that were lunching with a friend down town see then well make a break and get out if he says he wants to introduce us to the faculty or anything like that then you say that we have to get the twelvethirty to new york see im not going to say anything about a chair in philosophy today i want to read it up first some night so as to be able to talk about it  to all of this i agreed  from a janitor we inquired where to find the president  in the administration building eh said mr sims thats a new one on me the building on the right eh thank you  see the president said a young lady in an anteoffice im not sure whether you can see him just now have you an appointment  mr sims drew out a card give him that he said on the card he had scribbled graduate of 1887  in a few minutes we were shown into another room where there was a young man evidently the presidents secretary and a number of people waiting  will you kindly sit down murmured the young man in a consultingroom voice and wait the president is engaged just now  we waited through the inner door leading to the president people went and came mr sims speaking in whispers continued to caution me on the quickness of our getaway  presently the young man touched him on the shoulder  the president will see you now he whispered  we entered the room the old guy rose to meet us mr simss card in his hand but he was not old he was at least ten years younger than either of us he was in fact what mr sims and i would almost have called a boy in dress and manner he looked as spruce and busy as the sales manager of a shoe factory  delighted to see you gentlemen he said shaking hands effusively we are always pleased to see our old graduates mr samsonno i beg pardon mr simsclass of 97 i seeno i beg your pardon class of 67 i read it wrongly  i heard mr sims murmuring something that seemed to contain the words a look around  yes yes exactly said the president a look round youll find a great deal to interest you in looking about the place im sure mr samson great changes im extremely sorry i cant offer to take you round myself here he snapped a gold watch open and shut the truth is i have to catch the twelvethirty to new yorkso sorry  then he shook our hands again very warmly  in another moment we were outside the door the getaway was accomplished  we walked out of the building and towards the avenue  as we passed the portals of the arts building a noisy rackety crowd of boysevidently to our eyes schoolboys came out jostling and shouting they swarmed past us accidentally no doubt bodychecking mr sims whose straw hat was knocked off and rolled on the sidewalk a janitor picked it up for him as the crowd of boys passed  what pack of young bums are those asked mr sims you oughtnt to let young roughs like that come into the buildings are they here from some school or something  no sir said the janitor theyre students  students repeated mr sims and what are they shouting like that for  theres a notice up that their professor is ill and so the class is cancelled sir  class said mr sims are those a class  yes sir said the janitor thats the senior class in philosophy  mr sims said nothing he seemed to limp more than his custom as we passed down the avenue  on the way home on the train he talked much of crude alcohol and the possibilities of its commercial manufacture  so far as i know his only benefaction up to date has been the two dollars that he gave to a hackman to drive us away from the college     6fetching the doctor from recollections of     childhood in the canadian countryside  we lived far back in the country such as it used to be in canada before the days of telephones and motor cars with long lonely roads and snake fences buried in deep snow and with cedar swamps where the sleighs could hardly pass two abreast here and there on a winter night one saw the light in a farm house distant and dim  over it all was a great silence such as people who live in the cities can never know  and on us as on the other families of that lonely countryside there sometimes fell the sudden alarm of illness and the hurrying drive through the snow at night to fetch the doctor from the village seven miles away  my elder brother and ithere was a long tribe of us as with all country familieswould hitch up the horse by the light of the stable lantern eager with haste and sick with fear counting the time till the doctor could be there  then out into the driving snow urging the horse that knew by instinct that something was amiss and so mile after mile till we rounded the corner into the single street of the silent village  late late at night it waseleven oclock perhapsand the village dark and deep in sleep except where the light showed red against the blinds of the surgery of the doctors roughcast house behind the spruce trees  doctor we cried as we burst in hurry and come jims ill  i can see him still as he sat there in his surgery the burly doctor rugged and strong for all the sixty winters that he carried there he sat playing chessalways he seemed to be playing chesswith his son a medical student burly and rugged already as himself  shut the door shut the door he called come in boys here let me brush that snow off youits my move charlie remembernow what the devils the matter  then we would pant out our hurried exclamations both together  bah he growled ill nothing mere belly ache i guess  that was his term his favorite word for an undiagnosed diseasebelly ache they call it supergastral aesthesia now in a city house it sounds better yet how we hung upon the doctors good old saxon term yearning and hoping that it might be that  but even as he growled the doctor had taken down a lantern from a hook thrown on a huge battered fur coat that doubled his size and was putting medicinesa very shopful it seemedinto a leather case  your horse is done up he said well put my mare in come and give me a hand charlie  he was his own hostler and stableman he and his burly son yet how quickly and quietly he moved the lantern swinging on his arm as he buckled the straps what kind of a damn fool tug is this youve got he would say  then in a moment as it seemed out into the wind and snow again the great figure of the doctor almost filling the seat of the cutter the two of us crushed in beside him with responsibility the unbearable burden gone from us and renewed comfort in our hearts  little is said on the way our heads are bent against the storm the long stride of the doctors mare eats up the flying road  then as we near the farm house and see the light in the sickroom window fear clutches our hearts again  you boys unhitch says the doctor ill go right in  presently when we enter the house we find that he is in the sickroomthe door closed no word of comfort has come forth he has sent out for hot blankets the stoves are to be kept burning we must sit up we may be needed that is all  and there in that still room through the long night he fights singlehanded against death behind him is no human help no consultation no wisdom of the colleges to call in only his own unaided strength and his own firm purpose and that strange instinct in the fight for a flickering life that some higher power than that of colleges has planted deep within his soul  so we watch through the night hours in dull misery and fear a phantom at the window pane so must we wait till the slow morning shows dim and pale at the windows  then he comes out from the room his face is furrowed with the fatigue of his long vigil but as he speaks the tone of his voice is as that of one who has fought and conquered  therehell do now give him this when he wakes  then a great joy sweeps over us as the phantom flees away and we shudder back into the warm sunshine of life while the sound of the doctors retreating sleighbells makes music to our ears  and once it was not so the morning dawned and he did not come from the darkened room only there came to our listening ears at times the sound of a sob or moan and the doctors voice firm and low but with all hope gone from it  and when at last he came his face seemed old and sad as we had never seen it he paused a moment on the threshold and we heard him say i have done all that i can then he beckoned us into the darkened room and for the first time we knew death  all that is forty years ago  they tell me that since then the practice of medicine has been vastly improved there are specialists now i understand for every conceivable illness and for every subdivision of it if i fall ill there is a whole battery of modern science to be turned upon me in a moment there are xrays ready to penetrate me in all directions i may have any and every treatmenthypnotic therapeutic or thaumaturgicfor which i am able to pay  but oh my friends when it shall come to be my lot to be ill and strickenin the last and real sense with the great fear upon me and the dark phantom at the panethen let some one go fast and eagerthough it be only in the paths of an expiring memoryfast and eager through the driving snow to bring him to my bedside let me hear the sound of his hurrying sleighbells as he comes and his strong voice without the doorand if that may not be then let me seem at least to feel the clasp of his firm hand to guide me without fear to the land of shadows where he has gone before
