lightvessels or floating lighthouses which guard the shores of this kingdom and mark the dangerous shoals lying off some of our harbours and roadsteads  it will also convey to youif you dont skipa general idea of the life and adventures of some of the men who have manned these interesting and curious craft in time past as well as give you some account of the sayings and doings of several other personages more or less connected with our coasts  may you read it with pleasure and profit andmay your shadow never be less  i gratefully express my acknowledgment and tender my best thanks to the elder brethren of the trinity house to whose kindness i am indebted for having been permitted to spend a week on board the gullstream lightvessel one of the three floatinglights which mark the goodwin sands and to robin allen esquire secretary to the trinity house who has kindly furnished me with valuable books papers and information  i have also gratefully to tender my best thanks to captain valle district superintendent under the trinity house at ramsgate for the ready and extremely kind manner in which he afforded me every facility for visiting the various lightvessels and buoys of his district and for observing the nature and duties of the service  to the master of the gull whose bunk i occupied while he was on shoreto mr john leggett the mate who was in command during the period of my visitand to the men of the floatinglight i have to offer my heartfelt thanks for not only receiving me with generous hospitality but for treating me with hearty goodwill during my pleasant sojourn with them in their interesting and peculiar home  my best thanks for much useful and thrilling information are due to mr isaac jarman the coxswain and mr fish the bowman of the ramsgate lifeboatmen who may be said to carry their lives continually in their hands and whose profession it is to go out at the call of duty and systematically grapple with death and rob him of his prey  to the harbour master and deputy harbour master at ramsgate i am also indebted for information and assistance and to mr reading the master of the aid steamtug which attends upon and shares the perils of the lifeboat  rm  ballantyne  edinburgh 1870    chapter one  particular inquiries  a lightclear ruddy and brilliant like a huge carbuncleuprose one evening from the deep and remained hovering about forty feet above the surface scattering its rays far and wide over the downs to ramsgate and deal along the coast towards dover away beyond the north foreland across the goodwin sands and far out upon the bosom of the great north sea  it was a chill november evening when this light arose in the year well it matters not what year  we have good reasons reader for shrouding this point in mystery  it may have been recently it may have been long long ago  we dont intend to tell  it was not the first time of that lights appearance and it certainly was not the last  let it suffice that what we are about to relate did happen sometime or other within the present century  besides being cold the evening in question was somewhat stormygusty as was said of it by a traveller with a stern visage and remarkably keen grey eyes who entered the coffeeroom of an hotel which stood on the margin of ramsgate harbour facing the sea and from the upper windows of which the light just mentioned was visible  it is sir said the waiter in reply to the gusty observation stirring the fire while the traveller divested himself of his hat and greatcoat  think its going to blow hard inquired the traveller planting himself firmly on the hearthrug with his back to the fire and his thumbs hooked into the armholes of his waistcoat  it may sir and it may not answered the waiter with the caution of a man who has resolved come what may never to commit himself sometimes it comes on to blow sir wen we dont look for it at other times it falls calm wen we least expects it  i dont pretend to understand much about the weather myself sir but i shouldnt wonder if it was to come on to blow ard  it aint an uncommon thing at ramsgate sir  the traveller who was a man of few words said humph to which the waiter dutifully replied yessir feeling no doubt that the observation was too limited to warrant a lengthened rejoinder  the waiter of the fortress hotel had a pleasant sociable expressive countenance which beamed into a philanthropic smile as he added  can i do anything for you sir  yestea answered the traveller with the keen grey eyes turning and poking the fire with the heel of his boot  anything with it sir asked the waiter with that charmingly confident air peculiar to his class which induces one almost to believe that if a plate of elephants foot or a slice of crocodiles tail were ordered it would be produced hot in a few minutes  dyou happen to know a man of the name of jones in the town demanded the traveller facing round abruptly  the waiter replied that he had the pleasure of knowing at least seven joneses in the town  does one of the seven deal largely in cured fish and own a small sloop asked the traveller  yessir he do but he dont live in ramsgate he belongs to yarmouth sir comes ere only now and then  dyou know anything about him  no sir he dont frequent this otel  the waiter said this in a tone which showed that he deemed that fact sufficient to render jones altogether unworthy of human interest but i believe he added slowly that he is said to ave plenty of money bears a bad character and is rather fond of his bottle sir  you know nothing more  nothing sir  ham and eggs dry toast and shrimps said the keeneyed traveller in reply to the reiterated question  before these viands were placed on the table the brief twilight had passed away and darkness enshrouded land and sea  after they had been consumed the traveller called for the latest local paper to which he devoted himself for an hour with unflagging zealreading it straight through apparently advertisements and all with as much diligence as if it were a part of his professional business to do so  then he tossed it away rang the bell and ordered a candle  i suppose he said pointing towards the sea as he was about to quit the room that that is the floating light  it is one of em sir replied the waiter  there are three lights on the sands sir the northsan ead the gullstream and the southsan ead  that one sir is the gull  how far off may it be  about four miles sir  what is the mates name  welton sir john welton  is he aboard just now  yessir its the masters month ashore  the master and mate ave it month an month about sirone month afloat next month ashore but it seems to me sir that they have arder work wen ashore than they ave wen afloatlookin after the trinity stores sir an goin off in the tender to shift and paint the buoys an such like but then you see sir wen its their turn ashore they always gits home to spend the nights with their families sir wich is a sort of compensation as it werethats where it is sir  humph dyou know what time it is slack water out there in the afternoon just now  about three oclock sir  call me at nine tomorrow breakfast at halfpast beefsteaks coffee dry toast  goodnight  yessirgoodnight sirnumber 27 sir first floor lefthand side  number 27 slammed his door with that degree of violence which indicates a stout arm and an easy conscience  in less than quarter of an hour the keen grey eyes were veiled in slumber as was proved unmistakably to the household by the sounds that proceeded from the nose to which these eyes belonged  it is not unfrequently found that strength of mind vigour of body high colour and a tremendous appetite are associated with great capacity for snoring  the man with the keen grey eyes possessed all these qualities as well as a large chin and a firm mouth full of very strong white teeth  he also possessed the convenient power of ability to go to sleep at a moments notice and to remain in that felicitous condition until he chose to awake  his order to be called in the morning had reference merely to hot water for at the time of which we write men were still addicted to the ridiculous practice of shavinga practice which as every one knows is now confined chiefly to very old menwho naturally find it difficult to give up the bad habit of a lifetimeand to little boys who erroneously suppose that the use of a sharp penknife will hasten natures operations  exactly at nine oclock a knock at the door and ot water sir sounded in the ears of nunber 27  at halfpast nine precisely number 27 entered the coffeeroom and was so closely followed by the waiter with breakfast that it seemed as if that selfsacrificing functionary had sat up all night keeping the meal hot in order to testify by excessive punctuality the devotion of his soul to duty  the keeneyed man had a keen appetite if one might judge from appearances in such a matter  a thick underdone steak that overwhelmed his plate appeared to melt away rapidly from before him  potatoes he disposed of in two bites each small ones were immolated whole  of mustard he used as much as might have made a smallsized plaster pepper he sowed broadcast he made no account whatever of salt and sugar was as nothing before him  there was a peculiar crash in the sound produced by the biting of his toast which was suggestive at once of irresistible power and thorough disintegration  coffee went down in halfcup gulps shrimps disappeared in shoals shells and all andin short his proceedings might have explained to an intelligent observer how it is that so many men grow to be exceedingly fat and why it is that hotel proprietors cannot afford to lower their apparently exorbitant charges the waiter standing modestly by and looking on with solemn interest mentally attributed the travellers extraordinary powers and high health to the fact that he neither smoked nor drank  it would be presumptuous in us to hazard a speculation on this subject in the face of an opinion held by one who was so thoroughly competent to judge  breakfast over the keeneyed man put on his hat and overcoat and sallied forth to the harbour where he spent the greater part of the forenoon in loitering about inspecting the boatsparticularly the lifeboatand the shipping with much interest and entering into conversation with the boatmen who lounged upon the pier  he was very gracious to the coxswain of the lifeboata bluff deepchested hearty neckornothing sort of man with an intelligent eye almost as keen as his own and a manner quite as prompt  with this coxswain he conversed long about the nature of his stirring and dangerous duties  he then made inquiry about his crew how many men he had and their circumstances and by the way whether any of them happened to be named jones  one of them was so named the coxswain saidtom jones  this led the traveller to ask if tom jones owned a small sloop  no he didnt own a sloop not even a boat  was there any other jones in the town who owned a small sloop and dealt largely in cured fish  yes there was and he was a regular gallowsbird if all reports were true the coxswain told him  the traveller did not press the subject long  having brought it up as it were incidentally he dismissed it carelessly and again concentrated his attention and interest on the lifeboat  to all the men with whom he conversed this bluff man with the keen grey eyes put the same question and he so contrived to put it that it seemed to be a matter of comparatively little interest to him whether there was or was not a man of the name of jones in the town  nevertheless he gained all the information about jones that he desired and then hiring a boat set out for the floating light  the weather that had appeared threatening during the night suddenly became calm and fine as if to corroborate the statement of the waiter of the fortress hotel in regard to its uncertainty but knowing men in oilcloth souwesters and long boots gave it as their opinion that the weather was not to be trusted  fortunately for the traveller it remained trustworthy long enough to serve his purpose  the calm permitted his boat to go safely alongside of the lightship and to climb up the side without difficulty  the vessel in which he found himself was not by any means what we should style clipperbuiltquite the reverse  it was short for its length bluff in the bows round in the stern and painted all over excepting the mast and deck of a bright red colour like a great scarlet dragon or a gigantic boiled lobster  it might have been mistaken for the first attempt in the shipbuilding way of an infatuated boy whose acquaintance with ships was founded on hearsay and whose taste in colour was violently eccentric  this remarkable thing had one immense mast in the middle of it supported by six stays like the norse galleys of old but it had no yards for although the sea was indeed its home and it incessantly braved the fury of the storm diurnally cleft the waters of flood and ebbtide and gallantly breasted the billows of ocean all the year round it had no need of sails  it never advanced an inch on its course for it had no course  it never made for any port it was never either homeward or outward bound  no streaming eyes ever watched its departure no beating hearts ever hailed its return  its bowsprit never pointed either to greenlands icy mountains or indias coral strand for it had no bowsprit at all  its helm was never swayed to port or starboard although it had a helm because the vessel turned submissive with the tides and its rudder being lashed hard and fast amidshipslike most weathercockscouldnt move  its doom was to tug perpetually day and night from year to year at a gigantic anchor which would not let go and to strain at a monster chaincable which would not snapin short to strive for ever like sisyphus after something which can never be attained  a sad destiny some may be tempted to exclaim  no reader not so sad as it appears  we have presented but one side of the picture  that curious almost ridiculouslooking craft was among the aristocracy of shipping  its important office stamped it with nobility  it lay there conspicuous in its royal colour from day to day and year to year to mark the fairway between the white cliffs of old england and the outlying shoalsdistinguished in daylight by a huge ball at its masthead and at night by a magnificent lantern with argand lamps and concave reflectors which shot its rays like lightning far and wide over the watery waste while in thick weather when neither ball nor light could be discerned a sonorous gong gave its deeptoned warning to the approaching mariner and let him know his position amid the surrounding dangers  without such warnings by night and by day the world would suffer the loss of thousands of lives and untold millions of gold indeed the mere absence of such warnings for one stormy night would certainly result in loss irreparable to life and property  as well might great britain dispense with her armies as with her floating lights  that boiledlobsterlike craft was also if we may be allowed to say so stamped with magnanimity because its services were disinterested and universal  while other ships were sailing grandly to their ports in all their canvas panoply and swelling with the pride of costly merchandise within each unmindful of the other this ship remained floating there destitute of cargo either rich or poor never in port always on service serene in all the majesty of her one settled selfsacrificing purposeto guide the converging navies of the world safely past the dangerous shoals that meet them on their passage to the worlds greatest port the thames or to speed them safely thence when outwardbound  that unclipperly craft moreover was a gallant vessel because its post was one of danger  when other ships fled on the wings of terroror of storm trysailsto seek refuge in harbour and roadstead this one merely lengthened her cableas a knight might shake loose the reins of his warhorse on the eve of conflictand calmly awaited the issue prepared to let the storm do its worst and to meet it with a bold front  it lay right in the channel too i the imminent deadly breach as it were prepared to risk encounter with the thousands of ships great and small which passed to and fro continuallyto be grazed and fouled by clumsy steersmen and to be run into at night by unmanageable wrecks or derelicts ready for anything in factcome weal come woe blow high blow lowin the way of duty for this vessel was the floating light that marked the gullstream off the celebrated and fatal goodwin sands    chapter two  the floating light becomes the scene of floating surmises and vague suspicions  it must not be supposed from what has been said that the gull lightship was the only vessel of the kind that existed at that time but she was a good type of the class of vessels numbering at present about sixty to which she belonged and both as regarded her situation and duties was and still is one of the most interesting among the floating lights of the kingdom  when the keeneyed traveller stepped upon her wellscrubbed deck he was courteously received by the mate mr john welton a stronglybuilt man above six feet in height with a profusion of red hair huge whiskers and a very peculiar expression of countenance in which were united calm selfpossession coolness and firmness with great goodhumour and affability  you are mr welton i presume said the traveller abruptly touching his hat with his forefinger in acknowledgment of a similar salute from the mate  that is my name sir  will you do me the favour to read this letter said the traveller selecting a document from a portly pocketbook and presenting it  without reply the mate unfolded the letter and quietly read it through after which he folded and returned it to his visitor remarking that he should be happy to furnish him with all the information he desired if he would do him the favour to step down into the cabin  i may set your mind at rest on one point at once observed the stranger as he moved towards the companionhatch my investigations have no reference whatever to yourself  mr welton made no reply but a slight look of perplexity that had rested on his brow while he read the letter cleared away  follow me mr larks he said turning and descending the ladder sailorfashionwhich means crabwise  do you happen to know anything asked mr larks as he prepared to follow about a man of the name of jones  i have come to inquire particularly about him and about your son who i am told  the remainder of the sentence was lost in the cabin of the floating light  here with the door and skylight shut the mate remained closeted for a long time in close conference with the keeneyed man much to the surprise of the two men who constituted the watch on deck because visitors of any kind to a floating light were about as rare as snowflakes in july and the sudden advent of a visitor who looked and acted mysteriously was in itself a profound mystery  their curiosity however was only gratified to this extent that they observed the stranger and the mate through the skylight bending earnestly over several newspapers spread out before them on the cabin table  in less than an hour the keeneyed man reappeared on deck bade the mate an abrupt goodbye nodded to the men who held the ropes for him descended into the boat and took his departure for the shore whence he had come  by this time the sun was beginning to approach the horizon  the mate of the floating light took one or two turns on the deck at which he gazed earnestly as if his future destiny were written there  he then glanced at the compass and at the vessels bow after which he leant over the side of the reddragon and looked down inquiringly at the flow of the tide  presently his attention was fixed on the shore behind which the sun was about to set and after a time he directed a stern look towards the sky as if he were about to pick a quarrel with that part of the universe but thinking better of it apparently he unbent his brows let his eyes fall again on the deck and muttered to himself hm  i expected as much  what it was that he expected mr john welton never told from that day to this so it cannot be recorded here but after stating the fact he crossed his arms on his broad chest and leaning against the stern of his vessel gazed placidly along the deck as if he were taking a complacent survey of the vast domain over which he ruled  it was an interesting kingdom in detail  leaving out of view all that which was behind him and which of course he could not see we may remark that just before him stood the binnacle and compass and the cabin skylight  on his right and left the territory of the quarterdeck was seriously circumscribed and the promenade much interfered with by the ships boats which like their parent were painted red and which did not hang at the davits but like young lobsters of the kangaroo type found shelter within their mother when not at sea on their own account  near to them were two signalcarronades  beyond the skylight rose the bright brass funnel of the cabin chimney and the winch by means of which the lantern was hoisted  then came another skylight and the companionhatch about the centre of the deck  just beyond this stood the most important part of the vesselthe lanternhouse  this was a circular wooden structure above six feet in diameter with a door and small windows  inside was the lanternthe beautiful piece of costly mechanism for which the lightship its crew and its appurtenances were maintained  right through the centre of this house rose the thick unyielding mast of the vessel  the lantern which was just a little less than its house surrounded this mast and travelled upon it  beyond this the capital of the kingdom the eye of the monarch was arrested by another bright brass funnel which was the chimney of the galleyfire and indicated the exact position of the abode of the crew orto continue our metaphorthe populace who however required no such indicator to tell of their existence or locality for the chorus of a nigger melody burst from them ever and anon through every opening in the decks with jovial violence as they sat busily engaged on various pieces of work below  the more remote parts of this landscapeor lightscape if we may be allowed the expressionwere filled up with the galleyskylight the bitts and the windlass above which towered the gong and around which twined the two enormous chain cables  only one of these however was in usethat with a single mushroomanchor being sufficient to hold the ship securely against tide and tempest  in reference to this we may remark in passing that the cable of a floating light is frequently renewed and that the chafing of the links at the hawsehole is distributed by the occasional paying out or hauling in of a few yards of chaina process which is styled easing the nip  horroo me hearty yere as clain as a ladys watch exclaimed a man of rugged form but pleasant countenance as he issued from the small doorway of the lanternhouse with a bundle of waste in one hand and an oilcan in the other  this was one of the lamplighters of the lightshipjerry macgowla man whose whole soul was so to speak in that lantern  it was his duty to clip and trim the wicks and fill the lamps and polish the reflectors and brasses and oil the joints and wheels for this was a revolvingin other words a flashing light and clean the glasses and windows  as there were nine lights to attend to and get ready for nightly service it may be easily understood that the lamplighters duty was no sinecure  the shout of jerry recalled the king from his contemplation of things in general to the lantern in particular  all ready to hoist jerry inquired mr welton going forward  all ready sir exclaimed the man looking at his handiwork with admiration and carefully removing a speck of dust that had escaped his notice from one of the plateglass windows ant she a purty thing nowbaits the best ginaiva watch as iver was made  ye might ait yer supper off her floor and shave in the reflictors  thats a fact jerry with no end of oil to your salad too said mr welton surveying the work of the lamplighter with a critical eye  true for ye replied jerry an as much cotton waste as ye like without sinful extravagance  the sun will be down in a few minutes said the mate turning round and once more surveying the western horizon  jerry admitted that judging from past experience there was reason to believe in the probability of that event and then being of a poetical temperament he proceeded to expatiate upon the beauty of the evening which was calm and serene  dye know sir he said gazing towards the shore between which and the floating light a magnificent fleet of merchantmen lay at anchor waiting for a breezeeach vessel reflected clearly in the water along with the dazzling clouds of gold that towered above the setting sundye know sir i niver sees a sky like that but it minds me o the blissid green hills an purty lakes of owld ireland an fills me buzzum wid a sort of inspiration till it feels fit amost to bust  you should have been a poet jerry observed the mate in a contemplative tone as he surveyed the shipping through his telescope  just what ive often thought mesilf sir replied jerry wiping his forehead with the bunch of wastemany a time ive said to mesilf in a thoughtful mood    wan little knows what dirty cloes   may kiver up a poet   what fires may burn an flout an skurn   an no wan iver know it  thats splendid jerry but whats the meanin of skurn  sorrow wan of me knows sir but it conveys the idee somehow dont it now  im not quite sure that it does said the mate walking aft and consulting his chronometer for the last time after which he put his head down the hatchway and shouted up lights in a deep sonorous voice  ay ay sir came the ready response from below followed by the prompt appearance of the other lamplighter and the four seamen who composed the crew of the vessel jerry turned on his heel murmuring in a tone of pity that the mate poor man had no soul for poethry  five of the crew manned the winch the mate and jerry went to a blocktackle which was also connected with the lifting apparatus  then the order to hoist was given and immediately after just as the sun went down the floating light went upa modest yet allimportant luminary of the night  slowly it rose for the lantern containing it weighed full half a ton and caused the hoisting chain and pulleys to groan complainingly  at last it reached its destination at the head of the thick part of the mast but about ten or fifteen feet beneath the ball  as it neared the top jerry sprang up the chainladder to connect the lantern with the rod and pinion by means of which with clockwork beneath it was made to revolve and flash once every third of a minute  simultaneously with the ascent of the gull light there arose out of the sea three bright stars on the noreastern horizon and another star in the southwest  the first were the three fixed lights of the lightship that marked the north sandhead the latter was the fixed light that guarded the south sandhead  the goodwin sentinels were now placed for the night and the commerce of the world might come and go and pass those dreaded shoals in absolute security  ere long the lights of the shipping in the downs were hung out and one by one the lamps on shore shone forththose which marked the entrance of ramsgate harbour being conspicuous for colour and brilliancyuntil the water which was so calm as to reflect them all seemed alive with perpendicular streams of liquid fire land and sea appearing to be the subjects of one grand illumination  a much less poetical soul than that of the enthusiastic lamplighter might have felt a touch of unwonted inspiration on such a night and in such a scene  the effect on the mind was irresistibly tranquillising  while contemplating the multitudes of vessels that lay idle and almost motionless on the glassy water the thought naturally arose that each black hull enshrouded human beings who were gradually sinking into restrelaxing after the energies of the past daywhile the sable cloak of night descended slowly and soothingly as if god were spreading his hand gently over all to allay the fever of mans busy daylife and calm him into needful rest  the watch of the floating light having been set namely two men to perambulate the decka strict watch being kept on board night and day the rest of the crew went below to resume work amuse themselves or turn in as they felt inclined  while they were thus engaged and darkness was deepening on the scene welton stood on the quarterdeck observing a small sloop that floated slowly towards the lightship  her sails were indeed set but no breath of wind bulged them out her onward progress was caused by the tide which had by that time begun to set with a strong current to the northward  when within about a cables length the rattle of her chain told that the anchor had been let go  a few minutes later a boat was seen to push off from the sloop and make for the lightship  two men rowed it and a third steered  owing to the force of the current they made the vessel with some difficulty  heave us a rope cried one of the men as they brushed past  no visitors allowed aboard replied mr welton sternly catching up nevertheless a coil of rope  hallo father surely youve become very unhospitable exclaimed another voice from the boat  why jim is that you my son cried the mate as he flung the coil over the side  the boatmen caught it and next moment jim stood on the decka tall strapping young seaman of twenty or thereaboutsa second edition of his father but more active and lithe in his motions  why you creep up to us jim like a thief in the night  what brings you here lad at such an hour asked mr welton senior as he shook hands with his son  ive come to have a talk with ee father  as to creeping like a thief a man must creep with the tide when theres no wind dye see if he dont come to an anchor  tis said that time and tide wait for no man that bein so i have come to see you now that ive got the chance thats where it is  but i cant stay long for old jones will  what interrupted the mate with a frown as he led his son to the forepart of the vessel in order to be out of earshot of the watch have ee really gone an shipped with that scoundrel again after all ive said to ee  i have father answered the young man with a perplexed expression it is about that same that ive come to talk to ee and to explain  you have need to explain jim said the mate sternly for it seems to me that you are deliberately taking up with bad company and i see in you already one o the usual consequences you dont care much for your fathers warnings  dont say that father exclaimed the youth earnestly i am sure that if you knewstay ill send back the boat with orders to return for me in an hour or so  saying this he hurried to the gangway dismissed the boat and returned to the forepart of the vessel where he found his father pacing the deck with an anxious and somewhat impatient air  father said jim as he walked up and down beside his sire i have made up my mind that it is my duty to remain at least a little longer with jones because  your duty interrupted the mate in surprise  james he added earnestly you told me not long ago that you had taken to attending the prayermeetings at the sailors chapel when you could manage it and i was glad to hear you say so because i think that the man who feels his need of the help of the almighty and acts upon his feeling is safe to escape the rocks and shoals of lifealways supposin that he sails by the right chartthe bible but tell me does the missionary or the bible teach that it is any ones duty to take up with a swearing drinking scoundrel who is going from bad to worse and has got the name of being worthy of a berth in newgate  we cannot tell father whether all thats said of morley jones be true  we may have our suspicions but we cant prove tem and theres no occasion to judge a man too soon  that may be so jim but that is no reason why you should consort with a man who can do you no goods and will certainly do ee much harm when youve no call for to do so  why do ee stick by himthats what i want to knowwhen everybody says hell be the ruin of you  and why do ee always put me off with vague answers when i git upon that subject you did not use to act like that jim  you were always fair an aboveboard in your young days  but whats the use of askin  its plain that bad company has done it an my only wonder is how you ever come to play the hypocrite to that extent as to go to the prayermeeting and make believe youve turned religious  there was a little bitterness mingled with the tone of remonstrance in which this was said which appeared to affect the young man powerfully for his face crimsoned as he stopped and laid his hand on his fathers shoulder  whatever follies or sins i may have committed he said solemnly i have not acted a hypocrites part in this matter  did you ever yet find me out father tellin you a lie  well i cant say i ever did answered the mate with a relenting smile xcept that time when you skimmed all the cream off the milk and capsized the dish and said the cat done it although you was slobbered with it from your nose to your toesbut you was a very small fellow at that time you was and hadnt got much ballast aboard nor begun to stow your conscience  well father resumed jim with a halfsad smile you may depend upon it i am not going to begin to deceive you now  my dear mothers last words to me on that dreary night when she diedalways stick to the truth jim whatever it may cost youhave never been forgotten and i pray god they never may be  believe me when i tell you that i never join morley in any of his sinful doings especially his drinking bouts you know that i am a total abstainer  no youre not cried mr welton senior you dont abstain totally from bad company jim and its that i complain of  i never join him in his drinking bouts repeated jim without noticing the interruption and as he never confides to me any of his business transactions i have no reason to say that i believe them to be unfair as i said before i may suspect but suspicion is not knowledge we have no right to condemn him on mere suspicion  true my son but you have a perfect right to steer clear of him on mere suspicion  no doubt replied jim with some hesitation in his tone but there are circumstances  there you go again with your circumstances exclaimed welton senior with some asperity why dont you heave circumstances overboard rig the pumps and make a clean breast of it  surely its better to do that than let the ship go to the bottom  because father the circumstances dont all belong to myself  other peoples affairs keep my tongue tied  i do assure you that if it concerned only myself i would tell you everything and indeed when the right time comes i promise to tell you allbut in the meantime i i  jim said mr welton senior stopping suddenly and confronting his stalwart son tell me honestly now isnt there a pretty girl mixed up in this business  jim stood speechless but a mantling flush which the rays of the revolving light deepened on his sunburnt countenance rendered speech unnecessary  i knew it exclaimed the mate resuming his walk and thrusting his hands deeper into the pockets of his coat it never was otherwise since adam got married to eve  whatever mischief is going youre sure to find a woman underneath the very bottom of it no matter how deep you go if it wasnt that the girls are at the bottom of everything good as well as everything bad id be glad to see the whole bilin of em made fast to all the sinkers of all the buoys along the british coast and sent to the bottom of the north sea  i suspect that if that were done said jim with a laugh youd soon have all the boys on the british coast making earnest inquiries after their sinkers  but after all father although the girls are hard upon us sometimes you must admit that we couldnt get on without em  true for ye boy observed jerry macgowl who coming up at that moment overheard the conclusion of the sentence  its mesilf as superscribes to that same  havent the swate creeturs led me the life of a dog turned me inside out like an owld stockin trod me in the dust as if i was benaith contimpt an riven me heart to mortial tatters but i couldnt get on widout em nohow for all that  as the pote might say av he only knowd how to putt it in proper verse    och woman dear ye darlin   its i would iver be   yer praises caterwaulin   in swaitest melodee  mind your own business jerry said the mate interrupting the flow of the poets inspiration  sure its that same im doin sir replied the man respectfully touching his cap as he advanced towards the gong that surrounded the windlass and uncovered it  dont ye see the fog acomin down like the wolf on the fold an aint it my dooty to play a little tshune for the benefit o the public  jerry hit the instrument as he spoke and drowned his own voice in its sonorous roar  he was driven from his post however by dick moy one of the watch who having observed the approaching fog had gone forward to sound the gong and displayed his dislike to interference by snatching the drumstick out of jerrys hand and hitting him a smart blow therewith on the top of his head  as further conversation was under the circumstances impossible john welton and his son retired to the cabin where the former detailed to the latter the visit of the strange gentleman with the keen grey eyes and the conversation that had passed between them regarding morley jones  still the youth remained unmoved maintaining that suspicion was not proof although he admitted that things now looked rather worse than they had done before  while the father and son were thus engaged a low moaning wail and an unusual heave of the vessel caused them to hasten on deck just as one of the watch put his head down the hatch and shouted a squall sir brewing up from the noreast    chapter three  a disturbed night a wreck and an unexpected rescue  the aspect of the night had completely changed  the fog had cleared away heavy clouds rolled athwart the sky a deeper darkness descended on the shipping at anchor in the downs and a gradually increasing swell caused the gull to roll a little and tug uneasily at her cable nevertheless the warning light at her masthead retained its perpendicular position in consequence of a clever adaptation of mechanism on the principle of the universal joint  with the rise of the swell came the first rush of the squall  if they dont send the boat at once youll have to spend the night with us jim said the mate looking anxiously in the direction of the sloop belonging to morley jones the dark outlines of which could just be seen looming of a deeper black against the black sky  its too late even now returned jim in an anxious tone the boat like everything else about the sloop is a rotten old thing and would be stove against the side in this swell slight though it be as yet but my chief trouble is that the cables are not fit to hold her if it comes on to blow hard  for some time the wind increased until it blew half a gale  at that point it continued steady and as it gave no indication of increasing john welton and his son returned to the cabin where the latter amused himself in glancing over some of the books in the small library with which the ship was furnished while the sire busied himself in posting up the ships log for the day  for a considerable time they were silent the one busily engaged writing the other engrossed with a book  at last mr welton senior heaved a deep sigh and said while he carefully dotted an i and stroked a t  it has always been my opinion jim that when boys are bein trained for the sea they should be taught writing in a swing or an omnibus in order to get em used to do it in difficult circumstances  there she goes again he added referring to a lurch of the vessel which caused the tail of a y to travel at least two inches out of its proper course  now that jobs done  ill turn in for a spell and advise you to do the same lad  no ill go on deck and have a talk with dick moy  if the gale dont increase ill perhaps turn in but i couldnt sleep just now for thinkin o the sloop  please yourself my son an youll please me replied the mate with a smile which ended in a yawn as he opened the door of a small sleeping berth and disappeared into its recesses  james welton stood for a few minutes with his back to the small fireplace and stared meditatively at the cabin lamp  the cabin of the floating light was marvellously neat and immaculately clean  there was evidence of a wellordered household in the tidiness with which everything was put away in its proper place even although the fair hand of woman had nothing to do with it and clumsy man reigned paramount and alone  the cabin itself was very smallabout ten feet or so in length and perhaps eight in width  the roof was so low that jim could not stand quite erect because of the beams  the grate resembled a toy and was of brass polished so bright that you might have used it for a lookingglass the fire in it was proportionately small but large enough for the place it had to warm  a crumb or speck of dust could scarce have been found on the floor with a microscopeand no wonder for whenever john welton beheld the smallest symptom of such a blemish he seized a brush and shovel and swept it away  the books in the little library at the stern were neatly arranged and so were the cups plates glasses saltcellars spoons and saucers in the little recess that did duty as a cupboard  in short order and cleanliness reigned everywhere  and not only was this the case in the cabin but in every department of the ship  the breadlockers the oilroom next to the cabin the galley where the men livedall were scrupulously clean and everything therein was arranged with the method and precision that one is accustomed to expect only on board a manofwar  and after all what is a floating light but a manofwar  its duty is like that of any threedecker to guard the merchant service from a dangerous foe  it is under command of the trinity corporationwhich is tantamount to saying that it is well found and handledand it does battle continually with the storm  what more could be said of a manofwar  the only difference is that it does its work with less fuss and no noise  after warming himself for a short time for the night had become bitterly cold jim welton put on one of his sires overcoats and went on deck where he had a long walk and talk with dick moy who gave it as his opinion that it was a wery cold night and said that he wouldnt be surprised if it wor to come on to blow arder before mornin  dick was a huge man with a large expanse of goodnatured visage and a tendency to make all his statements with the solemnity of an oracle big and little men like large and small dogs have usually a sympathetic liking for each other  dick moys chief friend on board was little jack shales who was the life of the ship and was particularly expert as were also most of his mates in making during hours of leisure beautiful workboxes and writingdesks with inlaid woods of varied colours which were sold at a moderate price on shore in order to eke out the monthly wage and add to the comforts of wives and little ones at ramsgate  it may be added that jack shales was unquestionably the noisiest man on board  he had a good voice could sing and did sing from morning till night and had the power of uttering a yell that would have put to shame the wildest warrior among the cherokee savages  jack shales kept watch with moy that night and assisted in the conversation until a sudden snow storm induced young welton to bid them goodnight and retire below  goodnight said shales as jims head was disappearing down the hatchway stir up the fire and keep yourself warm  thats just what i mean to do replied jim sorry i cant communicate some of the warmth to you  but you can think of us cried jack looking down the hatchway you can at least pity us poor babes out here in the wind and snow  shut up jack said moy with a solemn growl wot a tremendous jaw youve got wen you let loose  why wot are ee starin at now  ave ee seed a ghost  no dick said shales in a tone of voice from which every vestige of jocularity had disappeared look steady in the direction of the south sandhead light andsee aint that the flash of a gun  it looks like it  a wreck on the sand i fear muttered dick moy putting up both hands to guard his eyes from the snowflakes that were driven wildly about by the wind which had by that time increased to a furious gale  for a few minutes the two men stood gazing intently towards the southwest horizon  presently a faint flash was seen so faint that they could not be certain it was that of a signalgun  in a few minutes however a thin thread of red light was seen to curve upwards into the black sky  no mistake now cried jack leaping towards the cabin skylight which he threw up and bending down shoutedsouth sandhead light is firing sir and sending up rockets  the mate who was at the moment in the land of dreams sprang out of them and out of his bunk and stood on the cabin floor almost before the sentence was finished  his son who had just drawn the blanket over his shoulders and given vent to the first sigh of contentment with which a man usually lays his head on his pillow for the night also jumped up drew on coat nether garments and shoes as if his life depended on his speed and dashed on deck  there was unusual need for clothing that night for it had become bitterly cold a coat of ice having formed even on the saltwater spray which had blown into the boats  they found dick moy and jack shales already actively engagedthe one loading the lee gun the other adjusting a rocket to its stick  a few hurried questions from the mate elicited all that it was needful to know  the flash of the gun from the south sandhead lightship about six miles off had been distinctly seen a third time and a third rocket went up just as welton and his son gained the deck indicating that a vessel had struck upon the fatal goodwin sands  the report of the gun could not be heard owing to the gale carrying the sound to leeward but the bright line of the rocket was distinctly visible  at the same moment the flaring light of a burning tarbarrel was observed  it was the signal of the vessel in distress just on the southern tail of the sands  by this time the gun was charged and the rocket in position  look alive jack fetch the poker cried the mate as he primed the gun  jack shales dived down the companionhatch and in another moment returned with a redhot poker which the mate had thrust into the cabin fire at the first alarm  he applied it in quick succession to the gun and rocket  a blinding flash and deafening crash were followed by the whiz of the rocket as it sprang with a magnificent curve far away into the surrounding darkness  this was their answer to the south sandhead light which having fired three guns and sent up three rockets to attract the attention of the gull then ceased firing  it was also their first note of warning to the lookout on the pier of ramsgate harbour  of the three lightships that guarded the sands the gull lay nearest to ramsgate hence whichever of the other two happened to send up signals the gull had to reply and thenceforward to continue repeating them until the attention of the ramsgate lookout should be gained and a reply given  thats a beauty cried the mate referring to the rocket fetch another jack sponge her well out dick moy well give em another shot in a few minutes  loud and clear were both the signals but four and a half miles of distance and a fresh gale neutralised their influence  the lookout on the pier did not observe them  in less than five minutes the gun and rocket were fired again  still no answering signal came from ramsgate  load the weather gun this time cried the mate theyll have a better chance of seeing the flash of that  jack obeyed and jim welton having nothing to do but look on sought shelter under the lee of the weather bulwarks for the wind according to dick moy was blowin needles and penknives  the third gun thundered forth and shook the floating light from stem to stern but the rocket struck the rigging and made a low wavering flight another was therefore sent up but it had scarcely cut its bright line across the sky when the answering signal was observeda rocket from ramsgate pier  thats all right now our dutys done said the mate as he went below and divesting himself of his outer garments quietly turned in while the watch having sponged out and recovered the guns resumed their active perambulation of the deck  james welton however could not calm down his feelings so easily  this was the first night he had ever spent in a lightship the scene was therefore quite new to him and he could not help feeling somewhat disappointed at the sudden termination of the noise and excitement  he was told that the ramsgate lifeboat could not be out in less than an hour and it seemed to his excited spirit a terrible thing that human lives should be kept so long in jeopardy  of course he began to think is it not possible to prevent this delay but his better sense whispered to him that excited spirits are not the best judges in such matters although it cannot be denied that they have an irresistible tendency to judge  there was nothing for it however but to exercise philosophic patience so he went below and turned in as sailors have it all standing to be ready when the lifeboat should make its appearance  the young sailors sleep was prompt and profound  it seemed to him but a few minutes after he had laid his head on the pillow when jack shales voice again resounded in the cabin  lifeboat close alongside sir  didnt see her till this moment  she carries no lights  the weltons father and son sprang out of their bunks a second time and minus coat hat and shoes scrambled on deck just in time to see the broadstairs lifeboat rush past before the gale  she was close under the stern and rendered spectrally visible by the light of the lantern  what are you firing for shouted the coxswain of the boat  ship on the sands bearing south roared jack shales at the full pitch of his stentorian voice  there was no time for more for the boat did not pause in her meteorlike flight  the question was asked and answered as she passed with a magnificent rush into darkness  the reply had been heard and the lifeboat shot straight as an arrow to the rescue  reader we often hear and read of such scenes but we can tell you from experience that vision is necessary to enable one to realise the full import of all that goes on  there was a strange thrill at the heart of young welton when he saw the familiar blueandwhite boat leaping over the foaming billows  often had he seen it in model and in quiescence in its boathouse ponderous and almost ungainly but now he saw it for the first time in action as if endued with life  so we fancy warriors might speak of our heavy cavalry as we see them in barracks and as they saw them at alma  again all was silent and unexciting on board the gull but not many minutes later the watch once more shouted down the skylight  tugs in sight sir  it was afterwards ascertained that a mistake had been made in reference to the vessel that had signalled  some one on shore had reported that the guns and rockets had been seen flashing from the north sandhead vessel whereas the report should have been from the vessel at the south sandhead  the single word was allimportant  it had the effect of sending the steamtug aid which always attends upon the ramsgate lifeboat in the wrong direction involving much loss of time but we mention this merely as a fact not as a reproof  accidents will happen even in the best regulated families  the ramsgate lifeboat service is most admirably regulated and for once that an error of this kind can be pointed out we can point to dozensay hundredsof cases in which the steamer and lifeboat have gone straight as the crow flies to the rescue and have done good service on occasions when all other lifeboats would certainly have failed so great is the value of steam in such matters  on this occasion however the tug appeared somewhat late on the scene and hailed the gull  when the true state of the case was ascertained her course was directed aright and full steam let on  the ramsgate boat was in tow far astern  as she passed the brief questions and answers were repeated for the benefit of the coxswain and jim welton observed that every man in the boat appeared to be crouching down on the thwarts except the coxswain who stood at the steering tackles  no wonder  it is not an easy matter to sit up in a gale of wind with freezing spray and sometimes green seas sweeping over one  the men were doubtless wideawake and listening but as far as vision went that boat was manned by ten oilskin coats and souwesters  a few seconds carried them out of sight and so great was the power of steam that despite the loss of time they reached the neighbourhood of the wreck as soon as the broadstairs boat and found that the crew of the stranded vessel had already been saved and taken ashore by the deal lifeboat  it may be as well to observe here that although in this case much energy was expended unnecessarily it does not follow that it is frequently so expended  often far too often all the force of lifeboat service on that coast is insufficient to meet the demands on it  the crews of the various boats in the vicinity of the goodwin sands are frequently called out more than once in a night and they are sometimes out all night visiting various wrecks in succession  in all this work the value of the steamtug is very conspicuous for it can tow its boat again and again to windward of a wreck and renew the effort to save life in cases where devoid of such aid lifeboats would be compelled to give in after the failure of their first attempt in consequence of their being driven helplessly to leeward  but we have forestalled our narrative  the drama as far as the gulllight was concerned ended that night with the disappearance of the tug and lifeboat  it was not until several days afterwards that her crew learned the particulars of the wreck in connection with which they had acted so brief but so important a part  meanwhile dick moy who always walked the deck with a rolling swagger with his huge hands thrust deep into his breeches pockets when there was nothing for them to do said to jim welton hed advise im to go below an clap the deadlights on is peepers  jim approving the advice was about to descend to the cabin when he was arrested by a sharp cry that appeared to rise out of the waves  wot iver is that exclaimed dick as they all rushed to the port bow of the vessel and looked over the side  something in the water cried jack shales hastily catching up a coil of rope and throwing it overboard with that promptitude which is peculiar to seamen  why he cant kitch hold on it its only a dog observed dick moy  all uncertainty on this point was cleared away by a loud wail to which the poor animal gave vent as it scraped along the ships hull vainly endeavouring to prevent itself from being carried past by the tide  by this time they were joined by the mate and the rest of the crew who had heard the unwonted sounds and hurried on deck  each man was eagerly suggesting a method of rescue or attempting to carry one into effect by means of a noose or otherwise when mr welton senior observed that mr welton junior was hastily tying a rope round his waist  hallo  jim he cried surely you dont mean to risk your life for a dog  theres no risk about it father  why should i leave a poor dog to drown when it will only cost a ducking at the worst  you know i can swim like a cork and i aint easily cooled down  you shant do it if i can prevent cried the mate rushing at his reckless son  but jim was too nimble for him  he ran to the stern of the vessel leaped on the bulwarks flung the end of the coil of rope among the men and shouting hold on taut boys sprang into the sea  the men did hold on most powerfully they did more they hauled upon the rope hand over hand to a yoheaveho from jerry macgowl which put to shame the roaring gale and finally hauled jim welton on board with a magnificent newfoundland dog in his arms an event which was greeted with three enthusiastic cheers    chapter four  a new character introduced  the gale was a shortlived one  on the following morning the wind had decreased to a moderate breeze and before night the sea had gone down sufficiently to allow the boat of mr joness sloop to come alongside of the floating light  before jim welton bade his friends goodbye he managed to have an earnest and private talk with each of them  although he had never been connected with the gull he had frequently met with the men of that vessel and being one of those largehearted sympathetic men who somehow worm themselves into the affection and confidence of most of their friends and comrades he had something particular to say to each either in reference to wives and families on shore or to other members of that distracting section of the human family which according to mr welton senior lay at the foundation of all mischief  but young welton did not confine himself to temporal matters  it has already been hinted that he had for some time been in the habit of attending prayermeetings but the truth was that he had recently been led by a sailors missionary to read the bible and the precious word of god had been so blessed to his soul that he had seen his own lost condition by nature and had also seen and joyfully accepted jesus christ as his allsufficient saviour  he had come to know the truth and the truth had set him free free not only from spiritual death and the power of sin but free from that unmanly shame which alas too often prevents christians from taking a bold stand on the lords side  the young sailor had no doubt had severe inward conflicts which were known only to god and himself but he had been delivered and strengthened for he was not ashamed of christ in the presence of his old comrades and he sought by all the means in his power to draw them to the same blessed saviour  well goodbye jim said mr welton senior as his son moved towards the gangway when the boat came alongside all ive got to say to ee lad is that youre on dangerous ground and you have no right to shove yourself in the way of temptation  but i dont shove myself father i think i am led in that way  i may be wrong perhaps but such is my belief  youll not forget that message to my mother whispered a sicklylooking seaman whose strongboned frame appeared to be somewhat attenuated by disease  ill not forget rainer  its likely that we shall be in yarmouth in a couple of days and you may depend upon my looking up the old woman as soon after i get ashore as possible  hallo hi shouted a voice from below wots all the hurry cried dick moy stumbling hastily up on deck while in the act of closing a letter which bore evidence of having been completed under difficulties for its form was irregular and its back was blotted  here you are putt that in the post at yarmouth will ee like a good fellow  why youve forgotten the address exclaimed jim welton in affected surprise  no i avent  there it is hall right on the back  what that blot  ay thats wot stands for mrs moy said dick with a goodnatured smile  sure now observed jerry macgowl looking earnestly at the letter it do seem to me for all the world as if a cat had drawed his tail across it after stumblin over a inkbottle  dont mrs moy live in ramsgate inquired jim welton  of course she do replied dick  but im not going there im goin to yarmouth said jim  wot then retorted dick dee suppose the clerk o the postoffice at yarmouth aint as well able to read as the one at ramsgate even though the writin do be done with a cats tail  go along with ee  thus dismissed jim descended the side and was quickly on board the sloop nora to which he belonged  on the deck of the little craft he was received gruffly by a man of powerful frame and stern aspect but whose massive head covered with shaggy grey curling hair seemed to indicate superior powers of intellect  this was morley jones the master and owner of the sloop  a pretty mess youve made of it i might have been in yarmouth by this time he said testily  more likely at the bottom of the sea answered jim quietly as he went aft and looked at the compassmore from habit than from any desire to receive information from that instrument  well if i had been at the bottom o the sea what then  whos to say that i maynt risk my life if i see fit  its not worth much he said gloomily  you seem to forget that in risking your own life you risk the lives of those who sail along with you replied jim with a bold yet goodhumoured look at the skipper  and what if i do risk their livesthey aint worth much either im sure  not to you morley but worth a good deal to themselves not to mention their wives and families and friends  you know well enough that if i had wished ever so much to return aboard last night your boat could not have got alongside the gull for the sea  moreover you also know that if you had attempted to put to sea in such weather this leaky tub with rotten sails and running gear would have been a wreck on the goodwin sands before now and you and i with the two men and the boy would have been food for the gulls and fishes  not at all retorted jones theres not much fear of our lives here the lifeboat crews are too active for that and as to the sloop why shes insured you know for her full valuefor more than her value indeed  jones said this with a chuckle and a sly expression in his face as he glanced meaningly at his companion  i know nothing about your insurance or your cargo and whats more i dont want to know said jim almost angrily  youve been at squaretom again he added suddenly laying his hand upon the shoulder of his companion and looking earnestly into his eyes  it was now joness turn to be angry yet it was evident that he made an effort to restrain his feelings as he replied well what if i have its one thing for you to advise me to become a teetotaller and its quite another thing for me to agree to do it  i tell you again as ive often told you before jim welton that i dont mean to do it and im not going to submit to be warned and reasoned with by you as if you was my grandfather  i know that drink is the curse of my life and i know that it will kill me and that i am a fool for giving way to it but it is the only thing that makes me able to endure this life and as for the next i dont care for it and i dont believe in it  but your not believing in it does not make it less certain replied jim quietly but without any approach to solemnity in his tone or look for he knew that his companion was not in a mood just then to stand such treatment  you remember the story of the ostrich that was run down finding that it could not escape it stuck its head in the sand and thought that nobody saw it  you may shut your eyes morley but facts remain facts for all that  shutting my eyes is just what i am not doing returned jones flinging round and striding to the other side of the deck then turning quickly he strode back and added with an oath have i not told you that i see myself my position and my prospects as clearly as you do and that i intend to face them all and take the consequences  jim welton flushed slightly and his eyes dilated as he replied  have you not the sense to see morley jones that my remonstrances with you are at least disinterested  what would you think if i were to say to you go drink your fill till death finds you at last wallowing on the ground like a beast or worse than a beast i leave you to your fate  i would think that jim welton had changed his nature replied jones whose anger disappeared as quickly as it came  i have no objection to your storming at me jim  you may swear at me as much as you please but for any sake spare me your reasonings and entreaties because they only rouse the evil spirit within me without doing an atom of good and dont talk of leaving me  besides let me tell you you are not so disinterested in this matter as you think  there is some one in yarmouth who has something to do with your interest in me  the young man flushed again at the close of this speech but not from a feeling of anger  he dropt his eyes before the earnest though unsteady gaze of his halftipsy companion who burst into a loud laugh as jim attempted some stammering reply  come he added again assuming the stern aspect which was natural to him but giving jim a friendly slap on the shoulder dont let us fall out jim you and i dont want to part just now  moreover if we have a mind to get the benefit of the tide tonight the sooner we up anchor the better so we wont waste any more time talking  without waiting for a reply mr jones went forward and called the crew the anchor was weighed the sails were set and the sloop norabending over before the breeze as if doing homage in passing her friend the gulllightput to sea and directed her course for the ancient town and port of yarmouth    chapter five  more new characters introduced  if it be true that time and tide wait for no man it is equally true we rejoice to know that authors and readers have a corresponding immunity from shackles and are in nowise bound to wait for time or tide  we therefore propose to leave the gullstream light and the goodwin sands and the sloop nora far behind us and skipping a little in advance of time itself proceed at once to yarmouth  here in a snug parlour in an easy chair before a cheerful fire with a newspaper in his hand sat a bluff little elderly gentleman with a bald head and a fat little countenance in which benignity appeared to hold perpetual though amicable rivalry with fun  that the fat little elderly gentleman was eccentric could scarcely be doubted because he not only looked over his spectacles instead of through them but also apparently read his newspaper upside down  a closer inspection however would have shown that he was not reading the paper at all but looking over the top of it at an object which accounted for much of the benignity and some of the fun of his expression  at the opposite side of the table sat a very beautiful girl stooping over a book and so earnestly intent thereon as to be evidently quite oblivious of all else around her  she was at that interesting age when romance and reality are supposed to be pretty equally balanced in a wellregulated female mindabout seventeen  although not classically beautifulher nose being slightly turned upwardshe was nevertheless uncommonly pretty and as one of her hopeless admirers expressed it desperately loveable  jet black ringletsthen in vogueclustered round an exceedingly fair face on which there dwelt the hue of robust health  poor bob queeker the hopeless admirer above referred to would have preferred that she had been somewhat paler and thinner if that had been possible but this is not to be wondered at because queeker was about sixteen years of age at that time and wrote sonnets to the moon and other celestial bodies and also indulged in lines to various terrestrial bodies such as the lily or the snowdrop or something equally drooping or pale  queeker never by any chance addressed the sun or the redrose or anything else suggestive of health and vigour yet his melancholy soul could not resist katiewhich was this angels namebecause although she was energetic and vigorous and matteroffact not to say slightly mischievous she was intensely sympathetic and tender in her feelings and romantic too  but her romance puzzled him  there was something too intense about it for his taste  if he had only once come upon her unawares and caught her sitting with her hands clasped gazing in speechless adoration at the moon or even at a streetlamp in the event of its being thick weather at the time his love for her would have been without alloy  as it was queeker thought her desperately loveable and in his perplexity continued to write sonnets without number to the moon in which efforts however he was singularly unsuccessful owing to the fact that after he had gazed at it for a considerable length of time the orb of night invariably adopted black ringlets and a bright sunny complexion  george durantwhich was the name of the bald fat little elderly gentlemanwas katies father  looking at them no one would have thought so for katie was tall and graceful in form and her countenance except when lighted up with varying emotion was grave and serene  as mr durant looked at it just then the gravity had deepened into severity the pretty eyebrows frowned darkly at the book over which they bent and the rosy lips represented a compound of pursing and pouting as they moved and muttered something inaudibly  what is it that puzzles you katie asked her father laying down the paper  sh whispered katie without lifting her head seventeen twentytwo twentynine thirtysixone pound sixteenno i cant get it to balance  did you ever know such a provoking thing  she flung down her pencil and looked full in her fathers face where fun had for the time so thoroughly conquered and overthrown benignity that the frown vanished from her brow and the rosy lips expanded to join her sire in a hearty fit of laughter  if you could only see your own face katie when you are puzzling over these accounts you would devote yourself ever after to drawing it instead of those chalkheads of which you are so fond  no i wouldnt papa said katie whose gravity quickly returned its all very well for you to joke about it and laugh at me but i can tell you that this account wont balance there is a twoandsixpence wrong somewhere and you know it has to be all copied out and sent off by the evening post tomorrow  i really cant understand why we are called upon to make so many copies of all the accounts and papers for that ridiculous board of trade im sure they have plenty of idle clerks of their own without requiring us to slave as we dofor such a wretched salary too  katie shook her curls indignantly as she thought of the unjust demands and inadequate remuneration of government and resumed her work the frowning brows and pursed coral lips giving evidence of her immediate and total absorption in the accounts  old mr durant still holding the newspaper upside down and looking over the top of it and of his spectacles at the fair accountant thought in his heart that if the assembled board of which his daughter spoke in such contemptuous terms could only behold her labouring at their books in order to relieve her father of part of the toil they would incontinently give orders that he should be thenceforth allowed a salary for a competent clerk and that all the accounts sent up from yarmouth should be bound in cloth of gold  here it is papa ive got it exclaimed katie looking up with enthusiasm similar to that which might be expected in a youthful sportsman on the occasion of hooking his first salmon  it was the twoandsixpence which you told me to give to  at that moment the outer door bell rang  theres cousin fanny oh im so glad exclaimed katie shutting up her books and clearing away a multitude of papers with which the table was lumbered she has promised to stay a week and has come in time to go with me to the singing class this afternoon  shes a darling girl as fond of painting and drawing almost as i am and hates cats  oh i do so love a girl that doesnt like cats  eh pussy shall i tread on your tail  this question was put to a recumbent cat which lay coiled up in earthly bliss in front of the fire and which katie had to pass in carrying her armful of books and papers to the sideboard drawer in which they were wont to repose  she put out her foot as if to carry her threat into execution  dare exclaimed mr durant with whom the cat was a favourite  well then promise that if mr queeker comes tonight you wont let him stay to spoil our fun said katie still holding her foot over the cats unconscious tail  as she spoke one of the rather heavy accountbooks which ought to have been bound in cloth of gold slipped off the pile and as ill luck would have it fell on the identical tail in question the cat belonging to which sprang up with a fierce caterwaul in rampant indignation  oh papa you know i didnt mean it  mr durants eyes twinkled with amusement as he beheld the sudden change of poor katies expression to intense earnestness but before he could reply the door was thrown open cousin fanny rushed in the cat rushed out the two young ladies rushed into each others arms and went in a species of ecstatic waltz upstairs to enjoy the delights of a private interview leaving mr durant to sink into the arms of his easy chair and resume his paperthis time with the right side up  let it be understood that the old gentleman was employed in yarmouth under one of the departments of the board of trade  we refrain from entering into particulars as to which department lest the vindictive spirit which was accredited to that branch of the government by miss katiewho being a lady must of course have been rightshould induce it to lay hold of our estimable friend and make an example of him for permitting his independent daughter to expose its true character  in addition to his office in this connection mr durant also held the position of a retired merchant and shipowner and was a man of considerable wealth although he lived in a quiet unostentatious way in fact his post under government was retained chiefly for the purpose of extending his influence in his native townfor he counted himself a bloaterand enabling him to carry out more vigorously his schemes of christian philanthropy  cousin fanny hennings was a darling girl in katies estimation probably because she was her opposite in many respects though not in all  in goodhumour and affection they were similar but fanny had none of katies fire or enthusiasm or intellect or mischief she had however a great appreciation of fun and was an inordinate giggler fat fair and fifteen with flaxen curls pink cheeks and blue eyes she was the beauideal of a waxdoll and possessed about as much selfassertion as may be supposed to belong to that class of the dollcommunity which is constructed so as to squeak when squeezed  as katie durant squeezed her friend pretty often both mentally and physically cousin fanny squeaked a good deal more than usual during her occasional visits to yarmouth and even after her return home to margate where she and her widowed mother dweltas queeker poetically saidin a cottage by the sea  it was usually acknowledged by all her friends that fanny had increased her powers amazingly while absent in so much that she learned at last to squeak on her own account without being squeezed at all  after the cousins had talked in private until they had made themselves almost too late for the singingclass they issued from the house and betook themselves to the temple of music where some amazing pieces were performed by some thirty young vocalists of both sexes to their own entire satisfaction and to the entire dissatisfaction apparently of their teacher whose chief delight seemed to be to check the flow of gushing melody at a critical point and exclaim try it again  being ignorant of classical music we do not venture to give an opinion on these points but it is important to state as bearing on the subject in a sanitary point of view that all the pupils usually left the class in high spirits with the exception of queeker who had a voice like a cracked teakettle knew no more about music than katies catwhich he adored because it was katiesand who went to the class which was indebted for its discord chiefly to him wholly and solely because katie durant went to it and thus afforded him an opportunity of occasionally shaking hands with her  on the present evening however being of a shy disposition he could not bring himself to face cousin fanny  he therefore left the hall miserable and went home with desperate intentions as to the moon unfortunately that luminary was not visible the sun having just set but from his bedroom window which commanded a view of the roadstead he beheld the lantern of the saint nicolas gatt floatinglight and addressed the following lines to it with all the fervour incident to a hopeless affection    why blaze ye bright benignant beaming star   guiding the homebound seaman from afar   lighting the outbound wandrer on his way   with all the lightsome perspicuity of day   why not go out at once and let be hurld   dark dread unmitigated darkness oer the world   why should the heavenly constellations shine   why should the weather evermore be fine   why should this rolling ball go whirling round   why should the noise of mirth and music sound   why should the sparrow chirp the blackbird sing   the mountains echo and the valleys ring   with all thats cheerful humorous and glad   now that my heart is smitten and my brain gone mad  queeker fetched a long deepdrawn sigh at this point the agony of intense composition being for a moment relaxed  then catching his breath and glaring he went on in a somewhat gentler strain    forgive me floatinglight and you ye sun   moon stars and elements of nature every one   i did but vent my misery and spleen   in uttring words of fury that i hardly mean   at least i do in partbut hold why not   oh cease ye fiendish thoughts that rage and plot   to bring about my ruin  hence avaunt   or else in pity tell me what you want   i cannot live and yet i would not die   my hopes are blighted  where oh whither shall i fly   tis past  ill cease to daily with vain sophistry   and try the virtue of a calm philosophy  the effect of composition upon queeker was such that when he had completed his task he felt greatly tranquillised and having shut up his portfolio formed the sudden resolution of dropping in upon the durants to tea  meantime and before the lovesick youth had begun the lines above quoted katie and her cousin walked home by a road which conducted them close past the edge of those extensive sandy plains called the denes of yarmouth  here at the corner of a quiet street they were arrested by the sobbing of a little boy who sat on a railing by the roadside swaying himself to and fro in an agony of grief  katies sympathetic heart was instantly touched  she at once went up to the boy and made earnest inquiries into the cause of his distress  please maam said the boy ive lost a shillin and i cant find it nowheres  oh wot ever shall i do  my mother gave it me to give with two other bobs to my poor sick brother whom ive comed all this way to see and there ive gone an lost it an ill ave to lay out all night in the cold for i dursnt go to see im without the moneyboo hoo  oh how very unfortunate exclaimed katie with real feeling for the boy whose soul was thus steeped to all appearance in woe unutterable was very small and very dirty and ragged and had an extremely handsome intelligent face with a profusion of wild brown curls  but i can make that up to you poor boy she added drawing out her purse here is a shilling for you  where do you live  at ramsgate maam  at ramsgate exclaimed katie in surprise why how did you manage to get here  i come in a lugger maam as blongs to a friend o ourn  weve just arrived an we goes away agin tomorrow  indeed  that will give you little time to see your sick brother  what is the matter with him  oh hes took very bad maam  im sorry to say hes bad altogether maam  bin an rund away from ome  amost broke his mothers eart he has an falld sick here he did  the small boy paused abruptly at this point and looked earnestly in katies kind and pitiful face  where does your brother live asked katie  the small boy looked rather perplexed and said that he couldnt rightly remember the name of the street but that the owner of the lugger knowd it  whereat katie seemed disappointed and said she would have been so glad to have visited him and given him such little comforts as his disease might warrant  oh maam exclaimed the small boy looking wistfully at her with his large blue eyes wot a pity ive forgot it  the doctor ordered im wine tooit was as much as is life was worth not to ave winebut of course they couldnt afford to git im wineeven cheap wine would do well enough at two bob or one bob the bottle  if you was to give me two bobshillins i mean maamid git it for im tonight  katie and her cousin conversed aside in low tones for a minute or two as to the propriety of complying with this proposal and came to the conclusion that the boy was such a nice outspoken honestlike fellow that it would do no harm to risk that sum in the circumstances  two shillings were therefore put into the boys dirty little hand and he was earnestly cautioned to take care of it which he earnestly and no doubt honestly promised to do  what is your name boy asked katie as she was about to leave him  billybilly towler maam answered the urchin pulling his forelock by way of respectful acknowledgment but my friends they calls me walleye chiefly in consikence o my bein wery much the rewerse of blind maam and niver capable of bein cotched in a state o slumber at no time  this reply had the effect of slightly damaging the small boys character for simplicity in katies mind although it caused both herself and her companion to laugh  well billy she said opening her cardcase here is my cardgive it to your sick brother and when he sends it to me with his address written on the back of it ill call on him  thankee maam said the small boy  after he had said this he stood silently watching the retiring figure of his benefactress until she was out of sight and then dashing round the corner of a byestreet which was somewhat retired he there went off into uncontrollable fits of laughterslapped his small thighs held his lean little sides with both hands threw his ragged cap into the air and in various other ways gave evidence of ecstatic delight  he was still engaged in these violent demonstrations of feeling when morley joneshaving just landed at yarmouth and left the sloop nora in charge of young weltoncame smartly round the corner and applying his heavy boot to the small boys person kicked him into the middle of the road    chapter six  the tempter and the tempted  what are ye howlin there for an blockin up the queens highway like that you precious young villain demanded morley jones  an wot are you breakin the queens laws for like that retorted billy towler dancing into the middle of the road and revolving his small fists in pugilistic fashion  you big hairy walrus i dont know whether to ave you up before the beaks for assault and battery or turn to an give ee a good lickin  mr jones showed all his teeth with an approving grin and the small boy grinned in return but still kept on revolving his fists and warning the walrus to look hout and defend hisself if he didnt want his daylights knocked out or his bows stove in  youre a smart youth you are said jones  ha youre afraid are you an wants to make friends but i wont ave it at no price  come on will you  jones still grinning from ear to ear made a rush at the urchin who however evaded him with such ease that the man perceived he had not the smallest chance of catching him  i say my lad he asked stopping and becoming suddenly grave where dyou come from  i comes from where i blongs to and where im agoin back to wen it suits me  very good retorted jones and i suppose you dont object to earn a little money in an easy way  yes i do object replied billy it aint worth my while to earn a little money in any way no matter how easy i never deals in small sums  a fi pun note is the lowest figur as i can stoop to  youll not object however to a gift i daresay remarked jones as he tossed a halfcrown towards the boy  billy caught it as deftly as a dog catches a bit of biscuit looked at it in great surprise tossed it in the air bit its rim critically and finally slid it into his trousers pocket  well you know he said slowly to obleege a friend im willin to accept  now then youngster if im willing to trust that halfcrown in your clutches you may believe i have got something to say to ee worth your while listenin to for you may see im not the man to give it to ee out o christian charity  thats true remarked billy who by this time had become serious and stood with his hands in his pockets still however at a respectful distance  well the fact is said mr jones that ive bin lookin out of late for a smart lad with a light heart and a light pocket and that aint troubled with much of a conscience  thats me to a tee said billy promptly my arts as light as a feather and my pocket is as light as a maginstrates wisdom  as for conscience the last beak as i wos introdooced to said i must have bin born without a conscience altogether an pon my honour i think he wos right for i never felt it yet though ive often triedxcept once wen id cleaned out the pocket of a old ooman as was starin in at a shop winder in cheapside and she fainted dead away wen she found it out and her little granddarter looked so pale and pitiful that i says to myself hallo  walleye youve bin to the wrong shop this time go an put it back ye young dog so i obeyed orders an slipped back the purse while pretendin to help the old ooman  it wos risky work though for a bobby twigged me and it was only my good wind and tough pair o shanks that saved me  now continued the urchin knitting his brows as he contemplated the knotty point ive had my doubts whether that wos conscience or a sort o natral weakness pecooliar to my constitootion  ive half a mind to call on the bishop of london on the point one o these days  so youre a city bird observed jones admiringly  ah and i can see that youre a provincial one replied billy jingling the halfcrown against the silver in his pocket  what brings you so far out of your beat walleye inquired jones  oh im on circuit just now makin a tower of the provinces  i tried a case just before you came up an made three shillins out of it besides no end o promiseswhich unfortnately i cant awail myself offrom a sweet young lady with such a pleasant face that i wished i could adopt her for a darter  but thats an expensive luxury you see cant afford it yet  well youngster said jones assuming a more grave yet offhand air if you choose to trust me ill put you in the way of makin some money without much trouble  it only requires a little false swearing which i daresay you are used to  no i aint retorted the urchin indignantly i never tells a lie xcept wen i cant help it  then of course a feller must do it  just so walleye thems my sentiments  have you got a father  no nor yet a mother replied billy  as far as im aweer of i wos diskivered on the steps of a city workus an my first impressions in this life wos the knuckles of the old woman as banged me up  the governor used to talk a lot o balderdash about our bein brought up but i knows better  i wos banged up banged up in the mornins banged to meals and banged to bed banged through thick and thin for everything an for nothin until i banged myself out o the door one fine mornin which i banged arter me an ave bin bangin about a genlemn at large ever since  ha got no friends and nothin to do said morley jones  jis so  well if you have a mind to take service with me come along an have a pot o beer  the man turned on his heel and walked off to a neighbouring publichouse leaving the small boy to follow or not as he pleased and apparently quite indifferent as to what his decision might be  billy towleralias walleyelooked after him with an air of uncertainty  he did not like the look of the man and was about to decide against him when the jingle of the halfcrown in his pocket turned the scale in his favour  running after him he quietly said im your man and then began to whistle at the same time making an abortive effort to keep step with his longlimbed employer who said nothing in reply but entering a publichouse ordered two pots of beer  these when produced he and his little companion sat down to discuss in the most retired box in the place and conversed in low tones  what was it brought you to yarmouth walleye asked mr jones  call me billy said the boy i like it better  well billyand by the way you may call me morleymy names jones but like yourself i have a preference  now then what brought you here  hm that involves a storya hanecdote if i may so speak replied this precocious youngster with much gravity  you see some time arter i runnd away from the workus i felld in with an old genlemn with a bald head an a fat corpus  do ee happen to know mr morley ow it is that bald heads an fat corpuses amost always go together  morley replied that he felt himself unable to answer that difficult question but supposed that as goodhumour was said to make people fat perhaps it made them bald also  i dun know continued billy anyhow this old genlemn he tookd a fancy to me an tookd me home to his otel for he didnt live in londonwos there only on a wisit at the time he felled in love with me at first sight  well he give me a splendacious suit of noo cloes an ad me put to a school where i soon larned to read and write an i do blieve wos on the highroad to be lord mayor of london when the old schoolmaster died before id bin two year there an the noo un wos so fond o the bangin system that i couldnt stand it an so bid em all a tender farewell an took to the streets agin  the old genlemn he comed three times from yarmouth where he belonged for to see me arter i wos put to the school an i had a sort o likin for him but not knowin his name and only been aweer that he lived at yarmouth i thought id have no chance o findin him  over my subsikint career ill draw a wail its enough to say i didnt like either it or my pals so i made up my mind at last to go to yarmouth an try to find the old genlemn as had adopted methats what he said hed done to me  wen id prigged enough o wipes to pay my fare down i comed awayan here i am  have you seen the old gentleman asked morley after a pause  no only just arrived this arternoon  and you dont know his name nor where he lives  no  and how did you expect to escape bein nabbed and put in limbo as a vagrant inquired morley  by gittin employment of coorse from some respectable genlemn like yourself an then runnin away from im wen id diskivered the old chap wi the bald head  morley jones smiled grimly  well my advice to you is he said to fight shy of the old chap even if you do discover him  depend upon it the life you would lead under his eye would be one of constant restraint and worry  hed put you to school again no doubt where youd get banged as beforea system i dont approve of at alland be made a milksop and a flunkey or something o that sortwhereas the life youll lead with me will be a free and easy rollikin manly sort o life  half on shore and half at sea  do what you like go where you willwhen business has bin attended tovictuals and clothing free gratis and pocketmoney enough to enable you to enjoy yourself in a moderate sort of way  you see im not goin to humbug you  it wont be all plain sailin but what is a man worth if he aint fit to stand a little roughandtumble  besides rough work makes a fellow take his ease with all the more zest  a life on the ocean wave one week with hard work and a run on shore the next week with just enough to do to prevent one wearyin  thats the sort o thing for you and me billy eh boy exclaimed the tempter growing garrulous in his cups and giving his small victim a pat on the shoulder which although meant to be a facetious touch wellnigh unseated him  billy towler recovered himself however and received it as it was meant in perfect good humour  the beer had mounted to his own little brain and his large eyes glowed with more than natural light as he sat gazing into his companions rugged face listening with delight to the description of a mode of life which he thought admirably suited to his tastes and capabilities  he was however a shrewd little creature sad and very rough experience of life had taught him to be uncommonly circumspect for his years  whats your business morley he demanded eagerly  ive a lot of businesses said mr jones with a drunken leer but my principal one is fishcuring  im a sort of shipowner too  leastwise ive got two craftone bein a sloop the other a boat  moreover i charter no end of vessels an do a good deal in the insurance way  but youll understand more about these things all in good time billy  i live while im at home in gravesend but ive got a daughter and a mother livin at yarmouth so i may say ive got a home at both places its a convenient sort o thing you seea town residence and a country villa as it were  come ill take you to the villa now and introduce ee to the women  so saying this rascal paid for the poison he had been administering in large doses to himself and his apprentice and taking billys dirty little hand in his large horny fist led him towards the centre of the town  poor billy little knew the nature of the awful gulf of sin and misery into which he was now plunging with a headlong hilarious vivacity peculiarly his own  he was indeed well enough aware of the fact that he was a thief and an outcast from society and that he was a habitual breaker of the laws of god and man but he was naturally ignorant of the extent of his guilt as well as of the certain and terrible end to which it pointed and above all he had not the most remote conception of the almost hopeless slavery to which he was doomed when once fairly secured in the baleful net which morley jones had begun to twine around him  but a higher power was leading the poor child in a way that he knew nota way that was little suspected by his temptera way that has been the means of snatching many and many a little one from destruction in time past and that will certainly save many more in time to comeas long as christian men and women band together to unite their prayers and powers for the rescue of perishing souls  traversing several streets with unsteady gaitfor he was now much the worse of drinkmr jones led his willing captive down one of those innumerable narrow streets or passages termed rows which bear some resemblance to the closes of the scottish capital  in width they are much the same but in cleanliness there is a vast difference for whereas the closes of the northern capital are notorious for dirt the rows of yarmouth are celebrated for their neat tidy aspect  what the cause of the neatness of the latter may be we cannot tell but we can bear the testimony of an eyewitness to the fact thatconsidering the class of inhabitants who dwell in them their laborious lives and limited meansthe rows are wondrously clean  nearly all of them are paved with pebbles or bricks  the square courts opening out of them on right and left although ridiculously small are so thoroughly scoured and swept that one might roll on their floors with white garments and remain unsoiled  in each court may be observed a waterbucket and scrubbingbrush wet usually from recent use also a green painted boxgarden of dimensions corresponding to the court full of welltended flowers  almost every door has a wooden or stone step and each step is worn and white with repeated scrubbingsinsomuch that one is irresistibly led to suspect that the bloaters must have a strong infusion of the dutch element in their nature  emerging at the lower end of the row mr jones and his small companion hastened along the centre of a narrow street which led them into one of much wider dimensions named friars lane  proceeding along this for some time they diverged to the right into another of the rows not far from the old citywall at a place where one of the massive towers still rears its rugged head as a picturesque ruin  the moon sailed out from under a mass of clouds at this point giving to objects the distinctness of daylight  hitherto billy towler had retained some idea of the direction in which he was being led but this last turn threw his topographical ideas into utter confusion  a queer place this he remarked as they emerged from the narrowest passage they had yet traversed into a neat snug and most unexpected little square with a garden in the middle of it and a flagstaff in one corner  adamandeve gardens they call it said mr jones were pretty nigh home now  i wonder they didnt call it eden at once observed billy it would have been shorter and comes to the same thing  here we are at last said mr jones stumbling against a small door in one of the network of rows that surrounded this yarmouth paradise hope the women are in he added attempting to lift the latch but finding that the door was locked he hammered at it with foot and fist violently  hallo shouted the deep voice of a man within  hallo indeed  who may you be growled mr jones with an angry oath  open the door will you  the door was opened at once by james welton who stood aside to let the other pass  oh its you is it said mr jones  didnt recognise your voice through the door  i thought you couldnt have got the sloop made snug so soon  well lass how are ee and hows the old ooman  as the man made these inquiries in a halfhearty voice he advanced into a poorlyfurnished apartment so small and low that it seemed a couple of sizes too small for him and bestowed a kiss first upon the cheek of his old mother who sat cowering over the fire but brightened up on hearing his voice and then upon the forehead of his daughter nora the cheerfulness of whose greeting however was somewhat checked when she observed the intoxicated state of her father  nora had a face which though not absolutely pretty was intensely winsome in consequence of an air of quiet womanly tenderness which surrounded it as with a halo  she was barely eighteen but her soft eyes possessed a look of sorrow and suffering which if not natural to them had at all events become habitual  who is this little boy father she said turning towards billy towler who still stood in the doorway a silent but acute observer of all that went on  oh that whyathats my noo prentice just come down from gravesend  hes been helpin for some time in the hang by which mr jones meant the place where his fish were cured and im goin to take him to sea with me next trip  come in billy and make yourself at home  the boy obeyed with alacrity and made no objection to a cup of tea and slice of bread and butter which nora placed before himsupper being just then in progress  youd better get aboard as soon as may be said jones to jim welton somewhat sternly  i didnt expect you to leave the sloop tonight  and i didnt intend to leave her replied jim taking no notice of the tone in which this was said but i thought id come up to ask if you wished me to begin dischargin early tomorrow morning  no were not going to discharge returned jones  not going to discharge echoed jim in surprise  no  i find that its not worth while discharging any part of the cargo here  on the contrary i mean to fill up with bloaters and run over with them to the coast of france so you can go and stow the top tier of casks more firmly and get ready for the noo ones  goodnight  the tone in which this was said left no excuse for jim to linger so he bade the household goodnight and departed  he had not gone far however when he was arrested by the sound of a light footstep  it was that of nora who had followed him  nora exclaimed the young sailor in surprise returning quickly and taking one of the girls hands in both of his  oh jim said nora with a look and tone of earnest entreaty dont dont forsake him just nowif the love which you have so often professed for me be true dont forsake him i beseech you  jim protested in the most emphatic terms that he had no intention of forsaking anybody and made a great many more protestations in the midst of which there were numerous ardent and more or less appropriate references to hearts that never deserted their colours sheetanchors that held on through thick and thin and needles that pointed without the smallest shadow of variation to the pole  but what makes you think im going to leave him he asked at the end of one of those flights  because he is so rough to ee jim replied the girl leaning her head on her lovers shoulder he spoke so gruff even now and i thought you went away huffed  oh jim you are the only one that has any influence over him  not the only one returned jim quietly smoothing the fair girls hair with his hard strong hand  well the only man at any rate continued nora especially when he is overcome with that dreadful drink  dear jim you wont forsake him will you even though he should insult even though he should strike you  no never  because he is your father nora ill stick by him in spite of all he can say or do to me and try god helping me to save him but i cannot stick by him if  if what asked the girl anxiously observing that he hesitated  if he does anything against the laws said jim in a low voice  it isnt that im afraid of my good nameid even let that go for your sake if by so doing i could get him out of mischief and as long as i know nothing against him for certain ill stand by him  but if he does fall and i come to know it i must leave him nora because i wont be art and part in it  i could no longer go on my knees to pray for him if i did that nora  moreover if anything o that sort should happen i must leave the country because hed be sure to be caught and tried and i will never stand witness against your father if i can avoid it by fair means  poor nora hung her head as she asked in a low voice if jim really thought her father was engaged in illegal practices  i cant say that i do replied the youth earnestly  come cheer up dearest nora  after all it is chiefly through reports that my suspicions have been aroused and we all know how easy it is for an enemy to raise an evil report  but nora i wish you had not bound me to secrecy as to my reason for sticking by your father  why should i not say boldly that its all for love of you  why should you wish to give any reason at all jim and above all that reason asked nora looking up with a blush  because said the youth with a perplexed look my secrecy about the matter has puzzled my father to such an extent that his confidence in me is entirely shaken  i have been all my life accustomed to open all my heart to him and now without rhyme or reason as he thinks i have suddenly gone right round on the other tack and at the same time as he says i have taken up with doubtful company  now if  the sound of approaching footsteps here brought the interview to an abrupt close  nora ran back to her poor home and jim welton directing his steps towards the harbour returned on board the little sloop which had been named after the girl of his heart    chapter seven  treats of queeker and othersalso of youthful jealousy love poetry and confusion of ideas  returning now to the moonstruck and katiesmitten queeker we find that poetic individual walking disconsolately in front of mr george durants mansion  in a previous chapter it has been said that after composing his celebrated lines to the lantern of the floating light he resolved to drop in upon the durants about teatimeand well did queeker know their teatime although every time he went there uninvited the miserable hypocrite expressed surprise at finding them engaged with that meal and said he had supposed they must have finished tea by that time  but on arriving at the corner of the street his fluttering heart failed him  the thought of the cousin was a stumblingblock which he could not surmount  he had never met her before he feared that she might be witty or sarcastic or sharp in some way or other and would certainly make game of him in the presence of katie  he had observed this cousin narrowly at the singingclass and had been much impressed with her appearance but whether this impression was favourable or unfavourable was to him in the then confused state of his feelings a matter of great uncertainty  now that he was about to face her he felt convinced that she must be a cynic who would poison the mind of katie against him and no power within his unfortunate body was capable of inducing him to advance and raise the knocker  thus he hung in torments of suspense until nine oclock whenin a fit of desperation he rushed madly at the door and committed himself by hitting it with his fist  his equanimity was not restored by its being opened by mr durant himself  queeker exclaimed the old gentleman in surprise come in my dear sir did you stumble against the door  i hope you havent hurt yourself  not at allano not at all the fact is i ran up the steps rather hastily andhow do you do miss durant  i hope you are quite well  poor queeker said this and shook hands with as much earnestness as if he had not seen katie for five years  quite well thank you  my cousin fanny henningsmr queeker  fanny bowed and mr queeker bowed and with a flushed countenance asked her about the state of her health with unnatural anxiety  thank you mr squeeker i am very well replied fanny  the unhappy youth would have corrected her in regard to his name but hesitated and missed the opportunity and when shortly afterwards while engaged in conversation with mr durant he observed fanny giggling violently in a corner by herself he felt assured that katie had kindly made the correction for him  the announcement of supper relieved him slightly and he was beginning to calm down over a piece of bread and cheese when the doorbell rang immediately after a heavy foot was heard in the passage the parlour door was flung open the maid announced mr hall and a tall elegant young man entered the room  his figure was slender but his chest was deep and his shoulders were broad and square  an incipient moustache of fair hair floated like a summer cloud on his upper lip which expanded with a hearty smile as he advanced towards mr durant and held out his hand  you have forgotten me i fear he said  forgotten you exclaimed the old gentleman starting up and seizing the young mans hand which he shook violentlyforgotten stanley halllittle stanney as i used to call you  man how you are grown to be sure  what a wonderful change  for the worse i fear exclaimed the youth laughing  come no fishing for compliments sir  let me introduce you to my daughter katie my niece fanny hennings and my young friend queeker now then sit down and make yourself at home youre just in time weve only just begun ring the bell for another plate katie  how glad i am to see you stanney my boyi cant call you by any other than the old name you see  how did you leave your father and what brings you here  come out with it all at once  i declare you have quite excited me  well was it for poor queeker that every one was too much occupied with the newcomer to pay any attention to him for he could not prevent his visage from betraying something of the feelings which harrowed up his soul  the moment he set eyes on stanley hall mortal jealousykeen rampant virulent jealousy of the worst typepenetrated every fibre of his being and turned his heart to stone  we cannot afford space to detail the various shades of agony the degrees of despair through which this unfortunate young man passed during that evening  a thick volume would not suffice to contain it all  language is powerless to express it  only those who have similarly suffered can conceive it  of course we need scarcely add that there was no occasion for jealousy nothing was further from the mind of stanley than the idea of falling in love with katie  nevertheless politeness required that he should address himself to her occasionally  at such times queekers soul was stabbed in an unutterable manner  he managed to command himself notwithstanding  to his credit be it said that he refrained from using the carvingknife  he even joined with some show of interest of course hypocritical in the conversation  stanley hall was not only goodlooking but goodhumoured and full of quiet fun and anecdote so that he quickly ingratiated himself with all the members of the family  dyou know it makes me feel young again to hear these old stories about your fathers collegelife said mr durant  have some more cheese stanneyyou look like a man who ought to have a good appetitefill your glass and pass the bottlethanks  now how comes it that you have turned up in this outoftheway part of the world  bythebye i hope you intend to stay some time and that you will take up your quarters with me  you cant imagine how much pleasure it would give me to have the son of my old companion as a guest for some time  im sure that katie joins me heartily in this hope  queekers spirit sank with horror and when katie smilingly seconded her fathers proposal his heart stood still with dismay  fanny hennings who had begun to suspect that there was something wrong with queeker put her handkerchief to her mouth and coughed with what appeared to be unreasonable energy  i regret said stanley and queekers breath came more freely that my stay must necessarily be short  i need not say that it would afford me the highest pleasure to accept your kind invitation he turned with a slight bow to katie and queeker almost fainted but the truth is that i have come down on a particular piece of business in regard to which i wish to have your advice and must return to london tomorrow or next day at furthest  queekers heart resumed its office  i am sorry to hear thatvery sorry  however you shall stay tonight at all events and you shall have the best advice i can give you on any subject you choose to mention  by the way talking of advice youre an md now i fancy  not yet replied stanley  i am not quite fledged although nearly so and i wish to go on a voyage before completing my course  quite right quite rightsee a little of life first eh  but how comes it stanney that you took kindly to the work at last for when i knew you first you could not bear the idea of becoming a doctor  ones ideas change i suppose replied the youth with a smileprobably my making the discovery that i had some talent in that direction had something to do with it  hm how did you make that discovery my boy asked the old gentleman  that question cant easily be answered except by my inflicting on you a chapter of my early life replied stanley laughing  then inflict it on us without delay my boy  i shall delight to listen and so i am sure will katie and fanny  as to my young friend queeker he is of a somewhat literary turn and may perhaps throw the incidents into verse if they are of a sufficiently romantic character  katie and fanny declared they would be charmed to hear about it and queeker said in a savagely jesting tone that he was so used to things being inflicted on him that he didnt mindrather liked it than otherwise  but you must not imagine said stanley that i have a thrilling narrative to give you i can merely relate the two incidents which fixed my destiny in regard to a profession  you remember i daresay that my heart was once set upon going to sea  well like most boys i refused to listen to advice on that point and told my father that i should never make a surgeonthat i had no taste or talent for the medical profession  the more my father tried to reason me out of my desire the more obstinate i became  the only excuse that i can plead is that i was very young very ignorant and very stupid  one day however i was left in the surgery with a number of dirty phials to washmy father having gone to visit a patient at a short distance when our servant came running in saying that there was a cab at the door with a poor boy who had got his cheek badly cut  as i knew that my father would be at home in less than quarter of an hour i ordered him to be brought in the poor childa little delicate boywas very pale and bleeding profusely from a deep gash in the cheek made accidentally by a knife with which he had been playing  the mouth was cut open almost to the ear  we laid him on a sofa and i did what i could to stop the flow of blood  i was not sixteen at the time and being very small for my age had never before felt myself in a position to offer advice and indeed i had not much to offer  but one of the bystanders said to me while we were looking at the child  what do you think should be done sir  the mere fact of being asked my opinion gratified my vanity and the respectful sir with which the question concluded caused my heart to beat high with unwonted emotion  it was the first time i had ever been addressed gravely as a man it was a new sensation and i think may be regarded as an era in my existence  with much gravity i replied that of course the wound ought to be sewed up  then sooner its done the better i think said the bystander for the poor child will bleed to death if it is allowed to go on like that  a sudden resolution entered into my mind  i stroked my chin and frowned as if in deep thought then turning to the man who had spoken saidit ought certainly to be done with as little delay as possible i expect my father to return every minute but as it is an urgent case i will myself undertake it if the parents of the child have no objection  seems to me lad remarked a country fellow who had helped to carry the child in that it beant a time to talk o parients objectin wen the cheelds bloodn to deth  yed better fa to work at onceif ee knows how  i cast upon this man a look of scorn but made no reply  going to the drawer in which the surgical instruments were kept i took out those that suited my purpose and went to work with a degree of coolness which astonished myself  i had often seen my father sew up wounds and had assisted at many an operation of the kind so that although altogether unpractised i was not ignorant of the proper mode of procedure  the people looked on with breathless interest  when i had completed the operation i saw my father looking over the shoulders of the people with an expression of unutterable surprise not unmingled with amusement  i blushed deeply and began some sort of explanation which however he cut short by observing in an offhand manner that the thing had been done very well and the child had better be carried into my bedroom and left there to rest for some time  he thus got the people out of the surgery and then when we were alone told me that i was a born surgeon that he could not have done it much better himself and in short praised me to such an extent that i felt quite proud of my performance  queeker who had listened up to this point with breathless attention suddenly said  dyou mean to say that you really did that  i do replied stanley with an amused smile  sewed up a mouth cut all the way to the ear  yes  with aa  with a needle and thread said stanley  queekers powers of utterance were paralysed  he looked at the young doctor with a species of awestricken admiration  jealousy for the time was in abeyance  this then was the beginning of your love for the profession said mr durant  undoubtedly it was but a subsequent event confirmed me in my devotion to it and induced me to give up all thoughts of the sea  the praise that i had received from my fatherwho was not usually lavish of complimentary remarksmade me ambitious to excel in other departments of surgery so i fixed upon the extraction of teeth as my next step in the profession  my father had a pretty large practice in that way  we lived as you remember in the midst of a populous rural district and had frequent visits from farm servants and labourers with heads tied up and lugubrious faces  i began to fit myself for duty by hammering big nails into a block of wood and drawing them out again  this was a device of my own for i wished to give my father another surprise and did not wish to betray what i was about by asking his advice as to how i should proceed  i then extracted the teeth from the jawbones of all the sheepsheads that i could lay hands on after a good deal of practice in this way i tried to tempt our cook with an offer of five shillings to let me extract a back tooth which had caused her a great deal of suffering at intervals for many months but she was a timid woman and would not have allowed me for five guineas i believe even to look into her mouth  i also tried to tempt our small stableboy with a similar sum  he was a plucky little fellow and although there was not an unsound tooth in his head agreed to let me draw one of the smallest of his back teeth for seven and sixpence if it should come out the first pull and sixpence for every extra rug  i thought the little fellow extravagant in his demands but rather than lose the chance submitted  he sat down quite boldly on our operating chair but grew pale when i advanced with the instrument when i tried to open his mouth he began to whimper and finally struggling out of my grasp fled  i afterwards gave him sixpence however for affording me as i told him so much pleasurable anticipation  after this i cast about for another subject but failed to procure a live one  it occurred to me however that i might try my hand on two skeletons that hung in our garret so i got their heads off without delay and gradually extracted every tooth in their jaws  as there were about sixty teeth i think in each pair i felt myself much improved before the jaws were toothless  at last i resolved to take advantage of the first opportunity that should offer during my fathers absence to practise on the living subject  it was not long before i had a chance  one morning my father went out leaving me in the surgery as was his wont  i was deeply immersed in a book on anatomy when i heard a tremendous double rapas if made with the head of a stickat the outer door and immediately after the question put in the gruff bass voice of an irishman is the dactur within  a tremendous growl of disappointment followed the reply  then after a pause is the assistant within  this was followed by a heavy tread in the passage and next moment an enormous man in very ragged fustian with a bronzed hairy face and a reapinghook under his arm stood in the surgery his head almost touching the ceiling  sure its niver the dacturs assistant ye are he exclaimed with a look of surprise  i rose drew myself up and endeavouring to look very solemn said that i was and demanded to know if i could do anything for him  ah then its a small assistant ye are anyhow he remarked but stopped suddenly and his huge countenance was convulsed with pain as he clapped his hand to his face and uttered a groan which was at least three parts composed of a growl  hooroo whirrrhach musha but its like the cratur o vesoovious all aliveoin me head  av it dont split up me jawtherehaoch  the giant stamped his foot with such violence that all the glasses cups and vials in the room rang again and clapping both hands over his mouth he bent himself double in a paroxysm of agony  i felt a strange mixture of wild delight and alarm shoot through me the chance had come in my way but in anticipating it i had somehow always contemplated operating on some poor boy or old woman  my thoughts had never depicted such a herculean and rude specimen of humanity  at first he would not believe me capable of extracting a tooth but i spoke with such cool selfpossession and assurancethough far from feeling eitherthat he consented to submit to the operation for the sake of additional security i seated him on the floor and took his head between my knees and i confess that when seated thus in such close proximity to his rugged as well as massive head gazing into the cavern filled with elephantine tusks my heart almost failed me  far back in the darkest corner of the cave i saw the decayed tootha massive lump of glistening ivory with a black pit in the middle of it screwing up my courage to the utmost i applied the key  the giant winced at the touch but clasped his hard hands togetherevidently prepared for the worst  i began to twist with right goodwill  the man roared furiously and gave a convulsive heave that almost upset myself and the big chair and disengaged the key  oh come said i remonstratively you ought to stand it better than that why the worst of it was almost over  was it though he inquired earnestly with an upward glance that gave to his countenance in that position a hideous aspect  sure it had need be for the worst baits all that iver i drained of  go at it again me boy  resolving to make sure work of it next time i fixed the key again and after getting it pretty tightat which point he evidently fancied the worst had been again reachedi put forth all my strength in one tremendous twist  i failed for a moment to draw the tusk but i drew forth a prolonged roar that can by no means be conceived or described  the irishman struggled  i held on tight to his head with my knees  the chair tottered on its legs  letting go the hair of his head i clapped my left hand to my right and with both arms redoubled the strain  the roar rose into a terrible yowl  there was a crash like the rending of a forest tree  i dropped the instrument sprang up turned the chair on the top of the man and cramming it down on him rushed to the door which i threw open and then faced about  there was a huge iron pestle lying on a table near my hand  seizing it i swayed it gently to and fro ready to knock him down with it if he should rush at me or to turn and fly as should seem most advisable  i was terribly excited and a good deal alarmed as to the possible consequences but managed with much difficulty to look collected  the big chair was hurled into a corner as he rose sputtering from the floor and holding his jaws with both hands  och ye spalpeen is that the way ye trait people  yes i replied in a voice of forced calmness we usually put a restraint on strong men like you when theyre likely to be violent  i saw the corners of his eyes wrinkle a little and felt more confidence  arrah but its the jawbone yeve took out ye goormacalluchscrowl  no it isnt its only the tooth i replied going forward and picking it up from the floor  the amazement of the man is not to be described  i gave him a tumbler of water and pointing to a basin told him to wash out his mouth which he did looking at me all the time however and following me with his astonished eyes as i moved about the room  he seemed to have been bereft of the power of speech for all that he could say after that was och av yer small yer cliver  on leaving he asked what was to pay  i said that id ask nothing as he had stood it so well and he left me with the same look of astonishment in his eyes and words of commendation on his lips  well that was a tremendous experience to begin with said mr durant laughing and so it made you a doctor  it helped  when my father came home i presented him with the tooth and from that day to this i have been hard at work but i feel a little seedy just now from overstudy so i have resolved to try to get a berth as surgeon on board a ship bound for india australia china or south america and as you are a shipowner and old friend i thought it just possible you might be not only willing but able to help me to what i want  and you thought right stanney my boy said the old gentleman heartily i have a ship going to sail for india in a few weeks and we have not yet appointed a surgeon  you shall have that berth if it suits you  at this point they were interrupted by the entrance of a servant maid with the announcement that there was a man in the lobby who wished to see mr durant  ill be back shortly said the old gentleman to stanley as he rose go to the drawingroom girls and give mr hall some music  youll find that my katie sings and plays very sweetly although she wont let me say so  fanny joins her with a fine contralto i believe and queeker too he singsaa what is it queekera bass or a baritoneeh  without waiting for a reply mr durant left the room and found morley jones standing in the lobby hat in hand  the old gentlemans expression changed instantly and he said with much severity  well mr jones what do you want  morley begged the favour of a private interview for a few minutes after a moments hesitation mr durant led him into his study  another loan i suppose said the old gentleman as he lit the gas  i had expected to have called to pay the last loan sir replied mr jones somewhat boldly but one cant force the market  i have my sloop down here loaded with herrings and if i chose to sell at a loss could pay my debt to you twice over but surely it can scarcely be expected of me to do that  i hear there is a rise in france just now and mean to run over there with them  i shall be sure to dispose of em to advantage  on my return ill pay your loan with interest  morley jones paused and mr durant looked at him attentively for a few seconds  is this all you came to tell me  why no sir not exactly replied jones a little disconcerted by the stern manner of the old gentleman  the sloop is not quite filled up she could stow a few more casks but i have been cleaned out and unless i can get the loan of forty or fifty pounds  ha  i thought so  are you aware mr jones that your character for honesty has of late been called in question  i am aware that i have got enemies replied the fishmerchant coldly if their false reports are to be believed to my disadvantage of course i cannot expect  it is not my belief in their reports replied mr durant that creates suspicion in me but i couple these reports with the fact that you have again and again deceived me in regard to the repayment of the loans which you have already received at various times from me  i cant help illluck sir said morley with a downcast look  if mens friends always deserted them at the same time with fortune there would be an end of all trade  mr jones said the other decidedly i tell you plainly that you are presumptuous when you count me one of your friends  your deceased brother having been an old and faithful servant of mine was considered by me a friend and it is out of regard to his memory alone that i have assisted you  even now i will lend you the sum you ask but be assured it is the last you shall ever get from me  i distrust you sir and i tell you soflatly  while he was speaking the old gentleman had opened a desk  he now sat down and wrote out a cheque which he handed to his visitor who received it with a grim smile and a curt acknowledgment and instantly took his leave  mr durant smoothed the frown from his brow and returned to the drawingroom where katies sweet voice instantly charmed away the memory of the evil spirit that had just left him  the table was covered with beautiful pencil sketches and chalkheads and watercolour drawings in various stages of progressionall of which were the production of the same fair busy and talented little hand that copied the accounts for the board of trade for love instead of money without a blot and without defrauding of dot or stroke a single i or t  queeker was gazing at one of the sketches with an aspect so haggard and savage that mr durant could not refrain from remarking it  why queeker you seem to be displeased with that drawing eh  whats wrong with it  oh ah exclaimed the youth starting and becoming very red in the faceno not with the drawing it is beautifulmost beautiful but iinfact i was thinking sir that thought sometimes leads us into regions of gloom in whichwhereone cant see ones way and ignes fatui mislead oror  very true queeker interrupted the old gentleman goodhumouredly thought is a wonderful quality of the mindtransports us in a moment from the indies to the poles fastens with equal facility on the substantial and the impalpable gropes among the vague generalities of the abstract and wriggles with ease through the thick obscurities of the concreteeh queeker  come give us a song like a good fellow  i never singi cannot sing sir said the youth hurriedly  no why i thought katie said you were attending the singingclass  the fat cousin was observed here to put her handkerchief to her mouth and bend convulsively over a drawing  queeker explained that he had just begun to attend but had not yet attained sufficient confidence to sing in public  then starting up he suddenly pulled out his watch exclaimed that he was quite ashamed of having remained so late shook hands nervously all round and rushing from the house left stanley hall in possession of the field  now the poor youths state of mind is not easily accounted for stanley being a close observer had at an early part of the evening detected the cause of queekers jealousy and being a kindly fellow sought by devoting himself to fanny hennings to relieve his young friend but strange to say queeker was not relieved  this fact was a matter of profound astonishment even to queeker himself who went home that night in a state of mind which cannot be adequately described sat down before his desk and with his head buried in his hands thought intensely  can it be he murmured in a sepulchral voice looking up with an expression of horror that i love them both  impossible  horrible perish the thoughtyes  seizing a pen    perish the thought   which never ought   to be   let not the thing  thingwingbingpingjingringlingtingclingdear me what a lot of words with little or no meaning there are in the english languagewhat will rhyme withah  i have itsting    let not the thing   reveal its sting   to me  having penned these lines queeker heaved a deep sighcast one long lingering gaze on the moon and went to bed    chapter eight  the sloop noramr jones becomes communicative and billy towler for the first time in his life thoughtful  a dead calm with a soft golden halftransparent mist had settled down on old father thames when early one morning the sloop nora floated rather than sailed towards the mouth of that celebrated river bent in the absence of wind on creeping out to sea with the tide  jim welton stood at the helm which in the circumstances required only attention from one of his legs so that his hands rested idly in his coat pockets  morley jones stood beside him  so you managed the insurance did you said jim in a careless way as though he put the question more for the sake of saying something than for any interest he had in the matter  mr jones whose eyes and manner betrayed the fact that even at that early hour he had made application to the demonspirit which led him captive at its will looked suspiciously at his questioner and replied  well yes ive managed it  for how much inquired jim  for 300 pounds  jim looked surprised  dye think the herring are worth that he asked  no they aint but theres some general cargo besides asll make it up to that includin the value o the sloop which ive put down at 100 pounds  moreover jim i have named you as the skipper  they required his name dye see and as im not exactly a seafarin man myself an wanted to appear only as the owner i named you  but that was wrong said jim for im not the master  yes you are replied morley with a laugh  i make you master now so pray captain welton attend to your duty and be civil to your employer  theres a breeze coming that will send you foul o the maplin light if you dont look out  whats the name o the passenger that came aboard at gravesend and what makes him take a fancy to such a craft as this inquired jim  i can answer these questions for myself said the passenger referred to who happened at that moment to come on deck  my name is stanley hall and i have taken a fancy to the nora chiefly because she somewhat resembles in size and rig a yacht which belonged to my father and in which i have had many a pleasant cruise  i am fond of the sea and prefer going to ramsgate in this way rather than by rail  i suppose you will approve my preference of the sea he added with a smile  i do indeed responded jim  the sea is my native element  i could swim in it as soon amost as i could walk and i believe thatone way or other in or on iti have had more to do with it than with the land  you are a good swimmer then i doubt not said stanley  pretty fair replied jim modestly  pretty fair echoed morley jones why hes the best swimmer ill be bound in norfolkay if he were brought to the test i do blieve hed turn out to be the best in the kingdom  on the strength of this subject the two young men struck up an acquaintance which before they had been long together ripened into what might almost be styled a friendship  they had many sympathies in common  both were athletic both were mentally as well as physically active and although stanley hall had the inestimable advantage of a liberal education jim welton possessed a naturally powerful intellect with a capacity for turning every scrap of knowledge to good use  their conversation was at that time however cut short by the springing up of a breeze which rendered it necessary that the closest attention should be paid to the management of the vessel among the numerous shoals which rendered the navigation there somewhat difficult  it may be that many thousands of those who annually leave london on voyages short and longof profit and pleasurehave very little idea of the intricacy of the channels through which they pass and the number of obstructions which in the shape of sandbanks intersect the mouth of the thames at its junction with the ocean  without pilots and an elaborate wellconsidered system of lights buoys and beacons a vessel would be about as likely to reach london from the ocean or vice versa in safety as a man who should attempt to run through an old timberyard blindfold would be to escape with unbroken neck and shins of shoals there are the east and west barrows the nob the knock the john the sunk the girdler and the long sands all lying like so many groundsharks quiet unobtrusive but very deadly waiting for ships to devour and getting them too very frequently despite the precautions taken to rob them of their costly food  these sandsharks if we may be allowed the expression separate the main channels which are named respectively the swin or kings channel on the north and the princes the queens and the south channels on the south  the channel through which the nora passed was the swin which though not used by firstclass ships is perhaps the most frequented by the greater portion of the coasting and colliery vessels and all the east country craft  the traffic is so great as to be almost continuous innumerable vessels being seen in fine weather passing to and fro as far as the eye can reach  to mark this channel alone there was at the time we write of the mouse lightvessel at the western extremity of the mouse sand the maplin lighthouse on the sand of the same name the swin middle lightvessel at the western extremity of the middle and heaps sand the whittaker beacon and the sunk lightvessel on the sunk sandbesides other beacons and numerous buoys  when we add that floating lights and beacons cost thousands and hundreds of pounds to build and that even buoys are valued in many cases at more than a hundred pounds each besides the cost of maintenance it may be conceived that the great work of lighting and buoying the channels of the kingdomapart from the lighthouse system altogetheris one of considerable expense constant anxiety and vast national importance it may also be conceived that the elder brethren of the corporation of trinity houseby whom from the time of henry viii down to the present day that arduous duty has been admirably performedhold a position of the highest responsibility  it is not our intention however to trouble the reader with further remarks on this subject at this point in our tale  in a future chapter we shall add a few facts regarding the trinity corporation which will doubtless prove interesting meanwhile we have said sufficient to show that there was good reason for jim welton to hold his tongue and mind his helm  when the dangerous navigation was past mr jones took billy towler apart and sitting down near the weather gangway entered into a private and confidential talk with that sprightly youngster  billy my boy he said with a leer that was meant to be at once amiable and patronising you and i suit each other very well dont we  billy who had been uncommonly well treated by his new master thrust his hands into the waistband of his trousers and putting his head meditatively on one side said in a low voice  hmwell yes you suit me pretty well  the respectable fishcurer chuckled and patted his protege on the back after which he proceeded to discuss or rather to detail some matters which had he been less affected by the contents of squaretom he might have hesitated to touch upon  yes he said youll do very well billy  youre a good boy and a sharp one which you see is exactly what i need  there are a lot o small matters that i want you to do for me and that couldnt be very well done by anybody else cause dye see there aint many lads o your age who unite so many good qualities  very true remarked billy gravely nodding his headwhich by the way was now decorated with a small straw hat and blue ribbon as was his little body with a blue guernsey shirt and his small legs with white duck trousers of approved sailor cut  now among other things resumed morley i want you to learn some lessons  billy shook his head with much decision  that wont go down mister jones  i dont mean for to larn no more lessons  ive ad more than enough o that  fact is i consider myself edicated raither igher than usual  cant i read and write and do a bit o cypherin  moreover i knows that the world goes round the sun wich is contrairy to the notions o the haincients wot wos rediklous enough to suppose that the sun went round the world  and dont i know that the earth is like a orange flattened at the poles though i dont blieve there is no poles an dont care a button if there was thats enough o jogrify for my money wen i wants more ill ax for it  but it aint that sort o lesson i mean billy said mr jones who was somewhat amused at the indignant tone in which all this was said the lesson i want you to learn is this i want you to git off by heart what you and i are doin an going to do so that if you should ever come to be questioned about it at different times by different people you might always give em the same intelligent answerdye understand  whew whistled the boy opening his eyes and showing his teeth beaks an maginstrates eh  just so  and remember my boy that you and i have been doin one or two things together of late that makes it best for both of us to be very affectionate to and careful about each other  dye understand that  billy towler pursed his little red lips as he nodded his small head and winked one of his large blue eyes  a slight deepening of the red on his cheeks told eloquently enough that he did understand that  the tempter had gone a long way in his course by that time  so many of the folds of the thin net had been thrown over the little thoughtless victim that lighthearted and defiant though he was by nature he had begun to experience a sense of restraint which was quite new to him  now billy continued jones let me tell you that our prospects are pretty bright just now  i have effected an insurance on my sloop and cargo for 300 pounds which means that ive been to a certain great city that you and i know of and paid into a companywe shall call it the submarine insurance companya small sum for a bit of paper which they call a policy by which they bind themselves to pay me 300 pounds if i should lose my ship and cargo  you see my lad the risks of the sea are very great and theres no knowing what may happen between this and the coast of france to which we are bound after touching at ramsgate dye understand  billy shook his head and with an air of perplexity said that he wasnt quite up to that dodgedidnt exactly see through it  supposin said he you does lose the sloop an cargo why wot thenthe sloop an cargo cost somethin i dessay  ah billy youre a smart boya knowing young rascal replied mr jones nodding approval of course they cost something but therein lies the advantage  the whole affair sloop an cargo aint worth more than a few pounds so if i throw it all away it will be only losing a few pounds for the sake of gaining three hundred  what think you of that lad  i think the submarine insurance company must be oncommon green to be took in so easy replied the youngster with a knowing smile  they aint exactly green either boy but they know that if they made much fuss and bother about insuring they would soon lose their customers so they often run the risk of a knowin fellow like me and take the loss rather than scare people away  you know if a grocer was in the habit of carefully weighing and testing with acid every sovereign he got before he would sell a trifle over the counterif he called every note in question and sent up to the bank to see whether it wasnt a forgery why his honest customers wouldnt be able to stand it theyd give him up  so he just gives the sovereign a ring and the note a glance an takes his chance  so it is in some respects with insurance companies  they look at the man and the papers see that alls right as well as they can and hope for the best  thats how it is  ha they must be jolly companies to have to do with  id like to transact some business with them submarines said the boy gravely  and so you shall my lad so you shall cried mr jones with a laugh all in good time  well as i was saying the cargo aint worth much it dont extend down to the keel billy by no means and as for the sloopshes not worth a ropesend  shes as rotten as an old coffin its all ive been able to do to make her old timbers hold together for this voyage  billy towler opened his eyes very wide at this and felt slightly uncomfortable  if she goes down in midchannel said he it strikes me that the submarines will get the best of it cause it dont seem to me that youre able to swim eight or ten miles at a stretch  we have a boat billy we have a boat my smart boy  mr jones accompanied this remark with a wink and a slight poke with his thumb in the smart boys side which however did not seem to have the effect of reassuring billy for he continued to raise various objections such as the improbability of the sloop giving them time to get into a boat when she took it into her head to go down and the likelihood of their reaching the land in the event of such a disaster occurring during a gale or even a stiff breeze  to all of which mr jones replied that he might make his mind easy because he jones knew well what he was about and would manage the thing cleverly  now billy heres the lesson that youve got to learn  besides remembering everything that i have told you and only answering questions in the way that i have partly explained and will explain more fully at another time you will take particular note that we left the thames today all right with a full cargojim welton bein master and one passenger bein aboard whom we agreed to put ashore at ramsgate that you heard me say the vessel and cargo were insured for 300 pounds but were worth more and that i said i hoped to make a quick voyage over and back  besides all this billy boy youll keep a sharp lookout and wont be surprised if i should teach you to steer and get the others on board to go below  if you should observe me do anything while you are steering or should hear any noises youll be so busy with the tiller and the compass that youll forget all about that and never be able to answer any questions about such things at all  have i made all that quite plain to you  yes captain hall right  billy had taken to styling his new employer captain and mr jones did not object  well go forard and take a nap  i shall want you tonight perhaps it may be not till tomorrow night  the small boy went forward as he was bid and leaning over the bulwark of the nora watched for a long time the rippling foam that curled from her bows and slid quietly along her black hull but billys thoughts were not like his eyes fixed upon the foam  for the first time in his life perhaps the foundling outcast began to feel that he was running in a dangerous road and entertained some misgivings that he was an uncommonly wild if not wicked fellow  it is not to be supposed that his perceptions on this subject were very clear or his meditations unusually profound but it is certain that during the short period of his residence in the school of which mention has been made his conscience had been awakened and partially enlightened so that his precociously quick intelligence enabled him to arrive at a more just apprehension of his condition than might have been expected considering his years and early training  we do not say that billys heart smote him  that little organ was susceptible only of impressions of jollity and mischief  in other respectsnever having been appealed to by loveit was as hard as a small millstone  but the poor boys anxieties were aroused and the new sensation appeared to add a dozen years to his life  up to this time he had been accustomed to estimate his wickednesses by the number of days weeks or months of incarceration that they involveda wipe he would say was so many weeks a silver sneezingbox or a gold ticker in certain circumstances so many more while a crack ie a burglary to which by the way he had only aspired as yet might cost something like a trip over the sea at the queens expense but it had never entered into the head of the small transgressor of the law to meditate such an awful deed as the sinking of a ship involving as it did the possibility of murder and suicide or hanging if he should escape the latter contingency  moreover he now began to realise more clearly the fact that he had cast in his lot with a desperate man who would stick at nothing and from whose clutches he felt assured that it would be no easy matter to escape  he resolved however to make the attempt the first favourable opportunity that should offer and while the resolve was forming in his small brain his little brows frowned sternly at the foam on the noras cutwater  when the resolve was fairly formed fixed and disposed of billys brow cleared and his heart rose superior to its cares  he turned gaily round  observing that the seaman who with himself and jim welton composed the crew of the sloop was sitting on the heel of the bowsprit half asleep he knocked his cap off dived down the forehatch with a merry laugh flung himself into his berth and instantly fell asleep to dream of the dearest joys that had as yet crossed his earthly pathnamely his wayward wanderings on long summer days among the sunny fields and hedgerows of hampstead kensington finchley and other suburbs of london    chapter nine  mr jones takes strong measures to secure his ends and introduces billy and his friends to some new scenes and moments  again we are in the neighbourhood of the goodwin sands  it is evening the sun has just gone down  the air and sea are perfectly still  the stars are coming out one by one and the floating lights have already hoisted their neverfailing signals  the nora lies becalmed not far from the goodwin buoy with her sails hanging idly on the yards  bill towler stands at the helm with all the aspect and importance of a steersman but without any other duty to perform than the tiller could have performed for itself  morley jones stands beside him with his hands in his coat pockets and stanley hall sits on the cabin skylight gazing with interest at the innumerable lights of the shipping in the roadstead and the more distant houses on shore  jim welton having been told that he will have to keep watch all night is down below taking a nap and grundy having been ordered below to attend to some trifling duty in the fore part of the vessel is also indulging in slumber  long and earnestly and anxiously had morley jones watched for an opportunity to carry his plans into execution but as yet without success  either circumstances were against him or his heart had failed him at the push  he walked up and down the deck with uncertain steps sat down and rose up frequently and growled a good dealall of which symptoms were put down by stanley to the fact that there was no wind  at last morley stopped in front of his passenger and said to him  i really think youd better go below and have a nap mr hall  its quite clear that we are not goin to have a breeze till night and it may be early morning when we call you to go ashore so if you want to be fit for much work tomorrow youd better sleep while you may  thank you i dont require much sleep replied stanley in fact i can easily do without rest at any time for a single night and be quite able for work next day  besides i have no particular work to do tomorrow and i delight to sit at this time of the night and watch the shipping  im not in your way am i  oh not at all not at all replied the fishmerchant as he resumed his irregular walk  this question was prompted by the urgency with which the advice to go below had been given  seeing that nothing was to be made of his passenger in this way morley jones cast about in his mind to hit upon another expedient to get rid of him and reproached himself for having been tempted by a good fare to let him have a passage  suddenly his eye was attracted by a dark object floating in the sea a considerable distance to the southward of them  thats lucky muttered jones after examining it carefully with the glass while a gleam of satisfaction shot across his dark countenance could not have come in better time  nothing could be better  shutting up the glass with decision he turned round and the look of satisfaction gave place to one of impatience as his eye fell on stanley hall who still sat with folded arms on the skylight looking as composed and serene as if he had taken up his quarters there for the night  after one or two hasty turns on the deck an idea appeared to hit mr jones for he smiled in a grim fashion and muttered ill try that if the breeze would only come  the breeze appeared to have been waiting for an invitation for one or two catspaws ruffled the surface of the sea as he spoke  mind your helm boy said mr jones suddenly let her away a point so steady  keep her as she goes and harkee he stooped down and whispered when i open the skylight do you call down breeze freshenin sir and has shifted a point to the westard  by the way mr hall said jones turning abruptly to his passenger you take so much interest in navigation that i should like to show you a new chart ive got of the channels on this part of the coast  will you step below  with pleasure replied stanley rising and following jones who immediately spread out on the cabin table one of his most intricate chartswhich as he had expected the young student began to examine with much interestat the same time plying the other with numerous questions  stay said jones ill open the skylightdont you find the cabin close  no sooner was the skylight opened than the small voice of billy towler was heard shouting  breeze freshenin sir and has shifted a pint to the westard  all right replied jonesexcuse me sir ill take a look at the sheets and braces and see that alls fastbe back in a few minutes  he went on deck leaving stanley busy with the chart  youre a smart boy billy  now do as i tell ee and keep your weather eye open  dye see that bit o floating wreck ahead  well keep straight for that and run right against it  ill trust to ee boy that ye dont miss it  billy said that he would be careful but resolved in his heart that he would miss it  jones then went aft to a locker near the stern whence he returned with a mallet and chisel and went below  immediately thereafter billy heard the regular though slight blows of the mallet and pursed his red lips and screwed up his small visage into a complicated sign of intelligence  there was very little wind and the sloop made slow progress towards the piece of wreck although it was very near and billy steered as far from it as he could without absolutely altering the course  presently jones returned on deck and replaced the mallet and chisel in the locker  he was very warm and wiped the perspiration frequently from his forehead  observing that the sloop was not so near the wreck as he had expected he suddenly seized the small steersman by the neck and shook him as a terrier dog shakes a rat  billy said he quickly in a low but stern voice its of no use  i see what you are up to  your steerin clear o that wont prevent this sloop from bein at the bottom in quarter of an hour if not sooner  if you hit it you may save yourself and me a world of trouble  its so much for your own interest boy to hit that bit of wreck that ill trust you again  so saying jones went down into the cabin apologised for having kept stanley waiting so long said that he could not leave the boy at the helm alone for more than a few minutes at a time and that he would have to return on deck immediately after he had made an entry on the log slate  had any one watched morley jones while he was making that entry on the log slate he would have perceived that the strong mans hand trembled excessively that perspiration stood in beads upon his brow and that the entry itself consisted of a number of unmeaning and wavering strokes  meanwhile billy towler left in sole possession of the sloop felt himself in a most unenviable state of mind  he knew that the crisis had arrived and the decisive tone of his tyrants last remark convinced him that it would be expedient for himself to obey orders  on the other hand he remembered that he had deliberately resolved to throw off his allegiance and as he drew near the piece of wreck he reflected that he was at that moment assisting in an act which might cost the lives of all on board  driven to and fro between doubts and fears the poor boy kept changing the course of the sloop in a way that would have soon rendered the hitting of the wreck an impossibility when a sudden and rather sharp puff of wind caused the nora to bend over and the foam to curl on her bow as she slipped swiftly through the water  billy decided at that moment to miss the wreck when he was close upon it and for that purpose deliberately and smartly put the helm hard astarboard  poor fellow his seamanship was not equal to his courage  so badly did he steer that the very act which was meant to carry him past the wreck thrust him right upon it  the shock although a comparatively slight one was sufficiently severe to arouse the sleepers to whom the unwonted sensation and sound carried the idea of sudden disaster  jim and grundy rushed on deck where they found morley jones already on the bulwarks with a boathook shouting for aid while stanley hall assisted him with an oar to push the sloop off what appeared to be the topmast and crosstrees of a vessel with which she was entangled  jim and grundy each seized an oar and exerting their strength they were soon clear of the wreck  well observed jim wiping his brow with the sleeve of his coat its lucky it was but a light topmast and a light breeze it cant have done us any damage worth speaking of  i dont know that said jones  there are often iron bolts and sharp points about such wreckage that dont require much force to drive em through a ships bottom  take a look into the hold jim and see that alls right  jim descended into the hold but immediately returned exclaiming wildly  why the sloops sinkin  lend a hand here if you dont want to go down with her he cried leaping towards the boat  stanley hall and grundy at once lent a hand to get out the boat while the fishmerchant uttering a wild oath jumped into the hold as if to convince himself of the truth of jims statement  he returned quickly exclaiming  she must have started a plank  its rushing in like a sluice  look alive lads out with her  the boat was shoved outside the bulwarks and let go by the run the oars were flung hastily in and all jumped into her as quickly as possible for the deck of the nora was already nearly on a level with the water  they were not a minute too soon  they had not pulled fifty yards from their late home when she gave a sudden lurch to port and went down stern foremost  to say that the party looked aghast at this sudden catastrophe would be to give but a feeble idea of the state of their minds  for some minutes they could do nothing but stare in silence at the few feet of the noras topmast which alone remained above water as a sort of tombstone to mark her ocean grave  when they did at length break silence it was in short interjectional remarks as they resumed the oars  mr jones without making a remark of any kind shipped the rudder the other four pulled  shall we make for land asked jim welton after a time  not wi the tide running like this answered jones well make the gull and get em to take us aboard till morning  at slack tide we can go ashore  in perfect silence they rowed towards the floating light which was not more than a mile distant from the scene of the disaster  as the ebb tide was running strong jim hailed before they were close alongsidegull ahoy heave us a rope will you  there was instant bustle on board the floating light and as the boat came sweeping past a growl of surprise was heard to issue from the mates throat as he shouted look out  a rope came whirling down on their heads which was caught and held on to by jim  all right father he said looking up  all wrong i think replied the sire looking down  why  jim you always turn up like a bad shilling and in bad company too  where ever have you come from this time  from the sea father  dont keep jawin there but help us aboard and youll hear all about it  by this time jones had gained the deck followed by stanley hall and billy  these quickly gave a brief outline of the disaster and were hospitably received on board while jim and grundy made fast the tackles to their boat and had it hoisted inboard  you wont require to pull ashore tomorrow said the elder mr welton as he shook his sons hand  the tender will come off to us in the morning and no doubt the captain will take you all ashore  so much the better observed stanley because it seems to me that our boat is worthy of the rotten sloop to which she belonged and might fail to reach the shore after all  her owner is rather fond of ships and boats that have got the rot said mr welton senior looking with a somewhat stern expression at morley jones who was in the act of stooping to wring the water out of the legs of his trousers  if he is said jones with an equally stern glance at the mate he is the only loserat all events the chief oneby his fondness  youre right retorted mr welton sharply the loss of a kit may be replaced but there are some things which cannot be replaced when lost  however you know your own affairs best  come below friends and have something to eat and drink  after the wrecked party had been hospitably entertained in the cabin with biscuit and tea they returned to the deck and breaking up into small parties walked about or leaned over the bulwarks in earnest conversation  jack shales and jerry macgowl took possession of jim welton and hurrying him forward to the windlass made him there undergo a severe examination and crossquestioning as to how the sloop nora had met with her disaster  these were soon joined by billy towler to whom the gay manner of shales and the rich brogue of macgowl were irresistibly attractive  jim however proved to be much more reticent than his friends deemed either necessary or agreeable  after a prolonged process of pumping to which he submitted with much good humour and an apparent readiness to be pumped quite dry jerry macgowl exclaimed  och it aint of no use trying to git no daiper  sure weve sounded im to the bottom an found nothin at all but mud  ay hes about as incomprehensible as that famous poet youre for ever givin us screeds of  whats is namesomebodys son  tennys son av coorse replied jerry but he aint incomprehensible jack hes only too daip for a man of ornary intellick  his thoughts is so awful profound sometimes that the longest deepsea lead line as ever was spun cant reach the bottom of em  its only such oncommon philosophers as dick moy there or a boardinschool miss for extremes meet you know jack that can rightly make him out  wots that youre sayin about dick moy inquired that worthy who had just joined the group at the windlass  he said you was a philosopher answered shales  youre another growled dick bluntly to macgowl  faix thats true replied jerry theres two philosophers aboord of this here light an the luminous power of our united intellicks is so strong that ive had it in my mind more than wance to suggest that if they wos to hoist you and me to the masthead together the gull would git on firstrate without any lantern at all  not a bad notion that said jack shales  ill mention it to the superintendent tomorrow when the tender comes alongside  praps hell report you to the trinity house as being willin to serve in that way without pay for the sake of economy  no not for economy mate objected dick moy  we cant afford to do dooty as lights without increased pay  just think of the intellektooal force required for to keep the lights agoin night after night  ay and the amount of the doctors bill broke in macgowl for curin the extra cowlds caught at the masthead in thick weather  but we wouldnt go up in thick weather stoopid said moywot ud be the use  aint the gong enough at sich times  och to be sure  didnt i misremember that  what a thing it is to be readywitted now  and since we are makin sich radical changes in the floatinglight system what would ye say boys to advise the boord to use the head of jack shales instead of a gong  it would sound splendiferous for there aint no more in it than an empty cask  the last gong they sint us down was cracked you know so i fancy thats considered the right sort and if so jacks head is cracked enough in all conscience  i suppose jerry said shales if my head was appointed gong youd like that your fist should git the situation of drumstick  stop your chaffin boys and lets catch some birds for tomorrows dinner said one of the men who had been listening to the conversation theres an uncommon lot of em about tonight an it seems to me if the fog increases we shall have more of em  hooo    sich a gittin up stairs and   a playin on the fiddle  sang jack shales as he sprang up the wirerope ladder that led to the lantern round which innumerable small birds were flitting as if desirous of launching themselves bodily into the bright light  what is that fellow about inquired stanley hall of the mate as the two stood conversing near the binnacle  hes catching small birds sir  we often get a number in that way here  but they aint so numerous about the gull as ive seen them in some of the other lightships  you may find it difficult to believe but i do assure you sir that i have caught as many as five hundred birds with my own hand in the course of two hours  indeed what sort of birds  larks and starlings chiefly but there were other kinds amongst em why sir they flew about my head and round the lantern like clouds of snowflakes  i was sittin on the lantern just as shales is sittin now and the birds came so thick that i had to pull my souwester down over my eyes and hold up my hands sometimes before my face to protect myself for they hit me all over  i snapped at em and caught em as fast as i could use my handsgave their heads a screw and crammed em into my pockets  in a short time the pockets were all as full as they could holdcoat vest and trousers  i had to do it so fast that many of em wasnt properly killed and some came alive agin hopped out of my pockets and flew away  at that moment there arose a laugh from the men as they watched their comrade who happened to be performing a feat somewhat similar to that just described by the mate  jack shales had seated himself on the roof of the lantern  this roof being opaque he and the mast which rose above him and its distinctive ball on the top were enveloped in darkness  jack appeared like a man of ebony pictured against the dark sky  his form and motions could therefore be distinctly seen although his features were invisible  he appeared to be engaged in resisting an attack from a host of little birds which seemed to have made up their minds to unite their powers for his destruction the fact being that the poor things fascinated by the brilliant light flew over under and round it with eyes so dazzled that they did not observe the man until almost too late to sheer off and avoid him  indeed many of them failed in this attempt and flew right against his head or into his bosom  these he caught killed and pocketed as fast as possible until his pockets were full when he descended to empty them  hallo  jack mind your eye cried dick moy as his friend set foot on the deck theres one of em agoin off with that crooked sixpence youre so fond of  jack caught a starling which was in the act of wriggling out of his coat pocket and gave it a final twist  hold your hats boys he cried hauling forth the game  talk of a scotch moortheres nothin equal to the top of the gull lantern for real sport  i say jack cried mr welton who with stanley and the others had crowded round the successful sportsman there are some strange birds on the ball  gulls or crows or owls  if you look sharp and get inside you may perhaps catch them by the legs  billy towler heard this remark and looking up saw the two birds referred to one seated on the ball at the masthead the other at that moment sailing round it  now it must be told and the reader will easily believe it that during all this scene billy had looked on not only with intense interest but with a wildness of excitement peculiar to himself while his eyes flashed and his small hands tingled with a desire to have not merely a finger but all his ten fingers in the pie  being only a visitor however and ignorant of everybody and everything connected with a floating light he had modestly held his tongue and kept in the background  but he could no longer withstand the temptation to act  without uttering a word he leaped upon the ropeladder of the lantern and was half way up it before any one observed him determined to forestall jack shales  then there was a shouting of hallo what is that scamp up to  come down you monkey hell break his neck  serve him right  hi come down will ee and similar urgent as well as complimentary expressions to all of which billy turned a deaf ear  another minute and he stood on the roof of the lantern looking up at the ball and grasping the mast which rosea bare poletwelve or fifteen feet above him  och av the spalpeen tries that exclaimed jerry macgowl itll be the ind of im intirely  billy towler did try it  many a london lamppost had he shinned up in his day  the difference did not seem to him very great  the ball he observed was made of light bands or lathes arranged somewhat in the form of latticework  it was full six feet in diameter and had an opening in the under part by which a man could enter it  through the lozengeshaped openings he could see two enormous ravens perched on the top  pausing merely for a second or two to note these facts and recover breath he shinned up the bare pole like a monkey and got inside the ball  the spectators on deck stood in breathless suspense and anxiety unable apparently to move but when they saw billy clamber up the side of the ball like a mouse in a wire cage put forth his hand seize one of the ravens by a leg and drag it through the bars to him a ringing cheer broke forth which was mingled with shouts of uncontrollable laughter  the operation of drawing the illomened bird through the somewhat narrow opening against the feathers had the double effect of ruffling it out to a round and ragged shape very much beyond its ordinary size and of rousing its spirit to ten times its wonted ferocity insomuch that when once fairly inside it attacked its captor with claw beak and wing furiously  it had to do battle however with an infant hercules billy held on tight to its leg and managed to restrain its head and wings with one arm while with the other he embraced the mast and slid down to the lantern but not before the raven freed its head and one of its wings and renewed its violent resistance  on the lantern he paused for a moment to make the captive more secure and then let his legs drop over the edge of the lantern intending to get on the rounds of the ladder but his foot missed the first one  in his effort to regain it he slipped  at that instant the bird freed his head and with a triumphant caw gave billy an awful peck on the nose the result was that the poor boy fell back  he could not restrain a shriek as he did so but he still kept hold of the raven and made a wild grasp with his disengaged hand  fortunately he caught the ladder and remained swinging and making vain efforts to hook his leg round one of the ropes  let go the bird shouted the mate rushing underneath the struggling youth resolved at all hazards to be ready to break his fall if he should let go  howld on yelled jerry macgowl springing up the ladderas jack shales afterwards saidlike a chimpanzee maniac and clutching billy by the neck  ye may let go now ye spalpeen said jerry as he held the upper half of billys shirt vest and jacket in his powerful and capacious grasp ill howld ye safe enough  at that moment the raven managed to free its dishevelled wings the fierce flapping of which it added to its clamorous cries and struggles of indignation  feeling himself safe billy let go his hold and used the freed hand to seize the ravens other leg  then the irishman descended and thus amid the riotous wriggles and screams of the dishevelled bird and the cheers laughter and congratulations of his friends our little hero reached the deck in safety  but this was not the end of their birdcatching on that memorable occasion  it was indeed the grand incident of the nightthe culminating point as it were of the battlebut there was a good deal of light skirmishing afterwards  billys spirit having been fairly roused was not easily allayed  after having had a piece of plaister stuck on the point of his nose which soon swelled up to twice its ordinary dimensions and became bulbous in appearance he would fain have returned to the lantern to prosecute the war with renewed energy this however mr welton senior would by no means permit so the youngster was obliged to content himself with skirmishing on deck in which he was also successful  one starling he found asleep in the fold of a tarpaulin  another he discovered in a snug corner under the lee of one of the mens coats and both were captured easily  then dick moy showed him a plan whereby he caught half a dozen birds in as many minutes  he placed a small handlantern on the deck and spread a white handkerchief in front of it  the birds immediately swarmed round this so vigorously that they even overturned the lantern once or twice  finally settling down on the handkerchief they went to sleep  it was evident that the poor things had not been flying about for mere pleasure  they had been undoubtedly fascinated by the ships glaring light and had kept flying round it until nearly exhausted insomuch that they fell asleep almost immediately after settling down on the handkerchief and were easily laid hold of  during the intervals of this warfare mr george welton related to billy towler and stanley hall numerous anecdotes of his experience in birdcatching on board the floating lights  mr welton had been long in the service and had passed through all the grades having commenced as a seaman and risen to be a lamplighter and a matethe position he then occupied  his office might perhaps be more correctly described as second master because the two were never on board at the same time each relieving the other month about and thus each being in a precisely similar position as to command though not so in regard to pay  there was one occasion said the mate when i had a tough setto with a bird something like what you have had tonight youngster  i was stationed at the time in the newarp lightvessel off the norfolk coast it happened not long after the light had gone up  i observed a very large bird settle on the roof of the lantern so i went cautiously up hopin it would turn out a good one to eat because you must know we dont go catchin these birds for mere pastime  were very glad to get em to eat and i can assure you the larks make excellent pies  well i raised my head slowly above the lantern and pounced on it  instantly its claws went deep into my hands  i seized its neck and tried to choke it but the harder i squeezed the harder it nipped until i was forced to sing out for help  leavin go the neck in order to have one hand free i descended the ladder with the bird hanging to the other hand by its claws  i found i had no occasion to hold tight to it for it held tight to me  before i got down however it had recovered a bit let go and flew away but took refuge soon after in the lanternhouse on deck  here i caught it a second time and once more received the same punishment from its claws  i killed it at last and then found to my disgust that it was a monster sparrowhawk and not fit for food  somethink floatin alongside sir said dick moy running aft at that moment and catching up a boathook with which he made a dart at the object in question and struck but failed to secure it  what is it moy asked mr welton  ony a bit o wreck i think  it looked like a corp at first  soon after this most of the people on board the gull went below and turned in leaving the deck in charge of the regular watch which on that occasion consisted of dick and his friend jack shales  jerry macgowl kept them company for a time being as he observed sintimentally inclined that night  stanley hall attracted by the fineness of the night also remained on deck a short time after the others were gone  do you often see dead bodies floating past he asked of dick moy  not wery often sir but occasionally we does  you see were so nigh the goodwin sands where wrecks take place in the winter months pritty constant that poor fellers are sometimes washed past us but they aint always dead  one night we heard loud cries not far off from us but it was blowin a gale and the night was so dark we could see nothin  we could no more have launched our boat than we could ave gone over the falls o niagary without capsizin  when next the relief comed off we heard that it was three poor fellers gone past on a piece of wreck  were they lost inquired stanley  no sir they warnt all of em lost  a brig saw em at daylight but just as they wos being picked up one wos so exhausted he slipped off the wreck an wos drownded  nother time continued moy as he paced slowly to and fro we seed a corp float past and tried to ook it with the boatook but missed it  it wos on its face and we could see it ad on a belt and sheathknife  there wos a bald spot on the ead and the gulls wos peckin at it so we knowd it wos deadwery likely a long time  theres a tight little craft remarked shales pointing to a vessel which floated at no great distance off  wich dye mean asked dick for there were so many vessels some at anchor and some floating past with the tide like phantom ships that it was not easy to make out which vessel was referred to the one wi the shoulderomutton mainsl  no that schooner with the raking masts an topsail  ah thats a purty little thing from owld ireland returned jerry macgowl  id know her anywhere by the cut of her jib  av she would only spaik shed let ye hear the brogue  since ye know her so well paddy praps you can tell us whats her cargo said jack shales  of coorse i canits fruit an timber replied jerry  fruit and timber exclaimed stanley with a laugh i was not aware that such articles were exported from ireland  ah sure they are yer honour replied jerry  no doubt the english with that low spirit of jealousy thats pecooliar to em would say it was brooms an taties but we calls it fruit and timber  after that jerry i think it is time for me to turn in so i wish you both a goodnight lads  goodnight sir goodnight replied the men as stanley descended to his berth leaving the watch to spin yarns and perambulate the deck until the bright beams of the floating light should be rendered unnecessary by the brighter beams of the rising sun    chapter ten  treats of tender subjects of a peculiar kind and shows how billy towler got into scrapes and out of them  the fact that we know not what a day may bring forth receives frequent and sometimes very striking illustration in the experience of most people  that the day may begin with calm and sunshine yet end in clouds and tempestor vice versais a truism which need not be enforced  nevertheless it is a truism which men are none the worse of being reminded of now and then  poor billy towler was very powerfully reminded of it on the day following his nightadventure with the ravens and his master was taught that the bestlaid plans of men as well as mice are apt to get disordered as the sequel will show  next morning the lookout on board the gull lightship reported the trinity steamtender in sight off the mouth of ramsgate harbour and the ensign was at once hoisted as an intimation that she had been observed  this arrangement by the way of hoisting a signal on board the floating lights when any of the trinity yachts chance to heave in sight is a clever device whereby the vigilance of lightship crews is secured because the time of the appearing of these yachts is irregular and therefore a matter of uncertainty  every one knows the natural and almost irresistible tendency of the human mind to relax in vigilance when the demand on attention is continualthat the act by becoming a mere matter of daily routine loses much of its intensity  the crews of floating lights are more than most men required to be perpetually on the alert because besides the danger that would threaten innumerable ships should their vessels drift from their stations or any part of their management be neglected there is great danger to themselves of being run into during dark stormy nights or foggy days  constant vigilance is partly secured no doubt by a sense of duty in the men it is increased by the feeling of personal risk that would result from carelessness and it is almost perfected by the order for the hoisting of a flag as above referred to  the superintendent of the district of which ramsgate is headquarters goes out regularly once every month in the tender to effect what is styled the reliefthat is to change the men each of whom passes two months aboard and one month on shore while the masters and mates alternately have a month on shore and a month on board  at the same time he puts on board of the four vessels of which he has charge namely the goodwin the gull the southsandhead and the varne lightshipswater coal provisions and oil for the month and such stores as may be required returning with the men relieved and the empty casks and cans etcetera to ramsgate harbour  besides this the tender is constantly obliged to go out at irregular intervalsit may be even several times in a weekfor the purpose of replacing buoys that have been shifted by stormsmarking with small green buoys the spot where a vessel may have gone down and become a dangerous obstruction in the fair waytaking up old chains and sinkers and placing new ones painting the buoysand visiting the north and south foreland lighthouses which are also under the district superintendents care  on all of these occasions the men on duty in the floating lights are bound to hoist their flag whenever the tender chances to pass them within sight on pain of a severe reprimand if the duty be neglected and something worse if such neglect be of frequent occurrence  in addition to this some of the elder brethren of the trinity house make periodical visits of inspection to all the floating lights round the coasts of england and this they do purposely at irregular times in order if possible to catch the guardians of the coast napping and woe betide the watch on duty if these inspecting brethren should manage to get pretty close to any lightship without having received the salute of recognition  hence the men of the floating lights are kept ever on the alert and the safety of the navigation as far as human wisdom can do it is secured  hence also at whatever time any of our floating lights should chance to be visited by strangers they like our lighthouses will invariably be found in perfect working order and as clean as new pins except of course during periods of general cleaning up or painting  begging pardon for this digression we return to billy towler whose delight with the novelty of his recent experiences was only equalled by his joyous anticipations of the stirring sealife that yet lay before him  the satisfaction of mr jones however at the success of his late venture was somewhat damped by the information that he would have to spend the whole day on board the tender  the district superintendent whose arduous and multifarious duties required him to be so often afloat that he seemed to be more at home in the tender than in his own house ashore was a man whose agreeable manners and kind hearty yet firm disposition had made him a favourite with every one in the service immediately on his boarding the gull he informed the uninvited and unfortunate guests of that floating light that he would be very glad to take them ashore but that he could not do so until evening as besides effecting the relief he meant to take advantage of the calm weather to give a fresh coat of paint to one or two buoys and renew their chains and sinkers and expressed a hope that the delay would not put them to much inconvenience  stanley hall between whom and the superintendent there sprang up an intimate and sympathetic friendship almost at first sight assured him that so far from putting him to inconvenience it would afford him the greatest pleasure to spend the day on board  billy towler heard this arrangement come to with an amount of satisfaction which was by no means shared by his employer who was anxious to report the loss of the nora without delay and to claim the insurance money as soon as possible  he judged it expedient however to keep his thoughts and anxieties to himself and only vented his feelings in a few deep growls which breaking on the ears of billy towler filled the heart of that youthful sinner with additional joy  wot a savage he is said dick moy looking at jones and addressing himself to billy  ah aint he just replied the urchin  has he not bin good to ee asked the big seaman looking down with a kindly expression at the small boy  middlin was billys cautious reply  i say neptune he added looking up into dicks face wots yer name  it aint neptune anyhow replied dick  thats wot weve called the big black noofoundland dog you sees over there ajumping about jim welton as if he had falled in love with him  why is it so fond of him asked billy  dick replied to this question by relating the incident of the dogs rescue by jim  werry interestin  well but wot is your name said billy returning to the point  dick  of course i know that ive heerd em all call ye that often enough but i spose youve got another  moy said the big seaman  moy eh cried billy with a grin that is a funny name but there aint enough of it for my taste  the conversation was interrupted at this point by the superintendent who having been for many years in command of an east indiaman was styled captain  he ordered the mate and men whose turn it was to be relieved to get into the tender along with the strangers  soon afterwards the vessel steamed away over the glassy water and billy who had taken a fancy to the big lamplighter went up to him and said  well dick moy where are we agoin to just now  dick pointed to a black speck on the water a considerable distance ahead of them  were agoin to that there buoy to lift it and put down a noo un  oh thats a boy is it and are them there boys too asked billy looking round at the curious oval and conical casklike things of gigantic proportions which lumbered the deck and filled the hold of the tender  ay theyre all buoys  none of em girls inquired the urchin gravely  no none of em replied dick with equal gravity for to him the joke was a very stale one  no thats stoopid now id ave ad some of em girls for varietys sakewots the use of em asked the imp who pretended ignorance in order to draw out his burly companion  to mark the channels replied dick  we puts a red buoy on one side and a checkered buoy on tother and if the vessels keeps atween em they goes all rightif not they goes ashore  hm thats just where it is now said billy  if i had had the markin o them there channels id ave put boys on one side an girls on tother all the way up to londonmade a sort o country dance of it an all the ships would ave gone up the middle an down agin dye see  port port a little said the captain at that moment  port it is sir answered mr welton senior who stood at the wheel  the tender was now bearing down on one of the numerous buoys which mark off the channels around the goodwin sands and it required careful steering in order to avoid missing it on the one hand or running into it on the other  a number of men stood on the bow of the vessel with ropes and boathooks in readiness to catch and make fast to it  these men with the exception of two or three who formed the permanent crew of the tender were either going off to relieve their comrades and take their turn on board the floating lights or were on their way to land having been relievedsuch as george welton the mate dick moy and jerry macgowl  among them were several masters and mates belonging to the lightvessels of that districtsedate grave cheerful and trustworthy men all of themwho had spent the greater part of their lives in the service and were by that time middleaged or elderly but still with few exceptions as strong and hardy as young men  jerry being an unusually active and powerful fellow took a prominent part in all the duties that devolved on the men at that time  that these duties were not light might have been evident to the most superficial observer for the buoys and their respective chains and sinkers were of the most ponderous and unwieldy description  referring to this stanley hall said as he stood watching the progress of the work why captain up to this day i have been in the habit of regarding buoys as trifling affairs not much bigger or more valuable than huge barrels or washingtubs but now that i see them close at hand and hear all you tell me about them my respect increases wonderfully  it will be increased still more perhaps replied the captain when i tell you the cost of some of them  now then macgowl look outare you ready  all ready sir  port a littlesteady  steady replied mr welton  arrah howld onoch stiddyheavehooray cried the anxious irishman as he made a plunge at the buoy which was floating alongside like a huge iron balloon bumping its big forehead gently yet heavily against the side of the tender and in that simple way conveying to the mind of stanley an idea of the great difficulty that must attend the shifting of buoys in rough weather  the buoy having been secured an iron hook and chain of great strength were then attached to the ring in its head  the chain communicated with a powerful crane rigged up on the foremast and was wrought by a steam windlass on deck  you see we require stronger tackle said the captain to stanley while the buoy was being slowly raised  that buoy weighs fully threequarters of a ton and cost not less along with its chain and sinker than 150 pounds yet it is not one of our largest  we have what we call monster buoys weighing considerably more than a ton which cost about 300 pounds apiece including a 60fathom chain and a 30hundredweight sinker  those mediumsized ones made of wood and hooped like casks cost from 80 pounds to 100 pounds apiece without appendages  even that small green fellow lying there with which i intend to mark the nora if necessary is worth 25 pounds and as there are many hundreds of such buoys all round the kingdom you can easily believe that the guarding of our shores is somewhat costly  indeed it must be answered stanley and if such insignificantlooking things cost so much what must be the expense of maintaining floating lights and lighthouses  i can give you some idea of that too said the captain  look out exclaimed the men at that moment  och be aisy cried jerry ducking as he spoke and thus escaping a blow from the buoy which would have cracked his head against the vessels side like a walnut  heave away lad  the man at the windlass obeyed  the irresistible steamwinch caused the huge chain to grind and jerk in its iron pulley and the enormous globular iron buoy came quietly over the side black here and brown there and redrusted elsewhere its green beard of seaweed dripping with brine and its sides grizzled with a sixmonths growth of barnacles and other shellfish  it must not be supposed that although the engine did all the heavy lifting the men had merely to stand by and look on  in the mere processes of capturing the buoy and making fast the chains and hooks and fending off etcetera there was an amount of physical effort straining and energisingon the part of the men that could scarcely be believed unless seen  do not fancy good reader that we are attempting to make much of a trifle in this description  our object is rather to show that what might very naturally be supposed to be trifling and easy work is in truth very much the reverse  the buoy having been lifted another of the same size and shape but freshly painted was attached to the chain tumbled over the side and left in its place  in this case the chain and sinker did not require renewing but at the next one visited it was found that buoy chain and sinker had to be lifted and renewed  and here again to a landsman like stanley there was much to interest and surprise  if a man ignorant of such matters were asked what he would do in the event of his having to go and shift one of those buoys he might probably reply well i suppose i would first get hold of the buoy and hoist it on board and then throw over another in its place but it is not probable that he would reflect that this process involved the violent upturning of a mass of wood or metal so heavy that all the strength of the dozen men who had to struggle with it was scarce sufficient to move gently even in the water that being upturned an inch chain had to be unshackleda process rendered troublesome owing to the ponderosity of the links which had to be dealt with and the constrained position of the man who wroughtand that the chain and sinker had to be hauled out of the sand or mud into which they had sunk so much that the donkeyengine had to strain until the massive chains seemed about to give way and the men stood in peril of having their heads suddenly cut open  not to be too prolix on this subject it may be said shortly that when the chain and sinker of the next buoy were being hauled in a threeinch rope snapped and grazed the finger of a man fortunately taking no more than a little of the skin off though it probably had force enough to have taken his hand off if it had struck him differently  again they tried but the sinker had got so far down into the mud that it would not let go  the engine went at last very slowly for it was applying almost the greatest strain that the chains could bear and the bow of the tender was hauled considerably down into the sea  the men drew back a little but after a few moments of suspense the motion of the vessel gradually loosened the sinker and eased the strain  there she goes handsomely cried the men as the engine again resumed work at reasonable speed  we sometimes lose chains and sinkers altogether in that way remarked dick moy to billy who stood looking on with heightened colour and glowing eyes and wishing with all the fervour of his small heart that the whole affair would give way in order that he might enjoy the tremendous crash which he thought would be sure to follow  would it be a great loss he asked  it would a wery great un said dick that there chain an sinker is worth nigh fifty or sixty pound  while this work was being done the captain was busy with his telescope taking the exact bearings of the buoy to ascertain whether or not it had shifted its position during the six months conflict with tide and tempest that it had undergone since last being overhauled  certain buildings on shore coming into line with other prominent buildings such as steeples chimneys and windmills were his infallible guides and these declared that the buoy had not shifted more than a few feet  he therefore gave the order to have the fresh buoy with its chain and sinker ready to let go  the buoy in questiona medium one about eight feet high five feet in diameter and conical in shapestood at the edge of the vessel like an extinguisher for the biggest candle that ever was conceived in the wildest brain at rome  its sinker a square mass of castiron nearly a ton in weight lay beside it and its twoinch chain every link whereof was eight or ten inches long and made of the toughest malleable iron was coiled carefully on the mainhatch so that nothing should impede its running out  all ready cried the captain taking a final glance through the telescope  all ready sir replied the men several of whom stood beside the buoy prepared to lay violent hands on it while two stood with iron levers under the sinker ready to heave  stand here billy an youll see it better said dick moy with a sly look for dick had by this time learned to appreciate the mischievous spirit of the urchin  let go cried the captain  let go echoed the men  the levers were raised the thrust was given  away went the sinker overboard went the buoy out went the chain with a clanging roar and a furious rush and up sprang a column of white spray part of which fell inboard and drenched billy towler to the skin  as well might dick moy have attempted to punish a pig by throwing it into the mud as to distress billy by sousing him with water  it was to him all but a native element  in fact he said that he believed himself to be a hamphiberous hanimal by nature and was of the opinion that he should have been born a merman  hooray showerbaths free gratis for nothink he yelled as soon as he had recaught his breath  any more o that sort comin he cried as he pulled off his shirt and wrung it  plenty more wery like it said dick chuckling and to be had wery much on the same terms  ah if youd only jine meit would make it so much more pleasant retorted the boy but it would take a deal more water to kiver yer huge carcase  that boy will either make a firstrate man or an outandout villain observed the captain to stanley as they stood listening to his chaffing remarks  hell require a deal of taming said jim welton who was standing by but hes a smart welldisposed little fellow as far as i know him  morley jones who was seated on the starboard bulwarks not far off confided his opinion to no one but he was observed to indulge in a sardonic grin and to heave his shoulders as if he were agitated with suppressed laughter when this last remark was made  the steamer meanwhile had been making towards another of the floating lights alongside of which some time was spent in transferring the full watercasks receiving the empties etcetera and in changing the men the same process was gone through with the other vessels and then in the afternoon they returned towards ramsgate harbour  on the way they stopped at one of the large buoys which required to be painted  the weather being suitable for that purpose a boat was lowered black and white paintpots and brushes were put into her and jack shales dick moy and jerry macgowl were told off to perform the duty  stanley hall also went for pastime and billy towler slid into the boat like an eel without leave just as it pushed off  get out ye small varmint shouted jerry but the boy did not obey the boat was already a few feet off from the vessel and as the captain either did not see or did not care billy was allowed to go  youll only be in the way an git tired of yer life before were half done said dick moy  never mind he shall keep me company said stanley laughing  we will sit in judgment on the work as it proceedswont we billy  well sir replied the boy with intense gravity that depends on whether yer finehart edication has bin sufficiently attended to but ive no objection to give you the benefit o my adwice if you gits into difficulties  a loud laugh greeted this remark and billy smiling with condescension said he was gratified by their approval  a few minutes sufficed to bring them alongside the buoy which was one of the largest size shaped like a cone and painted in alternate stripes of white and black  it rose high above the heads of the men when they stood up beside it in the boat  it was made of timber had a wooden ring round it near the water and bore evidence of having received many a rude buffet from ships passing in the dark  a nice little buoy this said billy looking at it with the eye and air of a connoisseur wots its name  the north goodwin cant ee read dont ee see its name up there on its side in letters as long as yerself said jack shales as he stirred up the paint in one of the pots  ah to be sure well it might have bin named the uncommon goodwin said billy for it seems to have seen rough service and to have stood it well  come boys look alive mix yer colours an go to work england expecks every man you know for to do his dooty  wot a bag of impudence it is said dick moy catching the ringbolt on the top of the buoy with the boathook and holding the boat as close to it as possible while his mates dipped their brushes in the black and white paint respectively and began to work with the energy of men who know that their opportunity may be cut short at any moment by a sudden squall or increasing swell  indeed calm though the water was there was enough of undulation to render the process of painting one of some difficulty for besides the impossibility of keeping the boat steady dick moy found that all his strength could not avail to prevent the artists being drawn suddenly away beyond reach of their object and as suddenly thrown against it so that their hands and faces came frequently into contact with the wet paint and gave them a piebald appearance  for some time billy contented himself with looking on and chaffing the men diversifying the amusement by an occasional skirmish with stanley who had armed himself with a brush and was busy helping  its raither heavy work sir to do all the judgment business by myself he said  theres that feller shales as dont know how a straight line should be drawd  couldnt ye lend me your brush jack or praps dick moy will lend me his beard as he dont seem to be usin it just now  here dick cried stanley giving up his brush youve had enough of the holdingon business come ill relieve you  ay thats your sort said billy muscle to the boatook an brains to the brush  hold on tight sir cried shales as the boat gave a heavy lurch away from the buoy while the three painters stood leaning as far over the gunwale as was consistent with safety and stretching their arms and brushes towards the object of their solicitude  stanley exerted himself powerfully a reactionary swell helped him too much and next moment the three men went heads hands and brushes plunging against the buoy  och morther cried jerry one of whose black hands had been forced against a white stripe and left its imprint there  look at that now  all right cried shales dashing a streak of white over the spot  theres no preventing it said stanley apologetically yet laughing in spite of himself  i say jack this is igh art this is observed moy as he drew back to take another dip but im free to confess that id raither go courtin the girls than painting the buoys  oh  dick you borrowed that from me cried billy for shame sir  well well observed jerry its many a time ive held on to a painter but i niver thought to become wan  what would ye call this nowa landscape or a portrait  i would call it a marine piece said stanley  how much sir asked dick moy who had got upon the wooden ring of the buoy and was standing thereon attempting but not very successfully to paint in that position  a mareenypiece you noodle cried billy dont ye onderstand the genelmn wots a sittin on judgment on ee  a mareenypiece is a piece o mareeny or striped kaliko wich is all the same and wery poor stuff it is too  come ill stand it no longer  i hold ye in sich contempt that i must look down on ee  so saying the active little fellow seized the boathook and swung himself lightly on the buoy the top of which he gained after a severe scramble amid the indignant shouts of the men  well since you have gone up there well keep you there till we are done  all right my hearties retorted billy in great delight and excitement as the men went on with their work  just then another heave of the swell drew the boat away obliging the painters to lean far over the side as before pointing towards their pictur as jerry called it but unable to touch it though expecting every moment to swing within reach again  suddenly billy towlerwhile engaged no doubt in some refined piece of mischiefslipped and fell backwards with a loud cry  his head struck the side of the boat in passing as he plunged into the sea  ah the poor craitur cried jerry macgowl immediately plunging after him  now it happened that jerry could not swim a stroke but his liking for the boy and the suddenness of the accident combined with his reckless disposition rendered him either forgetful of or oblivious to that fact instead of doing any good therefore to billy he rendered it necessary for the men to give their undivided attention to hauling his unwieldy carcase into the boat  the tide was running strong at the time  billy rose to the surface but showed no sign of life  he was sinking again when stanley hall plunged into the water like an arrow and caught him by the hair  stanley was a powerful swimmer but he could make no headway against the tide that was running to the southward at the time and before the men had succeeded in dragging their enthusiastic but reckless comrade into the boat billy and his friend had been swept to a considerable distance  as soon as the oars were shipped however they were quickly overtaken and rescued  stanley was none the worse for his ducking but poor billy was unconscious and had a large cut in his head which looked serious when he was taken on board the tender and restored to consciousness he was incapable of talking coherently  in this state he was taken back to ramsgate and conveyed to the hospital  there in a small bed the small boy lay for many weeks with ample leisure to reflect upon the impropriety of coupling funwhich is rightwith mischiefwhich is emphatically wrong and generally leads to disaster  but billy could not reflect because he had received a slight injury to the brain it was supposed which confused him much and induced him as his attentive nurse said to talk nothing but nonsense  the poor boys recentlymade friends paid him all the attention they could but most of them had duties to attend to which called them away so that ere long with the exception of an occasional visit from mr welton of the gull light he was left entirely to the care of the nurses and housesurgeons who were extremely kind to him  mr morley jones who might have been expected to take an interest in his protege left him to his fate after having ascertained that he was in a somewhat critical condition and in any case not likely to be abroad again for many weeks  there was one person however who found out and took an apparently deep interest in the boy  this was a stout hale gentleman of middle age with a bald head a stern countenance and keen grey eyes  he came to the hospital apparently as a philanthropic visitor inquired for the boy introduced himself as mr larks and sitting down at his bedside sought to ingratiate himself with the patient  at first he found the boy in a condition which induced him to indulge chiefly in talking nonsense but mr larks appeared to be peculiarly interested in this nonsense especially when it had reference as it frequently had to a man named jones  after a time when billy became sane again mr larks pressed him to converse more freely about this mr jones but with returning health came billys sharp wit and caution  he began to be more circumspect in his replies to mr larks and to put questions in his turn which soon induced that gentleman to discontinue his visits so that billy towler again found himself in what might with propriety have been styled his normal conditionabsolutely destitute of friends  but billy was not so destitute as he supposed himself to beas we shall see  meanwhile morley jones went about his special business  he reported the loss of the sloop nora had it advertised in the gazette took the necessary steps to prove the fact called at the office of the submarine insurance company and at the end of three weeks walked away chuckling with 300 pounds in his pocket  in the satisfaction which the success of this piece of business induced he opened his heart and mind pretty freely to his daughter nora and revealed not only the fact of billy towlers illness but the place where he then lay  until the money had been secured he had kept this a secret from her and had sent jim welton on special business to gravesend in order that he might be out of the way for a time but the motive being past he made no more secret of the matter  nora who had become deeply interested in the boy resolved to have him brought up from ramsgate to yarmouth by means of love not being possessed of money  the moment therefore that jim welton returned she issued her commands that he should go straight off to ramsgate find the boy and by hook or crook bring him to the garden of eden on pain of her utmost displeasure  but the thing ant possible said jim i havent got money enough to do it  then you must find money somehow or make it said nora firmly that dear boy must be saved  when he was stopping here i wormed all his secrets out of his little heart bless it  i dont wonder interrupted jim with a look of admiration  and what do you think continued the girl not noticing the interruption he confessed to me that he had been a regular london thief  now i am quite sure that god will enable me to win him back if i get him herefor i know that he is fond of meand i am equally sure that he will be lost if he is again cast loose on the world  god bless you nora ill do my best to fetch him to ee even if i should have to walk to ramsgate and carry him here on my shoulders but dont you think it would be as well also to keep himforgive me dear nora i must say itto keep him out of your fathers way  he might teach him to drink you know if he taught him no worse and thats bad enough  noras face grew pale as she said  oh jim are you sure there is nothing worse that he is likely to teach him  my father has a great deal of money just now ii hope that  why nora you need not think he stole it said jim hurriedly and with a somewhat confused look he got it in the regular way from the insurance company and i couldnt say that theres anything absolutely wrong in the business but  the young sailor stopped short and sighed deeply  noras countenance became still more pale and she cast down her eyes but spoke not a word for some moments  you must bring the boy to me jim she resumed with a sudden start he may be in danger here but there is almost certain ruin before him if he is left to fall back into his old way of life  we need not trouble the reader with a detailed account of the means by which jim welton accomplished his object  love prevailedas it always did always does and always willand ere many days had passed billy towler was once more a member of the drunkards family with the sweet presence of nora ever near him like an angels wing overshadowing and protecting him from evil    chapter eleven  the ancient corporation of trinity house of deptford strond  as landmarksbecause of their affording variety among other reasons are pleasant objects of contemplation to the weary traveller on a long and dusty road so landmarks in a tale are useful as restingplaces  we purpose therefore to relieve the reader for a very brief period from the strain of mingled fact and fiction in which we have hitherto indulgedturn into a siding as it wereand before getting on the main line again devote a short chapter to pure and unmitigated fact  so much has been said in previous chapters and so much has yet to be said about the lights and buoys and beacons which guard the shores of old england that it would be unpardonable as well as ungracious were we to omit making special reference to the ancient corporation of trinity house of deptford strond under the able management of which the whole of the important work has been devised and carried into operation and is now most efficiently maintained  it cannot be too urgently pressed upon unnauticalespecially young readers that the work which this corporation does and the duties which it performs constitute what we may term vital service  it would be too much perhaps to say that the life of the nation depends on the faithful and wise conduct of that service but assuredly our national prosperity is intimately bound up with it  the annual list of ships wrecked and lives lost on the shores of the kingdom is appalling enough already as every observant reader of the newspapers must know but if the work of the trinity housethe labours of the elder brethrenwere suspended for a single yearif the lights fixed and floating were extinguished and the buoys and beacons removed the writer could not express nor could the reader conceive the awful crash of ruin and the terrific cry of anguish that would sweep over the land from end to end like the besom of destruction  we leave to hardheaded politicians to say what or whether improvements of any kind might be made in connection with the trinity corporation  we do not pretend to be competent to judge whether or not that work might be better done  all that we pretend to is a certain amount of competency to judge and right to assert that it is well done and one of the easiest ways to assure onesself of that fact is to go visit the lighthouses and lightvessels on the coast and note their perfect management the splendid adaptation of scientific discoveries to the ends they are designed to serve the thoroughness the cleanliness the beauty of everything connected with the materiel employed the massive solidity and apparent indestructibility of the various structures erected and afloat the method everywhere observable the perfect organisation and the steady respectability of the lightkeepersobserve and note all these things we say and it will be impossible to return from the investigation without a feeling that the management of this department of our coast service is in preeminently able hands  nor is this to be wondered at when we reflect that the corporation of trinity house is composed chiefly the acting part of it entirely of nautical menmen who have spent their youth and manhood on the sea and have had constantly to watch and guard against those very rocks and shoals and traverse those channels which it is now their duty to light and buoy  see note 1  it has been sagely remarked by some philosopher we believeat least it might have been if it has notthat everything must have a beginning we agree with the proposition and therefore conclude that the corporation of trinity house must have had a beginning but that beginning would appear to be involved in those celebrated mists of antiquity which unhappily obscure so much that men would give their ears to know nowadays  firewhich has probably been the cause of more destruction and confusion than all of the other elements put togetherwas the cause of the difficulty that now exists in tracing this ancient corporation to its origin as will be seen from the following quotation from a little memoir drawn up the present deputymaster and printed for private distribution which was kindly lent to us by the present secretary of the house and from which most of our information has been derived  the printed information hitherto extant in regard to the corporation of trinity house is limited to the charter of confirmation granted by james the second with the minor concession by charles the second of thames ballastage and a compilation from the records of the corporation down to 1746 by its then secretary mr whormby supplemented by a memoir drawn up in 1822 by captain joseph cotton then deputymaster but the data of these latter are necessarily imperfect as the destruction by fire in 1714 of the house in water lane had already involved a disastrous loss of documentary evidence leaving much to be inferentially traced from collateral records of admiralty and navy boards  these however sufficiently attest administrative powers and protective influence scarcely inferior to the scope of those departments  more than a hundred years before the date of its original charter 1514 the corporation existed in the form of a voluntary association of the shipmen and mariners of england to which reference is made in the charter as being an influential body of long standing even at that time which protected maritime interests and relieved the aged and indigent among the seafaring community for which latter purpose they had erected an almshouse at deptford in kent where also were their headquarters this society had inspired confidence and acquired authority to establish regulations for the navigation of ships and the government of seamen which by general consent had been adopted throughout the service  it was therefore of tested and approved capacity which at length resulted in the granting to it of a charter by henry viii in 1514  from this date the history proper of the corporation of trinity house of deptford strond begins  in the charter referred to it is first so named and is described as the guild or fraternity of the most glorious and undividable trinity of saint clement  the subsequent charter of james i and all later charters are granted to the master wardens and assistants of the guild fraternity or brotherhood of the most glorious and undivided trinity and of saint clement in the parish of deptford in the county of kent  the grant of arms to the corporation is dated 1573 and includes the motto trinitas in unitate  no reason can now be assigned for the application of its distinctive title  the mere fact that the constitution of the guild included provision for the maintenance of a chaplain and for the conduct of divine service in the parish church is not we think sufficient to account for it  in the house or hall at deptford adjoining the almshouses the business of the corporation was first conducted  afterwards for the sake of convenient intercourse with shipowners and others in a house in ratcliffe next at stepney and then in water lane tower street  the tenement there falling into decayafter having been twice burnt and restoredwas forsaken and an estate was purchased on tower hill on which the present trinity house was built from designs by wyatt in 1798  a good idea of the relative antiquity of the corporation may be gathered from the fact that about the year 1520six years after the date of the first charterthe formation of the admiralty and navy boards was begun and on the consequent establishment of dockyards and arsenals the deptford buildingyard was confided to the direction of the trinity house together with the superintendence of all navy stores and provisions  so closely indeed were the services related that the first master of the corporation under the charter was sir thomas spert commander of the henry graceadieu our first manofwar and sometime controller of the navy  the corporation thus became as it were the civil branch of the english maritime service with a naval element which it preserves to this day  government records show that the trinity brethren exercised considerable powers at an early period in manning and outfitting the navy that they reported on ships to be purchased regulated the dimensions of those to be built and determined the proper complement of sailors for each as well as the armament and stores  besides performing its peaceful duties the corporation was bound to render service at sea if required but in consideration of such liability the brethren and their subordinates were exempted from land service of every kind  they have been frequently called upon to render service afloat and notably upon two occasionsduring the mutiny at the nore in 1797 when the elder brethren almost in view of the mutinous fleet removed or destroyed every beacon and buoy that could guide its passage out to sea and again in 1803 when a french invasion was imminent they undertook and carried out the defences of the entrance to the thames by manning and personally officering a cordon of fullyarmed ships moored across the river below gravesend with an adequate force of trustworthy seamen for destruction if necessary of all channel marks that might guide an approaching enemy  we cannot afford space to enter fully into the history of the trinity corporation  suffice it to say that it has naturally been the object of a good deal of jealousy and has undergone many searching investigations from all of which it has emerged triumphantly  its usefulness having steadily advanced with all its opportunities for extension it received in 1836 the culminating recognition of an act of parliament empowering its executive to purchase of the crown and to redeem from private proprietors their interests in all the coastlights of england thus bringing all within its own control  by crown patents granted from time to time the corporation was enabled to raise through levy of tolls the funds necessary for erection and maintenance of these national blessings  and all surplus of revenue over expenditure was applied to the relief of indigent and aged mariners their wives widows and orphans  about 1853 the allowance to outpensioners alone amounted to upwards of 30000 pounds per annum and nearly half as much more of income derived from property held in trust for charitable purposes was applied to the maintenance of the almshouses at deptford and mileend and to other charitable uses for the benefit of the maritime community  the court or governing body of the corporation is now composed of thirtyone members namely the master four wardens eight assistants and eighteen elder brethren  the latter are elected out of those of the class of younger brethren who volunteer and are approved as candidates for the office  eleven members of this court of thirtyone are men of distinctionmembers of the royal family ministers of state naval officers of high rank and the like  the remaindercalled acting brethrenare chiefly officers of the mercantile marine with a very fewusually threeofficers of her majestys navy  the younger brethrenwhose number is unlimitedare admissible at the pleasure of the court  they have no share in the management but are entitled to vote in the election of master and wardens  the duties of the corporation as described in their charters generally were to treat and conclude upon all and singular articles anywise concerning the science or art of mariners  a pretty wide and somewhat indefinite range  at the present time these duties are as follows  to maintain in perfect working order all the lighthouses floating lights and fogsignal stations on the coasts of england and to lay down maintain renew and modify all the buoys beacons and seasignals to regulate the supply of stores the appointment of keepers and constantly to inspect the stationsa service which entails unremitting attention upon the members some of whom are always on duty either afloat in the steamvessels or on land journeys  to examine and license pilots for a large portion of our coasts and to investigate generally into all matters relative to pilotage  to act as nautical advisers with the judge of the high court of admiralty a duty which frequently engages some of the brethren for considerable periods of time on intricate causes of the greatest importance  to survey and inspect the channels of the thames and the shoals of the north sea and other points of the coast at which shifting scouring growth or waste of sand may affect the navigation and require to be watched and notified  to supply shipping in the thames with ballast  the elder brethren have also to perform the duty of attending the sovereign on seavoyages  in addition to all this it has to superintend the distribution of its extensive charities founded on various munificent gifts and legacies nearly all given or left for the benefit of poor jack and his relatives and to manage the almshouses also the affairs of the house on tower hill and the engineering department with its superintendence of new works plans drawings lanterns optical apparatus etcetera the whole involving as will be obvious to men who are acquainted with business a mass of detail which must be almost as varied as it is enormous  the good influence of the operations of the trinity louse might be shown by many interesting instances  here is one specimen it has reference to ballastheaving  formerly the ballast when laid in barge or lighter alongside the ship to be supplied was heaved on board by men who were hired and paid by various waterside contractors and subjected to great hardships not only from the greed of their employers but from a demoralising system of payment through publicans and local harpies  these evils were altogether removed by the establishment of a heavers office under control of the trinity house where men could attend for employment and where their wages could be paid with regularity and free from extortionate deduction  many more examples might be given but were we to indulge in this strain our chapter would far exceed its proper limits  the lightvessels belonging to the corporation are 43 in number 38 in position and 5 in reserve to meet casualties  see note 2 of lighthouses there are 76 sixtyone of which built of brick stone or timber are on shore eleven of granite are on outlying rocks and four on iron piles are on sandbanks  there are 452 buoys of all shapes and sizes on the coast and half as many more in reserve besides about 60 beacons of various kinds and 21 storehouses in connection with them  also 6 steamvessels and 7 sailing tenders maintained for effecting the periodical relief of crews and keepers shifting and laying buoys etcetera  the working staff which keeps the whole complex machinery in order consists of 7 district

confident that no apology will be required    note 1  the service which the corporation of trinity house renders to the coasts of england is rendered to those of scotland by the commissioners of northern lights and to those of ireland by the commissioners of irish lightsboth to some extent under the supervision of the trinity house    the floating lights of england are illuminated by means of lamps with metallic reflectors on what is styled the catoptric system  the dioptric system in which the rays of light are transmitted through glass has been introduced into the floating lights of india by the messrs stevenson ce of edinburgh  the first floating light on this system in india was shown on the hoogly in 1865  since then several more dioptric lights have been sent to the same region and also to japan in 1869 and all reports agree in describing these lights as being eminently successful    chapter twelve  strange sights and scenes on land and sea  the river hoogly  off calcutta  tropical vegetation on the shore glittering sunshine on the water  blue sky and fleecy clouds overhead equally blue sky and fleecy clouds down below  a world of sky and water with ships and boats resting on their own inverted images in the midst  sweltering heat everywhere  black men revelling in the sunshine  white men melting in the shade  the general impression such that one might almost entertain the belief that the world has become whitehot and the end of time is about to be ushered in with a general conflagration  such is the scene reader to which we purpose to convey you  the day was yet young when a large vessel shook out her topsails and made other nautical demonstrations of an intention to quit the solid land ere long and escape if possible from the threatened conflagration  i wonder when those brutes will be sent off said the first mate of the ship to the surgeon who stood on the poop beside him  what brutes do you refer to asked the surgeon who was no other than our young friend stanley hall  why the wild beasts to be sure  have you not heard that we are to have as passengers on the voyage home two leopards an elephant and a rhinoceros  pleasant company  i wonder what neptune will say to that said stanley with a laugh as he walked forward to ask the opinion of the owner of the said neptune  i say welton we are to have an elephant a rhinoceros and two leopards on this voyage  indeed  yes what will neptune say to it  oh he wont mind sir replied jim patting the head of the large newfoundland dog with grey paws which stood beside him  jim and stanley had taken a fancy to each other when on board the nora the former had carried out a plan of going to sea in order to be out of the way if he should happen to be wanted as a witness at the trial of morley jones which event he felt certain must take place soon  he had made application to stanley who spoke to mr durant about himthe result being that jim obtained a berth on board the ship wellington which stood a1 at lloyds  hence we find him in the hoogly  neptune is a wise dog sir continued jim he dont feel much put out by curious company and is firstrate at taking care of himself besides there is no jealousy in his nature  i suppose he feels that nobody can cut him out when he has once fairly established a friendship i dont grudge the dive off the bulwarks of the old gull when i saved neptune i assure you  he was worth saving remarked stanley stooping to pat the meek head of the dog  yes i heard last night of the expected passengers pursued jim and am now rigging up tackle to hoist em on board  i meant to have told you of em last night but we got into that stiff argument about teetotalism which put it completely out of my head  ah welton youll never convince me that teetotalism is right said stanley with a goodhumoured laugh  not that i care much about wine or spirits myself but as long as a man uses them in moderation they can do him no harm  so i thought once sir returned jim but i have seen cause to change my mind  a healthy man cant use them in moderation because use is abuse  stimulants are only fit for weaklings and sick folk  as well might a stout man use crutches to help him to walk as beer or brandy to help him to work yet there are some strong young men so helpless that they cant get on at all without their beer or grog  come ill join issue with you on that point said stanley eagerly for he was very fond of an argument with jim who never lost his temper and who always paid his opponent the compliment of listening attentively to what he had to say  not just now replied jim pointing towards the shore for yonder comes a boat with some of the passengers we were talking of  is that tackle rigged welton shouted the mate  it is sir replied jim  then stand by some of you to hoist these leopards aboard  when the little boat or dinghy came alongside it was observed that the animals were confined in a large wooden cage through the bars of which they glared savagely at the halfdozen black fellows who conveyed them away from their native land  they seemed to be uncommonly irate perhaps the injustice done them in thus removing them against their will had something to do with it  possibly the motion of the boat had deranged their systems  whatever the cause they glared and growled tremendously  are you sure that cage is strong enough asked the mate casting a dubious look over the side  oh yes massaplenty strong  hould a bengal tiger said one of the black fellows looking up with a grin which displayed a splendid double row of glittering teeth  very well get the slings on welton and look sharp bosn for more company of the same kind is expected said the mate  the bosna broad short burly man as a boatswain always is and always ought to be with of course a terrific bass voice a body outrageously long and legs ridiculously shortreplied ay ay sir and gave some directions to his mates who stood by the hoisting tackles  at the first hoist the appearance of the cage justified the mates suspicions for the slings bent it in so much that some of the bars dropped out  avast heaving roared the boatswain  lower  down went the cage into the dinghy  the bars were promptly replaced and the slings fastened in better position  try it again bosn said the mate  the order to hoist was repeated and up went the cage a second time but it bent as before so that several bars again slipped out leaving the leopards sufficient space to jump through if they chose  lower yelled the mate  the men obeyed promptlyrather too promptly  the cage went down by the run into the boat and with a crash fell asunder  cut the rope cried the mate  jim welton jumped into the chains cut the painter and the boat was swept away by the tide which was running strong past the ship  at the same moment the black fellows went over the sides into the water like six black eels radiating from a centre and away went the dinghy with the leopards in possession mounted on the debris of their prison lashing their sides with their tails and looking round in proud defiance of all mankind  the crew of the boat each of whom could swim like a frog were soon picked up  meanwhile all on board the wellington who had telescopes applied them to their eyes and watched the progress of the dinghy  it chanced that the current set with considerable force towards the opposite side of the river where lay an island on which was a public garden  there ladies and gentlemen in gay costume as well as many natives and children were promenading the shady walks chatting pleasantly listening to the sweet strains of music enjoying the fragrance of scented flowers with the jungle and its inhabitants very far indeed from their thoughtsexcept perchance in the case of a group surrounding a young officer who was no doubt recounting the manner in which he had potted a tiger on the occasion of his last day out with the rajah of bangalore or some such dignitary  straight to the shores of this edenlike spot the dinghy drifted and quietly did the leopards abide the resultso also did the deeply interested crew of the wellington who of course were quite unable to give any note of warning  the little boat was seen to touch the shore and the leopards were observed to land leisurely without opposition from the enemy immediately after something resembling a sensation was apparent in the garden  the distance was too great to permit of sound travelling to the observers but it lent enchantment to the view to the extent of rendering the human beings there like moving flowers of varied hue presently there was a motion as if a tornado had suddenly burst upon the flowerbeds and scattered them right and left in dire confusionnot a few appearing to have been blown up into the trees  that same day the crack shots and sportsmen of calcutta went down to the usually peaceful islet and engaged in all the wild work of a regular hunt and at eve the two leopards were seen by interested observers in the wellington being conveyed away in triumph on a litter  but long before this happy consummation of the days sport in the garden the remainder of the expected company had arrived alongside the wellington and the undaunted bosnwho declared himself ready on the shortest notice to hoist any living creature on board from a sperm whale to a megatheriumtackled the elephant  the ponderous brute allowed itself to be manipulated with the utmost goodhumour and when carefully lowered on the deck it alighted with as much softness as if it had been shod with indiarubber and walked quietly forward casting a leer out of its small eyes at the mate as if it were aware of its powers but magnanimously forbore to use them to the disadvantage of its human masters  in passing it knocked off the bosns hat but whether this was done by accident or design has never been ascertained  at all events the creature made no apology  if this passenger was easygoing and polite the rhinoceros which came next was very much the reverse  that savage individual displayed a degree of perverse obstinacy and bad feeling which would have been deemed altogether inexcusable even in a small streetboy  in the whites of its very small grey eyes wickedness sat enthroned  the end of its hornsfor it had two on its noseappeared to be sharpened with malignity its thick lips quivered with anger and its ridiculously small tail wriggled with passionate emotion as if that appendage felt its insignificance yet sought to obtrude itself on public notice  to restrain this passenger was a matter of the utmost difficulty  to get him into the slings might have perplexed hercules himself but nothing could appal the bosn  the slings were affixed the order to hoist was given by the mate who had descended from the poop and stood near the gangway  up went the monster with a grunt and a peculiar rigidity of body which evidently betokened horror at his situation  being fully five tons in weight this passenger had to be received on board with caution  lower away was given  hold on was added  both orders were obeyed and the huge animal hung within three inches of the deck  stand clear there lads  there was no occasion for that order  it had been anticipated  lower was again given  the moment the feet of the creature touched the deck he dashed forward with ungovernable fury broke the slings overturned the bosn who fortunately rolled into the port scuppers and took possession of the ship driving the men into the chains and up the rigging  jump up shouted jim welton to the bosn  here he comes aft yelled several of the men  there was no need to warn the boatswain  he heard the thunder of the monsters feet and sprang into the main rigging with an amount of agility that could hardly have been excelled by a monkey  why what are you all afraid of asked the captain of the ship who had come on board with a number of passengers just before the occurrence of this incident  come down here sir and youll see replied the mate who was in the mainchains  the captain declined with a smile and advised the use of a lasso  immediately every man of the ships crew became for the nonce a mexican wildhorse tamer  running nooses were made and jack albeit unused to taking wild cattle on the prairies of america was nevertheless such an adept at casting a coil of rope that he succeeded beyond the most sanguine expectation  the bosn was the first to throw a loop over the creatures front horncast a hitch over its foremast as he styled it amid a deafening cheer  he was immediately pulled out of the rigging and a second time lay wallowing in the port scuppers but he cared nothing for that being upheld by the glory of having succeeded in fixing the first noose  soon after that stanley hall threw a noose over the creatures head and jim welton fixed one on its second hornor as the bosn said round his mizzen  in the course of halfanhour the rhinoceros was so completely entangled in the twisted ropes that he seemed as though he were involved in a net  he was finally captured and led to a ponderous stall that had been prepared for him between the fore and main masts  soon afterwards the last of the human passengers came on board  there were many of them  officers and their wives and childrensome in health some in sickness  old warriors returning home to repose on their laurels  young warriors returning home to recruit their health or to die  women who went out as wives returning as widows and women who went out as widows returning as wives  some returning with fortunes made a few returning with fortunes broken but all old and young healthy and sick rich and poor hopeful and hopeless glad at the prospect of leaving the burning skies of india behind and getting out among the fresh breezes of the open sea  then the sails were set and with a light evening breeze the wellington began her voyagehomeward bound  once again the scene changes  blue skies are gone  grey clouds preponderate  in the atlantic tossed by the angry billows a large ship scuds before the wind as though she were fleeing from the pursuit of a relentless enemy  she has evidently seen rough and long service her decks have been swept by many a heavy sea her spars have been broken and spliced  the foremast is sprung the maintopgallant mast is gone and the mizzen has been snapped off close by the deck  her bulwarks are patched here and there and her general appearance bears evidence of the tremendous power of ocean  it would be difficult in that weatherworn hull to recognise the trim fullrigged ship that left the hoogly many months before  it was not a recent gale that had caused all this damage  in the south atlantic several weeks before she had encountered one of those terrific but shortlived squalls which so frequently send many of mans stoutest floating palaces to the bottom  hence her halfwrecked condition  the passengers on board the wellington did not however seem to be much depressed by their altered circumstances  the fact was they had become so used to rough weather and had weathered so many gales and reached their damaged condition by such slow degrees that they did not realise it as we do turning thus abruptly from one page to another  besides this although still some weeks sail from the white cliffs of old england they already began to consider the voyage as good as over and not a few of the impatient among them had begun to pack up so as to be ready for going ashore  and how carefully were those preparations for landing made  with what interest the sandalwood fans and inlaid ivory boxes and elaborately carved chessmen and curious indian toys and costly indian shawls were reexamined and repacked in more secure and carefullytoberemembered corners in order that they might be got at quickly when eager little hands at home well well it is of no use to dwell on what was meant to be for not one of those lovetokens ever reached its destination  all were swallowed up by the insatiable sea  but let us not forestall  the elephant and rhinoceros were the only members of the community that had perished on the voyage  at first the elephant had been dreaded by many but by degrees it won the confidence and affection of all  houses innumerable had been built for it on deck but the sagacious animal had a rooted antipathy to restraint  no sort of den however strongly formed could hold him long  the first structures were so ridiculously disproportioned to his strength as to be demolished at once  on being put into the first house that jack built he looked at it demurely for at least five minutes as if he were meditating on the probable intentions of the silly people who put him there but neither by look nor otherwise did he reveal the conclusions to which he came  his intentions however were not long of being made known  he placed his great side against the den there was a slow but steady rending of timbers as if the good ship herself were breaking up a burst of laughter from the men followed and sambo was free  when the succeeding houses were built so strong that his side availed not he brought his wonderful patience and his remarkable trunk to bear on them and picked them to pieces bit by bit  then ropes were tried but he snapped weak ropes and untied strong ones  at last he was permitted to roam the decks at perfect liberty and it was a point of the greatest interest to observe the neat way in which he picked his steps over the lumbered decks without treading upon anythingay even during nights when these decks in the tropical regions were covered with sleeping men  everybody was fond of sambo  neptune doted on him and the children who fed him to such an extent with biscuits that the bosn said he would be sartin sure to die of appleplexyabsolutely adored him  even the gruff grumpy unsociable rhinoceros amiably allowed him to stroke its head with his trunk  sambo troubled no one except the cook but that luxurious individual was so constantly surrounded by a halo so to speak of delicious and suggestive odours that the elephant could not resist the temptation to pay him frequent visits especially when dinner was being prepared  one of his favourite proceedings at such times was to put his trunk into the galley take the lid off the coppers make a small coil of the end of his proboscis and therewith at one sweep spoon out a supply of potatoes sufficient for halfadozen men  of course the cook sought to counteract such tendencies but he had to be very circumspect for sambo resented insults fiercely  one day the cook caught his enemy in the very act of clearing out the potato copper  enraged beyond endurance he stuck his tormentors into the animals trunk  with a shriek of rage sambo dashed the potatoes in the mans face and made a rush at him  the cook fled to his sanctum and shut the door  there the elephant watched him for an hour or more the united efforts mental and physical of the ships crew failed to remove the indignant creature so they advised the cook to remain where he was for some time  he hit on the plan however of rewinning the elephants friendship  he opened his door a little and gave him a piece of biscuit  sambo took it  what his feelings were no one could tell but he remained at his post  another piece of biscuit was handed out then the end of the injured proboscis was smoothed and patted by the cook  another large piece of biscuit was administered and by degrees the cure was affected  thus successfully was applied that grand principle which has accomplished so much in this wicked world even among higher animals than elephantsthe overcoming of evil with good  eventually sambo sickened  either the cold of the north told too severely on a frame which had been delicately nurtured in sunny climes or sambo had surreptitiously helped himself during the hours of night to something deleterious out of the paint or pitch pots  at all events he died to the sincere regret of all on boardcook not exceptedand was launched overboard to glut the sharks with an unwonted meal and astonish them with a new sensation  very dissimilar was the end of the rhinoceros  that bumptious animal retained its unamiable spirit to the last  fortunately it did not possess the powers or sagacity of the elephant  it could not untie knots or pick its cage to pieces so that it was effectually restrained during the greater part of the voyage but there came a tempest at last which assisted him in becoming freefree not only from durance vile but from the restraints of this life altogether  on the occasion referred to the rudder was damaged and for a time rendered useless so that the good ship wellington rolled to an extent that almost tore the masts out of her  everything not firmly secured about the decks was washed overboard  among other things the rhinoceros was knocked so heavily against the bars of his crib that they began to give way  at last the vessel gave a plunge and roll which seemed to many of those on board as though it must certainly be her last  the rhinoceros was sent crashing through the dislocated bars the ropes that held his legs were snapped like the cords wherewith samson was bound in days of old and away he went with the lurch of a tipsy man against the longboat which he stove in  hold on roared the bosn  whether this was advice to the luckless animal or a general adjuration to everybody and everything to be prepared for the worst we know not but instead of holding on every one let go what he or she chanced to be holding on to at the moment and made for a place of safety with reckless haste  the rhinoceros alone obeyed the order  it held on for a second or two in a most remarkable manner to the mainmast but another lurch of the vessel cast it loose again a huge billow rolled under the stern down went the bow and the brute slid on its haunches with its fore legs rigid in front at an incredible pace towards the galley just as a smash became imminent the bow rose the stern dropt and away he went back again with equal speed but in a more sidling attitude towards the quarterdeck  before that point was reached a roll diverted him out of course and he was brought up by the main hatch from which he rebounded like a billiard ball towards the starboard gangway  at this point he lost his balance and went rolling to leeward like an empty cask  there was something particularly awful and impressive in the sight of this unwieldy monster being thus knocked about like a pea in a rattle and sometimes getting into attitudes that would have been worthy of a dancer on the tightrope but the consummation of the event was not far off  an unusually violent roll of the ship sent him scrambling to starboard a still more vicious roll checked and reversed the rush and dashed him against the cabin skylight  he carried away part of this continued his career went tailforemost through the port bulwarks like a cannonshot into the sea  he rose once but as if to make sure of her victory the ship relentlessly fell on him with a weight that must have split his skull and sent him finally to the bottom  strange to say the dog neptune was the only one on board that appeared to mourn the loss of this passenger  he howled a good deal that night in an unusually sad tone and appeared to court sympathy and caresses more than was his wont from jim welton and the young people who were specially attached to him but he soon became reconciled alas to the loss of his crusty friend  the storms ceased as they neared the shores of england  the carpenter and crew were so energetic in repairing damages that the battered vessel began to wear once more something of her former trim aspect and the groups of passengers assembled each evening on the poop began to talk with everdeepening interest of home while the children played beside them or asked innumerable questions about brothers sisters and cousins whose names were as familiar as household words though their voices and forms were still unknown  the weather was fine the sky was clear warm summer breezes filled the sails and all nature seemed to have sunk into a condition so peaceful as to suggest the idea that storms were past and gone for ever when the homewardbound ship neared the land  one evening the captain remarked to the passengers that if the wind would hold as it was a little longer they should soon pass through the downs and say goodbye to the sea breezes and the roll of the ocean wave    chapter thirteen  bob queeker comes out very strong indeed  it is both curious and interesting to observe the multitude of unlikely ways in which the ends of justice are ofttimes temporarily defeated who would have imagined that an old pump would be the cause of extending morley joness term of villainy of disarranging the deeplaid plans of mr larks of effecting the deliverance of billy towler and of at once agonising the body and ecstatifying the soul of robert queeker  yet so it was  if the old pump had not existedif its fabricator had never been bornthere is every probability that mr joness career would have been cut short at an earlier period  that he would in his then state of mind have implicated billy who would have been transported along with him and almost certainly ruined that mr queeker wouldbut hold let us present the matter in order  messrs merryheart and dashope were men of the law and mr robert queeker was a man of their officein other words a clerknot a confidential one but a clerk nevertheless in whose simpleminded integrity they had much confidence  bob as his fellowclerks styled him was sent on a secret mission to ramsgate  the reader will observe how fortunate it was that his mission was secret because it frees us from the necessity of setting down here an elaborate and tedious explanation as to how when and where the various threads of his mission became interwoven with the fabric of our tale  suffice it to say that the only part of his mission with which we are acquainted is that which had reference to two menone of whom was named mr larks the other morley jones  now it so happened that queekers acquaintance mr durant had an intimate friend who dwelt near a beautiful village in kent  when queeker mentioned the circumstance of the secret mission which called him to ramsgate he discovered that the old gentleman was on the point of starting for this village in company with his daughter and her cousin fanny  youll travel with us i hope queeker our roads lie in the same direction at least a part of the way you know said the hearty little old gentleman with goodnature beaming in every wrinkle from the crown of his bald head to the last fold of his treble chin it will be such a comfort to have you to help me take care of the girls  and if you can spare time to turn aside for a day or two i promise you a hearty welcome from my friendwhose residence named jenkinsjoy is an antique paradise and his hospitality unbounded  he has splendid horses too and will give you a gallop over as fine a country as exists between this and the british channel  you ride of course  queeker admitted that he could ride a little  at least he added after a pause i used frequently to get rides on a carthorse when i was a very little boy  so it was arranged that queeker should travel with them  moreover he succeeded in obtaining from his employers permission to delay for three days the prosecution of the missionwhich although secret was not immediately pressingin order that he might visit jenkinsjoy  it was fortunate that when he went to ask this brief holiday he found mr merryheart in the office  had it been his mischance to fall upon dashope he would have received a blunt refusal and prompt dismissalso thoroughly were the joys of that gentleman identified with the woes of other people  but great though queekers delight undoubtedly was on this occasion it was tempered by a soulharassing care which drew forth whole quires of poetical effusions to the moon and other celestial bodies  this secret sorrow was caused by the dreadful and astonishing fact that do what he would to the contrary the weathercock of his affections was veering slowly but steadily away from katie and pointing more and more decidedly towards fanny hennings  it is but simple justice to the poor youth to state that he loathed and abhorred himself in consequence  there am i he soliloquised on the evening before the journey began a monster a brute a lower animal almost who have sought with all my strength to gainperchance have gainedthe innocent trusting heart of katie durant and yet without really meaning it but somehow without being able to help it i amnot falling in love oh no perish the thought but butfalling into something strangely mysteriously incomprehensibly similar tooh base ingrate that i am is there no way no backdoor by which  starting up and seizing a pen at this point of irrepressible inspiration he wrote reading aloud as he set down the burning thoughts    oh for a postern in the rear   where wretched man might disappear   and never more should seek her    fly fly to earths extremest bounds  bounds mounds lounds founds kounds downds rounds pounds zoundshoundsha houndsi have it    fly fly to earths extremest bounds   with huntsmen horses horns and hounds   and diedejected queeker  i wonder thought queeker as he sat biting the end of his quillhis usual method of courting inspiration i wonder if there is anything prophetic in these lines  durant said that his friend has splendid horses  they may perhaps be hunters  ha my early ambition perchance youths fond dream may yet be realised  but let me not hope  hope always tells a false as well as flattering tale to me she has ever been in my experience he was bitter at this point an incorrigible liahem storyteller  striking his clenched fist heavily on the table queeker rose put on his hat and went round to mr durants merely to inquire whether he could be of any servicenot that he could venture to offer assistance in the way of packing but there might be something such as roping trunks or writing and affixing addresses in regard to which he might perhaps render himself useful  why miss durant he said on entering you are always busy  am i said katie with a smile as she rose and shook hands  yes iiassure you miss durant said queeker bowing to fanny on whose fat pretty face there was a scarlet flush the result either of the suddenness of queekers entry or of the suppression of her inveterate desire to laugh i assure you that it quite rouses my admiration to observe the ease with which you can turn your hand to anything  you can write out accounts better than any fellow in our office  then you play and sing with so much ease and i often find you making clothes for poor people with pounds of tea and sugar in your pockets besides many other things and now here you are painting likelikeone of the old masters  this was quite an unusual burst on the part of queeker who felt as though he were making some amends for his unfaithfulness in thus recalling and emphatically asserting the unquestionably good qualities of his ladylove  he felt as if he were honestly attempting to win himself back to his allegiance  you are very complimentary said katie with a glance at her cousin which threw that young lady into silent convulsions  not at all cried queeker forcing his enthusiasm up to white heat and seizing a drawing which he held up before him in the vain attempt to shut fanny out of his sight  now i call this most beautiful he said in tones of genuine admiration  i never saw anything so sweet before  indeed said katie who observed that the youth was gazing over the top of the drawing at her cousin  i am so glad you like it for to say truth i have felt disappointed with it myself and papa says it is only soso  do point out to me its faults mr queeker and the parts you like best  she rose and looked over queekers shoulder with much interest and took hold of the drawing to keep it firmly in its position  there was an excessively merry twinkle in katies eyes as she watched the expression of queekers face when he exclaimed  faults miss durant there are noeh why what  oh you wicked deceptive man youve got it upside down said katie shaking her finger at the unhappy youth who stammered tried to explainto apologisefailed broke down and talked unutterable nonsense to the infinite delight of his fair tormentor  as for fanny that hebe bent her head suddenly over her workbasket and thrust her face into it as if searching with microscopic intensity for something that positively refused to be found  all that we can safely affirm in regard to her is that if her face bore any resemblance to the scarlet of her neck the fact that her workbox did not take fire is little short of a miracle  fortunately for all parties queeker inadvertently trod on the cats tail which resulted in a spurt so violent as to justify a total change of subject  before the storm thus raised had calmed down mr durant entered the room  at jenkinsjoy queeker certainly did meet with a reception even more hearty than he had been led to expect  mr durants friend stoutheart his amiable wife and daughters and strapping sons received the youthful limb of the law with that frank hospitality which we are taught to attribute to merrie england in the olden time  the mansion was oldfashioned and lowroofed trellisworked and creeperloved addicted to oak panelling balustrades and tapestried walls and highly suitable to ghosts of a humorous and agreeable tendency  indeed it was said that one of the rooms actually was haunted at that very time but queeker did not see any ghosts although he afterwards freely confessed to having seen all the rooms in the house more or less haunted by fairy spirits of the fair sex and masculine ghosts in buckskins and topboots  the whole air and aspect of the neighbourhood was such that queeker half expected to find a maypole in the neighbouring village sweet shepherdesses in straw hats pink ribbons and short kirtles in the fields and gentle shepherds with long crooks playing antique flageolets on green banks with innocentlooking dogs beside them and humbleminded sheep reposing in arcadian felicity at their feet  where does the meet take place today tom asked mr stoutheart senior of mr stoutheart junior while seated at breakfast the first morning after their arrival at jenkinsjoy  at curmersfield replied young stoutheart  ah not a bad piece of country to cross  you remember when you and i went over it together amy  we have gone over it so often together papa replied amy that i really dont know to which occasion you refer  why that time when we met the hounds unexpectedly when you were mounted on your favourite wildfire and appeared to have imbibed some of his spirit for you went off at a tangent crying out come along papa and cleared the hedge at the roadside crossed slappertons farm galloped up the lane leading to curmersfield took the ditch with the low fence beyond at cumitstrongs turnipfield in a flying leap obliging me to go quarter of a mile round by the gateand overtook the hounds just as they broke away on a false scent in the direction of the neckornothing ditch  oh yes i remember replied amy with a gentle smile it was a charming gallop  i wished to continue it but you thought the ground would be too much for me though i have gone over it twice since then in perfect safety  you are far too timid papa  queeker gazed and listened in openmouthed amazement for the young girl who acknowledged in an offhand way that she had performed such tremendous feats of horsemanship was modest pretty unaffected and feminine  i wonder thought queeker if fanah i mean katiecould do that sort of thing  he looked loyally at katie but thought disloyally of her cousin accused himself of base unfaithfulness and seizing a hot roll began to eat violently  would you like to see the meet mr queeker said mr stoutheart senior i can give you a good mount  my own horse slapover is neither so elegant nor so highspirited as wildfire but he can go over anything and is quite safe  a sensitive spring had been touched in the bosom of queeker which opened a floodgate that set loose an astonishing and unprecedented flow of enthusiastic eloquence  i shall like it of all things he cried with sparkling eyes and heightened colour  it has been my ambition ever since i was a little boy to mount a thoroughbred and follow the hounds  i assure you the idea of crossing country as it is called i believe and taking hedges ditches fivebarred gates and everything as we go has a charm for me which is absolutely inexpressible  queeker stopped abruptly because he observed a slight flush on fannys cheeks and a pursed expression on fannys lips and felt uncertain as to whether or not she was laughing at him internally  well said queeker cried mr stoutheart enthusiastically its a pity you are a townbred man  such spirit as yours can find vent only in the free air of the country  amy dear said katie with an extremely innocent look at her friend do huntsmen in this part of england usually take everything as they go  i think mr queeker used that expression  nnot exactly replied amy with a smile and glance of uncertainty as if she did not quite see the drift of the question  ah  i thought not returned katie with much gravity  i had always been under the impression that huntsmen were in the habit of going round stackyards and houses and such thingsnot over them  queeker was stabbedstabbed to the heart  it availed not that the company laughed lightly at the joke and that mr stoutheart said that he queeker should realise his young dream and reiterated the assurance that his horse would carry him over anything if he only held tightly on and let him go  he had been stabbed by katiethe gentle katiethe girl whom he had adored so longha there was comfort in the word had it belonged to the past it referred to things gone by it rhymed with sad bad mad it suggested a period of remote antiquity and pointed to a hazy future  as the latter thought rushed through his heated brain he turned his eyes on fanny with that bold look of dreadful determination that marks the traitor when having fully made up his mind he turns his back on his queen and flag for ever  but poor queeker found little comfort in the new prospect for fanny had been gently touched on the elbow by katie when she committed her savage attack and when queeker looked at the fair fat cousin she was involved in the agonies of a suppressed but tremendous giggle  after breakfast two horses were brought to the door  wildfire a sleek powerful roan of large size was a fit steed for the stalwart tom who in neatlyfitting costume and hessian boots got into the saddle like a man accustomed to it  the other horse slapover was a large strongboned somewhat heavy steed suitable for a man who weighed sixteen stone and stood six feet in his socks  now then jump up queeker said mr stoutheart holding the stirrup  if queeker had been advised to vault upon the ridgepole of the house he could not have looked more perplexed than he did as he stood looking up at the towering mass of horseflesh to the summit of which he was expected to climb  however being extremely light and mr stoutheart senior very strong he was got into the saddle somehow  where are the stirrups said queeker with a perplexed air trying to look over the side of his steed  why theyve forgot to shorten em said mr stoutheart with a laugh observing that the irons were dangling six inches below the riders toes  this was soon rectified  queekers glazed leather leggingswhich were too large for him and had a tendency to turn roundwere put straight the reins were gathered up and the huntsman rode away  all youve to do is to hold on shouted mr stoutheart as they rode through the gate  he is usually a little skittish at the start but quiet as a lamb afterwards  queeker made no reply  his mind was brooding on his wrongs and sorrows for katie had quietly whispered him to take care and not fall off and fanny had giggled again  i must cure him of his foolish fancy thought katie as she reentered the house for fannys sake if for nothing else though i cannot conceive what she can see to like in him  there is no accounting for taste  i can at all events diethought queeker as he rode along shaking the reins and pressing his little legs against the horse as if with the savage intention of squeezing the animals ribs together  there was prophetic inspiration in the linesyes he continued repeating them    fly fly to earths extremest bounds   with huntsmen horses horn and hounds   and diedejected queeker  ill change thatit shall be rejected queeker now  for some time tom stoutheart and queeker rode over hill and dalethat is to say they traversed four miles of beautiful undulating and diversified country at a leisurely pace having started in good time  your father observed queeker as they rode side by side down a green lane said i think when we started that this horse was apt to be skittish at the start  is he difficult to hold in  oh no replied tom with a reassuring smile  he is as quiet and manageable as any man could wish  he does indeed bounce about a little when we burst away at first and is apt then to get the bit in his teeth but youve only to keep a tight rein and hell go all right  his only fault is a habit of tossing his head which is a little awkward until you get used to it  yes i have discovered that fault already replied queeker as the horse gave a practical illustration of it by tossing his enormous head back until it reached to within an inch of the point of his riders nose  twice he has just touched my forehead  had i been bending a little forward i suppose he would have given me an unpleasant blow  rather said stoutheart junior  i knew one poor fellow who was struck in that way by his horse and knocked off insensible  i think he was killed but dont feel quite sure as to that  he has no other faults i hope asked queeker  none  as for refusing his leapshe refuses nothing  he carries my father over anything he chooses to run him at so its not likely that hell stick with a lightweight  this was so selfevident that queeker felt a reply to be unnecessary he rode on therefore in silence for a few minutes comforting himself with the thought that at all events he could die  i dont intend said queeker after a few minutes consideration to attempt to leap everything  i think that would be foolhardy  i must tell you mr stoutheart before we get to the place of meeting that i can only ride a very little and have never attempted to leap a fence of any kind  indeed i never bestrode a real hunter before  i shall therefore content myself with following the hounds as far as it is safe to do so and will then give it up  young stoutheart was a little surprised at the modest and prudent tone of this speech but he goodnaturedly replied  very well ill guide you through the gates and gaps  you just follow me and you shall be all right and when youve had enough of it let me know  queeker and his friend were first in the field but they had not been there many minutes when one and another and another redcoat came cantering over the country and ere long a large cavalcade assembled in front of a mansion the lawn of which formed the rendezvous  there were men of all sorts and sizes on steeds of all kinds and shapeslittle men on big horses and big men on little horses men who looked like bloated aristocrats before the bloating process had begun and men in whom the bloating process was pretty far advanced but who had no touch of aristocracy to soften it  men who looked healthy and happy others who looked reckless and depraved  some wore redcoats cords and topsothers to the surprise and no small comfort of queeker who fancied that all huntsmen wore red coats were habited in modest tweeds of brown and grey  many of the horses were sleek glossy and finelimbed like racers others were strongboned and rough  some few were of gigantic size and rugged aspect to suit the massive men who bestrode them  one of these in particular a hearty jovial farmerand a relative of tomsappeared to the admiring queeker to be big and powerful enough to have charged a whole troop of light dragoons singlehanded with some hope of a successful issue  ladies were there to witness the start and two of the fair sex appeared ready to join the hunt and follow the hounds while here and there little boys might be seen bent on trying their metal on the backs of shetland ponies  it was a stirring scene of meeting and chatting and laughing and rearing and curvetting and fresh air and sunshine  presently the master of the hounds came up with the pack at his heels a footman of the mansion supplied all who desired it with a tumbler of beer  have some beer said young stoutheart pointing to the footman referred to  no thank you said queeker  will you  no  i have quite enough of spirit within me  dont require artificial stimulant said the youth with a laugh  come nowwere off  queekers heart gave a bound as he observed the master of the hounds ride off at a brisk pace followed by the whole field  i wont die yet  its too soon he thought as he shook the reins and chirped to his steed  slapover did not require chirping  he shook his head executed a mild pirouette on his left hind leg and made a plunge which threatened first to leave his rider behind and then to shoot him over his head  queeker had been taken unawares but he pressed his knees together knitted his brows and resolved not to be so taken again  whew what a rush there was as the two or three hundred excited steeds and enthusiastic riders crossed the lawn galloped through an open gate and made towards a piece of rough ground covered with low bushes and bracken through which the hounds were seen actively running as if in search of something  the bodies of the hounds were almost hidden and queeker whose chief attention was devoted to his horse had only time to receive the vague impression as he galloped up that the place was alive with white and pointed tails  that first rush scattered queekers depression to the winds  what cared he for love either successful or unrequited now  katie was forgotten fanny was to him little better than a mere abstraction  he was on a hunter  he was following the hounds  he had heard or imagined he had heard something like a horn  he was surprised a little that no one cried out tallyho and in the wild excitement of his feelings thought of venturing on it himself but the necessity of holding in slapover with all the power of his arms fortunately induced him to restrain his ardour  soon after he heard a shout of some sort which he tried to believe was tallyho and the scattered huntsmen who had been galloping about in all directions converged into a stream  following he knew not and cared not what or whom he swept round the margin of a little pond and dashed over a neighbouring field  from that point queekers recollection of events became a train of general confusion with lucid points at intervals where incidents of unusual interest or force arrested his attention  the first of these lucid points was when at the end of a heavy burst over a ploughed field he came to what may be styled his first leap his hat by that time had threatened so frequently to come off that he had thrust it desperately down on his head until the rim behind rested on the back of his neck  trotting through a gap in a hedge into a road young stoutheart sought about for a place by which they might clamber up into the next field without going round by the gate towards which most of the field had headed  dyou think you could manage that said tom pointing with the handle of his whip to a gap in the hedge where there was a mound and a hollow with a chevauxdefrise of cut stumps around and a mass of thorn branches sufficiently thin to be broken through  queeker never looked at it but gazing steadily in the face of his friend said  ill follow  stoutheart at once pushed his horse at it  it could not be called a leap  it was a mere scramble done at the slowest possible pace wildfire gave one or two little bounds and appeared to walk up perpendicularly on his hind legs while tom looked as if he were plastered against him with some adhesive substance then he appeared to drop perpendicularly down on the other side his tail alone being visible  all right come along shouted tom  queeker rode up to the gap shut his eyes gave a chirp and committed himself to fate and slapover  he felt a succession of shocks and then a pause  venturing to open his eyes he saw young stoutheart still on the other side of the fence laughing at him  you shouldnt hold so tight by the reins he cried youve pulled him back into the road  try it again  queeker once more shut his eyes slacked the reins and seizing the pommel of the saddle gave another chirp  again there was a shock which appeared to drive his body up against his head another which seemed to have all but snapped him off at the waist then a sensation about his hat as if a few wildcats were attempting to tear it off followed by a drop and a plunge which threw him forward on his chargers neck  dear me he exclaimed panting as he opened his eyes i had no idea the shock would have been sososhocking  tom laughed cried well done and galloped on  queeker followed his cheeks on fire and perspiration streaming from his brow  now then here is an easy fence cried stoutheart looking back and pointing to a part of the field where most of the huntsmen were popping over a low hedge will you try it  queekers spirit was fairly up  ill try it he said sternly  come on then  stoutheart led the way gallantly at full speed and went over like an indiarubber ball  queeker brought the handle of his ridingwhip whack down on the flank of his astonished horse and flew at the fence slapover took it with a magnificent bound  queeker was all but left behind  he tottered as it were in the saddle rose entirely out of it came down with a crash that almost sent him over the horses head and gave him the probable sensations of a telescope on being forcibly shut up but he held on bravely and galloped up alongside of his companion with a tendency to cheer despite his increased surprise at the extreme violence of the shocks to which his unaccustomed frame was being exposed  after this our enthusiastic nimrod went at everything and feared nothing  well was it for him that he had arranged to follow tom stoutheart else assuredly he would have run slapover at fences which would have taxed the temerity even of that quadruped and insured his destruction  tom seeing his condition considerately kept him out of danger and yet being thoroughly acquainted with the country managed to keep him well up with the hounds  towards the afternoon queekers fire began to abate  his aspect had become dishevelled  his hat had got so severely thrust down on his head that the brim in front reposed on the bridge of his nose as did the brim behind on the nape of his neck  his trousers were collected in folds chiefly about his knees and the glazed leggings had turned completely round presenting the calves to the front  but these were matters of small moment compared with the desperate desire he had to bring his legs together if even for a moment of time  sensations in various parts of his frame which in the earlier part of the day had merely served to remind him that he was mortal had now culminated into unquestionable aches and pains and his desire to get off the back of slapover became so intense that he would certainly have given way to it had he not felt that in the event of his doing so there would be no possibility of his getting on again  where are they all away to he asked in surprise as the whole field went suddenly off helterskelter in a new direction  i think theyve seen the fox replied stoutheart  seen the fox why i forgot all about the fox  butbut havent we seen it before havent we been after it all day  no weve only got scent of if once or twice  well well exclaimed queeker turning up his eyes i declare we have had as good fun as if we had been after the fox in full sight all the time  here is a somewhat peculiar leap said stoutheart reining up as they approached a fence on the other side of which was a highroad ill go first to show you the way  the peculiarity of the leap lay in the fact that it was a drop of about four feet into the road which was lower to that extent than the field and that the side of the road into which the riders had to drop was covered with scrubby bushes  to men accustomed to it this was a trifle  most of the field had already taken it though a few cautious riders had gone round by a gate  when queeker came to try it he felt uneasysitting as he did so high and looking down such a precipice as it seemed to him  however he shut his eyes and courageously gave the accustomed chirp and slapover plunged down  queeker held tight to the saddle and although much shaken would have come out of the ordeal all right had not slapover taken it into his head to make a second spring over a low bush which stood in front of him  on the other side of this bush there was an old pump  queeker lost his balance threw out his arms fell off was hurled violently against the old pump and his right leg was broken  a cart was quickly procured and on trusses of straw the poor huntsman was driven sadly and slowly back to jenkinsjoy where he was tenderly put to bed and carefully nursed for several weeks by his hospitable and sympathising friends  queeker bore his misfortune like a stoic chiefly because it developed the great fact that fanny hennings wept a whole night and a day after its occurrence insomuch that her fair face became so swollen as to have lost much of its identity and all its beautya fact which filled queeker with hopes so high that his recovery was greatly hastened by the contented almost joyous manner in which he submitted to his fate  of course queekers secret mission was for the time being at an endand thus it came to pass that an old pump as we said at the beginning of this chapter was the cause of the failure of several deeplaid plans and of much bodily anguish and mental felicity to the youthful nimrod  queekers last observation before falling into a feverish slumber on the first night after his accident was to the effect that foxhunting was splendid sportmagnificent sportbut that it appeared to him there was no occasion whatever for a fox  and ever after that he was wont to boast that his first and last day of foxhunting which was an unusually exciting one had been got though charmingly without any fox at all  it is even said that queeker descending from poetryhis proper sphere to prose wrote an elaborate and interesting paper on that subject which was refused by all the sporting papers and journals to which he sent itbut this not being certified we do not record it as a fact    chapter fourteen  the lamplighter at home and threatening appearances  we turn now to a very different scenethe pier and harbour of ramsgate the stormfiend is abroad  thick clouds of a dark leaden hue drive athwart a sky of dingy grey ever varying their edges and rolling out limbs and branches in random fashion as if they were fleeing before the wind in abject terror  the wind however is chiefly in the sky as yet down below there are only fitful puffs now and then telling of something else in store  the sea is black with sufficient swell on it to cause a few crested waves here and there to gleam intensely white by contrast  it is early in the day nevertheless there is a peculiar darkness in the atmosphere which suggests the approach of night numerous vessels in the offing are making with all speed for ramsgate harbour which is truly and deservedly named a harbour of refuge for already some two dozen ships of considerable size and a large fleet of small craft have sought and found shelter on a coast which in certain conditions of the wind is fraught with danger  about the stores near the piers trinity men are busy with buoys anchors and cables elsewhere labourers are toiling idlers are loafing and lifeboatmen are lounging about leaning on the parapets looking wistfully out to sea with and without telescopes from the sheer force of habit and commenting on the weather  the broad bronzed stormbattered coxswain of the celebrated ramsgate lifeboat who seems to possess the power of feeding and growing strong on hardship and exposure is walking about at the end of the east pier contemplating the horizon in the direction of the goodwin sands with the serious air of a man who expects ere long to be called into action  the harbourmasterwho is and certainly had need be a man of brain as well as muscle and energy to keep the conflicting elements around him in ordermoves about actively making preparation for the expected gale  early on the morning of the day referred to nora jones threaded her way among the stalls of the marketplace under the townhall as if she were in search of some one  not succeeding in her search she walked briskly along one of the main thoroughfares of the town and diverged into a narrow street which appeared to have retired modestly into a corner in order to escape observation  at the farther end of this little street she knocked at the door of a house the cleanly appearance of which attested the fact that its owner was welldoing and orderly  nora knocked gently she did everything gently  is mrs moy at home she asked as a very bright little girls head appeared  no sooner was noras voice heard than the door was flung wide open and the little girl exclaimed yes shes at ome and daddy too  she followed up this assurance with a laugh of glee and seizing the visitors hand dragged her into the house by main force  hallo nora ow are ee gal cried a deep bass voice from the neighbourhood of the floor where its owner appeared to be smothered with children for he was not to be seen  nora looked down and beheld the legs and boots of a big man but his body and head were invisible being completely covered and held down by four daughters and five sons one of the former being a baby and one of the latter an infant  dick moy who was enjoying his month on shore rose as a man might rise from a long dive flung out his great right arm scattered the children like flecks of foam and sat up with a beaming countenance holding the infant tenderly in his left arm  the baby had been cast under the table where it lay helpless apparently and howling  it had passed the most tender period of life and had entered on that stage when knocks cuts yells and bruises are the order of the day  glad to see you nora said the man of the floating light extending his huge hand which the girl grasped and shook warmly  youll excuse me not bein more purlite  im oppressed with childn as you see  it seems to me as if id gone an got spliced to that there ooman in the storybook wot lived in the shoe an had so many childn she didnt know wot to do  if so she knows wot to do now  shes only got to hand em over to poor dick moy an leave him to suffer the consickences ah ere she comes  dick rose as he spoke and handed a chair to nora at the moment that his better but lesser half entered  it must not be supposed that dick said all this without interruption on the contrary he bawled it out in the voice of a bosns mate while the four daughters and five sons including the baby and the infant crawled up his legs and clung to his pockets and enacted babel on a small scale  mrs moy was a very pretty tidy cheerful little woman of the fat fair and forty description save that she was nearer thirtyfive than forty  it was clear at a glance that she and dick had been made for each other and that had either married anybody else each would have done irreparable damage to the other  sit down nora  im so glad to see you  come to breakfast i hope were just going to have it  mrs moy said this as if she really meant it and would be terribly disappointed if she met with a refusal  nora tried to speak but babel was too much for her  silence burst from dick as if a small cannon had gone off in the room  babel was hushed  mums the word for three minutes said dick pointing to a huge yankee clock which stood on the chimneypiece with a model frigate in a glass case and a painted sea and sky on one side of it and a model lightvessel in a glass case and a painted sea and sky on the other  there was profound wisdom in this arrangement  if dick had ordered silence for an indefinite space of time there would have been discontent approximating to despair in babels bosom and therefore strong temptation to rebellion  but three minutes embraced a fixed and known period of time  the result was a desperate effort at restraint mingled with gleeful anticipation  the elder children who could read the clock stared eagerly at the yankee timepiece the younger ones who couldnt read the clock but who knew that the others could stared intently at their seniors and awaited the signal  with the exception of hard breathing the silence was complete the baby being spellbound by example and the feeble remarks of the infantwhich had been transferred to the arms of the eldest girlmaking no impression worth speaking of  you are very kind said nora ill stay for breakfast with pleasure grandmother wont be up for an hour yet and fathers not at home just now  werry good said dick taking a short black pipe out of his coatpocket thats all right  and ow do ee like ramsgate nora now youve had a fair trial of it  i think i like it better than yarmouth but perhaps that is because we live in a more airy and cheerful street  i would not have troubled you so early mr moytaint no trouble at all nora werry much the reversebut that i am anxious to hear how you got on with poor billy  at this point babel burst forth with redoubled fury  dick was attacked and carried by storm the short black pipe was seized and an old hat was clapped on his head and thrust down over his eyes  he gave in at once and submitted with resignation  he struck his colours so to speak without firing a shot and for full five minutes breasted the billows of a sea of children manfully while smart mrs moy spread the breakfasttable as quietly as if nothing were going on and nora sat and smiled at them  suddenly dick rose for the second time from his dive flung off the foam tossed aside the baby rescued the infant from impending destruction and thundered silence mums the word for three minutes more  thats six daddy cried the eldest boy whose spirit of opposition was growing so strong that he could not help indulging it even against his own interests  no said dick sternly  it was three minutes last time urged the boy an you said three minutes more this time three minutes more than three minutes is six minutes aint it  three minutes repeated dick holding up a warning finger  babel ceased the nine pair of eyes excepting those of the infant became fixed and nora proceeded  i wanted to hear how you got on with billy  did they take him in at once and what sort of place is the grotto  you see i am naturally anxious to know because it was a terrible thing to send a poor boy away from his only friend among strangers at such an age and just after recovering from a bad illness but you know i could not do otherwise it would have been his ruin to have  she paused  to have stopped where he was i spose you would say observed dick well i aint sure o that nora  its quite true that the bad company hed ave seen would ave bin against im but to ave you for his guardian hangel might ave counteracted that  it would ave bin like the soda to the hacid a fizz at first and all square arterwards howsever that dont signify now cos hes all right  i tuk him to the grotto the werry first thing arter id bin to the trinity ouse and seed him cast anchor there all right and  again babel burst forth and riot reigned supreme for five minutes more at the end of that time silence was proclaimed as before  now then said dick breakfast bein ready place the chairs  the three elder children obeyed this order  each member of this peculiar household had been told off as dick expressed it to a special duty which was performed with all the precision of discipline characteristic of a manofwar  thats all right now go in and win said dick  there was no occasion to appeal to the yankee clock now  tongues and throats as well as teeth and jaws were too fully occupied  babel succumbed for full quarter of an hour during which period dick moy related to nora the circumstances connected with a recent visit to london whither he had been summoned as a witness in a criminal trial and to which at noras earnest entreaty and with the boys unwilling consent he had conveyed billy towler  we say unwilling because billy during his long period of convalescence had been so won by the kindness of nora that the last thing in the world he would have consented to bear was separation from her but on thinking over it he was met by this insurmountable difficultythat the last thing in the world he would consent to do was to disobey her between these two influences he went unwillingly to londonfor the sake of his education as nora said to himfor the sake of being freed from the evil influence of her fathers example as poor nora was compelled to admit to herself  the grotto said dick speaking as well as he could through an immense mouthful of bacon and bread is an institootion which i ave reason for to believe desarves well of its country  it is an institootion sitooate in paddington street marylebone where homeless childn as would otherwise come to the gallows is took in an savedsaved not only from sin an misery themselves but saved from inflictin the same on society  i do assure you said dick striking the table with his fist in his enthusiasm so that the crockery jumped and some of the children almost choked by reason of their food going down what they styled their wrong throatsi do assure you that it would ave done yer art good to ave seed m as i did the day i went there so clean and comfrable and appyno mistake about that  their appiness was genooine  wot made it come ome to me was that i seed there a little boy as i appened to know was one o the dirtiest wickedest sharpest little willains in londona mere spider to look at but with mischief enough to fill a sixfut man to bustinan there ee was clean an jolly larnin his lessons like a good unan no sham neither cos ed got a good spice o the mischief left as was pretty clear from the way ee gave a sly pinch or pull o the hair now an again to the boys next him an drawed monkeyfaces on his slate  but that spider i wos told could do figurin like one oclock an could spell like johnsons dictionairy  well continued dick after a few moments devotion to a bowl of coffee i anded billy towler over to the superintendent tellin im ee wos a omeless boy as adnt got no parients nor relations an wos werry much in need o bein looked arter  so ee took im in an i bade him goodbye  dick moy then went on to tell how that the superintendent of the grotto showed him all over the place and told him numerous anecdotes regarding the boys who had been trained there that one had gone into the army and become a sergeant and had written many long interesting letters to the institution which he still loved as being his early and only home that another had become an artilleryman another a manofwars man and another a city missionary who commended the blessed gospel of jesus christ to those very outcasts from among whom he had himself been plucked  the superintendent also explained to his rugged but much interested and intelligent visitor that they had a flourishing ragged school in connection with the institution also a sundayschool and a band of hopewhich latter had been thought particularly necessary because they found that many of the neglected young creatures that came to them had already been tempted and taught by their parents and by publicans to drink so that the foundation of that dreadful craving disease had been laid and those desires had begun to grow which if not checked would certainly end in swift and awful destruction  one blessed result of this was that the children had not only themselves joined but had in some instances induced their drunken parents to attend the weekly addresses  all this and a great deal more was related by dick moy with the wonted enthusiasm and energy of his big nature and with much gesticulation of his tremendous fistto the evident anxiety of nora who like an economical housewife as she was had a feeling of tenderness for the crockery even although it was not her own  dick wound up by saying that if he was a rich man eed give some of is superfloous cash to that there grotto he would  perhaps you wouldnt said nora  ive heard one rich man say that the applications made to him for money were so numerous that he was quite annoyed and felt as if he was goin to become bankrupt  nora said dick smiting the table emphatically im not a rich man myself an wots more i never xpect to be so i cant be said to ave no personal notions at all dye see about wot they feels but ive also heerd a rich man give is opinion on that pint and ive no manner of doubt that my rich man is as good as yournbetter for the matter of that anyway he knowed wot was wot  well says ee to me wen i went an begged parding for axin im for a subscription to this ere werry grottowhich by the way is supported by woluntary contribootionsee says dick moy says ee youve no occasion for to ax my parding says ee  eres ow it is  ive got so much cash to spare out of my hincome  werry good i goes an writes down a list of all the charities  first of all comes the churchwhich aint a charity by the way but a debt owin to the lordan the missionary societies an the lifeboat institootion an the shipwrecked mariners society and such like which are the great national institootions of the country that every christian ought to give a helpin and to then theres the poor among ones own relations and friends then the hospitals an various charities o the city or town in which one dwells and the poor of the same  well arter thats all down says ee i consider wich o them ere desarves an needs most support from me an so i claps down somethin to each an adds it all up an wot is left over i holds ready for chance applicants  if their causes are good i give to em heartily if not i bow em politely out o the ouse thats were it is says ee  an do you know dick moy says ee the first time i tried that plan and put down wot i thought a fair liberal sum to each i wos amazedi wos stunned for to find that the total wos so small and left so werry much of my spare cash yet to be disposed of so i went over it all again and had to double and treble the amount to be given to each  ah dick says my rich man if people who dont keep cashbooks would only mark down wot they think they can afford to give away in a year an wot they do give away they would be surprised  its not always unwillingness to give thats the evil  often its ignorance o what is actooally givenno account bein kep  wot dye think dick my rich man goes on to say there are some churches in this country which are dependent on the people for support an the contents o the plates at the doors o these churches on sundays is used partly for cleanin and lightin of em partly for payin their precentors and partly for repairs to the buildins and partly for helpin out the small incomes of their ministers an wot dye think most o the peoplenot many but most of emgives a week dick for such important purposes  i don know sir says i  one penny dick says ee which comes exactly to four shillins and fourpence a year says ee  an they aint paupers dick  if they wos paupers it wouldnt be a big sum for em to give out o any pocketmoney they might chance to git from their pauper friends but theyre welldressed people dick and they seems to be well off  four an fourpence a year think o thatnot to mention the deduction wen they goes for a month or two to the country each summer  four an fourpence a year dick  some of em even goes so low as a halfpenny which makes two an twopence a year7 pounds 11 shillings 8 pence in a seventyyear lifetime dick supposin their liberality began to flow the day they wos born  at this my rich man fell to laughing till i thought eed a busted hisself but he pulled up sudden an axed me all about the grotto and said it was a firstrate institootion an gave me a tenpun note on the spot  now nora my rich man is a friend o yoursmr durant of yarmouth who came to ramsgate a short time ago for to spend the autumn an i got introdooced to him through knowin jim welton who got aboord of one of his ships through knowin young mr stanley hall dye see thats where it is  after this somewhat lengthened speech dick moy swallowed a slopbowlful of coffee at a draughthe always used a slopbowland applied himself with renewed zest to a norfolk dumpling in the making of which delicacy his wife had no equal  i believe that mr durant is a kind good man said nora feeding the infant with a crust dipped in milk and i am quite sure that he has got the sweetest daughter that ever a man was blessed withmiss katie you know her i suppose  avent seed er yet was dicks curt reply  shes a dear creature continued norastill doing her best to choke the infantshe found out where i lived while she was in search of a sick boy in yarmouth who she said was the brother of a poor ragged boy named billy towler she had once met with  of course i had to tell her that billy had been deceiving her and had no brother  oh you should have seen her kind face dick when i told her this  i do think that up to that time she had lived under the belief that a young boy with a goodlooking face and an honest look could not be a deceiver  poor thing said dick with a sad shake of the head as if pitying her ignorance  yes continued norastill attempting to choke the infantshe could not say a word at that time but went away with her eyes full of tears i saw her often afterwards and tried to convince her there might be some good in billy after all but she was not easily encouraged for her belief in appearances had got a shake that she seemed to find it difficult to get over  that was when billy was lying ill in hospital i have not seen much of her since then she and her father having been away in london  hm im raither inclined to jine her in thinkin that no goodll come o that young scamp  hes too sharp by half said dick with a frown depend upon it nora wen a boy as gone a great length in wickedness theres no chance o reclaimin him  dick exclaimed nora with sudden energy depend upon it that thats not true for it does not correspond with the bible which says that our lord came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance  theres truth in that anyhow replied dick gazing thoughtfully into noras countenance as if the truth had come home to him for the first time  what his further observations on the point might have been we know not as at that moment the door opened and one of his mates entered saying that he had come to go down with him to the buoystore as the superintendent had given orders that he and moy should overhaul the old north goodwin buoy and give her a fresh coat of paint  dick therefore rose wiped his mouth kissed the entire family beginning with the infant and ending with the missis after which he shook hands with nora and went out  the storm which had for some time past been brewing had fairly brewed itself up at last and the wild sea was covered with foam  although only an early autumn storm it was like many a thing out of season not the less violent on that account  it was one of the few autumn storms that might have been transferred to winter with perfect propriety  it performed its work of devastation as effectively as though it had come forth at its proper season  on land chimney stacks and trees were levelled  at sea vessels great and small were dismasted and destroyed and the east coast of the kingdom was strewn with wreckage and dead bodies  full many a noble ship went down that night  wealth that might have supported all the charities in london for a twelvemonth was sent to the bottom of the sea that night and lost for ever  lives that had scarce begun and lives that were all but done were cut abruptly short leaving broken hearts and darkened lives in many a home not only on the seacoast but inland where the sound of the great seas roar is never heard  deeds of daring were done that nightby men of the lifeboat service and the coastguardwhich seemed almost beyond the might of human skill and courageresulting in lives saved from that same great sealives young and lives oldthe salvation of which caused many a heart in the land from that night forward to bless god and sing for joy  but of all the widespread and farreaching turmoil the wreck and rescue the rending and relieving of hearts the desperate daring and dread disasters of that night we shall say nothing at all save in regard to that which occurred on and in the neighbourhood of the goodwin sands    chapter fifteen  a night of wreck and disasterthe gull comes to grief  when the storm began to brew that night george welton the mate of the floating light walked the deck of his boiledlobsterlike vessel and examined the sky and sea with that critical expression peculiar to seafaring men which conveys to landsmen the reassuring impression that they know exactly what is coming precisely what ought to be done and certainly what will be the result of whatever happens  after some minutes spent in profound meditation during which mr welton frowned inquiringly at the dark driving clouds above him he said itll be pretty stiff  this remark was made to himself or to the clouds but happening to be overheard by jerry macgowl who was at his elbow it was answered by that excellent man  true for ye itll blow great guns before midnight  the sands is showin their teeth already  the latter part of this remark had reference to brilliant white lines and dots on the seaward horizon which indicated breakers on the goodwin sands  luk at that now said jerry pointing to one of those huge clumsy vessels that are so frequently met with at sea even in the present day as to lead one to imagine that some of the shipbuilders in the time of noah must have come alive again and gone to work at their old trade on the old plans and drawings  luk at that now  did iver ye see sitch a tubstraight up and down the side and as big at the bow as the stern  shes not clipper built answered the mate they make that sort o ship by the mile and sell her by the fathomcuttin off from the piece just what is required  it dont take long to plaster up the ends and stick a mast or two into em  its in luck she is to git into the downs before the gale breaks and its to be hoped she has good groundtackle said jerry  the mate hoped so too in a careless way and remarking that he would go and see that all was made snug went forward  at that moment there came up the forehatch a yell as if from the throat of a north american savage  it terminated in the couplet tunefully sung    oh my oh my   o mammy dont you let the baby cry  jack shales following his voice immediately after came on deck  have ee got that workbox done asked jerry as his mate joined him  not quite done yet boy but ill get it finished after the lights are up  duty first pleasure afterwards you know  come now jack confess that youre makin it for a pretty girl  well so i am but it aint for my own pretty girl  its for that sweet little nora jones who came lately to live in ramsgate  you see i know shes goin to be spliced to jim welton and as jim is a good sort of fellow i want to make this little gift to his future bride  the gift referred to was a wellmade workbox such as the men of the floating light were at that time and doubtless still are in the habit of constructing in leisure hours  it was beautifully inlaid with wood of various kinds and colours and possessed a mark peculiarly characteristic of floatinglight boxes and desks namely two flags inlaid on the lidone of these being the union jack  most of the men on board displayed much skill and taste in the making of those boxes and desks although they were all selftaught and wrought with very simple tools in a not very commodious workshop  a great change from yesterday in the look o things jerry observed shales surveying the downs where despite the stiff and ever increasing breeze amounting almost to a gale numerous little pilotboats were seen dancing on the waves showing a mere shred of canvas and looking out for a job  yesterday was all sunshine and calm with pleasureboats round us and visitors heaving noospapers aboard  today its all gloom with gales brewin and pilots bobbin about like mother carys chickens  thats true jack replied jerry whose poetic soul was fired by the thought    timpest an turmoil today   with lots a saltwather an sorrow   blue little waves on the say   an sunny contintment tomorrow  thats how it is jack me boy all the world overeven in owld ireland hersilf an sure if theres pace to be found on earth its there its to be diskivered  right jerry peace is to be discovered there but im afraid its in a very distant future as yet said jack with a laugh  all in good time retorted jerry  up lights called the mate down the hatchway  ay ay sir came in chorus from below  desks and boxes were thrust aside the winch was manned and the weighty lantern mounted slowly to its nocturnal watchtower  its red eye flashed upon a dark scene  the gloom of approaching night was deepened by the inky clouds that obscured the sky  thick fog banks came sweeping past at intervals a cold northeasterly gale conveyed a wintry feeling to the air  small thick rain fell in abundance and everything attested the appropriateness of jerry macgowls observation that it was dirty weather intirely  the floating light was made snugin other words prepared for action by having a good many more fathoms of her chain veered out in order that she might strain less and swing more freely  loose articles were secured or stowed away  hatches were battened down and many other little nautical arrangements made which it would require a seaman to understand as well as to describe in detail  as the evening advanced the gale increased in violence tenfold and darkness settled down like an impenetrable pall over land and sea  the roar of breakers on the goodwin sands became so loud that it was sometimes heard on board the gulllight above the howling of the tempest  the sea rose so much and ran so violently among the conflicting currents caused by wind tide and sandbanks that the gull plunged swooped and tore at her cable so that the holding of it might have appeared to a landsman little short of miraculous  hissing and seething at the opposition she offered the larger waves burst over her bows and swept the deck from stem to stern but her ample scuppers discharged it quickly and up she rose again dripping from the flood to face and fight and foil each succeeding billow  high on the mast swaying wildly to and fro yet always hanging perpendicular by reason of a simple mechanism the lantern threw out its bright beams involving the vessel and the foamclad boiling sea in a circle of light which ended in darkness profound forming as it were a bright but ghostly chamber shut in with walls of ebony and revealing in all its appalling reality the fury of the sea  what horrors lay concealed in the darkness beyond no one could certainly know but the watch on board the gull could form from past experience a pretty good conception of them as they cowered under the lee of the bulwarks and looked anxiously out to windward  anxiously  ay there was cause for anxiety that night  the risk of parting from their cable was something though not very great but the risk of being run down by passing or driving ships during intervals of fog was much greater and the necessity of looking out for signals of distress was urgent  it was a night of warfare and the battle had begun early  mr weltons record of the earlier part of that day in the log ran thus  at 4 am calm with misty rain at 8 wind southeast light breeze at noon westsouthwest fresh breeze and rain  at 4 pm wind southwest fresh gale and heavy rain  a large fleet anchored in the downs  a schooner was seen to anchor in a bad place about this time at 7 wind still increasing  the watch observed several vessels part from their 7 anchors and proceed to margate roads  at 730 the wind flew into the nornorwest and blew a hurricane  these were the first mutterings of the fight that had begun  it was now about a quarter to eight pm jerry and his friend shales were cowering behind the bulwark on the starboard bow gazing to windward but scarce able to keep their eyes open owing to wind and spray  suddenly a large object was seen looming into the circle of light  stand by roared jerry and jack with startling vigour as the one leaped towards the tiller the other to the companionhatch a vessel bearing down on our hawse  the mate and men rushed on deck in time to see a large ship pass close to the bow of the gull  jack had cast loose the tiller because although in ordinary circumstances the helm of a lightvessel is of no use this was one of the few occasions in which it could be of service the rush of the tide past a ship at anchor confers upon it at all times except during slack water ie when the tide is on the turn the power of steering so that she can be made to sheer swiftly to port or starboard as may be required  but for this power floating lights would undoubtedly be run into more frequently than they are  the danger being over the helm was again made fast amidships but as several vessels were soon after seen sweeping pasttwo or three of them burning tarbarrels and flarelights for assistance it became evident that there would be little or no rest for any one on board that night the mate put on his oiled coat trousers boots and souwester and remained on deck  between eight and nine oclock a schooner was seen approaching  she came out of surrounding darkness like a dim phantom and was apparently making the attempt to go to windward of the floating light  she failed and in a moment was bearing down with terrible speed right upon them  starboard your helm shouted the mate at the same moment springing to the tiller of his own vessel  the steersman of the driving vessel fortunately heard and obeyed the order and she passedbut shaved the bow of the gull so closely that one of the men declared he could easily have jumped aboard of her  again at nine oclock there was a stir on board the floating light for another vessel was seen driving towards her  this one was a brig the foremast was gone and the remains of a tarbarrel were still burning on her deck but as none of the crew could be seen it was conjectured that some other ship must have run foul of her and they had escaped on board of it  all hands were again called the tiller was cast loose a wide sheer given to the gull and the brig went past them at about the distance of a shiplength  she went slowly by owing it was afterwards ascertained to the fact that she had ninety fathoms of cable trailing from her bows  she was laden with coal and when the deal boatmen picked her up next day they found the leg of a man on her deck terribly mutilated as if it had got jambed somehow and been wrenched off  but no one ever appeared to tell the fate of that vessels crew  shortly before ten two tarbarrels were observed burning in a northeasterly direction  these proved to be the signals of distress from a ship and a barque which were dragging their anchors  they gradually drove down on the north part of the sands the barque struck on a part named the goodwin knoll the ship went on the north sandhead  now the time for action had come  the goodwin lightvessel being nearest to the wrecks fired a signalgun and sent up a rocket  there goes the goodwin cried the mate load the starboard gun jack  he ran down himself for a rocket as he spoke and jerry ran to the cabin for the redhot poker which had been heating for some time past in readiness for such an event  a gun and a flare to the southeastard sir close to us shouted shales who had just finished loading as the mate returned with the rocket and fixed it in position  where away jack asked the mate hastily for it now became his duty to send the rocket in the direction of the new signals so as to point out the position of the wreck to the lifeboatmen on shore  due southeast sir there they go again said jack not so close as i thought  south sandhead vessel signalling now sir  there was no further need for questions  the flash of the gun was distinctly seen though the sound was not heard owing to the howling of the hurricane and the bright flare of a second tarbarrel told its own tale while a gun and rocket from the floating light at the south sandhead showed that the vessel in distress had been observed by her  fire cried the mate  jerry applied the poker to the gun and the scene which we have described in a former chapter was reenactedthe blinding flash the roar and the curved line of light across the black sky but there was no occasion that night to repeat the signals  everywhere along the coast the salvors of life and property were on the alertmany of them already in action out battling in midnight darkness with the raging sea  the signal was at once replied to from ramsgate  truly it was a dreadful night one of those tremendous hurricanes which visit our shores three or four times it may be in a century seeming to shake the world to its foundations and to proclaim with unwonted significance the dread power of him who created and curbs the forces of nature  but the human beings who were involved in the perils of that night had scant leisure and little inclination perchance to contemplate its sublimity  the crew of the gull light were surrounded by signals of disaster and distress  in whichever direction they turned their eyes burning tarbarrels and other flaring lights were seen telling their dismal tale of human beings in urgent need of assistance or in dire extremity  little more than an hour before midnight another craft was observed driving down on the hawse of the gull  there was greater danger now because it happened to be near the turn of the tide or slack water so that the rudder could not be used to advantage  all hands were once more turned out and as the vessel drew near mr welton hailed her but got no reply  let go the rudderpendants cried the mate as he shipped the tiller  the order was promptly obeyed and the helm shoved hard aport but there was no responsive sheer  the sea was at the time currentless another moment and the vessel which was a large deserted brig struck the floating light on the portbow and her fore shrouds caught the fluke of the spare anchor which projected from the side  an axe jerry look alive  jerry required no spur he bounded forward caught up an axe and leaped with it into the chains of the vessel which had already smashed part of the gulls bulwarks and wrenched the iron band off the cathead  cut away everything cried the mate who observed that the decks of the brig were full of water and feared that she might be in a sinking condition  the other men of the gull were busy with boathooks oars and fenders straining every nerve to get clear of this unwelcome visitor while jerry dealt the shrouds a few telling blows which quickly cut them through but in sweeping past the maintopsail yardarm of the brig went crashing into the lantern  instantly the lamps were extinguished and the bright beams of the floating light were gone  the brig then dropt astern and was soon lost to view  this was a disaster of the most serious natureinvolving as it did the absence of a light on the faithful glow of which the fate of hundreds of vessels might depend  fortunately however the extreme fury of the gale had begun to abate it was therefore probable that all the vessels which had not already been wrecked had found ports of shelter or would now be able to hold on to their anchors and weather the storm  but floatinglights are not left without resource in a catastrophe such as this  in the book of regulations for the service it is ordered that in circumstances of this kind two red lights are to be shown one at the end of the davit forward the other on a stanchion beside the ensign staff aft and likewise a red flare light is to be shown every quarter of an hour  accordingly while some of the men lit and fixed up the red lanterns jerry macgowl was told off to the duty of showing the red flares or as he himself expressed it settin off a succession o fireworks which wos mightily purty no doubt an would have bin highly entertainin if it had been foin weather and a time of rejoycin  meanwhile the lantern was lowered and it was found that the only damage done had been the shattering of one of its large panes of glass  the lamps although blown out had not been injured  the men therefore set vigorously to work to put in a spare pane and get the light once more into working order  leaving them then at this important piece of work let us turn aside awhile and follow the fortunes of the good ship wellington on that terrible night of storm and disaster  when the storm was brewing she was not far from the downs but the baffling winds retarded her progress and it was pitch dark when she reached the neighbourhood of the goodwin sands  nevertheless those on board of her did not feel much uneasiness because a good pilot had been secured in the channel  the wellington came bowling along under closereefed topsails  stanley hall and jim welton stood leaning over the taffrail looking down into the black foamstreaked water  both were silent save that now and then jim put down his hand to pat a black muzzle that was raised lovingly to meet it and whispered we shall be home tomorrow neptunecheer up old boy  but jims words did not express all his thoughts  if he had revealed them fully he would have described a bright fireside in a small and humble but very comfortable room with a smiling face that rendered sunshine unnecessary and a pair of eyes that made gaslight a paltry flame as well as an absolute extravagance  that the name of this cheap yet dear luminary began with an n and ended with an a is a piece of information with which we think it unnecessary to trouble the reader  stanley halls thoughts were somewhat on the same line of rail if we may be allowed the expression the chief difference being that his luminary beamed in a drawingroom and sang and played and painted beautifullywhich accomplishments however stanley thought would have been sorry trifles in themselves had they not been coupled with a taste for housekeeping and domestic economy and relieving as well as visiting the poor and sabbathschool teaching in short every sort of good work besides an unaccountable as well as admirable penchant for pitching into the board of trade and for keeping sundry accountbooks in such a neat and methodical way that there remains a lasting blot on that board in the fact of their not having been bound in cloth of gold  ever since his first visit to yarmouth stanley had felt an increasing admiration for katie durants sprightly character and sterling qualities and also increasing pity for poor bob queeker who he thought without being guilty of very egregious vanity had no chance whatever of winning such a prize  the reader now knows that the pity thus bestowed upon that pitiful foxhunting turncoat was utterly thrown away  i dont like these fogs in such dangerous neighbourhood observed jim welton as a fresh squall burst upon the ship and laid it over so much that many of the passengers thought she was going to capsize  we should be getting near the floating lights of the goodwin sands by this time  dont these lights sometimes break adrift asked stanley and thus become the cause of ships going headlong to destruction  not often replied jim  considering the constancy of their exposure to all sorts of weather and the number of lightvessels afloat it is amazin how few accidents take place  there has been nothing of the kind as long as i can remember anything about the service but my father has told me of a case where one of the lightvessels that marked a channel at the mouth of the thames once broke adrift in a heavy gale she managed to bring up again with her spare anchor but did not dare to show her light being out of her proper place and therefore a false guide  the consequence was that eight vessels which were making for the channel and counted on seeing her went on the sands and were lost with nearly all hands  if that be so it were better to have lighthouses i think than lightships said stanley  no doubt it would where it is possible to build em replied jim but in some places it is supposed to be impossible to place a lighthouse so we must be content with a vessel  but even lighthouses are are not perfectly secure  i know of one built on piles on a sandbank that was run into by a schooner and carried bodily away accidents will happen you know in the best regulated families but it seems to me that we dont hear of a floatinglight breakin adrift once in half a centurywhile on the other hand the good that is done by them is beyond all calculation  the young men relapsed into silence for at that moment another fierce gust of wind threw the ship over almost on her beamends  several of the male passengers came rushing on deck in alarm but the captain quieted them and induced them to return to the cabin to reassure the ladies who with the children were up and dressed being too anxious to think of seeking repose  it takes courts of inquiryformed of competent men who examine competent witnesses and have the counsel of competent seamenmany days of anxious investigation to arrive at the precise knowledge of the when how and wherefore of a wreck  we do not therefore pretend to be able to say whether it was the fault of the captain the pilot the man at the lead the steersman the lookout or the weather that the good ship wellington met her doom  all that we know for certain is that she sighted the southern lightvessel some time before midnight during the great gale that she steered what was supposed to be her true course and that shortly after she struck on the tail of the sands  instantly the foremast went by the board and the furious sea swept over the hull in blinding cataracts creating terrible dismay and confusion amongst nearly all on board  the captain and first mate however retained their coolness and selfpossession  stanley and jim also with several of the officers on board were cool and selfpossessed and able to render good service while stanley loaded a small carronade young welton got up blue lights and an empty tarbarrel  these were quickly fired  the south sandhead vessels immediately replied the gull as we have seen was not slow to answer and thus the alarm was transmitted to the shore while the breakers that rushed over the goodwins like great walls of snow lifted the huge vessel like a cork and sent it crashing down again and again upon the fatal sands    chapter sixteen  getting ready for action  let us turn back a little at this point and see how the watchers on ramsgate pier behaved themselves on that night of storm and turmoil  at the end of the east pier of ramsgate harbour there stands a very small house a sort of big sentrybox in fact of solid stone which is part and parcel of the pier itselfbuilt not only on it but into it and partially sheltered from the full fury of wind and sea by the low parapetwall of the pier  this is the east pier watchhouse the marine residence if we may so express it of the coxswain of the lifeboat and his men  it is their place of shelter and their watchtower their nightly resort where they smoke the pipe of peace and good fellowship and spin yarns or take such repose as the nature of their calling will admit of  this little stone house had need be strong like its inmates for like them it is frequently called upon to brave the utmost fury of the elementsreceiving the blast fresh and unbroken from the north sea as well as the towering billows from the same  this nocturnal watchtower for muscular men and stout hearts small though it be is divided into two parts the outer portion being the sleepingplace of the lifeboat men  it is a curious little box full of oilskin coats and souwester caps and seaboots and bears the general aspect of a house which had been originally intended for pigmies but had got inhabited by giants somehow by mistake  its very diminutive stove stands near to its extremely small door which is in close proximity to its unusually little window  a little library with a scanty supply of books hangs near the stovepipe as if the owners thereof thought the contents had become somewhat stale and required warming up to make them more palatable  a locker runs along two sides of the apartment on the coverings of which stand several lanterns an oilcan and a stone jar besides sundry articles with an extremely seafaring aspect among which are several pairs of the gigantic boots before referred tothe property of the coxswain and his mates  the cork lifebelt or jacket of the coxswain hangs near the door  the belts for use by the other men are kept in an outhouse down among the recesses of the pier near the spot to which the lifeboat is usually brought to embark her crew  only five of the lifeboat men called harbour boatmen keep watch in and around the little stone house at nights  the rest are taken from among the hardy coast boatmen of the place and the rule isfirst come first servedwhen the boat is called out  there is never any lack of able and willing hands to man the ramsgate lifeboat  near the low ceiling of the watchhouse several hammocks are slung obliging men to stoop a little as they move about  it is altogether a snug and cozy place but cannot boast much of the state of its atmosphere when the fire is going the door shut and the men smoking  on the night of the storm that has already been described in our last chapter the coxswain entered the watchhouse clad in his black oilskin garments and glittering with saltwater from top to toe  there will be more work for us before long pike he said flinging off his coat and souwester and taking up a pipe which he began to fill it looks blacker than ever in the noreast  pike the bowman of the boat who was a quiet man vigorous in action but of few words admitted that there was much probability of their services being again in demand and then rising put on his cap and coat and went out to take a look at the night  two other men sat smoking by the little stove and talking in lazy tones over the events of the day which to judge from their words had been already stirring enough  late the night beforeone of them said for the information of the other who appeared to have just arrived and was getting the newsthe steamtug and lifeboat had gone out on observing signals from the gull and had been told there was a wreck on the sands that they had gone round the back of the sands carefully examining them as far as the east buoy encountering a heavy ground swell with much broken sea but saw nothing that they had then gone closer in to about seven fathoms of water when the lifeboat was suddenly towed over a logas he styled it a baulkof timber but fortunately got no damage and that they were obliged to return to harbour having failed to discover the wreck which probably had gone to pieces before they got out to the sands so they had all their trouble for nothing  the manappealing by look to the coxswain who smoked in silence and gazed sternly and fixedly at the fire as if his mind were wandering far awaywent on to say further that early that morning they had been again called out and were fortunate enough to save the crew of a small schooner and that they had been looking out for and expecting another call the whole day for the truth of all which the man appealed again by look to the coxswain who merely replied with a slight nod while he continued to smoke in silence leaning his elbows on his knees with his strong hands clasped before him sailor fashion and gazing gravely at the fire  it seemed as if he were resting his huge frame after the recent fatigues to which it had been exposed and in anticipation of those which might be yet in store  just then the little door opened quickly and pikes dripping head appeared  i think the gull is signalling he said and vanished  the coxswains souwester and coat were on as if by magic and he stood beside his mate at the end of the pier partly sheltered by the parapet wall  they both clung to the wall and gazed intently out to sea where there was just light enough to show the black waves heaving wildly up against the dark sky and the foam gleaming in lurid patches everywhere  the seas breaking in heavy masses on the pierhead drenched the two men as they bent their heads to resist the roaring blast  if it had been high water they could not have stood there for a moment  they had not been there long before their constant friend the master of the steamtug joined them  straining their eyes intently in the direction of the floatinglight which appeared like a little star tossed on the faroff horizon they observed a slight flash and then a thin curved line of red fire was seen to leap into the chaos of dark clouds  there she goes cried the coxswain  an no mistake said pike as they all ran to get ready for action  few and to the point were the words spoken  each man knew exactly what was to be done  there was no occasion to rouse the lifeboat men on such a night  the harbourmaster had seen the signal and clad in oilskins like the men was out among them superintending  the steamtug which lies at that pier with her fires lighted and banked up and her water hot all the year round sounded her shrill whistle and cast loose  her master and mate were old hands at the perilous work and lost no time for wreck like fire is fatally rapid  there was no confusion but there was great haste  the lifeboat was quickly manned  those who were most active got on the cork lifebelts and leaped in those who were less active or at a greater distance when the signal sounded had to remain behind  eleven stalwart men with frames inured to fatigue and cold clad in oiled suits and with lifebelts on sat on the thwarts of the lifeboat and the coxswain stood on a raised platform in her stern with the tillerropes in his hands  the masts were up and the sails ready to hoist  pike made fast the huge hawser that was passed to them over the stern of the steamtug and away they went rushing out right in the teeth of the gale  no cheer was giventhey had no breath to spare for sentimental service just then  there was no one save the harbourmaster and his assistant with a few men on duty to see them start for few could have ventured to brave the fury of the elements that night on the spraylashed pier in darkness they left into darkness most appalling they plunged with nothing save a stern sense of duty and the strong hope of saving human life to cheer them on their way    chapter seventeen  the battle  at first the men of the lifeboat had nothing to do but hold on to the thwarts with the exception of course of the coxswain whose energies were taxed from the commencement in the matter of steering the boat which was dragged through the waves at such a rate by the powerful tug that merely to hold on was a work of some difficulty  their course might much more truly be said to have been under than over the waves so constantly did these break into and fill the boat  but no sooner was she full than the discharging tubes freed her and she rose again and again buoyant as a cork  those who have not seen this desperate work can form but a faint conception of its true character  written or spoken words may conjure up a pretty vivid picture of the scene the blackness of the night and the heaving and lashing of the waves but words cannot adequately describe the shriek of the blast the hiss and roar of breakers and they cannot convey the feeling of the weight of tons of falling water which cause the stoutest crafts of human build to reel and quiver to their centres  the steamtug had not to contend with the ordinary straightforward rush of a north sea storm  she was surrounded and beset by great boiling whirlpools and spouting crossseas  they struck her on the bow on the side on the quarter on the stern  they opened as if to engulf her they rushed at as if to overwhelm her  they met under her thrusting her up and they leaped into her crushing her down  but she was a sturdy vessel a steady hand was at the wheel and her weatherbeaten master stood calm and collected on the bridge  it is probable that few persons who read the accounts of lifeboat service on the goodwin sands are aware of the importance of the duties performed and the desperate risks run by the steamtug  without her powerful engines to tow it to windward of the wrecks the lifeboat would be much very much less useful than it is  in performing this service the tug has again and again to run into shallow water and steer in the blackest nights amid narrow intricate channels where a slight error of judgment on the part of her mastera few fathoms more to the right or leftwould send her on the sands and cause herself to become a wreck and an object of solicitude to the lifeboat crew  honour to whom honour is due is a principle easy to state but not always easy to carry into practice  every time the steamtug goes out she runs her full share of the imminent risksometimes and in some respects as great as that of the lifeboat herself for whereas a touch upon the sand to which it is her duty to approach as near as possible would be the deathwarrant of the tug it is on the other hand the glorious prerogative of the lifeboat to be almost incapable of destruction and her peculiar privilege frequently to go slap on and right over the sands with slight damage though with great danger  that the deathwarrant just referred to has not been signed over and over again is owing almost entirely to the courage and skill of her master and mate who possess a thorough and accurate knowledge of the intricate channels soundings and tides of those dangerous shoals and have spent many years in risking their lives among them  full credit is usually given to the lifeboat though not too much by any means but there is not we think a sufficient appreciation of the services of the steamtug  she may be seen in the harbour any day modestly doing the dirty work of hauling out the dredgeboats while the gay lifeboat floats idly on the water to be pointed out and admired by summer visitorsthus unfairly though unavoidably are public favours often distributed  observe reader we are far from holding up these two as rivals  they are a loving brother and sister  comparatively little could be done in the grand work of saving human life without the mighty strength of the big brother and on the other hand nothing at all could be done without the buoyant activity and courage of the little sister observe also that although the lifeboat floats in idleness like a saucy little duck in time of peace her men like their mates in the big brother are hard at work like other honest folk about the harbour  it is only when the sands show their teeth and the floating lights send up their signals and the stormblast calls to action that the tug and boat unite and the men flinging down the implements of labour rise to the dignity of heroic work with all the pith and power and promptitude of heroes  as they ploughed through the foam together the tug was frequently obliged to easesteam and give herself time to recover from the shock of those heavy cross seas  suddenly a bright flaring light was observed in the vicinity of a shoal called the break which lies between the goodwins and the shore  it went out in a few seconds but not before the master of the tug had taken its bearings and altered his course  at the same time signalguns and rockets were observed both from the north sandhead lightvessel and the gull and several flaring lights were also seen burning on or near the goodwin sands  on nearing the middle break which was easily distinguishable from the surrounding turmoil by the intensity of its roar as the seas rolled over it the coxswain of the lifeboat ordered the sail to be hoisted and the towrope slipped  pike who was a thoroughly intelligent and sympathetic bowman had all in readiness he obeyed the order instantly and the boat as if endued with sudden life sprang away on its own account into the broken water  broken water who but a lifeboatman can conceive what that means except indeed those few who have been saved from wreck  a chaos of white water rendered ghostly and grey by darkness  no green or liquid water visible anywhere all froth and fury with force tremendous everywhere  rushing rivers met by opposing cataracts bursting against each other leaping high in air from the shock falling back and whirling away in wild eddiesseeking rest but finding none  vain indeed must be our attempt to describe the awful aspect the mad music the fearful violence of broken water on the break  in such a sea the boat was tossed as if she were a chip but the gale gave her speed and speed gave her quick steering power  she leaped over the foam or dashed through it or staggered under it but always rose again the men meanwhile holding on for life  pike was ready in the bow with an arm tightly embracing the bollard or strong post round which the cable runs  the coxswains figure towering high in the stern with the steering tackles in his hands leaned forward against a strong strap or band fixed across the boat to keep him in position  they made straight for the spot where the flare light had been seen  at first darkness and thick spray combined prevented them from seeing anything but in a few minutes a dark object was seen looming faintly against the sky and the coxswain observed with anxious concern that it lay not to leeward but to windward of him  out oars down with the sail he shouted  his voice was very powerful but it was swept away and was only heard by those nearest to him  the order was instantly obeyed however but the gale was so heavy and the boat so large that headway could not be made  they could see that the wreck was a small vessel on her beamends  being to leeward they could hear despairing cries distinctly and four or five human beings were seen clinging to the side  the lifeboatmen strained till their sinews wellnigh cracked it seemed doubtful whether they had advanced or not when suddenly an unusually large wave fell in thunder on the break it rushed over the shallows with a foaming head caught the boat on its crest and carried it far away to leeward  sail was again made  a box near the coxswain a feet was opened and a bluelight taken out  there was no difficulty in firing this  a sharp stroke on its butt lighted the percussion powder within and in a moment the scene was illumined by a ghastly glare which brought out the blue and white boat distinctly and gave corpselike colour to the faces of the men  at the same time it summoned the attendant steamer  in a few minutes the tug ran down to her the towrope was taken on board and away went the brother and sister once more to windward of the wreck but now no wreck was to be seen  they searched round the shoal in all directions without success and finally were compelled to come to the conclusion that the same sea which had carried the boat to leeward had swept the wreck away  with sad hearts they now turned towards the goodwins but the melancholy incident they had just witnessed was soon banished from their minds by the urgent signals for aid still seen flaring in all directions  for the nearest of these they made at full speed  on their way a dark object was seen to sweep past them across their stern as if on the wings of the wind  it was the broadstairs lifeboat which had already done good service that night and was bent on doing more  similarly occupied were the lifeboats of deal walmer and other places along the coast  a deal lugger was also seen  the hardy beachmen of kent fear no storm they run out in all weathers to succour ships in distress and much good service do they accomplish but their powers are limited  like the steamtugs they can hover around the sands in heavy gales and venture gingerly near to them but thus far and no farther may they go  they cannot like the noble lifeboats dash right into the caldron of surf and dare the sands and seas to do their worst  the lifeboat men felt cheered no doubt to know that so many able hands were fighting around them in the same battle but they had little time to think on such things the work in hand claimed their exclusive attentionas it must now claim ours  one vessel was seen burning three very large flare lights  towards this the steamer hastened and when as near as prudence would permit her to approach the goodwin sandssomething less than quarter of a milethe hawser was again slipped sail was made on the lifeboat and she once more entered the broken water alone  here of course being more exposed it was still more tremendous than on the break  it was a little after midnight when they reached the sands and made the discovery that they were on the wrong hide of them the tide was making however and in a short time there was sufficient water to enable the boat to run right over she struck many times but being tough received no serious damage  soon they drew near the wreck and could see that she had sunk completely and that the crew were clinging to the jibboom  when about fifty yards to windward the anchor was let go the lifeboat veered down towards the wreck and with much difficulty they succeeded in taking off the whole crew of seven men  signalising the tug with another bluelight they ran to leeward into deep water and were again taken in tow the saved men being with some difficulty put on board the tug  they were dutchmen and the poor master of the lost vessel could find no words sufficiently forcible to express his gratitude to the coxswain of the lifeboat  when he afterwards met him on shore he wrung his hand warmly and with tears in his eyes promised never to forget him  me never tinks of you said he meaning the reverse so longs i live me tell the king of holland  it is but just to add that the poor fellow faithfully redeemed his illexpressed promise and that the coxswain of the lifeboat now possesses a medal presented to him by the king of holland in acknowledgment of his services on that occasion  but the great work of that night still remained to be done  not far from the lightvessel a flarelight was seen burning brightly  it seemed to be well tended and was often renewed  towards this the tug now steered with the little sister in tow  they soon came near enough to observe that she was a large ship going to pieces on the sands  slipping the cable once more the lifeboat gallantly dashed into the thickest of the fight and soon got within hail of the wreck  then it was that for the first time a ray of hope entered the hearts of the passengers of the luckless wellington and then it was that jim welton and stanley hall with several young officers who had kept the tarbarrels burning so briskly for so many hours despite the drenching seas sent up a loud thrilling cheer and announced to the terrorstricken women and children that the lifeboat was in sight  what a cry for those who had been for three hours dashing on the sands expecting every moment that the ship would break up  the horrors of their situation were enhanced by the novelty of their sensations  all of us can realise to some extent from hearsay and from paintings what is meant by billows bursting high over ships mastheads and washing everything off the decks but who that has not experienced it can imagine what it is to see gigantic yards being whipped to and fro as a light cane might be switched by a strong man to see topmasts snapping like pipestems to hear stout ropes cracking like pliant whipcord and great sails flapping with thunderclaps or bursting into shreds  above all who can realise the sensation caused by ones abode being lifted violently with every surge and dropped again with the crashing weight of two thousand tons or being rolled from side to side so that the floor on which one stands alternates between the horizontal and perpendicular while ones frame each time receives a shock that is only too much in dread harmony with the desperate condition of the mind  the lifeboat in sight  who at such a time would not pray gods best blessing on the lifeboat on the stalwart men who man it and on the noble society which supports it  certain it is that many a prayer of this kind was ejaculated on board the wellington that night while the passengers reechoed the good news and hurriedly went on deck  but what an awful scene of dreary desolation presented itself when they got there  the flares gave forth just enough light to make darkness visibleropes masts yards sails everything in indescribable confusion and the sea breaking over all with a violence that rendered it extremely difficult to maintain a footing even in the most sheltered position  fortunately by this time the vessel had been beaten sufficiently high on the shoal to prevent the terrible rolling to which she had been at first subjected and as the officers and seamen vied with each other in attentions to the women and children these latter were soon placed in comparative security and awaited with breathless anxiety the arrival of the boat  in order to keep the flarelights burning all kinds of materials had been sacrificed  deluged as they were continually by heavy seas nothing but the most inflammable substances would burn  hence when their tarbarrels were exhausted stanley hall and his assistants got hold of sheets tablecloths bedding and garments and saturated these with paraffine oil of which fortunately there happened to be a large quantity on board  they now applied themselves with redoubled diligence to the construction and keeping alight of these flares knowing well that the work which remained to be done before all should be rescued was of a nature requiring time as well as care and courage  on rushed the lifeboat through the broken water  when almost within hail the coxswain heard the roar of an unusually heavy sea rushing behind him  let go the foresheet he shouted and hold on for your lives  the wavea billow broken to atoms yet still retaining all its weight and motive forceoverwhelmed the boat and passed on  before she had quite recovered another sea of equal size engulfed her and as she had been turned broadside on by the first the second caught her in its embrace and carried her like the wind bodily to leeward  her immense breadth of beam prevented an upset and she was finally launched into shallower water where the sand had only a few feet of sea above it she had been swept away full quarter of a mile in little more than a minute  here the surf was like a boiling caldron but there was not depth enough to admit of heavy seas  the same sea that swept away the boat carried the fore and main masts of the wellington by the board and extinguished all her lights  the boat drove quite two miles to leeward before the tug got hold of her again  to have returned to the wreck against wind and tide alone we need scarcely repeat would have been impossible but with the aid of the tug she was soon towed to her old position and again cast loose  once more she rushed into the fight and succeeded in dropping anchor a considerable distance to windward of the wreck from which point she veered down under her lee but so great was the mass of broken masts spars and wreckagenothing being now left but parts of the mizzen and bowspritthat the coxswain was obliged to pay out 117 fathoms of cable to keep clear of it all  the difficulty and danger of getting the boat alongside now became apparent to the people on the wreck many of whom had never dreamed of such impediments before and their hopes sank unreasonably low just as before they had been raised unduly high  with great difficulty the boat got near to the port quarter of the ship and pike stood up ready in the bow with a line to which was attached a loaded cane something like a large lifepreserver  heave shouted the coxswain  the bowman made a deliberate and splendid cast the weighted cane fell on the deck of the ship and was caught by jim welton who attached a hawser to it  this was drawn into the boat and in a few seconds she was alongside  but she was now in great danger  the wild waters that heaved surged and leaped under the vessels lee threatened to dash the boat in pieces against her every moment and it was only by the unremitting and strenuous exertions of the men with boathooks oars and fenders that this was prevented  now the boat surged up into the chains as if about to leap on board the ship anon it sank into a gulf of spray or sheered wildly to leeward but by means of the hawser and cable and a spring attached to the latter she was so handled that one and another of the crew of the wreck were taken into her  the first saved was a little child  it was too small and delicate to be swung over the side by a rope so the captain asked jim welton as being the most agile man in the ship and possessed of superabundant animal courage to take it in his arms and leap on board  jim agreed at once handed over the care of his flarelights to one of the men and prepared for action  the poor child which was about a year old clung to its mothers neck with terror and the distracted womana soldiers widow could scarce be prevailed on to let the little one out of her arms  oh let me go with him she pleaded most earnestly he is all that is left to me  you shall follow immediately delay may be death said the captain kindly as he drew the child gently but firmly from her grasp  it was securely bound to jims broad bosom by means of a shawl watching his opportunity when the boat came surging up on the crest of a billow almost to his feet and was about to drop far down into the trough of the sea the young sailor sprang from the side and was caught in the outstretched arms of the lifeboat men  it had occurred to stanley hall just before this happened that there was every probability of some of the passengers falling overboard during the process of being transferred to the boat  stanley was of a somewhat eccentric turn of mind and seldom allowed his thoughts to dissipate without taking action of some kind  he therefore got into the mizzen chains and quietly fastened a rope round his waist the other end of which he tied to a stanchion  youll get crushed by the boat there cried the captain who observed him  perhaps not was the reply  he stood there and watched jim welton as he leaped  the mother of the child unable to restrain herself climbed on the bulwarks of the vessel  just as she did so the boat surged up againso close that it required but a short step to get into her  some of the passengers availed themselves of the chancethe poor widow among them  she sprang with a cry of joy for she saw her childs face at the moment as they unbound him from jims breast but she sprang short  little wonder that a woman should neglect to make due allowance for the quick swooping of the boat  next moment she was in the boiling foam  a moment later and she was in stanley halls grasp and both were swept violently to leeward but the rope brought them up  despite darkness and turmoil the quickeyed coxswain and his mate had noted the incident  pike payed out the hawser the coxswain eased off the spring away went the boat and next moment pike had stanley by the hair  short was the time required for their strong arms to pull him and his burden inboard and oh it was a touching sight to witness the expressions of the anxious faces that were turned eagerly towards the boat and glared pale and ghastly in the flaring light as her sturdy crew hauled slowly up hand over hand and got once more under the vessels lee  no sooner were they within reach than another impatient passenger leaped overboard  this was jims faithful dog neptune  watching his time with the intelligence of a human being he sprang with much greater precision and vigour than any human being could have done and alighting on pikes shoulders almost drove that stout boatman into the bottom of the boat  soon the boat was as full as it could hold  all the women and children had been got into her and many of the male passengers so that there was no room to move still there remained from twenty to thirty people to be rescued  seeing this jim seized neptune by the neck and flung him back into the wreck  catching a rope that hung over the side he also swung himself on board sayingyou and i must sink or swim together nep  shove off lads and come back as soon as you can  the hawser was slipped as he spoke the lifeboat was hauled slowly but steadily to windward up to her anchor  tons of water poured over her every moment but ran through her discharging tubes and deeply loaded though she was she rose buoyant from each immersion like an invincible seamonster  when the anchor was reached a small portion of the foresail was set and then cutting the cable with one blow of a hatchet away they went like the scudding foam right over the boiling shallows on the spit of sand  hand out a bluelight there cried the coxswain  a sharp blow caused the bluefire to flare up and shed a light that fell strong as that of the full moon on the mingled grave pale stern and terrified faces in the lifeboat  safe muttered one of the crew  safe was echoed in surprise no doubt from several fluttering hearts  as well might that have been said to the hapless canoeman rushing over the falls of niagara as to the inexperienced ones there while they gazed horrorstruck on the tumult of mad waters in that sudden blaze of unearthly light  their faith in a trustworthy and intelligent boatman was not equal to their faith in their own eyes backed by ignorance  but who will blame them for lack of faith in the circumstances  nevertheless they were safe  the watchful master of the tuglayingto off the deadly banks now noting the compass now casting the lead anon peering into the wild stormsaw the light ran down to it took the rescued ones on board and having received from the coxswain the information that there were more coming sent them down into his little cabin there to be refreshed and comforted while the lifeboat sheered off again and once more sprang into the broken water  so might some mighty warrior spur from the battlefield charged with despatches of the highest import bearing on the fight and having delivered his message turn on his heel and rush back into the whirling tide of war to complete the victory which had been so well begun  once more they made for the wreck which was by that time fast breaking up  running right before the wind in such an awful gale it was necessary to make the men crowd aft in order to keep the boats head well out of the water  on this occasion one or two of the seamen of the wellington who had been allowed inadvertently to remain in the boat became alarmed for the seas were rolling high over the gunwale on each side and rushing into her with such force as to make it a difficult matter to avoid being washed out  it was a new sensation to these men to rush thus madly between two walls of foam eight or ten feet high they glanced backward where another wall of foaming water seemed to be curling over the stern as if about to drop inboard  the coxswain observed their looks and knew their feelings  he knew there was no lack of courage in them and that a little experience would change their minds on this point  never look behind lads he cried look ahead always look right ahead  ay geordy remarked one of the mena scotchmanto his mate its rum sailin this is  i thocht we was a gaun to the bottom but nae doot the coxn kens best  its a wonderfu boat  having so said the sedate scot dismissed his anxieties and thereafter appeared to regard the surrounding chaos of water with no other feelings than philosophic interest and curiosity  on nearing the wreck the second time it was found that the tide had fallen so low that they could scarcely get alongside  three times they struck on the shoal on the third occasion the mizzenmast and sail were blown out of the boat  they managed to drop anchor however and to veer down under the port bow of the wellington whence the anxious survivors threw ropes to them and one after another leaped or swung themselves into the boat  but they were so long about it that before all had been got out the coxswain was obliged to drop to leeward to prevent being left aground  in spite of this the boat got fast and now they could neither advance to the wreck for the nine men who still remained in her nor push off to rejoin the tug  the space between the boat and vessel was crossed by such a continuous rush of broken water that for a time it was impossible to attempt anything but as the tide fell the coxswain consulted with his bowman and both agreed to venture to wade to the wreck those on board having become so exhausted as to be unable or unwilling to make further effort to save themselves  acting on this resolve they with one of their men sprang into the raging surf and staggered to the wreck where they induced two of the crew to leap overboard and brought them safely to the boat  others of the lifeboat crew then joined them and four more were rescued  see note 1  the tide had been at its lowest when this desperate work was begun before it was finished it had turned  this coupled with the fact that they had all been nearly swept away during the last effort and that there was a fresh burst of violence in the gale induced them to wait until the tide should rise  when it did so sufficiently they hauled and shoved the boat alongside and the captain who was one of the three remaining men made a desperate spring but missed the boat and was whirled away  pike made a grasp at him but missed  the coxswain seized a lifebuoy and hurled it towards him  it fell within his reach and it was supposed that he had caught it but they could not be certain  the boat was now afloat and bumping violently  if they had cut the cable in order to rescue the captain which they could by no means make sure of doing the improbability of being able to return in time to save the two remaining men would have been very great  it seemed to be life or death in either case so they stuck by the wreck  it was grey dawn now and the wreckage was knocking against and around them to such an extent that the coxswain began to fear for the safety of his boat  yet he was loath to leave the men to perish  jump now lads he cried sheering up alongside its your last chance  its death to all of us if we stop longer here  the men sprang together  one gained the side of the boat and was saved the other was swept away  he made frantic efforts to gain the boat but before his companion had been got inboard he was out of sight and although the cable was promptly cut and the sail set he could not be found  the boat was then run down along the sands in search of the captain  the coxswain knew well from experience that he must certainly have been swept by the current in the same direction as the wreckage he therefore followed this and in a short time had the inexpressible satisfaction and good fortune to find the captain  he had caught the lifebuoy and having managed to get it under his arms had floated about for the greater part of an hour  though nearly dead he was still sensible and after being well chafed and refreshed with a little rum from the coxswains casebottleprovided for occasions of this sorthe recovered  the great work of the lifeboat had now been accomplished but they could not feel that it had been thoroughly completed without one more effort being made to save the lost man  they therefore ran still farther down the sand in the direction where he had been last seen  they followed the drift of wreckage as before  presently the bowman uttered a thrilling shout for through the turmoil of dashing spray he saw the man clinging to a spar  so unexpected was this happy event that the whole crew involuntarily gave vent to a ringing cheer although in the circumstances and considering the nature of their exhausting work and the time they had been exposed to it one might have supposed them incapable of such a burst of enthusiasm  in a few moments he was rescued and now with light hearts they ran for the tug which was clearly visible in the rapidly increasing daylight  they did not put off time in transferring the saved men to the steamer  the big hawsertheir familiar bond of attachmentwas made fast to them and away went that noble big brother and splendid little sister straight for ramsgate harbour  see note 2  but the work of that wild night was not yet finished  on their way home they fell in with a schooner the foretopmast and bowsprit of which were gone  as she was drifting towards the sands they hailed her  no reply being made the lifeboat was towed alongside and on being boarded it was found that she was a derelict  probably she had got upon the sands during the night been forsaken by her crew in their own boatin which event there was small chance of any being savedand had drifted off again at the change of the tide  be that as it might six lifeboat men were put on board  finding no water in her they slipt her two cables which were hanging from the bow a rope was made fast to the steamer and she was taken in tow  it was drawing towards noon when they neared the harbour  very different indeed was the aspect of things there then from what it had been when they went out on their errand of mercy thirteen hours before although the gale was still blowing fresh it had moderated greatly  the black clouds no longer held possession of the sky but were pierced scattered and gilded as they were rolled away by the victorious sun the sea still raged and showed its white teeth fiercely as if its spirit had been too much roused to be easily appeased but blue sky appeared in patches everywhere the rain had ceased and the people of the town and visitors swarmed out to enjoy the returning sunshine inhale the fresh seabreeze and await anxiously the return of the lifeboatfor of course every one in the town was aware by that time that she had been out all night  when at length the smoke of the big brother was observed drawing near the people flocked in hundreds to the piers and cliffswherever a point of vantage was to be had dozens of spectators crowned it wherever a point of danger was to be gained daring spiritschiefly in the shape of small boystook it by storm in absolute contempt of the police  jacobs ladderthe cliff staircasewas crowded from top to bottom  the west pier was rendered invisible to its outer extremity by human beings  the east pier as far as it was dry was covered by the fashion and beautyas well as by the fishy and tarryof the town beyond the point of dryness it was more or less besieged by those who were reckless riotous and ridiculously fond of saltwater spray  the yards and shrouds of the crowded and much damaged shipping in the harbour were manned and the windows of the town that commanded the sea were filled with human faces  an absolute battery of telescopes like small artillery was levelled at the approaching tug  everywhere were to be seen and heard evidences of excitement anxiety and expectation  it was not long before it was announced that flags were seen flying at the mastheads of the tug and lifeboata sure evidence that a rescue had been successfully accomplished  this caused many a burst of cheering from the crowds as the fact and its import became gradually known  but these were as nothing compared with the cheers that arose when the steamer with the lifeboat and the schooner in tow drew near and it could be seen that there were many people on boardamong them women and children  when they finally surged past the pierhead on the crest of a tremendous billow and swept into the harbour under a vast shower of spray that burst over the pier and rose above the mastheads of the shipping withinas if to pour a libation on the gallant crews then a succession of cheers that cannot be described welcomed the victors and reechoed from the chalkcliffs to be caught up and sent out again and again in thrilling cadence on the mad sea which had thus been plundered of its booty and disappointed of its prey  scarfs and hats and kerchiefs and hands were waved in wild enthusiasm strangely mingled with tender pity when the exhausted women and children and the wornout and battered lifeboatmen were landed  many cheered no doubt to think of the strong hearts and invincible courage that dwelt in the breasts of britains sons while otherstracing things at once to their true sourcecheered in broken tones or were incompetent to cheer at all when they thought with thankfulness of britains faith in the word of god which directly or indirectly had given that courage its inspiration and filled those hearts with fire    note 1  the coxswainmr isaac jarmanwho has rendered heroic service in the ramsgate lifeboat during the last ten years has been personally instrumental in saving between four and five hundred lives    note 2  if the reader should desire to know something more of the history of the celebrated ramsgate lifeboat which owing to its position opportunities and advantages has had the most stirring career of all the lifeboat fleet we advise the perusal of a work at present in the press if it be not already published named storm warriors or the ramsgate lifeboat and the goodwin sands by the reverend john gilmore whose able and thrilling articles on the lifeboatservice in macmillans magazine are well known    chapter eighteen  shows that there are no effects without adequate causes  there were not a few surprising and unexpected meetings that day on ramsgate pier  foremost among the hundreds who pressed forward to shake the lifeboatmen by the hand and to sympathise with and congratulate the wrecked and rescued people was mr george durant  it mattered nothing to that stout enthusiast that his hat had been swept away into hopeless destruction during his frantic efforts to get to the front leaving his polished head exposed to the still considerable fury of the blast and the intermittent violence of the sun and it mattered if possible still less that the wreck turned out to be one of his own vessels but it was a matter of the greatest interest and amazement to him to find that the first man he should meet in the crowd and seize in a hearty embrace was his young friend stanley hall  what stanney he exclaimed in unmitigated surprise is itcan it be  prodigious sight  the old gentleman could say no more but continued for a few seconds to wring the hands of his young friend gaze in his face and vent himself in gusts of surprise and bursts of tearful laughter to the great interest and amusement of the bystanders  mr durants inconsistent conduct may be partly accounted for and excused by the fact that stanley had stepped on the pier with no other garments on than a pair of trousers and a shirt the former having a large rent on the right knee and the latter being torn open at the breast in consequence of the violent removal of all the buttons when its owner was dragged into the lifeboat  as in addition to this the young mans dishevelled hair did duty for a cap and his face and hands were smeared with oil and tar from the flarelights which he had assisted to keep up so energetically it is not surprising that the first sight of him had a powerful effect on mr durant  why stanney he said at length you look as if you were some strange seamonster just broke loose from neptunes menagerie  perhaps this idea had been suggested by the rope round stanleys waist the cut end of which still dangled at his side for mr durant took hold of it inquiringly  ay sir put in the coxswain who chanced to be near him that bit of rope is a scarf of honour  he saved the life of a soldiers widow with it  there was a tendency to cheer on the part of the bystanders who heard this  god bless you stanney my boy  come and get dressed said the old gentleman suddenly seizing his friends arm and pushing his way through the crowd come along oh dont talk to me of the ship  i know that its lost no matteryou are saved  and do you come along with us welwelwhats the name of   ah  weltoncome my daughter is here somewhere  i left her near the parapet  never mind she knows her way home  katie certainly was there and when over the heads of the peoplefor she had mounted with characteristic energy on the parapet assisted by queeker and accompanied by fanny henningsshe beheld stanley hall in such a plight she felt a disposition to laugh and cry and faint all at once  she resisted the tendency however although the expression of her face and her rapid change of colour induced queeker with anxious haste to throw out his arms to catch her  ha exclaimed queeker i knew it  what queeker knew he never explained  it may have had reference to certain suspicions entertained in regard to the impression made by the young student on katie the night of their first meeting we cannot tell but we know that he followed up the exclamation with the muttered remark it was fortunate that i pulled up in time  herein queeker exhibited the innate tendency of the human heart to deceive itself  that furious little poetical foxhunter had by his own confession felt the pangs of a guilty conscience in turning just because he could not help it from katie to fanny yet here he was now basely and coolly taking credit to himself for having pulled up in time  oh look at the dear little children exclaimed fanny pointing towards a part of the crowd where several seamen were carrying the rescued and still terrified little ones in their strong arms while others assisted the women along and wrapped dry shawls round them  how dreadful to think said katie making a hard struggle to suppress her agitation that all these would have been lost but for the lifeboat and how wonderful to think that some of our own friends should be among them  ay there be many more besides these saved last night miss remarked a sturdy old boatman who chanced to be standing beside her  all along the east coast the lifeboats has bin out miss you may be sure and they dont often shove off without bringin somethin back to show for their pains though they dont all ave steamers for to tug em out theres the broadstairs boat now ive jist heerd she was out all night an saved fifteen lives an the walmer and deal boats has fetched in a lot i believe though we hant got particklers yet  besides those whom we have mentioned as gazing with the crowd at the arrival of the lifeboat morley jones and nora and billy towler were there  jones and billy had returned from london together the night before the storm and like nearly every one else in the town had turned out to witness the arrival of the lifeboat  dick moy also was there and that huge lump of goodnature spent the time in making sagacious remarks and wise comments on wind and weather wrecks and rescues in a manner that commanded the intense admiration of a knot of visitors who happened to be near him and who regarded him as a choice specimena sort of typeof the british son of neptune  this is wot i says observed dick while the people were landing so long as theres ope old on  never say die and never give in thems my sentiments  cause why no one never knows wot may turn up  if your ship goes down wy wot then  strike out to be sure  praps you may be picked up afore long  if sharks is near praps you may be picked down  you can never tell  if you gets on a shoal wot then wy stick to the ship till a lifeboat comes off to ee  dont never go for to take to your own boats  if you docapsize an davy joness locker is the word  if the lifeboat cant git alongside wy wait till it can if it cant wy it can only be said that it couldnt  no use cryin over spilt milk you know  not that i cares for milk  it dont keep at sea dye see ans only fit for babbys  if the lifeboat capsizes wy then owin to her parfection o build she rights again an you avin on cork jackets praps gits into er by the lifelines all handy  if you avent got no cork jackets on wy them that hasll pick ee up  if not its like enough youll go down  but no matter youve did yer best an man woman or child can do no more  you can only die once dye see  whether the admiring audience did or did not see the full force of these remarks they undoubtedly saw enough in the gigantic tar to esteem him a marvel of philosophic wisdom  judging by their looks that he was highly appreciated it is just possible that dick moy might have been tempted to extend his discourse had not a move in the crowd showed a general tendency towards dispersion the rescued people having been removed some to the sailors home others to the residences of hospitable people in the town  now it must not be imagined that all these characters in our tale have been thus brought together merely at our pleasure without rhyme or reason and in utter disregard of the law of probabilities  by no means  mr robert queeker had started for ramsgate as the reader knows on a secret mission which as is also well known was somewhat violently interrupted by the sporting tendencies of that poetical lawclerk but no sooner did queeker recover from his wounds thanwith the irresistible ardour of a wellington or a blucher or a bulldog or a boardingschool bellehe returned to the charge made out his intended visit set his traps baited his lines fastened his snares and whatever else appertained to his secret mission so entirely to the satisfaction of messrs merryheart and dashope that these estimable men resolved some time afterwards to send him back again to the scene of his labours to push still further the dark workings of his mission elate with success the earnest queeker prepared to go  oh what joy if she would only go with him  and why not cried queeker starting up when this thought struck him as if it had struck him too hard and he were about to retaliatewhy not  that is the question  he emphasised that as if all other questions hamlets included sank into insignificance by contrast  only last night continued queeker to himself still standing bolt upright in a frenzy of inspiration and running his fingers fiercely through his hair so as to make it stand bolt upright tooonly last night i heard old durant say he could not make up his mind where to go to spend the autumn this year  why not ramsgate why not ramsgate    its chalky cliffs and yellow sand   and rides and walks and weather   its windows which a view command   of everything together    its pleasant walks and pretty shops   to fascinate the belles   its foaming waves like washingslops   to captivate the swells    its boats and boatmen brave and true   who lounge upon the jetty   and smile upon the girls too   at least when they are pretty    oh  ramsgate where in all the earth   beside the lovely sea   can any town of note or worth   be found to equal thee  nowhere said queeker bringing his fist down on the table with a force that made the ink leap when he had finished these versesverses however which cost him two hours and a profuse perspiration to produce  it was exactly a quarter to eight pm by the yarmouth customhouse clock due allowance being made for variation when this nowhere was uttered and it was precisely a quarter past nine pm that day week when the durants drove up to the door of the fortress hotel in ramsgate and ordered beds and teaso powerful was the influence of a great mind when brought to bear on fanny hennings who exercised irresistible influence over the goodnatured katie whose power over her indulgent father was absolute  not less natural was the presence in ramsgate of billy towler  we have already mentioned that for peculiarly crooked ends of his own morley jones had changed his abode to ramsgatehis country abode that is  his headquarters and town department continued as before to flourish in gravesend in the form of a publichouse which had once caught fire at a time strange to say when the spirit and beer casks were all nearly empty a curious fact which the proprietor alone was aware of but thought it advisable not to mention when he went to receive the 200 pounds of insurance which had been effected on the premises a few weeks before  it will thus be seen that mr joness assurance in the matter of dealing with insurance was considerable  having taken up his temporary abode then in ramsgate and placed his mother and daughter therein as permanent residents mr jones commenced such a close investigation as to the sudden disappearance of his ally billy that he wormed out of the unwilling but helpless nora not only what had become of him but the name and place of his habitation having accomplished this he dressed himself in a blue nautical suit with brass buttons took the morning train to london and in due course presented himself at the door of the grotto where he requested permission to see the boy towler  the request being granted he was shown into a room and billy was soon after let in upon him  hallo young walleye why what ever has come over you he exclaimed in great surprise on observing that billys face was clean in which condition he had never before seen it and his hair brushed an extraordinary novelty and most astonishing of all that he wore unragged garments  billy who although outwardly much altered had apparently lost none of his hearty ways and sharp intelligence stopped short in the middle of the room thrust both hands deep into his trousers pockets opened his eyes very wide and gave vent to a low prolonged whistle  what game may you be up to he said at the end of the musical prelude  you are greatly improved billy said jones holding out his hand  im not aweer replied the boy drawing back as ive got to thank you for it  come billy this aint friendly is it after all ive done for you said jones remonstratively i only want you to come out an ave a talk with me about things an ill give ee a swig o beer or whatever you take a fancy to  you aint goin to show the white feather and become a milksop are you  now look here mister jones said the boy with an air of decision that there was no mistaking as he retreated nearer to the door i dont want for to have nothin more to do with you  ive seed much more than enough of ee  you knows me pretty well an you knows that wotiver else i may be i aint a hippercrite  i knows enough o your doins to make you look pretty blue if i like but for reasons of my own wot youve got nothink to do with i dont mean to peach  all i ax is that you goes your way an let me alone  thats where it is  the people here seem to ave got a notion that ive got a soul as well as a body and that it aint xactly sitch a worthless thing as to be never thought of and throwd away like an old shoe  they may be wrong and they may be right but im inclined to agree with em  let me tell ee that you ave did more than anybody else to show me the evil of wicked ways so you neednt stand there grinnin like a rackishoot wi the toothache  ive jined the band of hope too so i dont want none o your beer nor nothin else an if you offers to lay hands on me ill yell out like a shespurtindeel an bring in the guvnor wots fit to wollop six o you any day with his left hand  this last part of billys speech was made with additional fire in consequence of morley jones taking a step towards him in anger  well boy he said sternly hypocrite or not youve learned yer lesson pretty pat so you may do as you please  its little that a chip like you could do to get me convicted on anything youve seen or heard as yet an if ye did succeed it would only serve to give yourself a lift on the way to the gallows  but it wasnt to trouble myself about you and your wishes that i came here for the wily rascal assumed an air and tone of indifference at this point if you had only waited to hear what id got to say before you began to spit fire you might have saved your breath  the fact is that my nora is very illso ill that i fear she stands a poor chance o gittin better  im goin to send her away on a long sea voyage  praps that may do her good if not its all up with her  she begged and prayed me so earnestly to come here and take you down to see her before she goes that i could not refuse her particularly as i happened to have business in london anyhow  if id known how you would take it i would have saved myself the trouble of comin  however ill bid you goodday now  jones said the boy earnestly thats a lie  very good retorted the man putting on his hat carelessly ill take back that message with your complimentseh  no but said billy almost whimpering with anxiety is nora really ill  i dont wish you to come if you dont want to replied jones you can stop here till doomsday for me  but do you suppose id come here for the mere amusement of hearing you give me the lie  ill go said billy with as much emphasis as he had previously expressed on declining to go  the matter was soon explained to the manager of the grotto  mr jones was so plausible and gave such unexceptionable references that it is no disparagement to the penetration of the superintendent of that day to say that he was deceived  the result was as we have shown that billy ere long found his way to ramsgate  when mr jones introduced him ceremoniously to nora he indulged in a prolonged and hearty fit of laughter  nora gazed at billy with a look of intense amazement and billy stared at nora with a very mingled expression of countenance for he at once saw through the deception that had been practised on him and fully appreciated the difficulty of his positionhis powers of explanation being hampered by a warning given him long ago by his friend jim welton that he must be careful how he let nora into the full knowledge of her fathers wickedness    chapter nineteen  confidences and cross purposes  katie durant sitting with a happy smile on her fair face and goodwill in her sweet heart to all mankindwomankind included which says a good deal for herwas busy with a beautiful sketch of a picturesque watermill meditating on the stirring scene she had so recently witnessed when a visitor was announced  who can it be inquired katie papa is out you know and no one can want me  the lodginghouse keeper mrs cackles smiled at the idea of no one wanting katie knowing as she did that there were at least twenty people who would have given all they were worth in the world to possess her either in the form of wife sister daughter friend governess or companion  well miss she do wants you and says as no one else will do  oh a lady please show her in mrs cackles  well she aint a lady either though ive seen many a lady as would give their weight in gold to be like her  so saying the landlady departed and in a few seconds introduced nora  miss jones cried katie rising with a pleased smile and holding out her hand this is a very unexpected pleasure  thank you miss durant  i felt sure you would remember me said nora taking a seat and i also feel sure that you will assist me with your advice in a matter of some difficulty especially as it relates to the boy about whose sick brother you came to me at yarmouth some time ago you remember  oh  billy towler exclaimed katie with animation yes i remember you are right in expecting me to be interested in him  let me hear all about it  hereupon nora gave katie an insight into much of billy towlers history especially dwelling on that part of it which related to his being sent to the grotto in the hope of saving him from the evil influences that were brought to bear upon him in his intercourse with her father  not she said somewhat anxiously that i mean you to suppose my dear father teaches him anything that is wicked but his business leads him much among bad menandthey drink and smoke you know which is very bad for a young boy to see and many of them are awful swearers  now poor billy has been induced to leave the grotto and to come down here for what purpose i dont know but i am so disappointed because i had hoped he would not have got tired of it so soon and what distresses me most is that he does not speak all his mind to me i can see that for he is very fond of me and did not use to conceal things from meat least i fancied not  the strange thing about it too is that he says he is willing to return to the grotto immediately if i wish it  i am very very sorry to hear all this said katie with a troubled air but what do you propose to do and how can i assist youonly tell me and i shall be so happy to do it if it be in my power  i really dont know how to put it to you dear miss durant and i could not have ventured if you had not been so very kind when i met you in yarmouth butbut your father owns several vessels i believe and andyou will excuse me referring to it i knowhe was so good as to get a situation on board of the wellingtonwhich has so unfortunately been wreckedfor a youngaa youngman one of those who was saved  yes yes said katie quickly thinking of stanley hall and blushing scarlet i know the young gentleman to whom you refer well go on  well continued nora thinking of jim welton and blushing scarlet too that young man said to me that he felt sure if i were to make application to mr durant through you he would give billy a situation in one of his ships and so get him out of harms way  he was right said katie with a somewhat puzzled expression and you may rely on my doing what i can for the poor boy with papa who is always happy to help in such cases but i was not aware that mr hall knew either you or billy  mr hall exclaimed nora in surprise  did you not refer to him just now  no miss i meant james welton  oh exclaimed katie prolonging that monosyllable in a sliding scale ranging from low to high and back to low again which was peculiarly suggestive i beg your pardon i quite misunderstood you well you may tell mr welton that i will befriend billy to the utmost of my power  the door opened as she spoke and cousin fanny entered  katie ive come to tell you that mr queek she stopped short on observing nora who rose hastily thanked katie earnestly for the kind interest she had expressed in her little friend and took her leave  this is a very interesting little incident fan said katie with delight when they were alone quite a romancelet of real life  let me see here is a poor boythe boy who deceived us you rememberwhom bad companions are trying to decoy into the wicked meshes of their dreadful net and a sweet young girl a sort of guardian angel as it were comes to me and asks my aid to save the boy and have him sent to sea  isnt it delightful  quite the groundwork of a taleand might be so nicely illustrated added katie glancing at her drawings  but forgive me fan i interrupted you  what were you going to tell me  only that mr queeker cannot come to tea tonight as he has business to attend to connected with his secret mission replied fanny  how interesting it would be said katie musing if we could only manage to mix up this mission of mr queekers in the plot of our romance wouldnt it  come i will put away my drawing for today and finish the copy of papas quarterly cashaccount for those dreadful board of trade people then we shall go to the pier and have a walk and on our way we will call on that poor old bedridden woman whom papa has ferreted out and give her some tea and sugar  isnt it strange that papa should have discovered one so soon  i suppose you are aware of his penchant for old women fan  no i was not aware of it said fan smiling  whatever fan said she accompanied with a smile  indeed a smile was the necessary result of the opening of her little mouth for whatever purposenot an affected smile but a merry onewhich always had the effect her face being plump of half shutting her eyes  yes continued katie with animation papa is so fond of old women particularly if they are very old and very little and thin they must be thin though  i dont think he cares much for them if they are fat  he says that fat people are so jolly that they dont need to be cared for but he dotes upon the little thin ones  fanny smiled and observed that that was curious  so it is observed katie now my taste lies in the direction of old men  i like to visit poor old men much better than poor old women and the older and more helpless they are the more i like them  fanny smiled again and observed that that was curious too  so it is said katie very odd that papa should like the old women and i should like the old men but so it is  now fan well get ready andoh how provoking  that must be another visitor  people find papa out so soon wherever we go and then they give him no rest  a boy wishes to see you miss said mrs cackles  me exclaimed katie in surprise  yes miss and he says he wants to see you alone on important business  katie looked at fanny and smiled  fanny returned the smile and immediately left the room  show him in mrs cackles  the landlady withdrew and ushered in no less a personage than billy towler himself who stopped at the door and stood with his hat in his hand and an unusually confused expression in his looks  please miss said billy you knows me i think  katie admitted that she knew him and knowing in her heart that she meant to befriend him it suddenly occurred to her that it would be well to begin with a little salutary severity by way of punishment for his former misdeeds  last time i saw you miss i did you said billy with a slight grin  you did replied katie with a slight frown and i hope you have come to apologise for your naughty conduct  well i cant xactly say as i have come to do that but i dessay i may as well begin that way  im very sorry miss for havin did you an ive called now to see if i cant do you again  katie could not restrain a laugh at the impudence of this remark but she immediately regretted it because billy took encouragement and laughed too she therefore frowned with intense severity and still remembering that she meant ultimately to befriend the boy resolved to make him in the meantime feel the consequences of his former misdeeds  come boy she said sharply dont add impertinence to your wickedness but let me know at once what you want with me  billy was evidently taken aback by this rebuff  he looked surprised and did not seem to know how to proceed  at length he put strong constraint upon himself and said in rather a gruff tone  well miss iathe fact isyou know a gal named nora jones dont you  anyhow she knows you an has said to me so often that you was a parfect angel thatthat  that you came to see interrupted katie glancing at her shoulders whether i really had wings or not eh  katie said this with a still darker frown for she thought that the urchin was jesting  nothing was further from his intention  knowing this and not finding the angelic looks and tones which he had been led to expect billy felt still more puzzled and inclined to be cross  seems to me that theres a screw loose somewheres said billy scratching the point of his nose in his vexation  howsever i came here to ax your advice and although you cernly dont ave wings nor the style o looks wots usual in eavenly wisiters ill make a clean breast of itso here goes  hereupon the poor boy related how he had been decoyed from the grotto of which establishment he gave a graphic and glowing accountand said that he was resolved to have nothing more to do with morley jones but meant to return to the grotto without delaythat evening if possible he had a difficulty however which was that he could not speak freely to nora about her father for fear of hurting her feelings or enlightening her too much as to his true character in regard to which she did not yet know the worst  one evil result of this was that she had begun to suspect there was something wrong as to his own affection for herselfwhich was altogether a mistake  billy made the last remark with a flush of earnest indignation and a blow of his small hand on his diminutive knee  he then said that another evil result was that he could not see his way to explain to nora why he wished to be off in such a hurry and worst of all he had not a sixpence in the world wherewith to pay his fare to london and had no means of getting one  and so said katie still keeping up her fictitious indignation you come to beg money from me  not to beg missto borrer  ah and thus to do me a second time said katie  it must not be supposed that katies sympathetic heart had suddenly become adamantine  on the contrary she had listened with deep interest to all that her youthful visitor had to say and rejoiced in the thought that she had given to her such a splendid opportunity of doing good and frustrating evil but the little spice of mischief in her character induced her still to keep up the fiction of being suspicious in order to give billy a salutary lesson  in addition to this she had not quite got over the supposed insult of being mistaken for an angel  she therefore declined in the meantime to advance the required sum tenandsixpencealthough the boy earnestly promised to repay her with his first earnings  no she said with a gravity which she found it difficult to maintain i cannot give you such a sum until i have seen and consulted with my father on the subject but i may tell you that i respect your sentiments regarding nora and your intention to forsake your evil ways  if you will call here again in the evening i will see what can be done for you  saying this and meditating in her heart that she would not only give billy the tenandsixpence to enable him to return to the grotto but would induce her father to give him permanent employment in one of his ships she showed billy to the door and bade him be a good boy and take care of himself  thereafter she recalled fanny and for her benefit reenacted the whole scene between herself and billy towler in a manner so graphic and enthusiastic as to throw that amiable creature into convulsions of laughter which bade fair to terminate her career in a premature fit of juvenile apoplexy    chapter twenty  mysterious doings  disappointed displeased and sorely puzzled billy towler took his way towards the harbour with his hands thrust desperately into his pockets and an unwonted expression of discontent on his countenance  so deeply did he take the matter to heart that he suffered one small boy to inquire pathetically if ed bin long in that state o grumps and another to suggest that if e couldnt be appier than that ed better go an drown hisself without vouchsafing a retort or even a glance of recognition  passing the harbour he went down to the beach and there unexpectedly met with mr morley jones  hallo my young bantam exclaimed morley with a look of surprise  well old cochinchina wots up replied billy in a gruff tone drunk as usual i see  being somewhat desperate the boy did not see or did not mind the savage glance with which mr jones favoured him  the glance was however exchanged quickly for an idiotic smile as he retorted  well i aint so drunk but i can see to steer my course lad  come ive got a noo boat what dye say to go an have a sail  the fact is billy i was just on my way up to the house to ax you to go with me so its good luck that i didnt miss you  will ee go lad  at any other time the boy would have refused but his recent disappointment in regard to the angelic nature of katie still rankled so powerfully in his breast that he swung round and saidget along thenim your manits all up nownever say diein for a penny in for a pound and a variety of similar expressions all of which tended to convince mr jones that billy towler happened to be in a humour that was extremely suitable to his purposes  he therefore led him towards his boat which he said was lying on the beach at broadstairs all ready to shove off  the distance to broadstairs was about two miles and the walk thither was enlivened by a drunken commentary on the fallacy of human hopes in general on the part of mr jones and a brisk fire of caustic repartee on the part of master towler  a close observer might have noticed that while these two were passing along the beach at the base of the high cliffs of chalk running between ramsgate and broadstairs two heads were thrust cautiously out of one of the small caverns or recesses which have been made in these cliffs by the action of the waves  the one head bore a striking resemblance to that of robert queeker esquire and the other to that of mr larks  how these two came to be together and to be there it is not our business to say  authors are fortunately not bound to account for everything they relate  all that we know is that mr queeker was there in the furtherance probably of his secret mission and that mr larks missions appeared to be always more or less secret  at all events there they were together fellowstudents apparently of the geology or conchology of that region if one might judge from the earnest manner in which they stooped and gazed at the sands and picked up bits of flint or small shells over which they held frequent and no doubt learned discussions of an intensely engrossing nature  it might have been also noticed by a close observer that these stoopings to pick up specimens and these stoppages to discuss invariably occurred when mr jones and master billy chanced to pause or to look behind them  at last the boat was reached  it lay on the beach not far from the small harbour of broadstairs already surrounded by the rising tide  about the same time the geological and conchological studies of messrs queeker and larks coming to an end these scientific men betook themselves suddenly to the shelter of a small cave whence they sat watching with intense interest the movements of the man and boy thus proving themselves gifted with a truly baconian spirit of general inquiry into simple facts with a view to future inductions  jump in billy said jones and dont wet your feet i can easily shove her off alone  billy obeyed  hallo wot have ee got here he cried touching a large tarpaulin bag with his foot  only some grub answered jones putting his shoulder to the bow of the boat  and a compass too cried billy looking round in surprise  ay it may come on thick you know said jones as the boats keel grated over the sand  i say stop cried billy youre up to some mischief come let me ashore  mr jones made no reply but continued to push off the boat  seeing this the boy leaped overboard but jones caught him  for one instant there was a struggle then poor billy was lifted in the strong mans arms and hurled back into the boat  next moment it was afloat and jones leaped inboard  billy was not to be overcome so easily however he sprang up and again made a leap over the gunwale but jones caught him by the collar and after a severe struggle dragged him into the boat and gave him a blow on the head with his clenched fist which stunned him  then seizing the oars he pulled off  after getting well away from the beach he hoisted a small lugsail and stood out to sea  all this was witnessed by the scientific men in the cave through a couple of small pockettelescopes which brought the expression of joness and billys countenances clearly into view  at first mr queeker with poetic fervour started up intent on rushing to the rescue of the oppressed but mr larks with prosaic hardness of heart held him forcibly back and told him to make his mind easy adding that mr jones had no intention of doing the boy any further harm  whereupon queeker submitted with a sigh  the two friends then issued from the cave shook hands and bade each other goodbye with a laughthe man with the keen grey eyes following the path that led to broadstairs while the lawyers clerk returned to ramsgate by the beach  meanwhile the sun went down and the lanterns of the goodwin the gull and the south sandhead floating lights went up  the shades of evening fell and the stars came outone by one at first then by twos and threes at last by bursts of constellations until the whole heavens glowed with a galaxy of distant worlds  during all this time mr jones sat at the helm of his little boat and held steadily out to sea  the wind being light he made small progress but that circumstance did not seem to trouble him much  youd better have a bit supper lad said jones in a careless way of course youre welcome to starve yourself if ee choose but by so doin youll only make yourself uncomfortable for nothing  youre in for it now an cant help yourself  billy was seated on one of the thwarts looking very savage with his right eye nearly closed by the blow which had caused him to succumb  praps i maynt be able to help myself he replied but i can peach upon you anyhow  so you can my lad if you want to spend eight or ten years in limbo retorted jones spitting out his quid of tobacco and supplying its place with a new one  you and i are in the same boat billy whether ashore or afloat we sink or swim together  no more was said for some time  jones knew that the boy was in his power and resolved to bide his time  billy felt that he had at least the chance of being revenged if he chose to sacrifice himself so he nursed his wrath to keep it warm  about an hour afterwards a squall struck the boat and nearly capsized it but jones who was quite sobered by that time threw her head quickly into the wind and billy forgetting everything else leaped up with his wonted activity loosened the sail and reefed it  the squall soon passed away and left them almost becalmed as before  that was well done billy said jones in a cheerful tone youd make a smart sailor my lad  billy made no reply and despite his efforts to the contrary felt highly flattered  he also felt the pangs of hunger and after resisting them for some time resolved to eat as it were under protest  with a reckless wilful air therefore he opened the tarpaulin bag and helped himself to a large hunk of bread and a piece of cheese  whereupon mr jones smiled grimly and remarked that there was nothing like grub for giving a man heartexcept grog he added producing a casebottle from his pocket and applying it to his mouth  have a pull lad  no well please yourself  i aint goin to join the temperance move myself yet said jones replacing the bottle in his pocket  the short squall having carried the boat nearer to the gull lightship than was desirable mr jones tried to keep as far off from her as possible while the tide should sweep them past but the wind having almost died away he did not succeed in this however he knew that darkness would prevent recognition so he thought it best not to take to the oars but to hold on intending to slip quietly by not supposing that billy would think it of any use to hail the vessel but billy happened to think otherwise  gull ahoy hoy he shouted at the top of his shrill voice  boat ahoy responded jack shales who happened to be on duty but no response was given to jack for the good reason that jones had instantly clapped his hand on billys mouth and halfchoked him  thats odd remarked jack after repeating his cry twice  i could swear it was the voice of that sharp little rascal billy towler  if it wasnt it was his ghost replied jerry macgowl who chanced to be on deck at the time  sure enough its very ghostlike said shales as the boat glided silently and slowly out of the circle of the lanterns light and faded from their vision  mr jones did not follow up his act with further violence  he merely assured billy that he was a foolish fellow and that it was of no use to struggle against his fate  as time wore on poor billy felt dreadfully sleepy and would have given a good deal for some of the grog in his companions casebottle but resolving to stand upon his dignity would not condescend to ask for it at length he lay down and slept and jones covered him with a pilotcoat  no soft spot in the scoundrels heart induced him to perform this act of apparent kindness  he knew the poor boys temperament and resolved to attack him on his weakest point  when billy awoke the day was just breaking  he stretched himself yawned sat up and looked about him with the confused air of one not quite awake  hallo he cried gaily where on earth am i  you aint on earth lad youre afloat replied jones who still sat at the helm  at once the boy remembered everything and shrank within himself  as he did so he observed the pilotcoat which covered him and knew that it must have been placed where it was by jones  his resolution to hold out was shaken still he did not give in  mr jones now began to comment in a quiet goodnatured way upon the weather and the prospects of the voyage which excited billys curiosity very much and suggested that breakfast would not be a bad thing and that a drop o rum might be agreeable but took care never to make his remarks so pointed as to call for an answer  just as the sun was rising he got up slowly cast loose the stays and halyards of mast and sail lifted the mast out of its place and deliberately hove the whole affair overboard remarking in a quiet tone that having served his purpose he didnt want mast or sail any longer  in the same deliberate way he unshipped the rudder and cast it away  he followed this up by throwing overboard one of the oars and then taking the only remaining oar he sculled and steered the boat therewith gently  billy who thought his companion must be either drunk or mad could contain himself no longer  i say old fellow he remarked youre comin it pretty strong  wot on earth are you up to and where in all the world are ee goin to  oh come you know answered jones in a remonstrative tone i may be an easygoin chap but i cant be expected to tell all my secrets except to friends  well well said billy with a sigh its no use tryin to hold out ill be as friendly as i can only  i tells you candid ill mizzle whenever i gits ashore  im not agoin to tell no end o lies to please you any longer so i give ee fair warning said billy stoutly  all right my lad said the wily jones who felt that having subdued the boy thus far he would have little difficulty in subduing him still further in course of time and by dint of judicious treatment i dont want ee to tell lies on my account an ill let you go free as soon as ever we get ashore  so now lets shake hands over it and have a glass o grog and a bit o breakfast  billy shook hands and took a sip out of the casebottle by way of clenching the reconciliation  the two then had breakfast together and while this meal was in progress jones informed his little friend of the nature of the game he was engaged in playing out  you must know my lad said mr jones that you and i have been wrecked  we are the only survivors of the brig skylark which was run down in a fog by a large threemasted screw steamer on the night of the thirteenththats three nights ago billy  the skylark sank immediately and every soul on board was lost except you and me because the steamer as is too often the case in such accidents passed on and left us to our fate  you and i was saved by consequence of bein smart and gettin into this here small boatwhich is one o the skylarks boatsonly just in time to save ourselves but she had only one oar in her and no mast or sail or rudder as you see billy nevertheless we managed to keep her goin with the one oar up to this time and no doubt said mr jones with a grin well manage to keep her goin till were picked up and carried safe into port  billys eyes had opened very wide and very round as mr joness description proceeded gradually as his surprise increased his mouth also opened and elongated but he said never a word though he breathed hard  now billy my boy pursued mr jones i tell ee all this of course in strict confidence  the skylark you must know was loaded with a valuable cargo of fine herrings worth about 200 pounds  there was 780 barrels of em and 800 boxes  the brig was worth 100 pounds so the whole affair was valued at 300 pounds sterling  you dont mean to tell me said billy catching his breath that there warnt never no such a wessel as the skylark  never that i know of replied jones with a smile except in my brain and on the books o several insurance companies  billys eyes and mouth grew visibly rounder but he said nothing more and mr jones renewing his quid went on  well my lad before this here skylark left the port of london for cherbourg i insured her in no fewer than five insurance companies youll understand that that aint regular my boy but at each office i said that the vessel was not insured in any other and they believed me you must know that a good deal of business is done by these companies in good faith which gives a chance to smart fellows like me and you to turn an honest penny dye see  they are pretty soft luckily  mr jones happened to be mistaken in this opinion as the sequel will show but billy believed him at the time and wondered that they were so green  yes continued jones counting on his fingers im in for 300 pounds with the advance company and 300 pounds with the tied harbours company and 225 pounds with the home and abroad company and 200 pounds with the submarine company and 300 pounds with the friendinneed companythe whole makin a snug little sum of 1325 pounds  in for a penny in for a pound is my motto you see so lad you and i shall make our fortunes if all goes well and you only continue game and clever  this last remark was a feeler and mr jones paused to observe its effect but he could scarce refrain from laughter for billys eyes and mouth now resembled three extremely round os with his nose like a fat mark of admiration in the midst  a gusty sigh was all the response he gave however so mr jones continued  weve been out about thirty hours starvin in this here little boat you and i so now its about time we wos picked up and as i see a vessel on our larboardbeam that looks like a foreigner well throw the grub overboard have another pull at the grog bottle and hoist a signal of distress  in pursuance of these intentions jones applied the casebottle to his lips and took a long pull after which he offered it to billy who however declined  he then threw the breadbag into the sea and tying his handkerchief to the oar after the manner of a flag set it up on end and awaited the result  the vessel alluded to was presently observed to alter its course and bear down on the boat and now billy felt that the deciding time had come  he sat gazing at the approaching vessel in silence  was he to give in to his fate and agree to tell lies through thick and thin in order to further the designs of mr jones or was he to reveal all the moment he should get on board the vessel and take the consequences  he thought of katie and resolved to give up the struggle against evil then nora rose up in his minds eye and he determined to do the right then he thought of transportation for a prolonged term of years with which jones threatened him and he felt inclined to turn again into the wrong road to escape from that presently he remembered the grotto and the lessons of truth to god and man that he had learned there and he made up his mind to fight in the cause of truth to the last gasp  mr jones watched his face keenly and came to the conclusion that he had quelled the boy and should now find him a willing and useful tool but in order to make still more sure he employed the few minutes that remained to him in commenting on the great discomfort of a convicts life and the great satisfaction that accrued from making ones fortune at a single stroke  this talk was not without its effect  billy wavered  before he could make up his mind they were alongside the strange vessel and next moment on her deck  mr jones quickly explained the circumstances of the loss of the skylark to the sympathetic captain  billy listened in silence and by silence had assented to the falsehood  it was too late now to mend matters so he gave way to despair which in him frequently if not usually assumed the form of reckless joviality  while this spirit was strong upon him he swore to anything  he not only admitted the truth of all that his tempter advanced but entertained the seamen with a lively and graphic account of the running down of the skylark and entered into minute particularschiefly of a comical naturewith such recklessness that the cause of mr jones bade fair to resemble many a roast which is totally ruined by being overdone  jones gave him a salutary check however on being landed next day at a certain town on the kentish coast so that when billy was taken before the authorities his statements were brought somewhat more into accord with those of his tempter  the wily mr jones went at once with billy to the chief officer of the coastguard on that station and reported the loss of his vessel with much minuteness of detailto the effect that she had sailed from london at noon of a certain date at the quarter ebb tide the sky being cloudy and wind souwest that the casualty occurred at five pm on the day following near the north foreland light at half flood tide the sky being cloudy and wind westsouwest that the vessel had sunk and all the crew had perished excepting himself and the boy  this report with full particulars was sent to the board of trade  mr jones then went to the agent for the shipwrecked mariners society and related his pitiful tale to him  that gentleman happening to be an astute man observed some discrepancies in the accounts given respectively by billy and his master  he therefore put a variety of puzzling questions and took down a good many notes  mr jones however had laid his plans so well and gave such a satisfactory and plausible account of himself that the agent felt constrained to extend to him the aid of the noble society which he represented and by which so much good is done to sailors directly and indirectly to the community at large  he paid their passage to london but resolved to make some further inquiries with a view either to confirming or allaying his suspicions  these little matters settled and the loss having been duly advertised in the newspapers mr jones set out for london with the intention of presenting his claims to the insurance companies  in the train billy had time to reflect on the wickedness of which he had been guilty and his heart was torn with conflicting emotions among which repentance was perhaps the most powerful  but what he thought was the use of repentance now  the thing was done and could not be undone  could it not  was it too late to mend  at the grotto he had been taught that it was never too late to mendbut that it was sinful as well as dangerous to delay on the strength of that fact that now was the accepted time now the day of salvation  when billy thought of these things and then looked at the stern inexorable face of the man by whom he had been enslaved he began to give way to despair  when he thought of his good angel nora he felt inclined to leap out of the carriage window and escape or die  he restrained himself however and did nothing until the train arrived in london  then he suddenly burst away from his captor dived between the legs of a magnificent railway guard whose dignity and person were overthrown by the shock eluded the ticketcollector and several policemen and used his active little legs so well that in a few minutes his pursuers lost him in a labyrinth of low streets not far distant from the station  from this point he proceeded at a rapid though less furious pace direct to the grotto where he presented himself to the superintendent with the remark that he had come back to make a clean breast of it    chapter twenty one  on the scent  let us change the scene and put back the clock  ah how many hearts would rejoice if it were as easy to return on the track of time in real life as it is to do so in a tale  it was the evening of the day in which jones and billy went to sea in the little boat  ramsgate mr durants suppertable with stanley hall and robert queeker as guests  they were all very happy and merry for stanley was recounting with graphic power some of the incidents of his recent voyage  mr durant was rich enough to take the loss of his vessel with great equanimity all the more so that it had been fully insured  mr queeker was in a state of bliss in consequence of having been received graciously by fanny whose soul was aflame with sentiment so powerful that she could not express it except through the medium of a giggle  only once had fanny been enabled to do full justice to herself and that was when alone with katie in the mysterious gloom of a midnight confabulation she suddenly observed that size and looks in men were absolutely nothingless than nothingand that in her estimation heart and intellect were everything  in the midst of his mirth mr durant suddenly turned to queeker and said  by the way what made you so late of coming tonight queeker  i thought you had promised to come to tea  well yes butathat is stammered queeker in confusion in fact i was obliged to keep an appointment in connection with thethe particular business  the secret mission in short observed katie with a peculiar smile  well secret mission if you choose laughed queeker at all events it was that which prevented my getting here sooner  in truth i did not expect to have managed to come so soon but we came to the boat  queeker stopped short and blushed violently feeling that he had slightly though unintentionally committed himself  fanny looked at him blushed in sympathy and giggled  oh theres a boat in the secret mission is there cried stanley come let us make a game of it  was it an iron boat  no replied queeker laughing for he felt that at all events he was safe in answering that question  was it a wooden one asked katie  wellye  was it a big one demanded mr durant entering into the spirit of the game  no it was a little one said queeker still feeling safe although anxious to evade reply  was there a man in it said katie  queeker hesitated  and a boy cried stanley  the question was put unwittingly but being so put queeker stammered and again blushed  katie on the contrary turned pale for her previously expressed hope that there might be some connection between queekers mission and billy towlers troubles flashed into her mind  but was there a boy in it she said with a sudden earnestness that induced every one to look at her in surprise  really i prayi must beg said queeker that you wont make this a matter of even jocular inquiry  of course i know that no one here would make improper use of any information that i might give but i have been pledged to secrecy by my employers  but continued katie in the same anxious way as before it will not surely be a breach of confidence merely to tell me if the boy was a small active goodlooking little fellow with bright eyes and curly hair  i am bound to admit said queeker that your description is correct  to the amazement not to say consternation of every one katie covered her face with her hands and burst into tears exclaiming in an agony of distress that she knew it she had feared it after sending him away that she had ruined him and that it was too late now to do anything  no not too late perhaps she repeated suddenly raising her large beautiful eyes which swam in tears oh papa come with me upstairs i must speak with you alone at once  she seized her astonished father by the hand and led him unresisting from the room  having hurriedly related all she knew about billy towler morley jones and nora she looked up in his face and demanded to know what was to be done  done my dear child he replied looking perplexed we must go at once and see how much can be undone  you tell me you have noras address  well well go there at once  butbut said katie nora does not know the full extent of her fathers wickedness and we want to keep it from her if possible  a very proper desire to spare her pain katie but in the circumstances we cannot help ourselves we must do what we can to frustrate this mans designs and save the boy  so saying mr durant descended to the diningroom  he explained that some suspicious facts had come to his daughters knowledge which necessitated instant action said that he was sorry mr queeker felt it incumbent on him to maintain secrecy in regard to his mission but that he could not think of pressing him to act in opposition to his convictions and dismissing his guests with many apologies went out with katie in search of the abode of nora jones  stanley hall whose curiosity was aroused by all that had passed went down to take a walk on the pier by way of wearing it off in a philosophical manner  he succeeded easily in getting rid of this feeling but he could not so easily get rid of the image of katie durant  he had suspected himself in love with her before he sailed for india his suspicions were increased on his return to england and when he saw the burst of deep feeling to which she had so recently given way and heard the genuine expressions of remorse and beheld her sweet face bedewed with tears of regret and pity suspicion was swallowed up in certainty  he resolved then and there to win her if he could and marry her  here a touch of perplexity assailed him but he fought it off nobly  he was young no doubt and had no money but what thenhe was strong had good abilities a father in a lucrative practice with the prospect of assisting and ultimately succeeding him  that was enough surely  the lodging which he had taken for a few days was retaken that night for an indefinite period and he resolved to lay siege to her heart in due form  but that uncertainty which is proverbial in human affairs stepped within the circle of his life and overturned his plans  on returning to his rooms he found a telegram on the table  his father it informed him was dangerously ill  by the next train he started for home and arrived to find that his father was dead  a true narrative of any portion of this worlds doings must of necessity be as varied as the world itself and equally abrupt in its transitions from the lively suppertable stanley hall passed to the deathbed of his father  in like manner we must ask the reader to turn with us from the contemplation of stanleys deep sorrow to the observation of queekers poetic despair  maddened between the desire to tell all he knew regarding the secret mission to mr durant and the command laid on him by his employers to be silent the miserable youth rushed frantically to his lodgings without any definite intentions but more than half inclined to sink on his knees before his desk and look up to the moon or stars or failing these to the floating light for inspiration and pen the direful dirge of something dreadful and desperate  he had even got the length of the first line and had burst like a thunderbolt into his room muttering    great blazing wonder of illimitable spheres  when he became suddenly aware of the fact that his chair was occupied by the conchological friend with whom he had spent the earlier part of that day who was no other than the man with the keen grey eyes  what still in the poetic vein he said with a grave smile  whyithought you were off to london exclaimed queeker with a very red face  i have seen cause to change my plan said mr larks quietly  im very glad of it replied queeker running his fingers through his hair and sitting down opposite his friend with a deep sigh because im in the most horrible state of perplexity  it is quite evident to me that the boy is known to miss durant for she went off into such a state when i mentioned him and described him exactly  indeed said mr larks hm  i know the boy too  do you  why didnt you tell me that  there was no occasion to said the imperturbable mr larks whose visage never by any chance conveyed any expression whatever except when he pleased and then it conveyed only and exactly the expression that he intended  but come he continued lets hear all about it and dont quote any poetry till you have done with the facts  thus exhorted queeker described the scene at the suppertable with faithful minuteness and on concluding demanded what was to be done  hm grunted mr larks  theyve gone to visit nora jones so you and i shall go and keep them company  come along  he put on his hat and went out followed by his little friend  in a lowly illfurnished room in one of the poorest streets of the town where rats and dogs and cats seemed to divide the district with povertystricken human beings they found nora sitting by the bedside of her grandmother who appeared to be dying  a large family bible from which she had been reading was open on her knee  mr larks had opened the door and entered without knocking  he and queeker stood in the passage and saw the bed the invalid and the watcher through an inner door which stood ajar  they could hear the murmurings of the old womans voice  she appeared to wander in her mind for sometimes her words were coherent at other times she merely babbled  o morley morley give it up she said during one of her lucid intervals it has been the curse of our family  your grandfather died of it your fatherah he was a man tall and straight and so kind till he took to it oh me how it changed him  but the lord saved his soul though he let the body fall to the dust  blessed be his holy name for that  give it up morley my darling boy give it up give it upoh for gods sake give it up  she raised her voice at each entreaty until it almost reached a shriek and then her whole frame seemed to sink down into the bed from exhaustion  why dont ee speak to me morley she resumed after a short time endeavouring to turn her head round  dearest granny said nora gently stroking one of her withered hands which lay on the counterpane father is away just now  no doubt he will be back ere long  ay ay hes always away always away she murmured in a querulous tone always coming back too but he never comes  oh if he would give it upgive it up  she repeated this several times and gradually dwindled off into unintelligible mutterings  by this time mr larks had become aware of whispering voices in a part of the room which he could not see  pushing the door a little farther open he entered softly and in a darkened corner of the apartment beheld mr durant and katie in close conversation with james welton  they all rose and nora seeing that the old woman had fallen into a slumber also rose and advanced towards the strangers  mr durant at once explained to her who queeker was and queeker introduced mr larks as a friend who had come to see them on important business  i think we know pretty well what the business is about said jim welton advancing and addressing himself to mr larks but you see he added glancing towards the bed that this is neither the time nor place to prosecute your inquiries sir  mr larks who was by no means an unfeeling man though very stern said that he had no intention of intruding he had not been aware that any one was ill in the house and he would take it as a favour if mr welton would go outside and allow him the pleasure of a few words with him  of course jim agreed but before going took nora aside  ill not be back tonight dearest he said in a low whisper tomorrow early ill return  you will leave no stone unturned said nora  not one  ill do my best to save him  and you have told me the worsttold me all asked nora with a look of intense grief mingled with anxiety on her pale face  i have said jim in a tone and with a look so earnest and truthful that nora required no further assurance  she gave him a kindly but inexpressibly sad smile and returned to her stool beside the bed  her lover and mr larks went out followed by queeker  we wont intrude on you longer tonight said katie going up to nora and laying her hand quietly on her shoulder  your visit is no intrusion said nora looking up with a quiet smile it was love that brought you here i know  may our dear lord bless you and your father for wishing to comfort the heart of one who needs it so muchoh so much  she put her hands before her face and was silent katie tried in vain to speak  the tears coursed freely down her cheeks but never a word could she utter  she put her arm round the neck of the poor girl and kissed her  this was a language which nora understood many words could not have expressed so much no words could have expressed more    chapter twenty two  mr jones is outwitted and nora is left desolate  when morley jones found himself suddenly deserted by his ally billy towler he retired to the privacy of a box in a low publichouse in thames street and there under the stimulus of a stiff glass of grog consulted with himself as to the best mode of procedure under the trying circumstances in which he found himself placed  he thought it probable after half an hour of severe meditation that billy would return to the grotto but that for his own sake he would give a false account of his absence and say nothing about the loss of the skylark  feeling somewhat relieved in mind by his conclusions on this head he drank off his grog called for another glass and then set himself to the consideration of how far the disappearance of the boy would interfere with his obtaining payment of the various sums due by the insurance offices  this point was either more knotty and difficult to unravel than the previous one or the grog began to render his intellect less capable of grappling with it  at all events it cost him an hour to determine his course of action and required another glass of grog to enable him to put the whole matter fairly before his mental vision in one comprehensive view  this however accomplished he called for a fourth glass of grog for luck and reeled out of the house to carry out his deeplaid plans  his first act was to proceed to greenwich where a branch of his fishcuring business existed or was supposed to exist  here he met a friend who offered to treat him  unfortunately for the success of his schemes he accepted this offer and in the course of a debauch revealed so much of his private affairs that the friend after seeing him safely to his lodging and bidding him an affectionate farewell went up to london by the first boat on the following morning and presented himself to the managers of various insurance companies to whom he made revelations which were variously received by these gentlemen some of them opening their eyes in amazement while others opened their mouths in amusement and gave him to understand that he was very much in the position of a man who should carry coals to newcastle they being then in possession of all the information given and a great deal more besides  the manager of the submarine insurance company was the most facetious among these gentlemen on hearing the revelations of mr joness friend  can you tell me said that gentleman when he had pumped the friend dry which of us is likely to receive the distinguished honour of the first visit from mr jones  he said summat about your own office sir replied the informer leastwise i think he did but i aint quite sartin  hm not unlikely observed the manager we have had the pleasure of paying him something before today  come here i will introduce you to an acquaintance of mr jones who takes a deep interest in him  he has just arrived from ramsgate  opening a door the manager ushered the informer into a small room where a stout man with peculiarly keen grey eyes was warming himself at the fire  allow me to introduce you mr larks to a friend of mr jones who may be of some use  i will leave you together for a little said the manager with a laugh as he retired and shut the door  it is not necessary that we should enter into details as to how mr jones went about the business of drawing his nets ashoreso to speak and how those who took a special interest in mr jones carefully assisted him and up to a certain point furthered all his proceedings it is sufficient to say that about a fortnight after his arrival in londonall the preliminary steps having been takenhe presented himself one fine forenoon at the office of the submarine insurance company  he was received very graciously and much to his satisfaction was told that the claim could now be settled without further delay  former experience had taught him that such a piece of business was not unusually difficult of settlement but he was quite charmed by the unwonted facilities which seemed to be thrown in his way in regard to the present affair  he congratulated himself internally and the manager congratulated him externally so to speak by referring to his good fortune in having insured the vessel and cargo to the full amount  even the clerks of the establishment appeared to manifest unwonted interest in the case which gratified while it somewhat surprised mr jones  indeed the interest deepened to such an extent and was so obtrusive that it became almost alarming so that feelings of considerable relief were experienced by the adventurous man when he at length received a cheque for 300 pounds and left the office with it in his pocket  in the outer lobby he felt a touch on his arm and looking round met the gaze of a gentleman with peculiarly keen grey eyes  this gentleman made some quiet remarks with reference to mr jones being wanted and when mr jones not relishing the tone or looks of this gentleman made a rush at the outer glass door of the office an official stepped promptly in front of it put one hand on the handle and held up the other with the air of one who should say excuse me there is no thoroughfare this way  turning abruptly to the left mr jones found himself confronted by another grave gentleman of powerful frame and resolute aspect who by a species of magic or sleight of hand known only to the initiated slipped a pair of steel bracelets on mr joness wrists and finally almost before he knew where he was mr jones found himself seated in a cab with the strong gentleman by his side and the keen greyeyed gentleman in front of him  soon afterwards he found himself standing alone in the midst of an apartment the chief characteristics of which were that the furniture was scanty the size inconveniently little and the window unusually high up besides being heavily barred and ridiculously small  here let us leave him to his meditations  one fine forenoonmany weeks after the capture of morley jonesdick moy jack shales and jerry macgowl were engaged in painting and repairing buoys in the trinity store on the pier at ramsgate  the two former were enjoying their month of service on shore the latter was on sickleave but convalescent  jack was painting squares of alternate black and white on a buoy of a conical shape  dick was vigorously scraping seaweed and barnacles off a buoy of a round form  the store or big shed was full of buoys of all shapes some new and fresh others old and rugged all of them would have appeared surprisingly gigantic to any one accustomed to see buoys only in their native element  the invalid sat on the shank of a mushroom anchor and smoked his pipe while he affected to superintend the work  sure i pity the poor craturs as is always sick  the mouth o man can niver tell the blessedness of bein well as the pote says observed jerry with a sigh as he shook the ashes out of his pipe and proceeded to refill it  come now jack shales he added after a short pause ye dont call that square do ee  ill paint yer nose black if you dont shut up said jack drawing the edge of a black square with intense caution in order to avoid invading the domain of a white one  ah you reminds me of the owld proverb that says somethin about asses gittin impudent an becomin free with their heels when lions grow sick  well jerry retorted jack with a smile as he leaned back and regarded his work with his head very much on one side and his eyes partially closed after the manner of knights of the brush im not offended because im just as much of an ass as you are of a lion  i say mates remarked dick moy pausing in his work and wiping his brow are ee aweer that the capn has ordered us to be ready to start wi the first o the tide at half after five tomorrow  i knows it replied jack shales laying down the black brush and taking up the white one  i knows it too said jerry macgowl but it dont make no manner of odds to me cause i means to stop ashore and enjoy meself  i mean to amoose meself with the trial o that black thief morley jones  dick moy resumed his work with a grunt and said that jerry was a lucky fellow to be so long on sickleave and jack said he wished he had been called up as a witness in joness case for he would have cut a better figure than jim welton did  ay boy said dick moy but there wos a reason for that  you know the poor feller is in love wi joness daughter an he didnt like for to help to convict his own fatherinlaw to be dye see  thats where it is  the boy billy towler was amost as bad  hes got a weakness for the gal too an no wonder for shes bin as good as a mother to im  they say that billy nigh broke the hearts o the lawyers he wos so stoopid at sometimes an so oncommon cute at others but it warnt o no use  jims father was strong in his evidence agin him an that mr larks as comed aboard of the gull you remember he had been watching an ferreting about the matter to that extent that he turned joness former life inside out  it seems hes bin up to dodges o that kind for a long time past  no has he said jack shales  arrah didnt ye read of it exclaimed jerry macgowl  no replied jack drily not bein on the sicklist i hant got time to read the papers dye see  well resumed dick moy it seems he has more than once set fire to his premises in gravesend and got the insurance money  howsever he has got fourteen years transportation now an thatll take the shine pretty well out of him before he comes back  how did the poor gal take it asked jack  dick replied that she was very bad at first but that she got somewhat comforted by the way her father behaved to her and listened to her readin o the bible after he was condemned  it might be that the death of his old mother had softened him a bit for she died with his name on her lips her last words being oh morley give it up my darling boy give it up its your only chance to give it up for you inherit it my poor boy the passion and the poison are in your blood oh give it up morley give it up  they do say continued dick that jones broke down altogether wen he heard that an fell on his gals neck an cried like a babby  but for my part i dont much believe in them deathbed repentancesfor its much the same thing wi jones now he bein as good as dead  its not wot a man says but how a man lives asll weigh for or against him in the end  an what more did he say asked jerry macgowl stopping down the tobacco in his pipe with one of his fireproof fingers you see havin bin on the sicklist so long i havent got up all the details o this business  he didnt say much more replied dick scraping away at the seaweed and barnacles with renewed vigour only he made his darter promise that shed marry jim welton as soon after he was gone as possible  she did nothing but cry poor thing and wouldnt hear of it at first but he was so strong about it saying that the thought of her being so well married was the only thing as would comfort him wen he was gone that she gave in at last  sure then shell have to make up her mind said jerry to live on air which is too light food intirely for any wan excep humminbirds and potes  shell do better than that mate returned dick for jim as got appointed to be assistantkeeper to a lightouse through that fustrate genleman mr durant who is and an glove im told wi the elder brethren up at the trinity ouse  its said that they are to be spliced in a week or two but owin to the circumstances the weddin is to be kep quite priwate  good luck to em cried jerry  talkin of the durants i spose yeve heard that theres goin to be a weddin in that family soon  oh yes ive heard on it cried dick miss durantkatie they calls hershes agoin to be spliced to the young doctor that was wrecked in the wellington  a smart man that  they say ee has stepped into is fathers shoes an is so much liked that ees had to git an assistant to help him to get through the work o curin peopleor killin of em i never feel rightly sure in my own mind which it is that the doctors does for us  och dont ye know said jerry removing his pipe for a moment they keeps curin of us as long as weve got any tin an when thats done they kills us off quietly  if it warnt for the doctors wed all live to the age of methoosamel excep of coorse wen we was cut off by accident or drink  well i dont know as to that said jack shales in a hearty manner but im right glad to hear that miss durant is gettin a good husband for shes the sweetest gal in england i think always exceptin one whom i dont mean for to name just now  hasnt she been a perfect angel to the poorespecially to poor old mensince she come to ramsgate and didnt she before goin back to yarmouth where she blongs to make a beautiful paintin o the lifeboat and present it in a gold frame with tears in her sweet eyes to the coxswain o the boat an took his big fist in her two soft little hands an shook an squeezed it an begged him to keep the pictur as a very slight mark of the gratitude an esteem of dr hall an herselfthat was after they was engaged you know  ah there aint many gals like her said jack with a sigh always exceptin one  humph said dick moy i wouldnt give my old ooman for six dozen of er  just so observed jerry with a grin an ive no manner of doubt that dr hall wouldnt give her for sixty dozen o your old ooman its human natur ladthats where it is mates  but what has come o billy towler  has he gone back to the whatsisnamethe cavern eh  the grotto you mean said jack shales  well the grottotant much differ  hes gone back for a time said dick but mr durant has prowided for him too  he has given him a berth aboord one of his eastindiamen so if billy behaves hisself his fortins as good as made  leastwise he has got his futt on the first round an the ladders all clear before him  by the way whats that ive heard said jack shales about mr durant findin out that hed knowd billy towler some years ago  i dont rightly know replied dick  ive eerd it said that the old gentleman recognised him as a beggar boy ed tuck a fancy to an putt to school long ago but billy didnt like the school it seems an runnd awaywich i dont regard as wery surprisinan mr durant could never find out where ed run to  thats how i eerd the story but wots true of it i dun know  there goes the dinnerbell exclaimed jack shales rising with alacrity on hearing a neighbouring clock strike noon  jerry rose with a sigh and remarked as he shook the ashes out of his pipe and put it into his waistcoat pocket that his appetite had quite left him that he didnt believe he was fit for more than two chickens at one meal whereas he had seen the day when he would have thought nothing of a whole leg of mutton to his own cheek  ah remarked dick moy irish mutton i spose  well i dont know ow you feels but i feels so hungry that i could snap at a ringbolt and i know of a lot o childn big an small as wont look sweet on their daddy if he keeps em waitin for dinner so come along mates  saying this dick and his friends left the buoystore and walked smartly off to their several places of abode in the town  in a darkened apartment of that same town sat nora jones the very personification of despair on a low stool with her head resting on the side of a poor bed  she was alone and perfectly silent for some sorrows like some thoughts are too deep for utterance  everything around her suggested absolute desolation  the bed was that in which not long ago she had been wont to smooth the pillow and soothe the heart of her old grandmother  it was empty now  the fire in the rusty grate had been allowed to die out and its cold grey ashes strewed the hearth among them lay the fragments of a black bottle  it would be difficult to say what it was in the peculiar aspect of these fragments that rendered them so suggestive but there was that about them which conveyed irresistibly the idea that the bottle had been dashed down there with the vehemence of uncontrollable passion  the little table which used to stand at the patients bedside was covered with a few crumbs and fragments of a meal that must to judge from their state and appearance have been eaten a considerable time ago and the confusion of the furniture as well as the dust that covered everything was strangely out of keeping with the character of the poor girl who reclined by the side of the bed so pale and still that but for the slight twitching movement of her clasped hands one might have supposed she had already passed from the scene of her woe  even the oldfashioned timepiece that hung upon a nail in the wall seemed to be smitten with the pervading spell for its pendulum was motionless and its feeble pulse had ceased to tick  a soft tap at the door broke the deathlike silence  nora looked up but did not answer as it slowly opened and a man entered  on seeing who it was she uttered a low wail and buried her face in the bedclothes without speaking or moving from her position she held out her hand to jim welton who advanced with a quick but quiet step and going down on his knees beside her took the little hand in both of his  the attitude and the silence were suggestive  without having intended it the young sailor began to pray and in a few short broken sentences poured out his soul before god  a flood of tears came to noras relief  after a few minutes she looked up  oh thank you thank you jim  i believe that in the selfishness of my grief i had forgotten god but oh  i feel as if my heart was crushed beyond the power of recovery  she is gone glancing at the empty bed and he is gonegonefor ever  jim wished to comfort her and tried to speak but his voice was choked he could only draw her to him and laying her head on his breast smooth her fair soft hair with his hard but gentle hand  not gone for ever dearest he said at length with a great effort it is indeed along long time but  he could not go further for it seemed to him like mockery to suggest by way of comfort that fourteen years would come to an end  for some minutes the silence was broken only by an occasional sob from poor nora  oh he was so different once she said raising herself and looking at her lover with tearful earnest eyes you have seen him at his worst jim  there was a timebefore he took to  she stopped abruptly as if unable to find words and pointed with a fierce expression that seemed strange and awful on her gentle face to the fragments of the broken bottle on the hearth  jim nodded  she saw that he understood and went on in her own calm voice  there was a time when he was kind and gentle and loving when he had no drunken companions and no mysterious goings to sea when he was the joy as well as the support of his mother and so fond of mebut he was always that even after he had  again nora paused and drooping her head uttered the low wail of desolation that went like cold steel to the young sailors heart  nora he said earnestly he will get no drink where he is going  at all events he will be cured of that before he returns home  oh i bless the lord for that said nora with fervour  i have thought of that before now and i have thought too that there are men of god where he is going who think of and pray for and strive to recover the souls of those whothat is but oh jim jim it is a long long weary time  i feel that i shall never see my father more in this worldnever never more  we cannot tell nora said jim with a desperate effort to appear hopeful  i know well enough that it may seem foolish to try to comfort you with the hope of seein him again in this life and yet even this may come to pass  he may escape or he may be forgiven and let off before the end of his time  but come cheer up my darling  you remember what his last request was  how can you talk of such a thing at such a time exclaimed nora drawing away from him and rising  be not angry nora said jim also rising  i did but remind you of it for the purpose of sayin that as you agreed to what he wished you have given me a sort of right or privilege dear nora at least to help and look after you in your distress  your own unselfish heart has never thought of telling me that you have neither money nor home this poor place being yours only till termday which is tomorrow but i know all this without requiring to be told and i have come to say that there is an old womana sort of relation of minewho lives in this town and will give you board and lodging gladly till i can get arrangements made at the lighthouse for ourthat is to saytill you choose in your own good time to let me be your rightful protector and supporter as well as your comforter  thank you jim  it is like yourself to be so thoughtful  forgive me i judged you hastily  it is true i am poori have nothing in the world but thanks be to god i have health  i can work and there are some kind friends she added with a sad smile who will throw work in my way i know  well we will talk about these things afterwards nora but you wont refuse to take advantage of my old friends offerat least for a night or two  no i wont refuse that jim see i am prepared to go she said pointing to a wooden seachest which stood in the middle of the room my box is packed  everything i own is in it  the furniture clock and bedding belong to the landlord  come then my own poor lamb said the young sailor tenderly let us go  nora rose and glanced slowly round the room  few rooms in ramsgate could have looked more povertystricken and cheerless nevertheless being associated in her mind with those whom she had lost she was loath to leave it  falling suddenly on her knees beside the bed she kissed the old counterpane that had covered the dead form she had loved so well and then went hastily out and leaned her head against the wall of the narrow court before the door  jim lifted the chest placed it on his broad shoulders and followed her locking the door behind him and putting the key in his pocket he gave his disengaged arm to nora and led her slowly a way    chapter twenty three  tells of an unlookedfor return and describes a great feast  if as we have elsewhere observed in this narrative time and tide wait for no man it is not less true that time and tide work wonderful changes in man and his affairs and fortunes  some of those changes we will now glance at premising that seven years have passed away since the occurrence of the events recorded in our last chapter  on the evening of a somewhat gloomy day in the month of sunny showers four men of rough aspect and clad in coarse but not disreputable garments stopped in front of a publichouse in one of the lowest localities of london and looked about them  there was something quite peculiar in their aspect  they seemed to be filled with mingled curiosity and surprise and looked somewhat scared as a bird does when suddenly set free from its cage  two of the men were of an extremely low type of humanitylowbrowed and scowlingand their language betokened that their minds were in keeping with their faces  the other two were betterlooking and betterspoken one of them having evidently been a handsome man in his day  his hair was blanched as white as snow although it still retained the curls of youth  his figure was much bent and he appeared like one who had been smitten with premature old age  well uncommon queer changes bin goin on here said one of the men gazing round him  one of the others admitted that there certainly had been wonderful changes and expressed a fear that if the change in himself was as great his old pals wouldnt know him  howsever observed he who had spoken first they wont see such a difference as they would have seen if wed got the whole fourteen  good luck to the ticketofleave system say i  the others laughed at this and one of them suggested that they should enter the publichouse and have a glass of grog in memory of old times three of the men at once agreed to this proposal and said that as it would not be long before they were in the stone jug again it behoved them to make the most of their freedom while it lasted  the man with white hair however objected and it was not until his companions had chaffed and rallied him a good deal that he consented to enter the house observing as he followed them slowly that he had not tasted a drop for seven years  well well replied one of the others it dont matter youll relish it all the more now old feller  itll go down like oil an call up the memory of old times  the memory of old times cried the whitehaired man stopping short with a sudden blaze of ferocity which amazed his companions  he stood glaring at them for a few moments with his hands tightly clenched then without uttering another word he turned round and rushed from the house  mad exclaimed one of the other three looking at his companions when they had recovered from their surprise mad as a march hare howsever that dont consarn us  come along my heartieshallo landlord fetch drink hereyour best and plenty of it  now boys fill up and ill give ee a toast  saying this the man filled his glass the others followed his example the toast was given and drunkmore toasts were given and drunkthe three men returned to their drink and their old ways and haunts and comrades as the sow returns to her wallowing in the mire  meanwhile the whitehaired man wandered away as if he had no settled purpose  day after day he moved on through towns and villages and fields offering to work but seldom being employed begging his bread from door to door but carefully avoiding the taverns sleeping where he could or where he was permittedsometimes in the barn of a kindly farmer sometimes under a haystack not unfrequently under a hedge until at last he found himself in the town of ramsgate  here he made inquiries of various people and immediately set forth again on his travels through the land until he reached a remote part of the coast of england where he found his further progress checked by the sea but by dint of begging a free passage from fishermen here and there he managed at last to reach one of our outlying reefs where on a small islet a magnificent lighthouse reared its white and stately column and looked abroad upon the ocean with its glowing eye  there was a small village on the islet in which dwelt a few families of fishermen  they were a hardworking community and appeared to be contented and happy  the lighthouse occupied an elevated plateau above the cliffs at the seaward extremity of the isle about quarter of a mile distant from the fishing village  thither the old man wended his way  the tower rising high above shrubs and intervening rocks rendered a guide unnecessary it was a calm evening  the path which was narrow and rugged wound its serpentine course amid grey rocks luxuriant brambles grasses and flowering shrubs  there were no trees  the want of shelter on that exposed spot rendered their growth impossible  the few that had been planted had been cut down by the norwest wind as with a scythe  as he drew near to the lighthouse the old man observed a woman sitting on a stool in front of the door busily engaged with her needle while three childrentwo girls and a boywere romping on the grass plat beside her  the boy was just old enough to walk with the steadiness of an exceedingly drunk man and betrayed a wonderful tendency to sit down suddenly and gazeastonished  the girls apparently though not really twins were just wild enough to enjoy their brothers tumbles and helped him to accomplish more of them than would have resulted from his own incapacity to walk  a magnificent black newfoundland dog with grey paws and a benignant countenance couched beside the woman and watched the children at play he frequently betrayed a desire to join them in their gambols but either laziness or a sense of his own dignity induced him to sit still  nora called the mother who was a young and exceedingly beautiful mother nora come here go tell your father that i see a stranger coming up the path  quick darling  little nora bounded away like a small fairy with her fair curls streaming in the wind which her own speed created  katie said the mother turning to her second daughter dont rumple him up quite so violently  you must remember that he is a tiny fellow yet and cant stand such rough treatment  but he likes it ma objected katie with a look of glee although she obeyed the order at once  dont you morley  little morley stopped in the middle of an ecstatic laugh scrambled upon his fat legs and staggered towards his mother with his fists doubled as if to take summary vengeance on her for having stopped the fun  oh baby boy my little morley what a wild fellow you are cried the mother catching up her child and tossing him in the air  the old man had approached near enough to overhear the words and recognise the face  tears sprang to his eyes and ran down his cheeks as he fell forward on the path with his face in the dust  at the same moment the lighthousekeeper issued from the door of the building  running towards the old man he and his wife quickly raised him and loosened his neckcloth  his face had been slightly cut by the fall  blood and dust besmeared it and soiled his white locks  poor old man said the keeper as his mate the assistant lightkeeper joined him  lend a hand billy to carry him in  he aint very heavy  the assistanta strapping young fellow with a powerful wellmade frame sparkling eyes and a handsome face on which at that moment there was a look of intense pityassisted his comrade to raise the old man they carried him with tender care into the lighthouse and laid him on a couch which at that time owing to lack of room in the building happened to be little noras bed  for a few moments he lay apparently in a state of insensibility while the mother of the family brought a basin of water and began carefully to remove the blood and dust which rendered his face unrecognisable  the first touch of the cold sponge caused him to open his eyes and gaze earnestly in the womans faceso earnestly that she was constrained to pause and return the gaze inquiringly  you seem to know me she said  the old man made no reply but slowly clasping his hands and closing his eyes exclaimed thank god fervently    let us glance now at a few more of the changes which had been wrought in the condition and circumstances of several of the actors in this tale by the wonderworking hand of time  on another evening of another month in this same year mr robert queekerhaving just completed an ode to a star which had been recently discovered by the astronomerroyalwalked from the door of the fortress hotel ramsgate and wending his way leisurely along harbour street directed his steps towards saint jamess hall  seven years had wrought a great change for the better in mr robert queeker  his once smooth face was decorated with a superb pair of lightbrown whiskers of the stamp now styled dundreary  his clothes fitted him well and displayed to advantage a figure which although short was well made and athletic  it was evident that time had not caused his shadow to grow less  there was a jaunty confident air about him too which might have been thought quite in keeping with a red coat and topboots by his friends in jenkinsjoy and would have induced hospitable mr stoutheart to let him once more try his fortune on the back of slapover without much anxiety as to the result ay even although the sweet but reckless amy were to be his leader in the field nevertheless there was nothing of the coxcomb about queekerno selfassertion nothing but amiableness selfsatisfaction and enthusiasm  queeker smiled and hummed a tune to himself as he walked along drawing on his gloves which were lavender kid and exceedingly tight  it will be a great night he murmured a grand a glorious night  as there was nothing peculiarly grand in the aspect of the weather it is to be presumed that he referred to something else but he said nothing more at the time although he smiled a good deal and hummed a good many snatches of popular airs as he walked along still struggling with the refractory fingers of the lavender kid gloves  arrived at saint jamess hall he took up a position outside the door and remained there as if waiting for some one  it was evident that mr queekers brief remark had reference to the proceedings that were going on at the hall because everything in and around it on that occasion gave unquestionable evidence that there was to be a great night there  the lobby blazed with light and resounded with voices and bustle as people streamed in continuously  the interior of the hall itself glowed like a redhot chamber of gold and was tastefully decorated with flowers and flags and evergreens while the floor of the room was covered with long tables which groaned under the glittering accessories of an approaching feast  fair ladies were among the assembling company and busy gentlemen who acted the part of stewards hurried to and fro giving directions and keeping order  a large portion of the company consisted of men whose hard hands powerful frames and bronzed faces proclaimed them the sons of toil and whose manly tones and holiday garments smacked of gales and salt water  what be goin on here measter inquired a country fellow nudging mr queeker with his elbow  queeker looked at his questioner in surprise and told him that it was a supper which was about to be given to the lifeboatmen by the people of the town  an who be the lifeboatmen measter  shades of the mighty dead not to mention the glorious living exclaimed queeker aghast have you never heard of the noble fellows who man the lifeboats all round the coasts of this great country and save hundreds of lives every year  have you not read of their daring exploits in the newspapers  have you never heard of the famous ramsgate lifeboat  well now ee mention it i doos remember summat about loifboats replied the country fellow after pondering a moment or two but bless ee i never read nothin about em not bein able to read an as ive lived all my loif fur inland an ony comed here today it aint to be thowt as i knows much about yer ramsgate loifboats  be there mony loifboat men in ramsgate measter  my good fellow said queeker taking the man by the sleeve and gazing at him with a look of earnest pity there are dozens of em  splendid fellows who have saved hundreds of men women and children from the raging deep and they are all to be assembled in this hall tonight to the number of nearly a hundredfor there are to be present not only the men who now constitute the crew of the ramsgate boat but all the men who have formed part of her crew in time past  every man among them is a hero continued queeker warming as he went on and shaking the country fellows arm in his earnestness and every man tonight will  he stopped short abruptly for at that moment a carriage drove up to the door and a gentleman jumping out assisted a lady to alight  without a word of explanation to the astonished country fellow queeker thrust him aside dashed forward presented himself before the lady and holding out his hand exclaimed  how do you do miss hennings  im so glad to have been fortunate enough to meet you  mr queequeeker exclaimed fanny blushing scarlet ii was not awareso very unexpectedi thoughtdear mebut pardon meallow me to introduce my uncle mr hemmings  mr queeker uncle whom you have often heard mamma speak about  mr hennings a sixfeettwo man stooped to shake queeker by the hand an impatient cabman shouted move on  fanny seized her uncles arm and was led away  queeker followed close and all three were wedged together in the crowd and swept towards the banquethall  are you one of the stewards asked fanny during a momentary pause  how exquisite she looks thought queeker as she glanced over her shoulder at him  he felt inclined to call her an angel or something of that sort but restrained himself and replied that he was not a steward but a guestan honoured guestand that he would have no objection to be a dishonoured guest if only by being expelled from the festive board he could manage to find an excuse to sit beside her in the ladies gallery  but that may not be he said with a sigh  i shall not be able to see you from my allotted position  alas we separate herethough thoughlost to sight to memory dear  the latter part of this remark was said hurriedly and in desperation in consequence of a sudden rush of the crowd rendering abrupt separation unavoidable  but although parted from his ladylove and unable to gaze upon her queeker kept her steadily in his minds eye all that evening made all his speeches to her sang all his songs to her and finallybut hold we must not anticipate  as we have saidor rather as we have recorded that queeker saidall the lifeboat men of the town of ramsgate sat down to that supper to the number of nearly one hundred men  all sturdy men of tried courage some were old with none of the fire that had nerved them to rescue lives in days gone by save that which still gleamed in their eyes some were young with the glow of irrepressible enthusiasm on their smooth faces and the intense wish to have a chance to dare and do swelling their bold hearts others were middleaged ironmoulded as able and as bold to the full as the younger men with the coolness and selfrestraint of the old ones but all old middleaged and young looking proud and pleased and so gentle in their demeanour owing no doubt to the presence of the fair sex that it seemed as if a small breeze of wind would have made them all turn tail and run away especially if the breeze were raised by the women  that the reception of these lionlike men converted into lambs that night was hearty was evinced by the thunders of applause which greeted every reference to their brave deeds  that their reception was intensely earnest was made plain by the scroll emblazoned on a huge banner that spanned the upper end of the room bearing the words  god bless the lifeboat crews  we need not refer to the viands set forth on that great occasion  of course they were of the best  we may just mention that they included baccy and grog  we merely record the fact  whether buns and tea would have been equally effective is a question not now under consideration  we refrain from expressing an opinion on that point here  of course the first toast was the queen and as jack always does everything heartily it need scarcely be said that this toast was utterly divested of its usual formality of character  the chairmans appropriate reference to her majestys wellknown sympathy with the distressed especially with those who had suffered from shipwreck intensified the enthusiasm of the loyal lifeboatmen  a band of amateur christy minstrels the genuine original amateur band of course enlivened the evening with appropriate songs to the immense delight of all present especially of mr robert queeker whose passionate love for music ever since his attendance at the singingclass long long ago had strengthened with time to such an extent that language fails to convey any idea of it  it mattered not to queeker whether the music were good or bad  sufficient for him that it carried him back with a gush to that dear temple of music in yarmouth where the learners were perpetually checked at critical points and told by their callous teacher tormentor we had almost written to try it again and where he first beheld the perplexing and beautiful fanny  when the toast of the evening was givensuccess to the ramsgate lifeboatit was as a matter of course received with deafening cheers and enthusiastic waving of handkerchiefs from the gallery in which the fair sex were accommodated among which handkerchiefs queeker by turning his head very much round tried to see and believed that he saw the precious bit of cambric wherewith fanny hennings was accustomed to salute her transcendental nose  the chairman spoke with enthusiasm of the noble deeds accomplished by the ramsgate lifeboat in time past and referred with pride and with a touch of feeling to the brave old coxswain then present loud cheers who had been compelled by increasing years to resign a service which they all knew better than he did taxed the energies courage and endurance of the stoutest and youngest man among them to the uttermost  he expressed a firm belief in the courage and prowess of the coxswain who had succeeded him renewed cheers and felt assured that the success of the boat in time to come would at the least fully equal its successes in time past  he then referred to some of the more prominent achievements of the boat especially to a night which all of them must remember seven years ago when the ramsgate boat with the aid of the steamtug was the means of saving so many livesnot to mention propertyand among others the life of their brave townsman james welton cheers and a young doctor the friend and now the soninlaw of one whose genial spirit and extensive charities were well known and highly appreciatedhe referred to mr george durant renewed cheers whose niece at that moment graced the gallery with her presence  at this there was a burst of loud and prolonged applause which terminated in a roar of laughter owing to the fact that mr queeker cheering and waving his hands in a state of wild enthusiasm knocked the neck off a bottle of wine and flooded the table in his immediate vicinity  covered with confusion queeker sat down amid continued laughter and rapturous applause  the chairman then went on to say that the event to which he had referredthe rescue of the crew and passengers of the wellington on the night of the great stormhad been eclipsed by some of the more recent doings of the same boat and after touching upon some of these said that although they had met there to do honour to the crews of their own lifeboat they must not forget other and neighbouring lifeboats which did their work noblythe brave crews of which were represented by the coxswains of the margate and broadstairs lifeboats who sat at that board that night as honoured guests loud cheers during which several of the men nearest to them shook hands with the coxswains referred to he could notthe chairman went on to saysit down without making special reference to the steamtug without which and the courage as well as knowledge of her master mate and crew renewed cheers the lifeboat could not overtake a tenth part of the noble work which she annually accomplished  he concluded by praying that a kind providence would continue to watch over and bless the ramsgate lifeboat and her crew  we need scarcely add that this toast was drunk with enthusiastic applause and that it was followed up by the amateur minstrels with admirable effect  many songs were sung and many toasts were proposed that night and warm was the expression of feeling towards the men who were ever so ready to imperil their lives in the hope of saving those of their fellowcreatures and who had already oftentimes given such ample proof that they were thoroughly able to do as well as to dare almost anything  several singers with good and one or two with splendid voices gave a variety of songs which greatly enhanced the brilliancy of the evening and were highly appreciated in the gallery and a few bad singers with miserable voices who volunteered their songs did really good service by impressing upon the audience very forcibly the immense differences between good and bad music and thus kindly acted as shadows to the vocal lights of the eveningas useful touches of discord in the general harmony which by contrast rendered the latter all the sweeter  but of all the solos sung that night none afforded such delight as a national melody sung by our friend jerry macgowl in a voice that rang out like the voices of three firstclass bosns rolled into one  that worthy son of the emerald isle and dick moy and jack shales happened to be enjoying their month on shore when the supper to the lifeboatmen was planned and they were all there in virtue of their having been instrumental in saving life on more than one occasion during their residence in ramsgate  jerrys song was as we have said highly appreciated but the applause with which it was greeted was as nothing compared with the shouts and cheers that shook the roof of saint jamess hall when on being asked to repeat it jerry modestly said that he would prefer to give them a duetperhaps it was a trayoav his mates jack shales and dick moy would only strike in wid bass and tenor  the men of the floating light then sang the minutegun at sea magnificently each taking the part that suited him best or struck his fancy at the moment and jerry varying from tenor to bass and bass to treble according to taste  now mister chairman said the bold jerry macgowl when the cheers had subsided its my turn to call for a song so i ax mr queeker to favour the company wid thunders of applause drowned the remainder of the sentence  poor queeker was thrown into great confusion and sought to explain that he could not sing even in privatemuch less in public  oh yes you can sir  try it sir no fear of ee  sure its yourself as can do it an no mistake were the remarks with which his explanation was interrupted  i assure you honestly cried queeker that i cannot sing but here breathless silence ensued if the chairman will kindly permit me i will give you a toast  loud cheers from all sides and a goodhumoured nod from the chairman greeted this announcement  mr chairman and friends said queeker the ladies have a perfect storm of laughter and cheers interrupted him for at least two minutes  yes resumed queeker suddenly blazing up with enthusiasm i repeat the ladies  thats the girls blissins on the swate darlints murmured jerry in a tone which set the whole table again in a roar  i echo the sentiment blessings on them said queeker with a goodhumoured glance at jerry  yes as i was going to say i propose the ladies who are always were and ever will be the solace of mans life the sweet drops in his otherwise bitter cup the lights in his otherwise dark dwelling the jewels in hisin hiscrown and the bright stars that glitter in the otherwise dark firmament of his destiny vociferous cheering  yes continued queeker waxing more and more energetic and striking the table with his fist whereby he overturned his neighbours glass of grog yes i reassert itthe ladies are all that and much more  hear hear  i propose their healthand after all i may be said to have some sort of claim to do so having already unintentionally poured a whole bottle of wine on the tablecloth as a libation to them  laughter and applause  what i ask continued queeker raising his voice and hand at the same moment and setting his hair straight upon end what i ask would man be without the ladies  what indeed said a voice near the foot of the table which called forth another burst of laughter just try to think my friends what would be the hideous gloom of this terrestrial ball if there were no girls  oh woman softener of mans rugged nature  what in the words of the poet  he carefully refrained from saying what poet    what were earth and all its joys   what were wealth with all its toys   what the life of men and boys   but for lovely woman    what if mothers were no more   if wives and sisters fled our shore   and left no sweethearts to the fore   no sign of darling woman    what dreary darkness would ensue   what moral wastes devoid of dew   if no strong hearts of men like you   beat for charming woman    who would rise at dutys call   who would fight to win or fall   who would care to live at all   were it not for woman  prolonged and rapturous cheers greeted this effusion in the midst of which the enthusiastic jerry macgowl sprang to his feet waved his glass above his headspilling half of its contents on the pate of a bald skipper who sat next to himand cheered lustily  men of the ramsgate lifeboat shouted queeker i call on you to pledge the ladieswith all the honours  it is unnecessary to say that the call was responded to with a degree of enthusiasm that threatened as dick moy said to jack shales to smash all the glasses an blow the roof off  in the midst of the noise and confusion queeker left the hall ascended to the gallery and sat himself down beside fanny hennings with an air of intense decision  oh mr queeker exclaimed fanny  listen fanny said the tall uncle at that moment they are giving one of the most important toasts of the eveningthe royal national lifeboat institution  fanny tried to listen and had caught a few words when she felt her hand suddenly seized and held fast  turning her head quickly she beheld the face of queeker turned to bright scarlet  what more she heard or saw after that it would be extremely difficult to tell  perhaps the best way of conveying an idea of it is to lay before the reader the short epistle which fanny penned that same night to her old friend katie hall  it ran thus  ramsgate  oh katie  darling katiehe has done it at last  dear fellow and so like himself tooso romantically so poetically  they were toasting the lifeboat institution at the time  he seized my hand fanny he said in the deep manly tones in which he had just made the most brilliant speech of the evening fanny my lovemy lifemy lifeboatwill you have me will you save me  there was a dreadful noise at the timea very storm of cheering  the whole room seemed in a whirl  my head was in a whirl too and oh how my heart beat  i dont know what i said  i fear i burst into a fit of laughter and then cried and dear uncle carried me outbut its all over now  that darling lifeboat institution i shall never forget it for they were sounding its praises at the very moment when my queeker and i got into the same boatfor lifeyour happy fanny  to this the next post brought the following reply  yarmouth  my dearest fannyis it necessary for me to say that your last short letter has filled my heart with joy  it has cleared up a mystery too on tuesday last in the forenoon mr queeker came by appointment to take lunch with us and stanley happened to mention that a supper was to be given to the ramsgate lifeboatmen and that he had heard you were to be there  during lunch mr queeker was very absent and restless and appeared to be unhappy  at last he started up made some hurried apology about the train for the south and having urgent business to transact looked at his watch and rushed out of the house  we could not understand it at the time but i knew that he had only a few minutes left to catch the train for the south and i now know that he caught itand why  ah fanny did i not always assure you that he would do it in desperation at last  my earnest prayer is that your wedded life may be as happy as mine has hitherto been  when your honeymoon is over you must promise to pay us a visit  you know that our villa is sufficiently far out of town to warrant your regarding us in the light of country friends and stanley bids me say that he will take no denial  papawho is at present romping round the room with my eldest boy on his shoulders so that i scarce know what i writebids me tell you with his kind love and hearty congratulations that he thinks you are not throwing yourself away for that queeker is a firstrate little fellow and a rising man  observe please that i quote papas own words  i must stop abruptly because a tiny cry from the nursery informs me that king baby is awake and demands instant attentionwith kindest love and congratulations your ever affectionate katie hall    chapter twenty four  conclusion  once again and for the last time we visit the floating light  it was a calm sunny evening about the end of autumn when the trinity tender having effected the relief of the old gull left her in order to perform the same service for her sister lightvessels  goodbye welton goodbye lads cried the superintendent waving his hand as the tenders boat pushed off and left them for another period of duty in their floating home  goodbye sir replied the mate and men touching their caps  now sir said dick moy to the mate shortly after when they were all except the watch assembled below round the galley stove are you goin to let us ave a bit o that there letter accordin to promise  what letter inquired jack shales who having only accomplished half of his period of service on boardone monthhad not come off with his comrades and knew little or nothing of what had occurred on shore  a letter from the lighthouse from jim said the mate lighting his pipe received it this forenoon just as we were gettin ready to come off  all well and hearty i hope asked jerry macgowl seating himself on a bench and rolling some tobacco between his palms preparatory to filling his pipe  all well replied the mate pulling out the letter in question and regarding the address with much interest an strange news in it  well then lets ear wot its all about said dick moy theres time to read it afore sunset an it aint fair to keep fellers in all the hagonies of hexpectation  thats true enough said jerry with a grin  arrah its bustin i am already wid kooriosity  heave ahead sir an be marciful  thus entreated mr welton glanced at his watch sat down and opening his letter read as follows  dear fatherhere we are thank god comfortably settled in the new lighthouse and nora and i both agree that although it is more outlandish it is much more cheerful in every way than our last abode although it is very wildlike and far from the mainland  billy towler my assistantwho has become such a strapping fellow that youd scarce know himis also much pleased with it  the children too give a decided opinion in favour of the place and even the baby little morley seems to know that he has made a change for the better  babys name brings me to the news that ive got to tell you  morley jones has come back  youll be surprised to hear that i daresay but its a fact  he got a ticketofleave and never rested till he found out where nora was  he came to us one evening some time ago and fell down in a sort of fit close to the lighthousedoor while nora was sitting in front of it and the children were romping with neptune beside her  poor fellow he was so changed so old and so whitehaired and worn that we did not know him at first but after we had washed the blood off his facefor he had cut himself when he felli recognised the old features  but he is changed in other respects too in a way that has filled my dear wifes heart with joy  of course you are aware that he got no drink during the seven years of his imprisonment  now that he is free he refuses to let a drop of anything stronger than water pass his lips he thinks it is his only chance and i believe he is right  he says that nothing but the thought of nora and the hope of one day being permitted to return to ask her forgiveness on his knees enabled him to endure his long captivity with resignation  i do assure you father that it almost brings tears to my eyes to see the way in which that man humbles himself before his daughter  noras joy is far too deep for words but it is written plainly in her face  she spent all her spare time with him at first reading the bible to him and trying to convince him that it was not the thought of her but gods mercy and love that had put it into his heart to repent and desire to reform  he does not seem quite inclined to take that view of it but he will come to it sooner or later for we have the sure promise that the lord will finish the good work he has begun  we have hired a room for him in a little village within half a mile of us  it is small but comfortable enough and he seems to be quite content with itas well he may be with nora and the children going constantly about him  i tell you what father the longer i live with nora the more i feel that i have got the truesthearted and most loveable wife in all the wide world  the people of the village would go any length to serve her and as to their children i believe they worship the ground she walks on as jerry macgowl used to say  och the idolatrous haythens growled jerry  and the way she manages our dear youngsters continued the mate reading on without noticing jerrys interruption would do your heart good to see  it reminds me of dick moys wife who is about the best mother i ever met withnext to nora of course  humph said dick with a grim smile wery complimentary  i wonder wot my old ooman will say to that  shell say no doubt that shell expect you to take example by jim welton when speaking of your wife observed jack shales  i wonder dick what ever could have induced mrs moy to marry such a fellow as you  i spose retorted dick lighting his pipe that it was to escape the chance o bein tempted in a moment of weakness to marry the likes o you  hear hear cried macgowl thats not unlikely dick  an sure she might have gone farther an fared worse  youre a good lump of a man anyhow though you havent much to boast of in the way of looks howsever it seems to me that looks dont go far wid sensible girls faix the uglier a man is its the better chance he has o gittin a purty wife  i have a brother myself whos a dale uglier than the figurhead of an owld dutch galliot an hes married the purtiest little girl in ireland he has  if ye want to hear the end of jims letter boys youd better shut up your potatotraps interposed mr welton  thats truefire away said shales  the mate continued to read  youll be glad to hear that the old dog neptune is well and hearty  he is a great favourite here especially with the children  billy towler has taught him a number of tricksamong other things he can dive like a seal and has no objection whatever to let little morley choke him or half punch out his eyes  tell mother not to be uneasy on that point for though neptune has the heart of a lion he has the temper of a lamb  there is an excellent preacher belonging to the wesleyan body who comes here occasionally on sundays and has worship in the village  he is not much of a preacher but hes an earnest godfearing man and has made the name of jesus dear to some of the people here who not long ago were quite careless about their souls  careless about their souls oh father how often i think of that now  how strange it seems that we should ever be thus careless  what should we say of the jeweller who would devote all his time and care to the case that held his largest diamond and neglect the gem itself  nora has got up a sunday school at the village and billy helps her with it  the grotto did wonders for himso he says himself  i must close this letter sooner than i intended for i hear noras voice like sweet music in the distance singing out that dinner is ready and if i keep the youngsters waiting long theyll sing out in a sharper strain of melody  so now father goodbye for the present  we all unite in sending our warmest love to dear mother and yourself  kindest remembrances also to my friends in the floating light  as much of my heart as nora and the children can spare is on board of the old gull  may god bless you allyour affectionate son james welton  the sun will be down in a few minutes sir said the watch looking down the hatchway while the men were engaged in commenting on jims letter  i know that replied the mate glancing at his timepiece as he went on deck  the upper edge of the sun was just visible above the horizon gleaming through the haze like a speck of ruddy fire  the shipping in the downs rested on a sea so calm that each rope and mast and yard was faithfully reflected  ramsgatewith the exception of its highest spireswas overshadowed by the wing of approaching night  the goodwin sands were partially uncovered looking calm and harmless enough with only a snowy ripple on their northern extremity where they were gently kissed by the swell of the north sea and with nothing save a riven stump or a halfburied stempost to tell of the storms and wrecks with which their name is so sadly associated  all around breathed of peace and tranquillity when the mate having cast a searching glance round the horizon leaned over the hatchway and shoutedlights up  the customary ay ay sir was followed by the prompt appearance of the crew  the winch was manned the signal given and just as the sun went down the floating light went up to scatter its guiding and warning beams far and wide across the darkening waste of water  may our little volume prove a truthful reflector to catch up a few of those beams and diverting them from their legitimate direction turn them in upon the shore to enlighten the mind and tickle the fancy of those who dwell upon the landand thus perchance add another thread to the bond of sympathy already existing between them and those whose lot it is to battle with the winds and live upon the sea
