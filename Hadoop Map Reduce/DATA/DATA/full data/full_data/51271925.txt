times    down the oise  church interiors    precy and the marionnettes    back to the world    preface to the first edition    to equip so small a book with a preface is i am half afraid to sin against proportion  but a preface is more than an author can resist for it is the reward of his labours  when the foundation stone is laid the architect appears with his plans and struts for an hour before the public eye  so with the writer in his preface he may have never a word to say but he must show himself for a moment in the portico hat in hand and with an urbane demeanour  it is best in such circumstances to represent a delicate shade of manner between humility and superiority  as if the book had been written by some one else and you had merely run over it and inserted what was good  but for my part i have not yet learned the trick to that perfection i am not yet able to dissemble the warmth of my sentiments towards a reader and if i meet him on the threshold it is to invite him in with country cordiality  to say truth i had no sooner finished reading this little book in proof than i was seized upon by a distressing apprehension  it occurred to me that i might not only be the first to read these pages but the last as well that i might have pioneered this very smiling tract of country all in vain and find not a soul to follow in my steps  the more i thought the more i disliked the notion until the distaste grew into a sort of panic terror and i rushed into this preface which is no more than an advertisement for readers  what am i to say for my book  caleb and joshua brought back from palestine a formidable bunch of grapes alas my book produces naught so nourishing and for the matter of that we live in an age when people prefer a definition to any quantity of fruit  i wonder would a negative be found enticing for from the negative point of view i flatter myself this volume has a certain stamp  although it runs to considerably upwards of two hundred pages it contains not a single reference to the imbecility of gods universe nor so much as a single hint that i could have made a better one myselfi really do not know where my head can have been  i seem to have forgotten all that makes it glorious to be mantis an omission that renders the book philosophically unimportant but i am in hopes the eccentricity may please in frivolous circles  to the friend who accompanied me i owe many thanks already indeed i wish i owed him nothing else but at this moment i feel towards him an almost exaggerated tenderness  he at least will become my reader if it were only to follow his own travels alongside of mine  rls    antwerp to boom    we made a great stir in antwerp docks  a stevedore and a lot of dock porters took up the two canoes and ran with them for the slip  a crowd of children followed cheering  the cigarette went off in a splash and a bubble of small breaking water  next moment the arethusa was after her  a steamer was coming down men on the paddlebox shouted hoarse warnings the stevedore and his porters were bawling from the quay  but in a stroke or two the canoes were away out in the middle of the scheldt and all steamers and stevedores and other longshore vanities were left behind  the sun shone brightly the tide was makingfour jolly miles an hour the wind blew steadily with occasional squalls  for my part i had never been in a canoe under sail in my life and my first experiment out in the middle of this big river was not made without some trepidation  what would happen when the wind first caught my little canvas  i suppose it was almost as trying a venture into the regions of the unknown as to publish a first book or to marry  but my doubts were not of long duration and in five minutes you will not be surprised to learn that i had tied my sheet  i own i was a little struck by this circumstance myself of course in company with the rest of my fellowmen i had always tied the sheet in a sailingboat but in so little and crank a concern as a canoe and with these charging squalls i was not prepared to find myself follow the same principle and it inspired me with some contemptuous views of our regard for life  it is certainly easier to smoke with the sheet fastened but i had never before weighed a comfortable pipe of tobacco against an obvious risk and gravely elected for the comfortable pipe  it is a commonplace that we cannot answer for ourselves before we have been tried  but it is not so common a reflection and surely more consoling that we usually find ourselves a great deal braver and better than we thought  i believe this is every ones experience  but an apprehension that they may belie themselves in the future prevents mankind from trumpeting this cheerful sentiment abroad  i wish sincerely for it would have saved me much trouble there had been some one to put me in a good heart about life when i was younger to tell me how dangers are most portentous on a distant sight and how the good in a mans spirit will not suffer itself to be overlaid and rarely or never deserts him in the hour of need  but we are all for tootling on the sentimental flute in literature and not a man among us will go to the head of the march to sound the heady drums  it was agreeable upon the river  a barge or two went past laden with hay  reeds and willows bordered the stream and cattle and grey venerable horses came and hung their mild heads over the embankment  here and there was a pleasant village among trees with a noisy shippingyard here and there a villa in a lawn  the wind served us well up the scheldt and thereafter up the rupel and we were running pretty free when we began to sight the brickyards of boom lying for a long way on the right bank of the river  the left bank was still green and pastoral with alleys of trees along the embankment and here and there a flight of steps to serve a ferry where perhaps there sat a woman with her elbows on her knees or an old gentleman with a staff and silver spectacles  but boom and its brickyards grew smokier and shabbier with every minute until a great church with a clock and a wooden bridge over the river indicated the central quarters of the town  boom is not a nice place and is only remarkable for one thing that the majority of the inhabitants have a private opinion that they can speak english which is not justified by fact  this gave a kind of haziness to our intercourse  as for the hotel de la navigation i think it is the worst feature of the place  it boasts of a sanded parlour with a bar at one end looking on the street and another sanded parlour darker and colder with an empty birdcage and a tricolour subscription box by way of sole adornment where we made shift to dine in the company of three uncommunicative engineer apprentices and a silent bagman  the food as usual in belgium was of a nondescript occasional character indeed i have never been able to detect anything in the nature of a meal among this pleasing people they seem to peck and trifle with viands all day long in an amateur spirit  tentatively french truly german and somehow falling between the two  the empty birdcage swept and garnished and with no trace of the old piping favourite save where two wires had been pushed apart to hold its lump of sugar carried with it a sort of graveyard cheer the engineer apprentices would have nothing to say to us nor indeed to the bagman but talked low and sparingly to one another or raked us in the gaslight with a gleam of spectacles  for though handsome lads they were all in the scots phrase barnacled  there was an english maid in the hotel who had been long enough out of england to pick up all sorts of funny foreign idioms and all sorts of curious foreign ways which need not here be specified  she spoke to us very fluently in her jargon asked us information as to the manners of the present day in england and obligingly corrected us when we attempted to answer  but as we were dealing with a woman perhaps our information was not so much thrown away as it appeared  the sex likes to pick up knowledge and yet preserve its superiority  it is good policy and almost necessary in the circumstances  if a man finds a woman admire him were it only for his acquaintance with geography he will begin at once to build upon the admiration  it is only by unintermittent snubbing that the pretty ones can keep us in our place  men as miss howe or miss harlowe would have said are such encroachers for my part i am body and soul with the women and after a well married couple there is nothing so beautiful in the world as the myth of the divine huntress  it is no use for a man to take to the woods we know him st anthony tried the same thing long ago and had a pitiful time of it by all accounts  but there is this about some women which overtops the best gymnosophist among men that they suffice to themselves and can walk in a high and cold zone without the countenance of any trousered being  i declare although the reverse of a professed ascetic i am more obliged to women for this ideal than i should be to the majority of them or indeed to any but one for a spontaneous kiss  there is nothing so encouraging as the spectacle of selfsufficiency  and when i think of the slim and lovely maidens running the woods all night to the note of dianas horn moving among the old oaks as fancyfree as they things of the forest and the starlight not touched by the commotion of mans hot and turbid lifealthough there are plenty other ideals that i should preferi find my heart beat at the thought of this one  tis to fail in life but to fail with what a grace  that is not lost which is not regretted  and wherehere slips out the malewhere would be much of the glory of inspiring love if there were no contempt to overcome    on the willebroek canal    next morning when we set forth on the willebroek canal the rain began heavy and chill  the water of the canal stood at about the drinking temperature of tea and under this cold aspersion the surface was covered with steam  the exhilaration of departure and the easy motion of the boats under each stroke of the paddles supported us through this misfortune while it lasted and when the cloud passed and the sun came out again our spirits went up above the range of stayathome humours  a good breeze rustled and shivered in the rows of trees that bordered the canal  the leaves flickered in and out of the light in tumultuous masses  it seemed sailing weather to eye and ear but down between the banks the wind reached us only in faint and desultory puffs  there was hardly enough to steer by  progress was intermittent and unsatisfactory  a jocular person of marine antecedents hailed us from the towpath with a cest vite mais cest long  the canal was busy enough  every now and then we met or overtook a long string of boats with great green tillers high sterns with a window on either side of the rudder and perhaps a jug or a flower pot in one of the windows a dinghy following behind a woman busied about the days dinner and a handful of children  these barges were all tied one behind the other with tow ropes to the number of twentyfive or thirty and the line was headed and kept in motion by a steamer of strange construction  it had neither paddlewheel nor screw but by some gear not rightly comprehensible to the unmechanical mind it fetched up over its bow a small bright chain which lay along the bottom of the canal and paying it out again over the stern dragged itself forward link by link with its whole retinue of loaded skows  until one had found out the key to the enigma there was something solemn and uncomfortable in the progress of one of these trains as it moved gently along the water with nothing to mark its advance but an eddy alongside dying away into the wake  of all the creatures of commercial enterprise a canal barge is by far the most delightful to consider  it may spread its sails and then you see it sailing high above the treetops and the windmill sailing on the aqueduct sailing through the green cornlands  the most picturesque of things amphibious  or the horse plods along at a footpace as if there were no such thing as business in the world and the man dreaming at the tiller sees the same spire on the horizon all day long  it is a mystery how things ever get to their destination at this rate and to see the barges waiting their turn at a lock affords a fine lesson of how easily the world may be taken  there should be many contented spirits on board for such a life is both to travel and to stay at home  the chimney smokes for dinner as you go along the banks of the canal slowly unroll their scenery to contemplative eyes the barge floats by great forests and through great cities with their public buildings and their lamps at night and for the bargee in his floating home travelling abed it is merely as if he were listening to another mans story or turning the leaves of a picturebook in which he had no concern  he may take his afternoon walk in some foreign country on the banks of the canal and then come home to dinner at his own fireside  there is not enough exercise in such a life for any high measure of health but a high measure of health is only necessary for unhealthy people  the slug of a fellow who is never ill nor well has a quiet time of it in life and dies all the easier  i am sure i would rather be a bargee than occupy any position under heaven that required attendance at an office  there are few callings i should say where a man gives up less of his liberty in return for regular meals  the bargee is on shipboardhe is master in his own shiphe can land whenever he willhe can never be kept beating off a leeshore a whole frosty night when the sheets are as hard as iron and so far as i can make out time stands as nearly still with him as is compatible with the return of bedtime or the dinnerhour  it is not easy to see why a bargee should ever die  halfway between willebroek and villevorde in a beautiful reach of canal like a squires avenue we went ashore to lunch  there were two eggs a junk of bread and a bottle of wine on board the arethusa and two eggs and an etna cooking apparatus on board the cigarette  the master of the latter boat smashed one of the eggs in the course of disembarkation but observing pleasantly that it might still be cooked a la papier he dropped it into the etna in its covering of flemish newspaper  we landed in a blink of fine weather but we had not been two minutes ashore before the wind freshened into half a gale and the rain began to patter on our shoulders  we sat as close about the etna as we could  the spirits burned with great ostentation the grass caught flame every minute or two and had to be trodden out and before long there were several burnt fingers of the party  but the solid quantity of cookery accomplished was out of proportion with so much display and when we desisted after two applications of the fire the sound egg was little more than loowarm and as for a la papier it was a cold and sordid fricassee of printers ink and broken eggshell we made shift to roast the other two by putting them close to the burning spirits and that with better success  and then we uncorked the bottle of wine and sat down in a ditch with our canoe aprons over our knees  it rained smartly  discomfort when it is honestly uncomfortable and makes no nauseous pretensions to the contrary is a vastly humorous business and people well steeped and stupefied in the open air are in a good vein for laughter from this point of view even egg a la papier offered by way of food may pass muster as a sort of accessory to the fun  but this manner of jest although it may be taken in good part does not invite repetition and from that time forward the etna voyaged like a gentleman in the locker of the cigarette  it is almost unnecessary to mention that when lunch was over and we got aboard again and made sail the wind promptly died away  the rest of the journey to villevorde we still spread our canvas to the unfavouring air and with now and then a puff and now and then a spell of paddling drifted along from lock to lock between the orderly trees  it was a fine green fat landscape or rather a mere green water lane going on from village to village  things had a settled look as in places long lived in  cropheaded children spat upon us from the bridges as we went below with a true conservative feeling but even more conservative were the fishermen intent upon their floats who let us go by without one glance  they perched upon sterlings and buttresses and along the slope of the embankment gently occupied  they were indifferent like pieces of dead nature  they did not move any more than if they had been fishing in an old dutch print  the leaves fluttered the water lapped but they continued in one stay like so many churches established by law  you might have trepanned every one of their innocent heads and found no more than so much coiled fishingline below their skulls  i do not care for your stalwart fellows in indiarubber stockings breasting up mountain torrents with a salmon rod but i do dearly love the class of man who plies his unfruitful art for ever and a day by still and depopulated waters  at the last lock just beyond villevorde there was a lockmistress who spoke french comprehensibly and told us we were still a couple of leagues from brussels  at the same place the rain began again it fell in straight parallel lines and the surface of the canal was thrown up into an infinity of little crystal fountains  there were no beds to be had in the neighbourhood  nothing for it but to lay the sails aside and address ourselves to steady paddling in the rain  beautiful country houses with clocks and long lines of shuttered windows and fine old trees standing in groves and avenues gave a rich and sombre aspect in the rain and the deepening dusk to the shores of the canal  i seem to have seen something of the same effect in engravings  opulent landscapes deserted and overhung with the passage of storm  and throughout we had the escort of a hooded cart which trotted shabbily along the towpath and kept at an almost uniform distance in our wake    the royal sport nautique    the rain took off near laeken  but the sun was already down the air was chill and we had scarcely a dry stitch between the pair of us  nay now we found ourselves near the end of the allee verte and on the very threshold of brussels we were confronted by a serious difficulty  the shores were closely lined by canal boats waiting their turn at the lock  nowhere was there any convenient landingplace nowhere so much as a stableyard to leave the canoes in for the night  we scrambled ashore and entered an estaminet where some sorry fellows were drinking with the landlord  the landlord was pretty round with us he knew of no coachhouse or stableyard nothing of the sort and seeing we had come with no mind to drink he did not conceal his impatience to be rid of us one of the sorry fellows came to the rescue  somewhere in the corner of the basin there was a slip he informed us and something else besides not very clearly defined by him but hopefully construed by his hearers  sure enough there was the slip in the corner of the basin and at the top of it two nicelooking lads in boating clothes  the arethusa addressed himself to these  one of them said there would be no difficulty about a nights lodging for our boats and the other taking a cigarette from his lips inquired if they were made by searle and son  the name was quite an introduction  halfa dozen other young men came out of a boathouse bearing the superscription royal sport nautique and joined in the talk  they were all very polite voluble and enthusiastic and their discourse was interlarded with english boating terms and the names of english boatbuilders and english clubs  i do not know to my shame any spot in my native land where i should have been so warmly received by the same number of people  we were english boatingmen and the belgian boatingmen fell upon our necks  i wonder if french huguenots were as cordially greeted by english protestants when they came across the channel out of great tribulation  but after all what religion knits people so closely as a common sport  the canoes were carried into the boathouse they were washed down for us by the club servants the sails were hung out to dry and everything made as snug and tidy as a picture  and in the meanwhile we were led upstairs by our newfound brethren for so more than one of them stated the relationship and made free of their lavatory  this one lent us soap that one a towel a third and fourth helped us to undo our bags  and all the time such questions such assurances of respect and sympathy  i declare i never knew what glory was before  yes yes the royal sport nautique is the oldest club in belgium  we number two hundred  wethis is not a substantive speech but an abstract of many speeches the impression left upon my mind after a great deal of talk and very youthful pleasant natural and patriotic it seems to me to bewe have gained all races except those where we were cheated by the french  you must leave all your wet things to be dried  o entre freres  in any boathouse in england we should find the same  i cordially hope they might  en angleterre vous employez des slidingseats nestce pas  we are all employed in commerce during the day but in the evening voyezvous nous sommes serieux  these were the words  they were all employed over the frivolous mercantile concerns of belgium during the day but in the evening they found some hours for the serious concerns of life  i may have a wrong idea of wisdom but i think that was a very wise remark people connected with literature and philosophy are busy all their days in getting rid of secondhand notions and false standards  it is their profession in the sweat of their brows by dogged thinking to recover their old fresh view of life and distinguish what they really and originally like from what they have only learned to tolerate perforce  and these royal nautical sportsmen had the distinction still quite legible in their hearts  they had still those clean perceptions of what is nice and nasty what is interesting and what is dull which envious old gentlemen refer to as illusions  the nightmare illusion of middle age the bears hug of custom gradually squeezing the life out of a mans soul had not yet begun for these happystarred young belgians  they still knew that the interest they took in their business was a trifling affair compared to their spontaneous longsuffering affection for nautical sports  to know what you prefer instead of humbly saying amen to what the world tells you you ought to prefer is to have kept your soul alive  such a man may be generous he may be honest in something more than the commercial sense he may love his friends with an elective personal sympathy and not accept them as an adjunct of the station to which he has been called  he may be a man in short acting on his own instincts keeping in his own shape that god made him in and not a mere crank in the social enginehouse welded on principles that he does not understand and for purposes that he does not care for  for will any one dare to tell me that business is more entertaining than fooling among boats  he must have never seen a boat or never seen an office who says so  and for certain the one is a great deal better for the health  there should be nothing so much a mans business as his amusements  nothing but moneygrubbing can be put forward to the contrary no one but  mammon the least erected spirit that fell from heaven   durst risk a word in answer  it is but a lying cant that would represent the merchant and the banker as people disinterestedly toiling for mankind and then most useful when they are most absorbed in their transactions for the man is more important than his services  and when my royal nautical sportsman shall have so far fallen from his hopeful youth that he cannot pluck up an enthusiasm over anything but his ledger i venture to doubt whether he will be near so nice a fellow and whether he would welcome with so good a grace a couple of drenched englishmen paddling into brussels in the dusk  when we had changed our wet clothes and drunk a glass of pale ale to the clubs prosperity one of their number escorted us to an hotel  he would not join us at our dinner but he had no objection to a glass of wine  enthusiasm is very wearing and i begin to understand why prophets were unpopular in judaea where they were best known  for three stricken hours did this excellent young man sit beside us to dilate on boats and boatraces and before he left he was kind enough to order our bedroom candles  we endeavoured now and again to change the subject but the diversion did not last a moment  the royal nautical sportsman bridled shied answered the question and then breasted once more into the swelling tide of his subject  i call it his subject but i think it was he who was subjected  the arethusa who holds all racing as a creature of the devil found himself in a pitiful dilemma  he durst not own his ignorance for the honour of old england and spoke away about english clubs and english oarsmen whose fame had never before come to his ears  several times and once above all on the question of slidingseats he was within an ace of exposure  as for the cigarette who has rowed races in the heat of his blood but now disowns these slips of his wanton youth his case was still more desperate for the royal nautical proposed that he should take an oar in one of their eights on the morrow to compare the english with the belgian stroke  i could see my friend perspiring in his chair whenever that particular topic came up and there was yet another proposal which had the same effect on both of us  it appeared that the champion canoeist of europe as well as most other champions was a royal nautical sportsman  and if we would only wait until the sunday this infernal paddler would be so condescending as to accompany us on our next stage  neither of us had the least desire to drive the coursers of the sun against apollo  when the young man was gone we countermanded our candles and ordered some brandy and water  the great billows had gone over our head  the royal nautical sportsmen were as nice young fellows as a man would wish to see but they were a trifle too young and a thought too nautical for us  we began to see that we were old and cynical we liked ease and the agreeable rambling of the human mind about this and the other subject we did not want to disgrace our native land by messing an eight or toiling pitifully in the wake of the champion canoeist  in short we had recourse to flight  it seemed ungrateful but we tried to make that good on a card loaded with sincere compliments  and indeed it was no time for scruples we seemed to feel the hot breath of the champion on our necks    at maubeuge    partly from the terror we had of our good friends the royal nauticals partly from the fact that there were no fewer than fiftyfive locks between brussels and charleroi we concluded that we should travel by train across the frontier boats and all fiftyfive locks in a days journey was pretty well tantamount to trudging the whole distance on foot with the canoes upon our shoulders an object of astonishment to the trees on the canal side and of honest derision to all rightthinking children  to pass the frontier even in a train is a difficult matter for the arethusa  he is somehow or other a marked man for the official eye  wherever he journeys there are the officers gathered together  treaties are solemnly signed foreign ministers ambassadors and consuls sit throned in state from china to peru and the union jack flutters on all the winds of heaven  under these safeguards portly clergymen schoolmistresses gentlemen in grey tweed suits and all the ruck and rabble of british touristry pour unhindered murray in hand over the railways of the continent and yet the slim person of the arethusa is taken in the meshes while these great fish go on their way rejoicing  if he travels without a passport he is cast without any figure about the matter into noisome dungeons  if his papers are in order he is suffered to go his way indeed but not until he has been humiliated by a general incredulity  he is a born british subject yet he has never succeeded in persuading a single official of his nationality  he flatters himself he is indifferent honest yet he is rarely taken for anything better than a spy and there is no absurd and disreputable means of livelihood but has been attributed to him in some heat of official or popular distrust     for the life of me i cannot understand it  i too have been knolled to church and sat at good mens feasts but i bear no mark of it i am as strange as a jack indian to their official spectacles  i might come from any part of the globe it seems except from where i do  my ancestors have laboured in vain and the glorious constitution cannot protect me in my walks abroad  it is a great thing believe me to present a good normal type of the nation you belong to  nobody else was asked for his papers on the way to maubeuge but i was and although i clung to my rights i had to choose at last between accepting the humiliation and being left behind by the train  i was sorry to give way but i wanted to get to maubeuge  maubeuge is a fortified town with a very good inn the grand cerf it seemed to be inhabited principally by soldiers and bagmen at least these were all that we saw except the hotel servants  we had to stay there some time for the canoes were in no hurry to follow us and at last stuck hopelessly in the customhouse until we went back to liberate them  there was nothing to do nothing to see  we had good meals which was a great matter but that was all  the cigarette was nearly taken up upon a charge of drawing the fortifications  a feat of which he was hopelessly incapable  and besides as i suppose each belligerent nation has a plan of the others fortified places already these precautions are of the nature of shutting the stable door after the steed is away  but i have no doubt they help to keep up a good spirit at home  it is a great thing if you can persuade people that they are somehow or other partakers in a mystery  it makes them feel bigger  even the freemasons who have been shown up to satiety preserve a kind of pride and not a grocer among them however honest harmless and emptyheaded he may feel himself to be at bottom but comes home from one of their coenacula with a portentous significance for himself  it is an odd thing how happily two people if there are two can live in a place where they have no acquaintance  i think the spectacle of a whole life in which you have no part paralyses personal desire  you are content to become a mere spectator  the baker stands in his door the colonel with his three medals goes by to the cafe at night the troops drum and trumpet and man the ramparts as bold as so many lions  it would task language to say how placidly you behold all this  in a place where you have taken some root you are provoked out of your indifference you have a hand in the game your friends are fighting with the army  but in a strange town not small enough to grow too soon familiar nor so large as to have laid itself out for travellers you stand so far apart from the business that you positively forget it would be possible to go nearer you have so little human interest around you that you do not remember yourself to be a man  perhaps in a very short time you would be one no longer  gymnosophists go into a wood with all nature seething around them with romance on every side it would be much more to the purpose if they took up their abode in a dull country town where they should see just so much of humanity as to keep them from desiring more and only the stale externals of mans life  these externals are as dead to us as so many formalities and speak a dead language in our eyes and ears they have no more meaning than an oath or a salutation  we are so much accustomed to see married couples going to church of a sunday that we have clean forgotten what they represent and novelists are driven to rehabilitate adultery no less when they wish to show us what a beautiful thing it is for a man and a woman to live for each other  one person in maubeuge however showed me something more than his outside  that was the driver of the hotel omnibus  a mean enough looking little man as well as i can remember but with a spark of something human in his soul  he had heard of our little journey and came to me at once in envious sympathy  how he longed to travel he told me  how he longed to be somewhere else and see the round world before he went into the grave  here i am said he  i drive to the station  well  and then i drive back again to the hotel  and so on every day and all the week round  my god is that life  i could not say i thought it wasfor him  he pressed me to tell him where i had been and where i hoped to go and as he listened i declare the fellow sighed  might not this have been a brave african traveller or gone to the indies after drake  but it is an evil age for the gypsily inclined among men he who can sit squarest on a threelegged stool he it is who has the wealth and glory  i wonder if my friend is still driving the omnibus for the grand cerf  not very likely i believe for i think he was on the eve of mutiny when we passed through and perhaps our passage determined him for good  better a thousand times that he should be a tramp and mend pots and pans by the wayside and sleep under trees and see the dawn and the sunset every day above a new horizon  i think i hear you say that it is a respectable position to drive an omnibus  very well  what right has he who likes it not to keep those who would like it dearly out of this respectable position suppose a dish were not to my taste and you told me that it was a favourite amongst the rest of the company what should i conclude from that  not to finish the dish against my stomach i suppose  respectability is a very good thing in its way but it does not rise superior to all considerations  i would not for a moment venture to hint that it was a matter of taste but i think i will go as far as this  that if a position is admittedly unkind uncomfortable unnecessary and superfluously useless although it were as respectable as the church of england the sooner a man is out of it the better for himself and all concerned    on the sambre canalised    to quartes   about three in the afternoon the whole establishment of the grand cerf accompanied us to the waters edge  the man of the omnibus was there with haggard eyes  poor cagebird  do i not remember the time when i myself haunted the station to watch train after train carry its complement of freemen into the night and read the names of distant places on the timebills with indescribable longings  we were not clear of the fortifications before the rain began  the wind was contrary and blew in furious gusts nor were the aspects of nature any more clement than the doings of the sky  for we passed through a stretch of blighted country sparsely covered with brush but handsomely enough diversified with factory chimneys  we landed in a soiled meadow among some pollards and there smoked a pipe in a flaw of fair weather  but the wind blew so hard we could get little else to smoke  there were no natural objects in the neighbourhood but some sordid workshops  a group of children headed by a tall girl stood and watched us from a little distance all the time we stayed  i heartily wonder what they thought of us  at hautmont the lock was almost impassable the landingplace being steep and high and the launch at a long distance  near a dozen grimy workmen lent us a hand  they refused any reward and what is much better refused it handsomely without conveying any sense of insult  it is a way we have in our countryside said they  and a very becoming way it is  in scotland where also you will get services for nothing the good people reject your money as if you had been trying to corrupt a voter  when people take the trouble to do dignified acts it is worth while to take a little more and allow the dignity to be common to all concerned  but in our brave saxon countries where we plod threescore years and ten in the mud and the wind keeps singing in our ears from birth to burial we do our good and bad with a high hand and almost offensively and make even our alms a witnessbearing and an act of war against the wrong  after hautmont the sun came forth again and the wind went down and a little paddling took us beyond the ironworks and through a delectable land  the river wound among low hills so that sometimes the sun was at our backs and sometimes it stood right ahead and the river before us was one sheet of intolerable glory on either hand meadows and orchards bordered with a margin of sedge and water flowers upon the river  the hedges were of great height woven about the trunks of hedgerow elms and the fields as they were often very small looked like a series of bowers along the stream  there was never any prospect sometimes a hilltop with its trees would look over the nearest hedgerow just to make a middle distance for the sky but that was all  the heaven was bare of clouds  the atmosphere after the rain was of enchanting purity  the river doubled among the hillocks a shining strip of mirror glass and the dip of the paddles set the flowers shaking along the brink  in the meadows wandered black and white cattle fantastically marked  one beast with a white head and the rest of the body glossy black came to the edge to drink and stood gravely twitching his ears at me as i went by like some sort of preposterous clergyman in a play  a moment after i heard a loud plunge and turning my head saw the clergyman struggling to shore  the bank had given way under his feet  besides the cattle we saw no living things except a few birds and a great many fishermen  these sat along the edges of the meadows sometimes with one rod sometimes with as many as half a score they seemed stupefied with contentment and when we induced them to exchange a few words with us about the weather their voices sounded quiet and far away  there was a strange diversity of opinion among them as to the kind of fish for which they set their lures although they were all agreed in this that the river was abundantly supplied  where it was plain that no two of them had ever caught the same kind of fish we could not help suspecting that perhaps not any one of them had ever caught a fish at all  i hope since the afternoon was so lovely that they were one and all rewarded and that a silver booty went home in every basket for the pot  some of my friends would cry shame on me for this but i prefer a man were he only an angler to the bravest pair of gills in all gods waters  i do not affect fishes unless when cooked in sauce whereas an angler is an important piece of river scenery and hence deserves some recognition among canoeists  he can always tell you where you are after a mild fashion and his quiet presence serves to accentuate the solitude and stillness and remind you of the glittering citizens below your boat  the sambre turned so industriously to and fro among his little hills that it was past six before we drew near the lock at quartes  there were some children on the towpath with whom the cigarette fell into a chaffing talk as they ran along beside us it was in vain that i warned him  in vain i told him in english that boys were the most dangerous creatures and if once you began with them it was safe to end in a shower of stones  for my own part whenever anything was addressed to me i smiled gently and shook my head as though i were an inoffensive person inadequately acquainted with french  for indeed i have had such experience at home that i would sooner meet many wild animals than a troop of healthy urchins  but i was doing injustice to these peaceable young hainaulters when the cigarette went off to make inquiries i got out upon the bank to smoke a pipe and superintend the boats and became at once the centre of much amiable curiosity  the children had been joined by this time by a young woman and a mild lad who had lost an arm and this gave me more security  when i let slip my first word or so in french a little girl nodded her head with a comical grownup air  ah you see she said he understands well enough now he was just making believe  and the little group laughed together very goodnaturedly  they were much impressed when they heard we came from england and the little girl proffered the information that england was an island and a far way from herebien loin dici  ay you may say that a far way from here said the lad with one arm  i was as nearly homesick as ever i was in my life they seemed to make it such an incalculable distance to the place where i first saw the day  they admired the canoes very much  and i observed one piece of delicacy in these children which is worthy of record they had been deafening us for the last hundred yards with petitions for a sail ay and they deafened us to the same tune next morning when we came to start but then when the canoes were lying empty there was no word of any such petition  delicacy or perhaps a bit of fear for the water in so crank a vessel  i hate cynicism a great deal worse than i do the devil unless perhaps the two were the same thing  and yet tis a good tonic the cold tub and bathtowel of the sentiments and positively necessary to life in cases of advanced sensibility  from the boats they turned to my costume  they could not make enough of my red sash and my knife filled them with awe  they make them like that in england said the boy with one arm i was glad he did not know how badly we make them in england nowa days  they are for people who go away to sea he added and to defend ones life against great fish  i felt i was becoming a more and more romantic figure to the little group at every word  and so i suppose i was  even my pipe although it was an ordinary french clay pretty well trousered as they call it would have a rarity in their eyes as a thing coming from so far away  and if my feathers were not very fine in themselves they were all from over seas  one thing in my outfit however tickled them out of all politeness and that was the bemired condition of my canvas shoes  i suppose they were sure the mud at any rate was a home product  the little girl who was the genius of the party displayed her own sabots in competition and i wish you could have seen how gracefully and merrily she did it  the young womans milkcan a great amphora of hammered brass stood some way off upon the sward  i was glad of an opportunity to divert public attention from myself and return some of the compliments i had received  so i admired it cordially both for form and colour telling them and very truly that it was as beautiful as gold  they were not surprised  the things were plainly the boast of the countryside  and the children expatiated on the costliness of these amphorae which sell sometimes as high as thirty francs apiece told me how they were carried on donkeys one on either side of the saddle a brave caparison in themselves and how they were to be seen all over the district and at the larger farms in great number and of great size    pontsursambre    we are pedlars   the cigarette returned with good news  there were beds to be had some ten minutes walk from where we were at a place called pont we stowed the canoes in a granary and asked among the children for a guide  the circle at once widened round us and our offers of reward were received in dispiriting silence  we were plainly a pair of bluebeards to the children they might speak to us in public places and where they had the advantage of numbers but it was another thing to venture off alone with two uncouth and legendary characters who had dropped from the clouds upon their hamlet this quiet afternoon sashed and beknived and with a flavour of great voyages  the owner of the granary came to our assistance singled out one little fellow and threatened him with corporalities or i suspect we should have had to find the way for ourselves  as it was he was more frightened at the granary man than the strangers having perhaps had some experience of the former  but i fancy his little heart must have been going at a fine rate for he kept trotting at a respectful distance in front and looking back at us with scared eyes  not otherwise may the children of the young world have guided jove or one of his olympian compeers on an adventure  a miry lane led us up from quartes with its church and bickering windmill  the hinds were trudging homewards from the fields  a brisk little woman passed us by  she was seated across a donkey between a pair of glittering milkcans and as she went she kicked jauntily with her heels upon the donkeys side and scattered shrill remarks among the wayfarers  it was notable that none of the tired men took the trouble to reply  our conductor soon led us out of the lane and across country  the sun had gone down but the west in front of us was one lake of level gold  the path wandered a while in the open and then passed under a trellis like a bower indefinitely prolonged  on either hand were shadowy orchards cottages lay low among the leaves and sent their smoke to heaven every here and there in an opening appeared the great gold face of the west  i never saw the cigarette in such an idyllic frame of mind  he waxed positively lyrical in praise of country scenes  i was little less exhilarated myself the mild air of the evening the shadows the rich lights and the silence made a symphonious accompaniment about our walk and we both determined to avoid towns for the future and sleep in hamlets  at last the path went between two houses and turned the party out into a wide muddy highroad bordered as far as the eye could reach on either hand by an unsightly village  the houses stood well back leaving a ribbon of waste land on either side of the road where there were stacks of firewood carts barrows rubbish heaps and a little doubtful grass  away on the left a gaunt tower stood in the middle of the street  what it had been in past ages i know not  probably a hold in time of war but nowadays it bore an illegible dialplate in its upper parts and near the bottom an iron letterbox  the inn to which we had been recommended at quartes was full or else the landlady did not like our looks  i ought to say that with our long damp indiarubber bags we presented rather a doubtful type of civilisation  like ragandbone men the cigarette imagined  these gentlemen are pedlarsces messieurs sont des marchandsasked the landlady  and then without waiting for an answer which i suppose she thought superfluous in so plain a case recommended us to a butcher who lived hard by the tower and took in travellers to lodge  thither went we  but the butcher was flitting and all his beds were taken down  or else he didnt like our look  as a parting shot we had these gentlemen are pedlars  it began to grow dark in earnest  we could no longer distinguish the faces of the people who passed us by with an inarticulate good evening  and the householders of pont seemed very economical with their oil for we saw not a single window lighted in all that long village  i believe it is the longest village in the world but i daresay in our predicament every pace counted three times over  we were much cast down when we came to the last auberge and looking in at the dark door asked timidly if we could sleep there for the night  a female voice assented in no very friendly tones  we clapped the bags down and found our way to chairs  the place was in total darkness save a red glow in the chinks and ventilators of the stove  but now the landlady lit a lamp to see her new guests i suppose the darkness was what saved us another expulsion for i cannot say she looked gratified at our appearance we were in a large bare apartment adorned with two allegorical prints of music and painting and a copy of the law against public drunkenness  on one side there was a bit of a bar with some halfadozen bottles  two labourers sat waiting supper in attitudes of extreme weariness a plainlooking lass bustled about with a sleepy child of two and the landlady began to derange the pots upon the stove and set some beefsteak to grill  these gentlemen are pedlars she asked sharply  and that was all the conversation forthcoming  we began to think we might be pedlars after all  i never knew a population with so narrow a range of conjecture as the innkeepers of pontsursambre  but manners and bearing have not a wider currency than banknotes  you have only to get far enough out of your beat and all your accomplished airs will go for nothing  these hainaulters could see no difference between us and the average pedlar  indeed we had some grounds for reflection while the steak was getting ready to see how perfectly they accepted us at their own valuation and how our best politeness and best efforts at entertainment seemed to fit quite suitably with the character of packmen  at least it seemed a good account of the profession in france that even before such judges we could not beat them at our own weapons  at last we were called to table  the two hinds and one of them looked sadly worn and white in the face as though sick with over work and underfeeding supped off a single plate of some sort of breadberry some potatoes in their jackets a small cup of coffee sweetened with sugarcandy and one tumbler of swipes  the landlady her son and the lass aforesaid took the same  our meal was quite a banquet by comparison  we had some beefsteak not so tender as it might have been some of the potatoes some cheese an extra glass of the swipes and white sugar in our coffee  you see what it is to be a gentlemani beg your pardon what it is to be a pedlar  it had not before occurred to me that a pedlar was a great man in a labourers alehouse but now that i had to enact the part for an evening i found that so it was  he has in his hedge quarters somewhat the same preeminency as the man who takes a private parlour in an hotel  the more you look into it the more infinite are the class distinctions among men and possibly by a happy dispensation there is no one at all at the bottom of the scale no one but can find some superiority over somebody else to keep up his pride withal  we were displeased enough with our fare  particularly the cigarette for i tried to make believe that i was amused with the adventure tough beefsteak and all  according to the lucretian maxim our steak should have been flavoured by the look of the other peoples breadberry  but we did not find it so in practice you may have a headknowledge that other people live more poorly than yourself but it is not agreeablei was going to say it is against the etiquette of the universeto sit at the same table and pick your own superior diet from among their crusts  i had not seen such a thing done since the greedy boy at school with his birthday cake  it was odious enough to witness i could remember and i had never thought to play the part myself  but there again you see what it is to be a pedlar  there is no doubt that the poorer classes in our country are much more charitably disposed than their superiors in wealth  and i fancy it must arise a great deal from the comparative indistinction of the easy and the not so easy in these ranks  a workman or a pedlar cannot shutter himself off from his less comfortable neighbours  if he treats himself to a luxury he must do it in the face of a dozen who cannot  and what should more directly lead to charitable thoughts    thus the poor man camping out in life sees it as it is and knows that every mouthful he puts in his belly has been wrenched out of the fingers of the hungry  but at a certain stage of prosperity as in a balloon ascent the fortunate person passes through a zone of clouds and sublunary matters are thenceforward hidden from his view  he sees nothing but the heavenly bodies all in admirable order and positively as good as new  he finds himself surrounded in the most touching manner by the attentions of providence and compares himself involuntarily with the lilies and the skylarks  he does not precisely sing of course but then he looks so unassuming in his open landau  if all the world dined at one table this philosophy would meet with some rude knocks    pontsursambre    the travelling merchant   like the lackeys in molieres farce when the true nobleman broke in on their high life below stairs we were destined to be confronted with a real pedlar  to make the lesson still more poignant for fallen gentlemen like us he was a pedlar of infinitely more consideration than the sort of scurvy fellows we were taken for  like a lion among mice or a ship of war bearing down upon two cockboats  indeed he did not deserve the name of pedlar at all  he was a travelling merchant  i suppose it was about halfpast eight when this worthy monsieur hector gilliard of maubeuge turned up at the alehouse door in a tilt cart drawn by a donkey and cried cheerily on the inhabitants he was a lean nervous flibbertigibbet of a man with something the look of an actor and something the look of a horsejockey  he had evidently prospered without any of the favours of education for he adhered with stern simplicity to the masculine gender and in the course of the evening passed off some fancy futures in a very florid style of architecture  with him came his wife a comely young woman with her hair tied in a yellow kerchief and their son a little fellow of four in a blouse and military kepi  it was notable that the child was many degrees better dressed than either of the parents  we were informed he was already at a boarding school but the holidays having just commenced he was off to spend them with his parents on a cruise  an enchanting holiday occupation was it not to travel all day with father and mother in the tilt cart full of countless treasures the green country rattling by on either side and the children in all the villages contemplating him with envy and wonder  it is better fun during the holidays to be the son of a travelling merchant than son and heir to the greatest cottonspinner in creation  and as for being a reigning princeindeed i never saw one if it was not master gilliard  while m hector and the son of the house were putting up the donkey and getting all the valuables under lock and key the landlady warmed up the remains of our beefsteak and fried the cold potatoes in slices and madame gilliard set herself to waken the boy who had come far that day and was peevish and dazzled by the light  he was no sooner awake than he began to prepare himself for supper by eating galette unripe pears and cold potatoeswith so far as i could judge positive benefit to his appetite  the landlady fired with motherly emulation awoke her own little girl and the two children were confronted  master gilliard looked at her for a moment very much as a dog looks at his own reflection in a mirror before he turns away  he was at that time absorbed in the galette  his mother seemed crestfallen that he should display so little inclination towards the other sex and expressed her disappointment with some candour and a very proper reference to the influence of years  sure enough a time will come when he will pay more attention to the girls and think a great deal less of his mother  let us hope she will like it as well as she seemed to fancy  but it is odd enough the very women who profess most contempt for mankind as a sex seem to find even its ugliest particulars rather lively and highminded in their own sons  the little girl looked longer and with more interest probably because she was in her own house while he was a traveller and accustomed to strange sights  and besides there was no galette in the case with her  all the time of supper there was nothing spoken of but my young lord  the two parents were both absurdly fond of their child monsieur kept insisting on his sagacity  how he knew all the children at school by name and when this utterly failed on trial how he was cautious and exact to a strange degree and if asked anything he would sit and thinkand think and if he did not know it my faith he wouldnt tell you at allfoi il ne vous le dira pas  which is certainly a very high degree of caution  at intervals m hector would appeal to his wife with his mouth full of beefsteak as to the little fellows age at such or such a time when he had said or done something memorable and i noticed that madame usually poohpoohed these inquiries  she herself was not boastful in her vein but she never had her fill of caressing the child and she seemed to take a gentle pleasure in recalling all that was fortunate in his little existence  no schoolboy could have talked more of the holidays which were just beginning and less of the black schooltime which must inevitably follow after  she showed with a pride perhaps partly mercantile in origin his pockets preposterously swollen with tops and whistles and string when she called at a house in the way of business it appeared he kept her company and whenever a sale was made received a sou out of the profit  indeed they spoiled him vastly these two good people  but they had an eye to his manners for all that and reproved him for some little faults in breeding which occurred from time to time during supper  on the whole i was not much hurt at being taken for a pedlar  i might think that i ate with greater delicacy or that my mistakes in french belonged to a different order but it was plain that these distinctions would be thrown away upon the landlady and the two labourers  in all essential things we and the gilliards cut very much the same figure in the alehouse kitchen  m hector was more at home indeed and took a higher tone with the world but that was explicable on the ground of his driving a donkeycart while we poor bodies tramped afoot  i daresay the rest of the company thought us dying with envy though in no ill sense to be as far up in the profession as the new arrival  and of one thing i am sure  that every one thawed and became more humanised and conversible as soon as these innocent people appeared upon the scene  i would not very readily trust the travelling merchant with any extravagant sum of money but i am sure his heart was in the right place  in this mixed world if you can find one or two sensible places in a manabove all if you should find a whole family living together on such pleasant termsyou may surely be satisfied and take the rest for granted or what is a great deal better boldly make up your mind that you can do perfectly well without the rest and that ten thousand bad traits cannot make a single good one any the less good  it was getting late  m hector lit a stable lantern and went off to his cart for some arrangements and my young gentleman proceeded to divest himself of the better part of his raiment and play gymnastics on his mothers lap and thence on to the floor with accompaniment of laughter  are you going to sleep alone asked the servant lass  theres little fear of that says master gilliard  you sleep alone at school objected his mother  come come you must be a man  but he protested that school was a different matter from the holidays that there were dormitories at school and silenced the discussion with kisses  his mother smiling no one better pleased than she  there certainly was as he phrased it very little fear that he should sleep alone for there was but one bed for the trio  we on our part had firmly protested against one mans accommodation for two and we had a doublebedded pen in the loft of the house furnished beside the beds with exactly three hatpegs and one table  there was not so much as a glass of water  but the window would open by good fortune  some time before i fell asleep the loft was full of the sound of mighty snoring  the gilliards and the labourers and the people of the inn all at it i suppose with one consent  the young moon outside shone very clearly over pontsursambre and down upon the alehouse where all we pedlars were abed    on the sambre canalised    to landrecies   in the morning when we came downstairs the landlady pointed out to us two pails of water behind the streetdoor  voila de leau pour vous debarbouiller says she  and so there we made a shift to wash ourselves while madame gilliard brushed the family boots on the outer doorstep and m hector whistling cheerily arranged some small goods for the days campaign in a portable chest of drawers which formed a part of his baggage  meanwhile the child was letting off waterloo crackers all over the floor  i wonder bythebye what they call waterloo crackers in france perhaps austerlitz crackers  there is a great deal in the point of view  do you remember the frenchman who travelling by way of southampton was put down in waterloo station and had to drive across waterloo bridge  he had a mind to go home again it seems  pont itself is on the river but whereas it is ten minutes walk from quartes by dry land it is six weary kilometres by water  we left our bags at the inn and walked to our canoes through the wet orchards unencumbered  some of the children were there to see us off but we were no longer the mysterious beings of the night before  a departure is much less romantic than an unexplained arrival in the golden evening  although we might be greatly taken at a ghosts first appearance we should behold him vanish with comparative equanimity  the good folk of the inn at pont when we called there for the bags were overcome with marvelling  at sight of these two dainty little boats with a fluttering union jack on each and all the varnish shining from the sponge they began to perceive that they had entertained angels unawares  the landlady stood upon the bridge probably lamenting she had charged so little the son ran to and fro and called out the neighbours to enjoy the sight and we paddled away from quite a crowd of wrapt observers  these gentlemen pedlars indeed  now you see their quality too late  the whole day was showery with occasional drenching plumps  we were soaked to the skin then partially dried in the sun then soaked once more  but there were some calm intervals and one notably when we were skirting the forest of mormal a sinister name to the ear but a place most gratifying to sight and smell it looked solemn along the riverside drooping its boughs into the water and piling them up aloft into a wall of leaves  what is a forest but a city of natures own full of hardy and innocuous living things where there is nothing dead and nothing made with the hands but the citizens themselves are the houses and public monuments  there is nothing so much alive and yet so quiet as a woodland and a pair of people swinging past in canoes feel very small and bustling by comparison  and surely of all smells in the world the smell of many trees is the sweetest and most fortifying  the sea has a rude pistolling sort of odour that takes you in the nostrils like snuff and carries with it a fine sentiment of open water and tall ships but the smell of a forest which comes nearest to this in tonic quality surpasses it by many degrees in the quality of softness again the smell of the sea has little variety but the smell of a forest is infinitely changeful it varies with the hour of the day not in strength merely but in character and the different sorts of trees as you go from one zone of the wood to another seem to live among different kinds of atmosphere  usually the resin of the fir predominates  but some woods are more coquettish in their habits and the breath of the forest of mormal as it came aboard upon us that showery afternoon was perfumed with nothing less delicate than sweetbrier  i wish our way had always lain among woods  trees are the most civil society  an old oak that has been growing where he stands since before the reformation taller than many spires more stately than the greater part of mountains and yet a living thing liable to sicknesses and death like you and me  is not that in itself a speaking lesson in history  but acres on acres full of such patriarchs contiguously rooted their green tops billowing in the wind their stalwart younglings pushing up about their knees  a whole forest healthy and beautiful giving colour to the light giving perfume to the air  what is this but the most imposing piece in natures repertory  heine wished to lie like merlin under the oaks of broceliande  i should not be satisfied with one tree but if the wood grew together like a banyan grove i would be buried under the taproot of the whole my parts should circulate from oak to oak and my consciousness should be diffused abroad in all the forest and give a common heart to that assembly of green spires so that it also might rejoice in its own loveliness and dignity  i think i feel a thousand squirrels leaping from bough to bough in my vast mausoleum and the birds and the winds merrily coursing over its uneven leafy surface  alas the forest of mormal is only a little bit of a wood and it was but for a little way that we skirted by its boundaries  and the rest of the time the rain kept coming in squirts and the wind in squalls until ones heart grew weary of such fitful scolding weather  it was odd how the showers began when we had to carry the boats over a lock and must expose our legs  they always did this is a sort of thing that readily begets a personal feeling against nature  there seems no reason why the shower should not come five minutes before or five minutes after unless you suppose an intention to affront you  the cigarette had a mackintosh which put him more or less above these contrarieties  but i had to bear the brunt uncovered  i began to remember that nature was a woman my companion in a rosier temper listened with great satisfaction to my jeremiads and ironically concurred  he instanced as a cognate matter the action of the tides which said he was altogether designed for the confusion of canoeists except in so far as it was calculated to minister to a barren vanity on the part of the moon  at the last lock some little way out of landrecies i refused to go any farther and sat in a drift of rain by the side of the bank to have a reviving pipe  a vivacious old man whom i take to have been the devil drew near and questioned me about our journey  in the fulness of my heart i laid bare our plans before him  he said it was the silliest enterprise that ever he heard of  why did i not know he asked me that it was nothing but locks locks locks the whole way not to mention that at this season of the year we should find the oise quite dry  get into a train my little young man said he i and go you away home to your parents  i was so astounded at the mans malice that i could only stare at him in silence  a tree would never have spoken to me like this  at last i got out with some words  we had come from antwerp already i told him which was a good long way and we should do the rest in spite of him  yes i said if there were no other reason i would do it now just because he had dared to say we could not  the pleasant old gentleman looked at me sneeringly made an allusion to my canoe and marched of waggling his head  i was still inwardly fuming when up came a pair of young fellows who imagined i was the cigarettes servant on a comparison i suppose of my bare jersey with the others mackintosh and asked me many questions about my place and my masters character  i said he was a good enough fellow but had this absurd voyage on the head  o no no said one you must not say that it is not absurd it is very courageous of him  i believe these were a couple of angels sent to give me heart again  it was truly fortifying to reproduce all the old mans insinuations as if they were original to me in my character of a malcontent footman and have them brushed away like so many flies by these admirable young men  when i recounted this affair to the cigarette they must have a curious idea of how english servants behave says he dryly for you treated me like a brute beast at the lock  i was a good deal mortified but my temper had suffered it is a fact    at landrecies    at landrecies the rain still fell and the wind still blew but we found a doublebedded room with plenty of furniture real water jugs with real water in them and dinner  a real dinner not innocent of real wine  after having been a pedlar for one night and a butt for the elements during the whole of the next day these comfortable circumstances fell on my heart like sunshine  there was an english fruiterer at dinner travelling with a belgian fruiterer in the evening at the cafe we watched our compatriot drop a good deal of money at corks and i dont know why but this pleased us  it turned out we were to see more of landrecies than we expected for the weather next day was simply bedlamite  it is not the place one would have chosen for a days rest for it consists almost entirely of fortifications  within the ramparts a few blocks of houses a long row of barracks and a church figure with what countenance they may as the town  there seems to be no trade and a shopkeeper from whom i bought a sixpenny flintandsteel was so much affected that he filled my pockets with spare flints into the bargain  the only public buildings that had any interest for us were the hotel and the cafe  but we visited the church  there lies marshal clarke  but as neither of us had ever heard of that military hero we bore the associations of the spot with fortitude  in all garrison towns guardcalls and reveilles and such like make a fine romantic interlude in civic business  bugles and drums and fifes are of themselves most excellent things in nature and when they carry the mind to marching armies and the picturesque vicissitudes of war they stir up something proud in the heart  but in a shadow of a town like landrecies with little else moving these points of war made a proportionate commotion indeed they were the only things to remember  it was just the place to hear the round going by at night in the darkness with the solid tramp of men marching and the startling reverberations of the drum  it reminded you that even this place was a point in the great warfaring system of europe and might on some future day be ringed about with cannon smoke and thunder and make itself a name among strong towns  the drum at any rate from its martial voice and notable physiological effect nay even from its cumbrous and comical shape stands alone among the instruments of noise  and if it be true as i have heard it said that drums are covered with asses skin what a picturesque irony is there in that  as if this long suffering animals hide had not been sufficiently belaboured during life now by lyonnese costermongers now by presumptuous hebrew prophets it must be stripped from his poor hinder quarters after death stretched on a drum and beaten night after night round the streets of every garrison town in europe  and up the heights of alma and spicheren and wherever death has his red flag aflying and sounds his own potent tuck upon the cannons there also must the drummerboy hurrying with white face over fallen comrades batter and bemaul this slip of skin from the loins of peaceable donkeys  generally a man is never more uselessly employed than when he is at this trick of bastinadoing asses hide  we know what effect it has in life and how your dull ass will not mend his pace with beating but in this state of mummy and melancholy survival of itself when the hollow skin reverberates to the drummers wrist and each dub adub goes direct to a mans heart and puts madness there and that disposition of the pulses which we in our big way of talking nickname heroism is there not something in the nature of a revenge upon the donkeys persecutors  of old he might say you drubbed me up hill and down dale and i must endure but now that i am dead those dull thwacks that were scarcely audible in country lanes have become stirring music in front of the brigade and for every blow that you lay on my old greatcoat you will see a comrade stumble and fall  not long after the drums had passed the cafe the cigarette and the arethusa began to grow sleepy and set out for the hotel which was only a door or two away  but although we had been somewhat indifferent to landrecies landrecies had not been indifferent to us  all day we learned people had been running out between the squalls to visit our two boats  hundreds of persons so said report although it fitted ill with our idea of the townhundreds of persons had inspected them where they lay in a coalshed  we were becoming lions in landrecies who had been only pedlars the night before in pont  and now when we left the cafe we were pursued and overtaken at the hotel door by no less a person than the juge de paix  a functionary as far as i can make out of the character of a scots sheriffsubstitute  he gave us his card and invited us to sup with him on the spot very neatly very gracefully as frenchmen can do these things  it was for the credit of landrecies said he and although we knew very well how little credit we could do the place we must have been churlish fellows to refuse an invitation so politely introduced  the house of the judge was close by it was a wellappointed bachelors establishment with a curious collection of old brass warmingpans upon the walls  some of these were most elaborately carved  it seemed a picturesque idea for a collector  you could not help thinking how many nightcaps had wagged over these warmingpans in past generations what jests may have been made and kisses taken while they were in service and how often they had been uselessly paraded in the bed of death  if they could only speak at what absurd indecorous and tragical scenes had they not been present  the wine was excellent  when we made the judge our compliments upon a bottle i do not give it you as my worst said he  i wonder when englishmen will learn these hospitable graces  they are worth learning they set off life and make ordinary moments ornamental  there were two other landrecienses present  one was the collector of something or other i forget what the other we were told was the principal notary of the place  so it happened that we all five more or less followed the law  at this rate the talk was pretty certain to become technical  the cigarette expounded the poor laws very magisterially  and a little later i found myself laying down the scots law of illegitimacy of which i am glad to say i know nothing  the collector and the notary who were both married men accused the judge who was a bachelor of having started the subject  he deprecated the charge with a conscious pleased air just like all the men i have ever seen be they french or english how strange that we should all in our unguarded moments rather like to be thought a bit of a rogue with the women  as the evening went on the wine grew more to my taste the spirits proved better than the wine the company was genial  this was the highest water mark of popular favour on the whole cruise  after all being in a judges house was there not something semi official in the tribute  and so remembering what a great country france is we did full justice to our entertainment  landrecies had been a long while asleep before we returned to the hotel and the sentries on the ramparts were already looking for daybreak    sambre and oise canal    canal boats   next day we made a late start in the rain  the judge politely escorted us to the end of the lock under an umbrella  we had now brought ourselves to a pitch of humility in the matter of weather not often attained except in the scottish highlands  a rag of blue sky or a glimpse of sunshine set our hearts singing and when the rain was not heavy we counted the day almost fair  long lines of barges lay one after another along the canal many of them looking mighty spruce and shipshape in their jerkin of archangel tar picked out with white and green  some carried gay iron railings and quite a parterre of flowerpots  children played on the decks as heedless of the rain as if they had been brought up on loch carron side men fished over the gunwale some of them under umbrellas women did their washing and every barge boasted its mongrel cur by way of watchdog  each one barked furiously at the canoes running alongside until he had got to the end of his own ship and so passing on the word to the dog aboard the next  we must have seen something like a hundred of these embarkations in the course of that days paddle ranged one after another like the houses in a street and from not one of them were we disappointed of this accompaniment  it was like visiting a menagerie the cigarette remarked  these little cities by the canal side had a very odd effect upon the mind  they seemed with their flowerpots and smoking chimneys their washings and dinners a rooted piece of nature in the scene and yet if only the canal below were to open one junk after another would hoist sail or harness horses and swim away into all parts of france and the impromptu hamlet would separate house by house to the four winds  the children who played together to day by the sambre and oise canal each at his own fathers threshold when and where might they next meet  for some time past the subject of barges had occupied a great deal of our talk and we had projected an old age on the canals of europe  it was to be the most leisurely of progresses now on a swift river at the tail of a steamboat now waiting horses for days together on some inconsiderable junction  we should be seen pottering on deck in all the dignity of years our white beards falling into our laps  we were ever to be busied among paintpots so that there should be no white fresher and no green more emerald than ours in all the navy of the canals  there should be books in the cabin and tobaccojars and some old burgundy as red as a november sunset and as odorous as a violet in april  there should be a flageolet whence the cigarette with cunning touch should draw melting music under the stars or perhaps laying that aside upraise his voicesomewhat thinner than of yore and with here and there a quaver or call it a natural gracenotein rich and solemn psalmody  all this simmering in my mind set me wishing to go aboard one of these ideal houses of lounging  i had plenty to choose from as i coasted one after another and the dogs bayed at me for a vagrant at last i saw a nice old man and his wife looking at me with some interest so i gave them goodday and pulled up alongside  i began with a remark upon their dog which had somewhat the look of a pointer thence i slid into a compliment on madames flowers and thence into a word in praise of their way of life  if you ventured on such an experiment in england you would get a slap in the face at once  the life would be shown to be a vile one not without a side shot at your better fortune  now what i like so much in france is the clear unflinching recognition by everybody of his own luck  they all know on which side their bread is buttered and take a pleasure in showing it to others which is surely the better part of religion  and they scorn to make a poor mouth over their poverty which i take to be the better part of manliness  i have heard a woman in quite a better position at home with a good bit of money in hand refer to her own child with a horrid whine as a poor mans child  i would not say such a thing to the duke of westminster  and the french are full of this spirit of independence  perhaps it is the result of republican institutions as they call them  much more likely it is because there are so few people really poor that the whiners are not enough to keep each other in countenance  the people on the barge were delighted to hear that i admired their state  they understood perfectly well they told me how monsieur envied them  without doubt monsieur was rich and in that case he might make a canal boat as pretty as a villajoli comme un chateau  and with that they invited me on board their own water villa  they apologised for their cabin they had not been rich enough to make it as it ought to be  the fire should have been here at this side explained the husband  then one might have a writingtable in the middle booksand comprehensively all  it would be quite coquettish ca serait toutafait coquet  and he looked about him as though the improvements were already made  it was plainly not the first time that he had thus beautified his cabin in imagination and when next he makes a bit i should expect to see the writingtable in the middle  madame had three birds in a cage  they were no great thing she explained  fine birds were so dear  they had sought to get a hollandais last winter in rouen rouen thought i and is this whole mansion with its dogs and birds and smoking chimneys so far a traveller as that and as homely an object among the cliffs and orchards of the seine as on the green plains of sambrethey had sought to get a hollandais last winter in rouen but these cost fifteen francs apiecepicture itfifteen francs  pour un tout petit oiseaufor quite a little bird added the husband  as i continued to admire the apologetics died away and the good people began to brag of their barge and their happy condition in life as if they had been emperor and empress of the indies  it was in the scots phrase a good hearing and put me in good humour with the world  if people knew what an inspiriting thing it is to hear a man boasting so long as he boasts of what he really has i believe they would do it more freely and with a better grace  they began to ask about our voyage  you should have seen how they sympathised  they seemed half ready to give up their barge and follow us  but these canaletti are only gypsies semidomesticated the semidomestication came out in rather a pretty form  suddenly madams brow darkened  cependant she began and then stopped and then began again by asking me if i were single  yes said i  and your friend who went by just now  he also was unmarried  o thenall was well  she could not have wives left alone at home but since there were no wives in the question we were doing the best we could  to see about one in the world said the husband il ny a que cathere is nothing else worth while  a man look you who sticks in his own village like a bear he went on very well he sees nothing  and then death is the end of all  and he has seen nothing  madame reminded her husband of an englishman who had come up this canal in a steamer  perhaps mr moens in the ytene i suggested  thats it assented the husband  he had his wife and family with him and servants  he came ashore at all the locks and asked the name of the villages whether from boatmen or lockkeepers and then he wrote wrote them down  oh he wrote enormously  i suppose it was a wager  a wager was a common enough explanation for our own exploits but it seemed an original reason for taking notes    the oise in flood    before nine next morning the two canoes were installed on a light country cart at etreux  and we were soon following them along the side of a pleasant valley full of hopgardens and poplars agreeable villages lay here and there on the slope of the hill notably tupigny with the hoppoles hanging their garlands in the very street and the houses clustered with grapes  there was a faint enthusiasm on our passage weavers put their heads to the windows children cried out in ecstasy at sight of the two boatiesbarguettes  and bloused pedestrians who were acquainted with our charioteer jested with him on the nature of his freight  we had a shower or two but light and flying  the air was clean and sweet among all these green fields and green things growing there was not a touch of autumn in the weather  and when at vadencourt we launched from a little lawn opposite a mill the sun broke forth and set all the leaves shining in the valley of the oise  the river was swollen with the long rains  from vadencourt all the way to origny it ran with everquickening speed taking fresh heart at each mile and racing as though it already smelt the sea the water was yellow and turbulent swung with an angry eddy among halfsubmerged willows and made an angry clatter along stony shores  the course kept turning and turning in a narrow and well timbered valley  now the river would approach the side and run griding along the chalky base of the hill and show us a few open colzafields among the trees  now it would skirt the gardenwalls of houses where we might catch a glimpse through a doorway and see a priest pacing in the chequered sunlight  again the foliage closed so thickly in front that there seemed to be no issue only a thicket of willows overtopped by elms and poplars under which the river ran flush and fleet and where a kingfisher flew past like a piece of the blue sky  on these different manifestations the sun poured its clear and catholic looks  the shadows lay as solid on the swift surface of the stream as on the stable meadows the light sparkled golden in the dancing poplar leaves and brought the hills into communion with our eyes  and all the while the river never stopped running or took breath and the reeds along the whole valley stood shivering from top to toe  there should be some myth but if there is i know it not founded on the shivering of the reeds  there are not many things in nature more striking to mans eye  it is such an eloquent pantomime of terror and to see such a number of terrified creatures taking sanctuary in every nook along the shore is enough to infect a silly human with alarm  perhaps they are only acold and no wonder standing waistdeep in the stream  or perhaps they have never got accustomed to the speed and fury of the rivers flux or the miracle of its continuous body  pan once played upon their forefathers and so by the hands of his river he still plays upon these later generations down all the valley of the oise and plays the same air both sweet and shrill to tell us of the beauty and the terror of the world  the canoe was like a leaf in the current  it took it up and shook it and carried it masterfully away like a centaur carrying off a nymph  to keep some command on our direction required hard and diligent plying of the paddle  the river was in such a hurry for the sea  every drop of water ran in a panic like as many people in a frightened crowd  but what crowd was ever so numerous or so singleminded  all the objects of sight went by at a dance measure the eyesight raced with the racing river the exigencies of every moment kept the pegs screwed so tight that our being quivered like a welltuned instrument and the blood shook off its lethargy and trotted through all the highways and byways of the veins and arteries and in and out of the heart as if circulation were but a holiday journey and not the daily moil of threescore years and ten  the reeds might nod their heads in warning and with tremulous gestures tell how the river was as cruel as it was strong and cold and how death lurked in the eddy underneath the willows  but the reeds had to stand where they were and those who stand still are always timid advisers  as for us we could have shouted aloud  if this lively and beautiful river were indeed a thing of deaths contrivance the old ashen rogue had famously outwitted himself with us  i was living three to the minute  i was scoring points against him every stroke of my paddle every turn of the stream  i have rarely had better profit of my life  for i think we may look upon our little private war with death somewhat in this light  if a man knows he will sooner or later be robbed upon a journey he will have a bottle of the best in every inn and look upon all his extravagances as so much gained upon the thieves  and above all where instead of simply spending he makes a profitable investment for some of his money when it will be out of risk of loss  so every bit of brisk living and above all when it is healthful is just so much gained upon the wholesale filcher death  we shall have the less in our pockets the more in our stomach when he cries stand and deliver  a swift stream is a favourite artifice of his and one that brings him in a comfortable thing per annum but when he and i come to settle our accounts i shall whistle in his face for these hours upon the upper oise  towards afternoon we got fairly drunken with the sunshine and the exhilaration of the pace  we could no longer contain ourselves and our content  the canoes were too small for us we must be out and stretch ourselves on shore  and so in a green meadow we bestowed our limbs on the grass and smoked deifying tobacco and proclaimed the world excellent  it was the last good hour of the day and i dwell upon it with extreme complacency  on one side of the valley high up on the chalky summit of the hill a ploughman with his team appeared and disappeared at regular intervals  at each revelation he stood still for a few seconds against the sky  for all the world as the cigarette declared like a toy burns who should have just ploughed up the mountain daisy  he was the only living thing within view unless we are to count the river  on the other side of the valley a group of red roofs and a belfry showed among the foliage  thence some inspired bellringer made the afternoon musical on a chime of bells  there was something very sweet and taking in the air he played and we thought we had never heard bells speak so intelligibly or sing so melodiously as these  it must have been to some such measure that the spinners and the young maids sang come away death in the shakespearian illyria  there is so often a threatening note something blatant and metallic in the voice of bells that i believe we have fully more pain than pleasure from hearing them but these as they sounded abroad now high now low now with a plaintive cadence that caught the ear like the burthen of a popular song were always moderate and tunable and seemed to fall in with the spirit of still rustic places like the noise of a waterfall or the babble of a rookery in spring  i could have asked the bellringer for his blessing good sedate old man who swung the rope so gently to the time of his meditations  i could have blessed the priest or the heritors or whoever may be concerned with such affairs in france who had left these sweet old bells to gladden the afternoon and not held meetings and made collections and had their names repeatedly printed in the local paper to rig up a peal of brand new brazen birminghamhearted substitutes who should bombard their sides to the provocation of a brandnew bellringer and fill the echoes of the valley with terror and riot  at last the bells ceased and with their note the sun withdrew the piece was at an end shadow and silence possessed the valley of the oise  we took to the paddle with glad hearts like people who have sat out a noble performance and returned to work  the river was more dangerous here it ran swifter the eddies were more sudden and violent  all the way down we had had our fill of difficulties  sometimes it was a weir which could be shot sometimes one so shallow and full of stakes that we must withdraw the boats from the water and carry them round  but the chief sort of obstacle was a consequence of the late high winds  every two or three hundred yards a tree had fallen across the river and usually involved more than another in its fall  often there was free water at the end and we could steer round the leafy promontory and hear the water sucking and bubbling among the twigs  often again when the tree reached from bank to bank there was room by lying close to shoot through underneath canoe and all  sometimes it was necessary to get out upon the trunk itself and pull the boats across and sometimes when the stream was too impetuous for this there was nothing for it but to land and carry over  this made a fine series of accidents in the days career and kept us aware of ourselves  shortly after our reembarkation while i was leading by a long way and still full of a noble exulting spirit in honour of the sun the swift pace and the church bells the river made one of its leonine pounces round a corner and i was aware of another fallen tree within a stonecast  i had my backboard down in a trice and aimed for a place where the trunk seemed high enough above the water and the branches not too thick to let me slip below  when a man has just vowed eternal brotherhood with the universe he is not in a temper to take great determinations coolly and this which might have been a very important determination for me had not been taken under a happy star  the tree caught me about the chest and while i was yet struggling to make less of myself and get through the river took the matter out of my hands and bereaved me of my boat  the arethusa swung round broadside on leaned over ejected so much of me as still remained on board and thus disencumbered whipped under the tree righted and went merrily away down stream  i do not know how long it was before i scrambled on to the tree to which i was left clinging but it was longer than i cared about my thoughts were of a grave and almost sombre character but i still clung to my paddle  the stream ran away with my heels as fast as i could pull up my shoulders and i seemed by the weight to have all the water of the oise in my trouserspockets  you can never know till you try it what a dead pull a river makes against a man  death himself had me by the heels for this was his last ambuscado and he must now join personally in the fray  and still i held to my paddle  at last i dragged myself on to my stomach on the trunk and lay there a breathless sop with a mingled sense of humour and injustice  a poor figure i must have presented to burns upon the hilltop with his team  but there was the paddle in my hand  on my tomb if ever i have one i mean to get these words inscribed  he clung to his paddle  the cigarette had gone past a while before for as i might have observed if i had been a little less pleased with the universe at the moment there was a clear way round the treetop at the farther side  he had offered his services to haul me out but as i was then already on my elbows i had declined and sent him down stream after the truant arethusa  the stream was too rapid for a man to mount with one canoe let alone two upon his hands  so i crawled along the trunk to shore and proceeded down the meadows by the riverside  i was so cold that my heart was sore  i had now an idea of my own why the reeds so bitterly shivered  i could have given any of them a lesson  the cigarette remarked facetiously that he thought i was taking exercise as i drew near until he made out for certain that i was only twittering with cold  i had a rub down with a towel and donned a dry suit from the indiarubber bag  but i was not my own man again for the rest of the voyage  i had a queasy sense that i wore my last dry clothes upon my body the struggle had tired me and perhaps whether i knew it or not i was a little dashed in spirit  the devouring element in the universe had leaped out against me in this green valley quickened by a running stream  the bells were all very pretty in their way but i had heard some of the hollow notes of pans music  would the wicked river drag me down by the heels indeed and look so beautiful all the time  natures goodhumour was only skindeep after all  there was still a long way to go by the winding course of the stream and darkness had fallen and a late bell was ringing in origny saintebenoite when we arrived    origny saintebenoite    a byday   the next day was sunday and the church bells had little rest indeed i do not think i remember anywhere else so great a choice of services as were here offered to the devout  and while the bells made merry in the sunshine all the world with his dog was out shooting among the beets and colza  in the morning a hawker and his wife went down the street at a footpace singing to a very slow lamentable music o france mes amours  it brought everybody to the door and when our landlady called in the man to buy the words he had not a copy of them left she was not the first nor the second who had been taken with the song  there is something very pathetic in the love of the french people since the war for dismal patriotic musicmaking  i have watched a forester from alsace while some one was singing les malheurs de la france at a baptismal party in the neighbourhood of fontainebleau  he arose from the table and took his son aside close by where i was standing  listen listen he said bearing on the boys shoulder and remember this my son  a little after he went out into the garden suddenly and i could hear him sobbing in the darkness  the humiliation of their arms and the loss of alsace and lorraine made a sore pull on the endurance of this sensitive people and their hearts are still hot not so much against germany as against the empire  in what other country will you find a patriotic ditty bring all the world into the street  but affliction heightens love and we shall never know we are englishmen until we have lost india  independent america is still the cross of my existence i cannot think of farmer george without abhorrence and i never feel more warmly to my own land than when i see the stars and stripes and remember what our empire might have been  the hawkers little book which i purchased was a curious mixture side by side with the flippant rowdy nonsense of the paris music halls there were many pastoral pieces not without a touch of poetry i thought and instinct with the brave independence of the poorer class in france  there you might read how the woodcutter gloried in his axe and the gardener scorned to be ashamed of his spade  it was not very well written this poetry of labour but the pluck of the sentiment redeemed what was weak or wordy in the expression  the martial and the patriotic pieces on the other hand were tearful womanish productions one and all  the poet had passed under the caudine forks he sang for an army visiting the tomb of its old renown with arms reversed and sang not of victory but of death  there was a number in the hawkers collection called conscrits francais which may rank among the most dissuasive warlyrics on record  it would not be possible to fight at all in such a spirit  the bravest conscript would turn pale if such a ditty were struck up beside him on the morning of battle and whole regiments would pile their arms to its tune  if fletcher of saltoun is in the right about the influence of national songs you would say france was come to a poor pass  but the thing will work its own cure and a soundhearted and courageous people weary at length of snivelling over their disasters  already paul deroulede has written some manly military verses  there is not much of the trumpet note in them perhaps to stir a mans heart in his bosom they lack the lyrical elation and move slowly but they are written in a grave honourable stoical spirit which should carry soldiers far in a good cause  one feels as if one would like to trust deroulede with something  it will be happy if he can so far inoculate his fellowcountrymen that they may be trusted with their own future  and in the meantime here is an antidote to french conscripts and much other doleful versification  we had left the boats overnight in the custody of one whom we shall call carnival  i did not properly catch his name and perhaps that was not unfortunate for him as i am not in a position to hand him down with honour to posterity  to this persons premises we strolled in the course of the day and found quite a little deputation inspecting the canoes  there was a stout gentleman with a knowledge of the river which he seemed eager to impart  there was a very elegant young gentleman in a black coat with a smattering of english who led the talk at once to the oxford and cambridge boat race  and then there were three handsome girls from fifteen to twenty and an old gentleman in a blouse with no teeth to speak of and a strong country accent  quite the pick of origny i should suppose  the cigarette had some mysteries to perform with his rigging in the coachhouse so i was left to do the parade singlehanded  i found myself very much of a hero whether i would or not  the girls were full of little shudderings over the dangers of our journey  and i thought it would be ungallant not to take my cue from the ladies my mishap of yesterday told in an offhand way produced a deep sensation  it was othello over again with no less than three desdemonas and a sprinkling of sympathetic senators in the background  never were the canoes more flattered or flattered more adroitly  it is like a violin cried one of the girls in an ecstasy  i thank you for the word mademoiselle said i  all the more since there are people who call out to me that it is like a coffin  oh but it is really like a violin  it is finished like a violin she went on  and polished like a violin added a senator  one has only to stretch the cords concluded another and then tumtumtytumhe imitated the result with spirit  was not this a graceful little ovation  where this people finds the secret of its pretty speeches i cannot imagine unless the secret should be no other than a sincere desire to please but then no disgrace is attached in france to saying a thing neatly whereas in england to talk like a book is to give in ones resignation to society  the old gentleman in the blouse stole into the coachhouse and somewhat irrelevantly informed the cigarette that he was the father of the three girls and four more  quite an exploit for a frenchman  you are very fortunate answered the cigarette politely  and the old gentleman having apparently gained his point stole away again  we all got very friendly together  the girls proposed to start with us on the morrow if you please  and jesting apart every one was anxious to know the hour of our departure  now when you are going to crawl into your canoe from a bad launch a crowd however friendly is undesirable and so we told them not before twelve and mentally determined to be off by ten at latest  towards evening we went abroad again to post some letters  it was cool and pleasant the long village was quite empty except for one or two urchins who followed us as they might have followed a menagerie the hills and the treetops looked in from all sides through the clear air and the bells were chiming for yet another service  suddenly we sighted the three girls standing with a fourth sister in front of a shop on the wide selvage of the roadway  we had been very merry with them a little while ago to be sure  but what was the etiquette of origny  had it been a country road of course we should have spoken to them but here under the eyes of all the gossips ought we to do even as much as bow  i consulted the cigarette  look said he  i looked  there were the four girls on the same spot but now four backs were turned to us very upright and conscious  corporal modesty had given the word of command and the welldisciplined picket had gone rightaboutface like a single person  they maintained this formation all the while we were in sight but we heard them tittering among themselves and the girl whom we had not met laughed with open mouth and even looked over her shoulder at the enemy  i wonder was it altogether modesty after all or in part a sort of country provocation  as we were returning to the inn we beheld something floating in the ample field of golden evening sky above the chalk cliffs and the trees that grow along their summit  it was too high up too large and too steady for a kite and as it was dark it could not be a star  for although a star were as black as ink and as rugged as a walnut so amply does the sun bathe heaven with radiance that it would sparkle like a point of light for us  the village was dotted with people with their heads in air and the children were in a bustle all along the street and far up the straight road that climbs the hill where we could still see them running in loose knots  it was a balloon we learned which had left saint quentin at halfpast five that evening  mighty composedly the majority of the grown people took it  but we were english and were soon running up the hill with the best  being travellers ourselves in a small way we would fain have seen these other travellers alight  the spectacle was over by the time we gained the top of the hill all the gold had withered out of the sky and the balloon had disappeared  whither i ask myself caught up into the seventh heaven or come safely to land somewhere in that blue uneven distance into which the roadway dipped and melted before our eyes probably the aeronauts were already warming themselves at a farm chimney for they say it is cold in these unhomely regions of the air  the night fell swiftly  roadside trees and disappointed sightseers returning through the meadows stood out in black against a margin of low red sunset  it was cheerfuller to face the other way and so down the hill we went with a full moon the colour of a melon swinging high above the wooded valley and the white cliffs behind us faintly reddened by the fire of the chalk kilns  the lamps were lighted and the salads were being made in origny saintebenoite by the river    origny saintebenoite    the company at table   although we came late for dinner the company at table treated us to sparkling wine  that is how we are in france said one those who sit down with us are our friends and the rest applauded  they were three altogether and an odd trio to pass the sunday with  two of them were guests like ourselves both men of the north  one ruddy and of a full habit of body with copious black hair and beard the intrepid hunter of france who thought nothing so small not even a lark or a minnow but he might vindicate his prowess by its capture  for such a great healthy man his hair flourishing like samsons his arteries running buckets of red blood to boast of these infinitesimal exploits produced a feeling of disproportion in the world as when a steamhammer is set to cracking nuts  the other was a quiet subdued person blond and lymphatic and sad with something the look of a dane  tristes tetes de danois as gaston lafenestre used to say  i must not let that name go by without a word for the best of all good fellows now gone down into the dust  we shall never again see gaston in his forest costumehe was gaston with all the world in affection not in disrespectnor hear him wake the echoes of fontainebleau with the woodland horn  never again shall his kind smile put peace among all races of artistic men and make the englishman at home in france  never more shall the sheep who were not more innocent at heart than he sit all unconsciously for his industrious pencil  he died too early at the very moment when he was beginning to put forth fresh sprouts and blossom into something worthy of himself and yet none who knew him will think he lived in vain  i never knew a man so little for whom yet i had so much affection and i find it a good test of others how much they had learned to understand and value him  his was indeed a good influence in life while he was still among us he had a fresh laugh it did you good to see him and however sad he may have been at heart he always bore a bold and cheerful countenance and took fortunes worst as it were the showers of spring  but now his mother sits alone by the side of fontainebleau woods where he gathered mushrooms in his hardy and penurious youth  many of his pictures found their way across the channel  besides those which were stolen when a dastardly yankee left him alone in london with two english pence and perhaps twice as many words of english  if any one who reads these lines should have a scene of sheep in the manner of jacques with this fine creatures signature let him tell himself that one of the kindest and bravest of men has lent a hand to decorate his lodging  there may be better pictures in the national gallery but not a painter among the generations had a better heart  precious in the sight of the lord of humanity the psalms tell us is the death of his saints it had need to be precious for it is very costly when by the stroke a mother is left desolate and the peacemaker and peace looker of a whole society is laid in the ground with caesar and the twelve apostles  there is something lacking among the oaks of fontainebleau and when the dessert comes in at barbizon people look to the door for a figure that is gone  the third of our companions at origny was no less a person than the landladys husband  not properly the landlord since he worked himself in a factory during the day and came to his own house at evening as a guest  a man worn to skin and bone by perpetual excitement with baldish head sharp features and swift shining eyes  on saturday describing some paltry adventure at a duck hunt he broke a plate into a score of fragments  whenever he made a remark he would look all round the table with his chin raised and a spark of green light in either eye seeking approval  his wife appeared now and again in the doorway of the room where she was superintending dinner with a henri you forget yourself or a henri you can surely talk without making such a noise indeed that was what the honest fellow could not do  on the most trifling matter his eyes kindled his fist visited the table and his voice rolled abroad in changeful thunder  i never saw such a petard of a man i think the devil was in him  he had two favourite expressions  it is logical or illogical as the case might be  and this other thrown out with a certain bravado as a man might unfurl a banner at the beginning of many a long and sonorous story  i am a proletarian you see  indeed we saw it very well  god forbid that ever i should find him handling a gun in paris streets  that will not be a good moment for the general public  i thought his two phrases very much represented the good and evil of his class and to some extent of his country  it is a strong thing to say what one is and not be ashamed of it even although it be in doubtful taste to repeat the statement too often in one evening  i should not admire it in a duke of course but as times go the trait is honourable in a workman  on the other hand it is not at all a strong thing to put ones reliance upon logic and our own logic particularly for it is generally wrong  we never know where we are to end if once we begin following words or doctors there is an upright stock in a mans own heart that is trustier than any syllogism and the eyes and the sympathies and appetites know a thing or two that have never yet been stated in controversy reasons are as plentiful as blackberries and like fisticuffs they serve impartially with all sides  doctrines do not stand or fall by their proofs and are only logical in so far as they are cleverly put  an able controversialist no more than an able general demonstrates the justice of his cause  but france is all gone wandering after one or two big words it will take some time before they can be satisfied that they are no more than words however big and when once that is done they will perhaps find logic less diverting  the conversation opened with details of the days shooting  when all the sportsmen of a village shoot over the village territory pro indiviso it is plain that many questions of etiquette and priority must arise  here now cried the landlord brandishing a plate here is a field of beetroot  well  here am i then  i advance do i not eh bien sacristi and the statement waxing louder rolls off into a reverberation of oaths the speaker glaring about for sympathy and everybody nodding his head to him in the name of peace  the ruddy northman told some tales of his own prowess in keeping order  notably one of a marquis  marquis i said if you take another step i fire upon you  you have committed a dirtiness marquis  whereupon it appeared the marquis touched his cap and withdrew  the landlord applauded noisily  it was well done he said  he did all that he could  he admitted he was wrong  and then oath upon oath  he was no marquislover either but he had a sense of justice in him this proletarian host of ours  from the matter of hunting the talk veered into a general comparison of paris and the country  the proletarian beat the table like a drum in praise of paris  what is paris  paris is the cream of france  there are no parisians  it is you and i and everybody who are parisians  a man has eighty chances per cent to get on in the world in paris  and he drew a vivid sketch of the workman in a den no bigger than a doghutch making articles that were to go all over the world  eh bien quoi cest magnifique ca cried he  the sad northman interfered in praise of a peasants life he thought paris bad for men and women centralisation said he   but the landlord was at his throat in a moment  it was all logical he showed him and all magnificent  what a spectacle what a glance for an eye  and the dishes reeled upon the table under a cannonade of blows  seeking to make peace i threw in a word in praise of the liberty of opinion in france  i could hardly have shot more amiss  there was an instant silence and a great wagging of significant heads they did not fancy the subject it was plain but they gave me to understand that the sad northman was a martyr on account of his views  ask him a bit said they  just ask him  yes sir said he in his quiet way answering me although i had not spoken i am afraid there is less liberty of opinion in france than you may imagine  and with that he dropped his eyes and seemed to consider the subject at an end  our curiosity was mightily excited at this  how or why or when was this lymphatic bagman martyred  we concluded at once it was on some religious question and brushed up our memories of the inquisition which were principally drawn from poes horrid story and the sermon in tristram shandy i believe  on the morrow we had an opportunity of going further into the question for when we rose very early to avoid a sympathising deputation at our departure we found the hero up before us  he was breaking his fast on white wine and raw onions in order to keep up the character of martyr i conclude  we had a long conversation and made out what we wanted in spite of his reserve but here was a truly curious circumstance  it seems possible for two scotsmen and a frenchman to discuss during a long halfhour and each nationality have a different idea in view throughout  it was not till the very end that we discovered his heresy had been political or that he suspected our mistake  the terms and spirit in which he spoke of his political beliefs were in our eyes suited to religious beliefs  and vice versa  nothing could be more characteristic of the two countries politics are the religion of france as nanty ewart would have said a dd bad religion while we at home keep most of our bitterness for little differences about a hymnbook or a hebrew word which perhaps neither of the parties can translate  and perhaps the misconception is typical of many others that may never be cleared up  not only between people of different race but between those of different sex  as for our friends martyrdom he was a communist or perhaps only a communard which is a very different thing and had lost one or more situations in consequence  i think he had also been rejected in marriage but perhaps he had a sentimental way of considering business which deceived me  he was a mild gentle creature anyway and i hope he has got a better situation and married a more suitable wife since then    down the oise    to moy   carnival notoriously cheated us at first  finding us easy in our ways he regretted having let us off so cheaply and taking me aside told me a cockandbull story with the moral of another five francs for the narrator  the thing was palpably absurd but i paid up and at once dropped all friendliness of manner and kept him in his place as an inferior with freezing british dignity  he saw in a moment that he had gone too far and killed a willing horse his face fell i am sure he would have refunded if he could only have thought of a decent pretext  he wished me to drink with him but i would none of his drinks  he grew pathetically tender in his professions but i walked beside him in silence or answered him in stately courtesies and when we got to the landingplace passed the word in english slang to the cigarette  in spite of the false scent we had thrown out the day before there must have been fifty people about the bridge  we were as pleasant as we could be with all but carnival  we said goodbye shaking hands with the old gentleman who knew the river and the young gentleman who had a smattering of english but never a word for carnival  poor carnival here was a humiliation  he who had been so much identified with the canoes who had given orders in our name who had shown off the boats and even the boatmen like a private exhibition of his own to be now so publicly shamed by the lions of his caravan  i never saw anybody look more crestfallen than he  he hung in the background coming timidly forward ever and again as he thought he saw some symptom of a relenting humour and falling hurriedly back when he encountered a cold stare  let us hope it will be a lesson to him  i would not have mentioned carnivals peccadillo had not the thing been so uncommon in france  this for instance was the only case of dishonesty or even sharp practice in our whole voyage  we talk very much about our honesty in england  it is a good rule to be on your guard wherever you hear great professions about a very little piece of virtue  if the english could only hear how they are spoken of abroad they might confine themselves for a while to remedying the fact and perhaps even when that was done give us fewer of their airs  the young ladies the graces of origny were not present at our start but when we got round to the second bridge behold it was black with sightseers  we were loudly cheered and for a good way below young lads and lasses ran along the bank still cheering what with current and paddling we were flashing along like swallows  it was no joke to keep up with us upon the woody shore but the girls picked up their skirts as if they were sure they had good ankles and followed until their breath was out  the last to weary were the three graces and a couple of companions and just as they too had had enough the foremost of the three leaped upon a treestump and kissed her hand to the canoeists  not diana herself although this was more of a venus after all could have done a graceful thing more gracefully  come back again she cried and all the others echoed her and the hills about origny repeated the words come back  but the river had us round an angle in a twinkling and we were alone with the green trees and running water  come back  there is no coming back young ladies on the impetuous stream of life   the merchant bows unto the seamans star the ploughman from the sun his season takes   and we must all set our pocketwatches by the clock of fate  there is a headlong forthright tide that bears away man with his fancies like a straw and runs fast in time and space  it is full of curves like this your winding river of the oise and lingers and returns in pleasant pastorals and yet rightly thought upon never returns at all  for though it should revisit the same acre of meadow in the same hour it will have made an ample sweep betweenwhiles many little streams will have fallen in many exhalations risen towards the sun and even although it were the same acre it will no more be the same river of oise  and thus o graces of origny although the wandering fortune of my life should carry me back again to where you await deaths whistle by the river that will not be the old i who walks the street and those wives and mothers say will those be you  there was never any mistake about the oise as a matter of fact in these upper reaches it was still in a prodigious hurry for the sea  it ran so fast and merrily through all the windings of its channel that i strained my thumb fighting with the rapids and had to paddle all the rest of the way with one hand turned up sometimes it had to serve mills and being still a little river ran very dry and shallow in the meanwhile  we had to put our legs out of the boat and shove ourselves off the sand of the bottom with our feet  and still it went on its way singing among the poplars and making a green valley in the world  after a good woman and a good book and tobacco there is nothing so agreeable on earth as a river  i forgave it its attempt on my life which was after all one part owing to the unruly winds of heaven that had blown down the tree one part to my own mismanagement and only a third part to the river itself and that not out of malice but from its great preoccupation over its business of getting to the sea  a difficult business too for the detours it had to make are not to be counted  the geographers seem to have given up the attempt for i found no map represent the infinite contortion of its course  a fact will say more than any of them  after we had been some hours three if i mistake not flitting by the trees at this smooth breakneck gallop when we came upon a hamlet and asked where we were we had got no farther than four kilometres say two miles and a half from origny  if it were not for the honour of the thing in the scots saying we might almost as well have been standing still  we lunched on a meadow inside a parallelogram of poplars  the leaves danced and prattled in the wind all round about us  the river hurried on meanwhile and seemed to chide at our delay little we cared  the river knew where it was going not so we the less our hurry where we found good quarters and a pleasant theatre for a pipe  at that hour stockbrokers were shouting in paris bourse for two or three per cent but we minded them as little as the sliding stream and sacrificed a hecatomb of minutes to the gods of tobacco and digestion  hurry is the resource of the faithless  where a man can trust his own heart and those of his friends tomorrow is as good as today  and if he die in the meanwhile why then there he dies and the question is solved  we had to take to the canal in the course of the afternoon because where it crossed the river there was not a bridge but a siphon  if it had not been for an excited fellow on the bank we should have paddled right into the siphon and thenceforward not paddled any more  we met a man a gentleman on the towpath who was much interested in our cruise  and i was witness to a strange seizure of lying suffered by the cigarette  who because his knife came from norway narrated all sorts of adventures in that country where he has never been  he was quite feverish at the end and pleaded demoniacal possession  moy pronounce moy was a pleasant little village gathered round a chateau in a moat  the air was perfumed with hemp from neighbouring fields  at the golden sheep we found excellent entertainment  german shells from the siege of la fere nurnberg figures goldfish in a bowl and all manner of knickknacks embellished the public room  the landlady was a stout plain shortsighted motherly body with something not far short of a genius for cookery  she had a guess of her excellence herself after every dish was sent in she would come and look on at the dinner for a while with puckered blinking eyes  cest bon nestce pas she would say and when she had received a proper answer she disappeared into the kitchen  that common french dish partridge and cabbages became a new thing in my eyes at the golden sheep and many subsequent dinners have bitterly disappointed me in consequence  sweet was our rest in the golden sheep at moy    la fere of cursed memory    we lingered in moy a good part of the day for we were fond of being philosophical and scorned long journeys and early starts on principle  the place moreover invited to repose  people in elaborate shooting costumes sallied from the chateau with guns and gamebags and this was a pleasure in itself to remain behind while these elegant pleasureseekers took the first of the morning in this way all the world may be an aristocrat and play the duke among marquises and the reigning monarch among dukes if he will only outvie them in tranquillity  an imperturbable demeanour comes from perfect patience  quiet minds cannot be perplexed or frightened but go on in fortune or misfortune at their own private pace like a clock during a thunderstorm  we made a very short day of it to la fere but the dusk was falling and a small rain had begun before we stowed the boats  la fere is a fortified town in a plain and has two belts of rampart between the first and the second extends a region of waste land and cultivated patches  here and there along the wayside were posters forbidding trespass in the name of military engineering  at last a second gateway admitted us to the town itself  lighted windows looked gladsome whiffs of comfortable cookery came abroad upon the air  the town was full of the military reserve out for the french autumn manoeuvres and the reservists walked speedily and wore their formidable greatcoats  it was a fine night to be within doors over dinner and hear the rain upon the windows  the cigarette and i could not sufficiently congratulate each other on the prospect for we had been told there was a capital inn at la fere  such a dinner as we were going to eat such beds as we were to sleep inand all the while the rain raining on houseless folk over all the poplared countryside  it made our mouths water  the inn bore the name of some woodland animal stag or hart or hind i forget which  but i shall never forget how spacious and how eminently habitable it looked as we drew near  the carriage entry was lighted up not by intention but from the mere superfluity of fire and candle in the house  a rattle of many dishes came to our ears we sighted a great field of tablecloth the kitchen glowed like a forge and smelt like a garden of things to eat  into this the inmost shrine and physiological heart of a hostelry with all its furnaces in action and all its dressers charged with viands you are now to suppose us making our triumphal entry a pair of damp ragandbone men each with a limp indiarubber bag upon his arm  i do not believe i have a sound view of that kitchen i saw it through a sort of glory  but it seemed to me crowded with the snowy caps of cookmen who all turned round from their saucepans and looked at us with surprise  there was no doubt about the landlady however  there she was heading her army a flushed angry woman full of affairs  her i asked politelytoo politely thinks the cigaretteif we could have beds  she surveying us coldly from head to foot  you will find beds in the suburb she remarked  we are too busy for the like of you  if we could make an entrance change our clothes and order a bottle of wine i felt sure we could put things right so said i if we cannot sleep we may at least dineand was for depositing my bag  what a terrible convulsion of nature was that which followed in the landladys face  she made a run at us and stamped her foot  out with youout of the door she screeched  sortez sortez sortez par la porte  i do not know how it happened but next moment we were out in the rain and darkness and i was cursing before the carriage entry like a disappointed mendicant  where were the boating men of belgium where the judge and his good wines and where the graces of origny black black was the night after the firelit kitchen but what was that to the blackness in our heart  this was not the first time that i have been refused a lodging  often and often have i planned what i should do if such a misadventure happened to me again  and nothing is easier to plan  but to put in execution with the heart boiling at the indignity  try it try it only once and tell me what you did  it is all very fine to talk about tramps and morality  six hours of police surveillance such as i have had or one brutal rejection from an inndoor change your views upon the subject like a course of lectures  as long as you keep in the upper regions with all the world bowing to you as you go social arrangements have a very handsome air but once get under the wheels and you wish society were at the devil  i will give most respectable men a fortnight of such a life and then i will offer them twopence for what remains of their morality  for my part when i was turned out of the stag or the hind or whatever it was i would have set the temple of diana on fire if it had been handy  there was no crime complete enough to express my disapproval of human institutions  as for the cigarette i never knew a man so altered  we have been taken for pedlars again said he  good god what it must be to be a pedlar in reality  he particularised a complaint for every joint in the landladys body  timon was a philanthropist alongside of him  and then when he was at the top of his maledictory bent he would suddenly break away and begin whimperingly to commiserate the poor i hope to god he saidand i trust the prayer was answered that i shall never be uncivil to a pedlar  was this the imperturbable cigarette  this this was he  o change beyond report thought or belief  meantime the heaven wept upon our heads and the windows grew brighter as the night increased in darkness  we trudged in and out of la fere streets we saw shops and private houses where people were copiously dining we saw stables where carters nags had plenty of fodder and clean straw we saw no end of reservists who were very sorry for themselves this wet night i doubt not and yearned for their country homes but had they not each man his place in la fere barracks  and we what had we  there seemed to be no other inn in the whole town  people gave us directions which we followed as best we could generally with the effect of bringing us out again upon the scene of our disgrace  we were very sad people indeed by the time we had gone all over la fere and the cigarette had already made up his mind to lie under a poplar and sup off a loaf of bread  but right at the other end the house next the towngate was full of light and bustle  bazin aubergiste loge a pied was the sign  a la croix de malte there were we received  the room was full of noisy reservists drinking and smoking and we were very glad indeed when the drums and bugles began to go about the streets and one and all had to snatch shakoes and be off for the barracks  bazin was a tall man running to fat  softspoken with a delicate gentle face  we asked him to share our wine but he excused himself having pledged reservists all day long  this was a very different type of the workmaninnkeeper from the bawling disputatious fellow at origny  he also loved paris where he had worked as a decorative painter in his youth  there were such opportunities for selfinstruction there he said  and if any one has read zolas description of the workmans marriageparty visiting the louvre they would do well to have heard bazin by way of antidote  he had delighted in the museums in his youth  one sees there little miracles of work he said that is what makes a good workman it kindles a spark  we asked him how he managed in la fere  i am married he said and i have my pretty children but frankly it is no life at all  from morning to night i pledge a pack of good enough fellows who know nothing  it faired as the night went on and the moon came out of the clouds  we sat in front of the door talking softly with bazin at the guardhouse opposite the guard was being for ever turned out as trains of field artillery kept clanking in out of the night or patrols of horsemen trotted by in their cloaks  madame bazin came out after a while she was tired with her days work i suppose and she nestled up to her husband and laid her head upon his breast  he had his arm about her and kept gently patting her on the shoulder  i think bazin was right and he was really married  of how few people can the same be said  little did the bazins know how much they served us  we were charged for candles for food and drink and for the beds we slept in  but there was nothing in the bill for the husbands pleasant talk nor for the pretty spectacle of their married life  and there was yet another item unchanged  for these peoples politeness really set us up again in our own esteem  we had a thirst for consideration the sense of insult was still hot in our spirits and civil usage seemed to restore us to our position in the world  how little we pay our way in life  although we have our purses continually in our hand the better part of service goes still unrewarded  but i like to fancy that a grateful spirit gives as good as it gets  perhaps the bazins knew how much i liked them perhaps they also were healed of some slights by the thanks that i gave them in my manner     down the oise    through the golden valley   below la fere the river runs through a piece of open pastoral country green opulent loved by breeders called the golden valley  in wide sweeps and with a swift and equable gallop the ceaseless stream of water visits and makes green the fields  kine and horses and little humorous donkeys browse together in the meadows and come down in troops to the riverside to drink  they make a strange feature in the landscape above all when they are startled and you see them galloping to and fro with their incongruous forms and faces  it gives a feeling as of great unfenced pampas and the herds of wandering nations  there were hills in the distance upon either hand and on one side the river sometimes bordered on the wooded spurs of coucy and st gobain  the artillery were practising at la fere and soon the cannon of heaven joined in that loud play  two continents of cloud met and exchanged salvos overhead while all round the horizon we could see sunshine and clear air upon the hills  what with the guns and the thunder the herds were all frightened in the golden valley  we could see them tossing their heads and running to and fro in timorous indecision and when they had made up their minds and the donkey followed the horse and the cow was after the donkey we could hear their hooves thundering abroad over the meadows  it had a martial sound like cavalry charges  and altogether as far as the ears are concerned we had a very rousing battlepiece performed for our amusement  at last the guns and the thunder dropped off the sun shone on the wet meadows the air was scented with the breath of rejoicing trees and grass and the river kept unweariedly carrying us on at its best pace  there was a manufacturing district about chauny and after that the banks grew so high that they hid the adjacent country and we could see nothing but clay sides and one willow after another  only here and there we passed by a village or a ferry and some wondering child upon the bank would stare after us until we turned the corner  i daresay we continued to paddle in that childs dreams for many a night after  sun and shower alternated like day and night making the hours longer by their variety  when the showers were heavy i could feel each drop striking through my jersey to my warm skin and the accumulation of small shocks put me nearly beside myself  i decided i should buy a mackintosh at noyon  it is nothing to get wet but the misery of these individual pricks of cold all over my body at the same instant of time made me flail the water with my paddle like a madman  the cigarette was greatly amused by these ebullitions  it gave him something else to look at besides clay banks and willows  all the time the river stole away like a thief in straight places or swung round corners with an eddy the willows nodded and were undermined all day long the clay banks tumbled in the oise which had been so many centuries making the golden valley seemed to have changed its fancy and be bent upon undoing its performance  what a number of things a river does by simply following gravity in the innocence of its heart    noyon cathedral    noyon stands about a mile from the river in a little plain surrounded by wooded hills and entirely covers an eminence with its tile roofs surmounted by a long straightbacked cathedral with two stiff towers  as we got into the town the tile roofs seemed to tumble uphill one upon another in the oddest disorder but for all their scrambling they did not attain above the knees of the cathedral which stood upright and solemn over all  as the streets drew near to this presiding genius through the market place under the hotel de ville they grew emptier and more composed  blank walls and shuttered windows were turned to the great edifice and grass grew on the white causeway  put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground  the hotel du nord nevertheless lights its secular tapers within a stonecast of the church and we had the superb eastend before our eyes all morning from the window of our bedroom  i have seldom looked on the eastend of a church with more complete sympathy  as it flanges out in three wide terraces and settles down broadly on the earth it looks like the poop of some great old battleship  hollowbacked buttresses carry vases which figure for the stern lanterns  there is a roll in the ground and the towers just appear above the pitch of the roof as though the good ship were bowing lazily over an atlantic swell  at any moment it might be a hundred feet away from you climbing the next billow  at any moment a window might open and some old admiral thrust forth a cocked hat and proceed to take an observation  the old admirals sail the sea no longer the old ships of battle are all broken up and live only in pictures but this that was a church before ever they were thought upon is still a church and makes as brave an appearance by the oise  the cathedral and the river are probably the two oldest things for miles around and certainly they have both a grand old age  the sacristan took us to the top of one of the towers and showed us the five bells hanging in their loft  from above the town was a tesselated pavement of roofs and gardens the old line of rampart was plainly traceable and the sacristan pointed out to us far across the plain in a bit of gleaming sky between two clouds the towers of chateau coucy  i find i never weary of great churches  it is my favourite kind of mountain scenery  mankind was never so happily inspired as when it made a cathedral  a thing as single and specious as a statue to the first glance and yet on examination as lively and interesting as a forest in detail  the height of spires cannot be taken by trigonometry they measure absurdly short but how tall they are to the admiring eye  and where we have so many elegant proportions growing one out of the other and all together into one it seems as if proportion transcended itself and became something different and more imposing  i could never fathom how a man dares to lift up his voice to preach in a cathedral  what is he to say that will not be an anticlimax  for though i have heard a considerable variety of sermons i never yet heard one that was so expressive as a cathedral  tis the best preacher itself and preaches day and night not only telling you of mans art and aspirations in the past but convicting your own soul of ardent sympathies or rather like all good preachers it sets you preaching to yourselfand every man is his own doctor of divinity in the last resort  as i sat outside of the hotel in the course of the afternoon the sweet groaning thunder of the organ floated out of the church like a summons  i was not averse liking the theatre so well to sit out an act or two of the play but i could never rightly make out the nature of the service i beheld  four or five priests and as many choristers were singing miserere before the high altar when i went in  there was no congregation but a few old women on chairs and old men kneeling on the pavement  after a while a long train of young girls walking two and two each with a lighted taper in her hand and all dressed in black with a white veil came from behind the altar and began to descend the nave the four first carrying a virgin and child upon a table  the priests and choristers arose from their knees and followed after singing ave mary as they went  in this order they made the circuit of the cathedral passing twice before me where i leaned against a pillar the priest who seemed of most consequence was a strange down looking old man  he kept mumbling prayers with his lips but as he looked upon me darkling it did not seem as if prayer were uppermost in his heart  two others who bore the burthen of the chaunt were stout brutal militarylooking men of forty with bold overfed eyes they sang with some lustiness and trolled forth ave mary like a garrison catch  the little girls were timid and grave  as they footed slowly up the aisle each one took a moments glance at the englishman and the big nun who played marshal fairly stared him out of countenance  as for the choristers from first to last they misbehaved as only boys can misbehave and cruelly marred the performance with their antics  i understood a great deal of the spirit of what went on  indeed it would be difficult not to understand the miserere which i take to be the composition of an atheist  if it ever be a good thing to take such despondency to heart the miserere is the right music and a cathedral a fit scene  so far i am at one with the catholics an odd name for them after all  but why in gods name these holiday choristers why these priests who steal wandering looks about the congregation while they feign to be at prayer why this fat nun who rudely arranges her procession and shakes delinquent virgins by the elbow why this spitting and snuffing and forgetting of keys and the thousand and one little misadventures that disturb a frame of mind laboriously edified with chaunts and organings  in any playhouse reverend fathers may see what can be done with a little art and how to move high sentiments it is necessary to drill the supernumeraries and have every stool in its proper place  one other circumstance distressed me  i could bear a miserere myself having had a good deal of openair exercise of late but i wished the old people somewhere else  it was neither the right sort of music nor the right sort of divinity for men and women who have come through most accidents by this time and probably have an opinion of their own upon the tragic element in life  a person up in years can generally do his own miserere for himself although i notice that such an one often prefers jubilate deo for his ordinary singing  on the whole the most religious exercise for the aged is probably to recall their own experience so many friends dead so many hopes disappointed so many slips and stumbles and withal so many bright days and smiling providences there is surely the matter of a very eloquent sermon in all this  on the whole i was greatly solemnised  in the little pictorial map of our whole inland voyage which my fancy still preserves and sometimes unrolls for the amusement of odd moments noyon cathedral figures on a most preposterous scale and must be nearly as large as a department  i can still see the faces of the priests as if they were at my elbow and hear ave maria ora pro nobis sounding through the church  all noyon is blotted out for me by these superior memories and i do not care to say more about the place it was but a stack of brown roofs at the best where i believe people live very reputably in a quiet way but the shadow of the church falls upon it when the sun is low and the five bells are heard in all quarters telling that the organ has begun  if ever i join the church of rome i shall stipulate to be bishop of noyon on the oise    down the oise    to compiegne   the most patient people grow weary at last with being continually wetted with rain except of course in the scottish highlands where there are not enough fine intervals to point the difference  that was like to be our case the day we left noyon  i remember nothing of the voyage it was nothing but clay banks and willows and rain incessant pitiless beating rain until we stopped to lunch at a little inn at pimprez where the canal ran very near the river  we were so sadly drenched that the landlady lit a few sticks in the chimney for our comfort there we sat in a steam of vapour lamenting our concerns  the husband donned a gamebag and strode out to shoot the wife sat in a far corner watching us  i think we were worth looking at  we grumbled over the misfortune of la fere we forecast other la feres in the futurealthough things went better with the cigarette for spokesman he had more aplomb altogether than i and a dull positive way of approaching a landlady that carried off the indiarubber bags  talking of la fere put us talking of the reservists  reservery said he seems a pretty mean way to spend ones autumn holiday  about as mean returned i dejectedly as canoeing  these gentlemen travel for their pleasure asked the landlady with unconscious irony  it was too much  the scales fell from our eyes  another wet day it was determined and we put the boats into the train  the weather took the hint  that was our last wetting  the afternoon faired up  grand clouds still voyaged in the sky but now singly and with a depth of blue around their path and a sunset in the daintiest rose and gold inaugurated a thick night of stars and a month of unbroken weather  at the same time the river began to give us a better outlook into the country  the banks were not so high the willows disappeared from along the margin and pleasant hills stood all along its course and marked their profile on the sky  in a little while the canal coming to its last lock began to discharge its waterhouses on the oise so that we had no lack of company to fear  here were all our old friends the deo gratias of conde and the four sons of aymon journeyed cheerily down stream along with us we exchanged waterside pleasantries with the steersman perched among the lumber or the driver hoarse with bawling to his horses and the children came and looked over the side as we paddled by  we had never known all this while how much we missed them but it gave us a fillip to see the smoke from their chimneys  a little below this junction we made another meeting of yet more account  for there we were joined by the aisne already a far travelled river and fresh out of champagne  here ended the adolescence of the oise this was his marriage day thenceforward he had a stately brimming march conscious of his own dignity and sundry dams  he became a tranquil feature in the scene  the trees and towns saw themselves in him as in a mirror  he carried the canoes lightly on his broad breast there was no need to work hard against an eddy  but idleness became the order of the day and mere straightforward dipping of the paddle now on this side now on that without intelligence or effort  truly we were coming into halcyon weather upon all accounts and were floated towards the sea like gentlemen  we made compiegne as the sun was going down  a fine profile of a town above the river  over the bridge a regiment was parading to the drum  people loitered on the quay some fishing some looking idly at the stream  and as the two boats shot in along the water we could see them pointing them out and speaking one to another we landed at a floating lavatory where the washerwomen were still beating the clothes    at compiegne    we put up at a big bustling hotel in compiegne where nobody observed our presence  reservery and general militarismus as the germans call it were rampant  a camp of conical white tents without the town looked like a leaf out of a picture bible swordbelts decorated the walls of the cafes and the streets kept sounding all day long with military music  it was not possible to be an englishman and avoid a feeling of elation for the men who followed the drums were small and walked shabbily  each man inclined at his own angle and jolted to his own convenience as he went  there was nothing of the superb gait with which a regiment of tall highlanders moves behind its music solemn and inevitable like a natural phenomenon who that has seen it can forget the drummajor pacing in front the drummers tigerskins the pipers swinging plaids the strange elastic rhythm of the whole regiment footing it in timeand the bang of the drum when the brasses cease and the shrill pipes take up the martial story in their place  a girl at school in france began to describe one of our regiments on parade to her french schoolmates and as she went on she told me the recollection grew so vivid she became so proud to be the countrywoman of such soldiers and so sorry to be in another country that her voice failed her and she burst into tears  i have never forgotten that girl and i think she very nearly deserves a statue  to call her a young lady with all its niminy associations would be to offer her an insult  she may rest assured of one thing  although she never should marry a heroic general never see any great or immediate result of her life she will not have lived in vain for her native land  but though french soldiers show to ill advantage on parade on the march they are gay alert and willing like a troop of foxhunters i remember once seeing a company pass through the forest of fontainebleau on the chailly road between the bas breau and the reine blanche  one fellow walked a little before the rest and sang a loud audacious marching song  the rest bestirred their feet and even swung their muskets in time  a young officer on horseback had hard ado to keep his countenance at the words  you never saw anything so cheerful and spontaneous as their gait schoolboys do not look more eagerly at hare and hounds and you would have thought it impossible to tire such willing marchers  my great delight in compiegne was the townhall  i doted upon the townhall  it is a monument of gothic insecurity all turreted and gargoyled and slashed and bedizened with half a score of architectural fancies  some of the niches are gilt and painted and in a great square panel in the centre in black relief on a gilt ground louis xii rides upon a pacing horse with hand on hip and head thrown back  there is royal arrogance in every line of him the stirruped foot projects insolently from the frame the eye is hard and proud the very horse seems to be treading with gratification over prostrate serfs and to have the breath of the trumpet in his nostrils  so rides for ever on the front of the townhall the good king louis xii the father of his people  over the kings head in the tall centre turret appears the dial of a clock and high above that three little mechanical figures each one with a hammer in his hand whose business it is to chime out the hours and halves and quarters for the burgesses of compiegne  the centre figure has a gilt breastplate the two others wear gilt trunkhose and they all three have elegant flapping hats like cavaliers  as the quarter approaches they turn their heads and look knowingly one to the other and then kling go the three hammers on three little bells below  the hour follows deep and sonorous from the interior of the tower and the gilded gentlemen rest from their labours with contentment  i had a great deal of healthy pleasure from their manoeuvres and took good care to miss as few performances as possible and i found that even the cigarette while he pretended to despise my enthusiasm was more or less a devotee himself  there is something highly absurd in the exposition of such toys to the outrages of winter on a housetop  they would be more in keeping in a glass case before a nurnberg clock  above all at night when the children are abed and even grown people are snoring under quilts does it not seem impertinent to leave these gingerbread figures winking and tinkling to the stars and the rolling moon  the gargoyles may fitly enough twist their apelike heads fitly enough may the potentate bestride his charger like a centurion in an old german print of the via dolorosa but the toys should be put away in a box among some cotton until the sun rises and the children are abroad again to be amused  in compiegne postoffice a great packet of letters awaited us and the authorities were for this occasion only so polite as to hand them over upon application  in some ways our journey may be said to end with this letterbag at compiegne  the spell was broken  we had partly come home from that moment  no one should have any correspondence on a journey it is bad enough to have to write but the receipt of letters is the death of all holiday feeling  out of my country and myself i go  i wish to take a dive among new conditions for a while as into another element  i have nothing to do with my friends or my affections for the time when i came away i left my heart at home in a desk or sent it forward with my portmanteau to await me at my destination  after my journey is over i shall not fail to read your admirable letters with the attention they deserve  but i have paid all this money look you and paddled all these strokes for no other purpose than to be abroad and yet you keep me at home with your perpetual communications  you tug the string and i feel that i am a tethered bird  you pursue me all over europe with the little vexations that i came away to avoid  there is no discharge in the war of life i am well aware but shall there not be so much as a weeks furlough  we were up by six the day we were to leave  they had taken so little note of us that i hardly thought they would have condescended on a bill  but they did with some smart particulars too and we paid in a civilised manner to an uninterested clerk and went out of that hotel with the indiarubber bags unremarked no one cared to know about us  it is not possible to rise before a village but compiegne was so grown a town that it took its ease in the morning and we were up and away while it was still in dressinggown and slippers  the streets were left to people washing doorsteps nobody was in full dress but the cavaliers upon the townhall they were all washed with dew spruce in their gilding and full of intelligence and a sense of professional responsibility  kling went they on the bells for the halfpast six as we went by  i took it kind of them to make me this parting compliment they never were in better form not even at noon upon a sunday  there was no one to see us off but the early washerwomenearly and latewho were already beating the linen in their floating lavatory on the river  they were very merry and matutinal in their ways plunged their arms boldly in and seemed not to feel the shock  it would be dispiriting to me this early beginning and first cold dabble of a most dispiriting days work  but i believe they would have been as unwilling to change days with us as we could be to change with them  they crowded to the door to watch us paddle away into the thin sunny mists upon the river and shouted heartily after us till we were through the bridge    changed times    there is a sense in which those mists never rose from off our journey and from that time forth they lie very densely in my note book  as long as the oise was a small rural river it took us near by peoples doors and we could hold a conversation with natives in the riparian fields  but now that it had grown so wide the life along shore passed us by at a distance  it was the same difference as between a great public highway and a country bypath that wanders in and out of cottage gardens  we now lay in towns where nobody troubled us with questions we had floated into civilised life where people pass without salutation  in sparsely inhabited places we make all we can of each encounter but when it comes to a city we keep to ourselves and never speak unless we have trodden on a mans toes  in these waters we were no longer strange birds and nobody supposed we had travelled farther than from the last town  i remember when we came into lisle adam for instance how we met dozens of pleasureboats outing it for the afternoon and there was nothing to distinguish the true voyager from the amateur except perhaps the filthy condition of my sail the company in one boat actually thought they recognised me for a neighbour  was there ever anything more wounding  all the romance had come down to that  now on the upper oise where nothing sailed as a general thing but fish a pair of canoeists could not be thus vulgarly explained away we were strange and picturesque intruders and out of peoples wonder sprang a sort of light and passing intimacy all along our route  there is nothing but tit fortat in this world though sometimes it be a little difficult to trace  for the scores are older than we ourselves and there has never yet been a settlingday since things were  you get entertainment pretty much in proportion as you give  as long as we were a sort of odd wanderers to be stared at and followed like a quack doctor or a caravan we had no want of amusement in return but as soon as we sank into commonplace ourselves all whom we met were similarly disenchanted  and here is one reason of a dozen why the world is dull to dull persons  in our earlier adventures there was generally something to do and that quickened us  even the showers of rain had a revivifying effect and shook up the brain from torpor  but now when the river no longer ran in a proper sense only glided seaward with an even outright but imperceptible speed and when the sky smiled upon us day after day without variety we began to slip into that golden doze of the mind which follows upon much exercise in the open air  i have stupefied myself in this way more than once indeed i dearly love the feeling but i never had it to the same degree as when paddling down the oise  it was the apotheosis of stupidity  we ceased reading entirely  sometimes when i found a new paper i took a particular pleasure in reading a single number of the current novel but i never could bear more than three instalments and even the second was a disappointment  as soon as the tale became in any way perspicuous it lost all merit in my eyes only a single scene or as is the way with these feuilletons half a scene without antecedent or consequence like a piece of a dream had the knack of fixing my interest  the less i saw of the novel the better i liked it  a pregnant reflection  but for the most part as i said we neither of us read anything in the world and employed the very little while we were awake between bed and dinner in poring upon maps  i have always been fond of maps and can voyage in an atlas with the greatest enjoyment  the names of places are singularly inviting the contour of coasts and rivers is enthralling to the eye and to hit in a map upon some place you have heard of before makes history a new possession  but we thumbed our charts on these evenings with the blankest unconcern we cared not a fraction for this place or that  we stared at the sheet as children listen to their rattle and read the names of towns or villages to forget them again at once  we had no romance in the matter there was nobody so fancyfree  if you had taken the maps away while we were studying them most intently it is a fair bet whether we might not have continued to study the table with the same delight  about one thing we were mightily taken up and that was eating  i think i made a god of my belly  i remember dwelling in imagination upon this or that dish till my mouth watered and long before we got in for the night my appetite was a clamant instant annoyance sometimes we paddled alongside for a while and whetted each other with gastronomical fancies as we went  cake and sherry a homely rejection but not within reach upon the oise trotted through my head for many a mile and once as we were approaching verberie the cigarette brought my heart into my mouth by the suggestion of oysterpatties and sauterne  i suppose none of us recognise the great part that is played in life by eating and drinking  the appetite is so imperious that we can stomach the least interesting viands and pass off a dinner hour thankfully enough on bread and water just as there are men who must read something if it were only bradshaws guide  but there is a romance about the matter after all  probably the table has more devotees than love and i am sure that food is much more generally entertaining than scenery  do you give in as walt whitman would say that you are any the less immortal for that the true materialism is to be ashamed of what we are  to detect the flavour of an olive is no less a piece of human perfection than to find beauty in the colours of the sunset  canoeing was easy work  to dip the paddle at the proper inclination now right now left to keep the head down stream to empty the little pool that gathered in the lap of the apron to screw up the eyes against the glittering sparkles of sun upon the water or now and again to pass below the whistling towrope of the deo gratias of conde or the four sons of aymonthere was not much art in that certain silly muscles managed it between sleep and waking and meanwhile the brain had a whole holiday and went to sleep  we took in at a glance the larger features of the scene and beheld with half an eye bloused fishers and dabbling washerwomen on the bank  now and again we might be halfwakened by some church spire by a leaping fish or by a trail of river grass that clung about the paddle and had to be plucked off and thrown away  but these luminous intervals were only partially luminous a little more of us was called into action but never the whole the central bureau of nerves what in some moods we call ourselves enjoyed its holiday without disturbance like a government office the great wheels of intelligence turned idly in the head like fly wheels grinding no grist  i have gone on for half an hour at a time counting my strokes and forgetting the hundreds  i flatter myself the beasts that perish could not underbid that as a low form of consciousness  and what a pleasure it was  what a hearty tolerant temper did it bring about  there is nothing captious about a man who has attained to this the one possible apotheosis in life the apotheosis of stupidity and he begins to feel dignified and longaevous like a tree  there was one odd piece of practical metaphysics which accompanied what i may call the depth if i must not call it the intensity of my abstraction  what philosophers call me and notme ego and non ego preoccupied me whether i would or no  there was less me and more notme than i was accustomed to expect  i looked on upon somebody else who managed the paddling i was aware of somebody elses feet against the stretcher my own body seemed to have no more intimate relation to me than the canoe or the river or the river banks  nor this alone  something inside my mind a part of my brain a province of my proper being had thrown off allegiance and set up for itself or perhaps for the somebody else who did the paddling  i had dwindled into quite a little thing in a corner of myself  i was isolated in my own skull  thoughts presented themselves unbidden they were not my thoughts they were plainly some one elses and i considered them like a part of the landscape  i take it in short that i was about as near nirvana as would be convenient in practical life and if this be so i make the buddhists my sincere compliments tis an agreeable state not very consistent with mental brilliancy not exactly profitable in a money point of view but very calm golden and incurious and one that sets a man superior to alarms  it may be best figured by supposing yourself to get dead drunk and yet keep sober to enjoy it  i have a notion that openair labourers must spend a large portion of their days in this ecstatic stupor which explains their high composure and endurance  a pity to go to the expense of laudanum when here is a better paradise for nothing  this frame of mind was the great exploit of our voyage take it all in all  it was the farthest piece of travel accomplished  indeed it lies so far from beaten paths of language that i despair of getting the reader into sympathy with the smiling complacent idiocy of my condition when ideas came and went like motes in a sunbeam when trees and church spires along the bank surged up from time to time into my notice like solid objects through a rolling cloudland when the rhythmical swish of boat and paddle in the water became a cradlesong to lull my thoughts asleep when a piece of mud on the deck was sometimes an intolerable eyesore and sometimes quite a companion for me and the object of pleased considerationand all the time with the river running and the shores changing upon either hand i kept counting my strokes and forgetting the hundreds the happiest animal in france    down the oise  church interiors    we made our first stage below compiegne to pont sainte maxence  i was abroad a little after six the next morning  the air was biting and smelt of frost  in an open place a score of women wrangled together over the days market and the noise of their negotiation sounded thin and querulous like that of sparrows on a winters morning  the rare passengers blew into their hands and shuffled in their wooden shoes to set the blood agog  the streets were full of icy shadow although the chimneys were smoking overhead in golden sunshine  if you wake early enough at this season of the year you may get up in december to break your fast in june  i found my way to the church for there is always something to see about a church whether living worshippers or dead mens tombs you find there the deadliest earnest and the hollowest deceit and even where it is not a piece of history it will be certain to leak out some contemporary gossip  it was scarcely so cold in the church as it was without but it looked colder  the white nave was positively arctic to the eye and the tawdriness of a continental altar looked more forlorn than usual in the solitude and the bleak air  two priests sat in the chancel reading and waiting penitents and out in the nave one very old woman was engaged in her devotions  it was a wonder how she was able to pass her beads when healthy young people were breathing in their palms and slapping their chest but though this concerned me i was yet more dispirited by the nature of her exercises  she went from chair to chair from altar to altar circumnavigating the church  to each shrine she dedicated an equal number of beads and an equal length of time  like a prudent capitalist with a somewhat cynical view of the commercial prospect she desired to place her supplications in a great variety of heavenly securities  she would risk nothing on the credit of any single intercessor  out of the whole company of saints and angels not one but was to suppose himself her champion elect against the great assize  i could only think of it as a dull transparent jugglery based upon unconscious unbelief  she was as dead an old woman as ever i saw no more than bone and parchment curiously put together  her eyes with which she interrogated mine were vacant of sense  it depends on what you call seeing whether you might not call her blind  perhaps she had known love  perhaps borne children suckled them and given them pet names  but now that was all gone by and had left her neither happier nor wiser and the best she could do with her mornings was to come up here into the cold church and juggle for a slice of heaven  it was not without a gulp that i escaped into the streets and the keen morning air  morning why how tired of it she would be before night and if she did not sleep how then  it is fortunate that not many of us are brought up publicly to justify our lives at the bar of threescore years and ten fortunate that such a number are knocked opportunely on the head in what they call the flower of their years and go away to suffer for their follies in private somewhere else  otherwise between sick children and discontented old folk we might be put out of all conceit of life  i had need of all my cerebral hygiene during that days paddle the old devotee stuck in my throat sorely  but i was soon in the seventh heaven of stupidity and knew nothing but that somebody was paddling a canoe while i was counting his strokes and forgetting the hundreds  i used sometimes to be afraid i should remember the hundreds which would have made a toil of a pleasure but the terror was chimerical they went out of my mind by enchantment and i knew no more than the man in the moon about my only occupation  at creil where we stopped to lunch we left the canoes in another floating lavatory which as it was high noon was packed with washerwomen redhanded and loudvoiced and they and their broad jokes are about all i remember of the place  i could look up my historybooks if you were very anxious and tell you a date or two for it figured rather largely in the english wars  but i prefer to mention a girls boardingschool which had an interest for us because it was a girls boardingschool and because we imagined we had rather an interest for it  at leastthere were the girls about the garden and here were we on the river and there was more than one handkerchief waved as we went by  it caused quite a stir in my heart and yet how we should have wearied and despised each other these girls and i if we had been introduced at a croquetparty  but this is a fashion i love  to kiss the hand or wave a handkerchief to people i shall never see again to play with possibility and knock in a peg for fancy to hang upon  it gives the traveller a jog reminds him that he is not a traveller everywhere and that his journey is no more than a siesta by the way on the real march of life  the church at creil was a nondescript place in the inside splashed with gaudy lights from the windows and picked out with medallions of the dolorous way  but there was one oddity in the way of an ex voto which pleased me hugely  a faithful model of a canal boat swung from the vault with a written aspiration that god should conduct the saint nicolas of creil to a good haven  the thing was neatly executed and would have made the delight of a party of boys on the waterside  but what tickled me was the gravity of the peril to be conjured  you might hang up the model of a seagoing ship and welcome  one that is to plough a furrow round the world and visit the tropic or the frosty poles runs dangers that are well worth a candle and a mass  but the saint nicolas of creil which was to be tugged for some ten years by patient draughthorses in a weedy canal with the poplars chattering overhead and the skipper whistling at the tiller which was to do all its errands in green inland places and never get out of sight of a village belfry in all its cruising why you would have thought if anything could be done without the intervention of providence it would be that  but perhaps the skipper was a humorist  or perhaps a prophet reminding people of the seriousness of life by this preposterous token  at creil as at noyon saint joseph seemed a favourite saint on the score of punctuality  day and hour can be specified and grateful people do not fail to specify them on a votive tablet when prayers have been punctually and neatly answered  whenever time is a consideration saint joseph is the proper intermediary  i took a sort of pleasure in observing the vogue he had in france for the good man plays a very small part in my religion at home  yet i could not help fearing that where the saint is so much commanded for exactitude he will be expected to be very grateful for his tablet  this is foolishness to us protestants and not of great importance anyway  whether peoples gratitude for the good gifts that come to them be wisely conceived or dutifully expressed is a secondary matter after all so long as they feel gratitude  the true ignorance is when a man does not know that he has received a good gift or begins to imagine that he has got it for himself  the selfmade man is the funniest windbag after all  there is a marked difference between decreeing light in chaos and lighting the gas in a metropolitan backparlour with a box of patent matches and do what we will there is always something made to our hand if it were only our fingers  but there was something worse than foolishness placarded in creil church  the association of the living rosary of which i had never previously heard is responsible for that  this association was founded according to the printed advertisement by a brief of pope gregory sixteenth on the 17th of january 1832  according to a coloured basrelief it seems to have been founded sometime other by the virgin giving one rosary to saint dominic and the infant saviour giving another to saint catharine of siena  pope gregory is not so imposing but he is nearer hand  i could not distinctly make out whether the association was entirely devotional or had an eye to good works at least it is highly organised  the names of fourteen matrons and misses were filled in for each week of the month as associates with one other generally a married woman at the top for zelatrice  the leader of the band  indulgences plenary and partial follow on the performance of the duties of the association  the partial indulgences are attached to the recitation of the rosary  on the recitation of the required dizaine a partial indulgence promptly follows  when people serve the kingdom of heaven with a passbook in their hands i should always be afraid lest they should carry the same commercial spirit into their dealings with their fellowmen which would make a sad and sordid business of this life  there is one more article however of happier import  all these indulgences it appeared are applicable to souls in purgatory for gods sake ye ladies of creil apply them all to the souls in purgatory without delay  burns would take no hire for his last songs preferring to serve his country out of unmixed love suppose you were to imitate the exciseman mesdames and even if the souls in purgatory were not greatly bettered some souls in creil upon the oise would find themselves none the worse either here or hereafter  i cannot help wondering as i transcribe these notes whether a protestant born and bred is in a fit state to understand these signs and do them what justice they deserve and i cannot help answering that he is not  they cannot look so merely ugly and mean to the faithful as they do to me  i see that as clearly as a proposition in euclid  for these believers are neither weak nor wicked  they can put up their tablet commanding saint joseph for his despatch as if he were still a village carpenter they can recite the required dizaine and metaphorically pocket the indulgence as if they had done a job for heaven and then they can go out and look down unabashed upon this wonderful river flowing by and up without confusion at the pinpoint stars which are themselves great worlds full of flowing rivers greater than the oise  i see it as plainly i say as a proposition in euclid that my protestant mind has missed the point and that there goes with these deformities some higher and more religious spirit than i dream  i wonder if other people would make the same allowances for me like the ladies of creil having recited my rosary of toleration i look for my indulgence on the spot    precy and the marionnettes    we made precy about sundown  the plain is rich with tufts of poplar  in a wide luminous curve the oise lay under the hillside  a faint mist began to rise and confound the different distances together  there was not a sound audible but that of the sheepbells in some meadows by the river and the creaking of a cart down the long road that descends the hill  the villas in their gardens the shops along the street all seemed to have been deserted the day before and i felt inclined to walk discreetly as one feels in a silent forest  all of a sudden we came round a corner and there in a little green round the church was a bevy of girls in parisian costumes playing croquet  their laughter and the hollow sound of ball and mallet made a cheery stir in the neighbourhood and the look of these slim figures all corseted and ribboned produced an answerable disturbance in our hearts  we were within sniff of paris it seemed  and here were females of our own species playing croquet just as if precy had been a place in real life instead of a stage in the fairyland of travel  for to be frank the peasant woman is scarcely to be counted as a woman at all and after having passed by such a succession of people in petticoats digging and hoeing and making dinner this company of coquettes under arms made quite a surprising feature in the landscape and convinced us at once of being fallible males  the inn at precy is the worst inn in france  not even in scotland have i found worse fare  it was kept by a brother and sister neither of whom was out of their teens  the sister so to speak prepared a meal for us and the brother who had been tippling came in and brought with him a tipsy butcher to entertain us as we ate  we found pieces of loowarm pork among the salad and pieces of unknown yielding substance in the ragout  the butcher entertained us with pictures of parisian life with which he professed himself well acquainted the brother sitting the while on the edge of the billiardtable toppling precariously and sucking the stump of a cigar  in the midst of these diversions bang went a drum past the house and a hoarse voice began issuing a proclamation  it was a man with marionnettes announcing a performance for that evening  he had set up his caravan and lighted his candles on another part of the girls croquetgreen under one of those open sheds which are so common in france to shelter markets and he and his wife by the time we strolled up there were trying to keep order with the audience  it was the most absurd contention  the showpeople had set out a certain number of benches and all who sat upon them were to pay a couple of sous for the accommodation  they were always quite full a bumper houseas long as nothing was going forward but let the showwoman appear with an eye to a collection and at the first rattle of her tambourine the audience slipped off the seats and stood round on the outside with their hands in their pockets  it certainly would have tried an angels temper  the showman roared from the proscenium he had been all over france and nowhere nowhere not even on the borders of germany had he met with such misconduct  such thieves and rogues and rascals as he called them  and every now and again the wife issued on another round and added her shrill quota to the tirade  i remarked here as elsewhere how far more copious is the female mind in the material of insult  the audience laughed in high goodhumour over the mans declamations but they bridled and cried aloud under the womans pungent sallies  she picked out the sore points  she had the honour of the village at her mercy  voices answered her angrily out of the crowd and received a smarting retort for their trouble a couple of old ladies beside me who had duly paid for their seats waxed very red and indignant and discoursed to each other audibly about the impudence of these mountebanks but as soon as the showwoman caught a whisper of this she was down upon them with a swoop  if mesdames could persuade their neighbours to act with common honesty the mountebanks she assured them would be polite enough  mesdames had probably had their bowl of soup and perhaps a glass of wine that evening the mountebanks also had a taste for soup and did not choose to have their little earnings stolen from them before their eyes  once things came as far as a brief personal encounter between the showman and some lads in which the former went down as readily as one of his own marionnettes to a peal of jeering laughter  i was a good deal astonished at this scene because i am pretty well acquainted with the ways of french strollers more or less artistic and have always found them singularly pleasing  any stroller must be dear to the rightthinking heart if it were only as a living protest against offices and the mercantile spirit and as something to remind us that life is not by necessity the kind of thing we generally make it  even a german band if you see it leaving town in the early morning for a campaign in country places among trees and meadows has a romantic flavour for the imagination  there is nobody under thirty so dead but his heart will stir a little at sight of a gypsies camp  we are not cottonspinners all or at least not all through  there is some life in humanity yet  and youth will now and again find a brave word to say in dispraise of riches and throw up a situation to go strolling with a knapsack  an englishman has always special facilities for intercourse with french gymnasts for england is the natural home of gymnasts  this or that fellow in his tights and spangles is sure to know a word or two of english to have drunk english affnaff and perhaps performed in an english musichall  he is a countryman of mine by profession  he leaps like the belgian boating men to the notion that i must be an athlete myself  but the gymnast is not my favourite he has little or no tincture of the artist in his composition his soul is small and pedestrian for the most part since his profession makes no call upon it and does not accustom him to high ideas  but if a man is only so much of an actor that he can stumble through a farce he is made free of a new order of thoughts  he has something else to think about beside the moneybox  he has a pride of his own and what is of far more importance he has an aim before him that he can never quite attain  he has gone upon a pilgrimage that will last him his life long because there is no end to it short of perfection  he will better upon himself a little day by day or even if he has given up the attempt he will always remember that once upon a time he had conceived this high ideal that once upon a time he had fallen in love with a star  tis better to have loved and lost although the moon should have nothing to say to endymion although he should settle down with audrey and feed pigs do you not think he would move with a better grace and cherish higher thoughts to the end  the louts he meets at church never had a fancy above audreys snood but there is a reminiscence in endymions heart that like a spice keeps it fresh and haughty  to be even one of the outskirters of art leaves a fine stamp on a mans countenance  i remember once dining with a party in the inn at chateau landon  most of them were unmistakable bagmen others welltodo peasantry but there was one young fellow in a blouse whose face stood out from among the rest surprisingly  it looked more finished more of the spirit looked out through it it had a living expressive air and you could see that his eyes took things in  my companion and i wondered greatly who and what he could be it was fairtime in chateau landon and when we went along to the booths we had our question answered for there was our friend busily fiddling for the peasants to caper to  he was a wandering violinist  a troop of strollers once came to the inn where i was staying in the department of seine et marne  there was a father and mother two daughters brazen blowsy hussies who sang and acted without an idea of how to set about either and a dark young man like a tutor a recalcitrant housepainter who sang and acted not amiss the mother was the genius of the party so far as genius can be spoken of with regard to such a pack of incompetent humbugs and her husband could not find words to express his admiration for her comic countryman  you should see my old woman said he and nodded his beery countenance  one night they performed in the stableyard with flaring lampsa wretched exhibition coldly looked upon by a village audience  next night as soon as the lamps were lighted there came a plump of rain and they had to sweep away their baggage as fast as possible and make off to the barn where they harboured cold wet and supperless  in the morning a dear friend of mine who has as warm a heart for strollers as i have myself made a little collection and sent it by my hands to comfort them for their disappointment  i gave it to the father he thanked me cordially and we drank a cup together in the kitchen talking of roads and audiences and hard times  when i was going up got my old stroller and off with his hat  i am afraid said he that monsieur will think me altogether a beggar but i have another demand to make upon him  i began to hate him on the spot  we play again tonight he went on  of course i shall refuse to accept any more money from monsieur and his friends who have been already so liberal  but our programme of tonight is something truly creditable and i cling to the idea that monsieur will honour us with his presence  and then with a shrug and a smile  monsieur understandsthe vanity of an artist  save the mark  the vanity of an artist  that is the kind of thing that reconciles me to life  a ragged tippling incompetent old rogue with the manners of a gentleman and the vanity of an artist to keep up his selfrespect  but the man after my own heart is m de vauversin  it is nearly two years since i saw him first and indeed i hope i may see him often again  here is his first programme as i found it on the breakfasttable and have kept it ever since as a relic of bright days   mesdames et messieurs  mademoiselle ferrario et m de vauversin auront lhonneur de chanter ce soir les morceaux suivants  madermoiselle ferrario chanteramignonoiseaux legersfrance des francais dorment lale chateau bleuou voulezvous aller  m de vauversinmadame fontaine et m robinetles plongeurs a chevalle mari mecontenttaistoi gaminmon voisin loriginal heureux comme cacomme on est trompe   they made a stage at one end of the salleamanger  and what a sight it was to see m de vauversin with a cigarette in his mouth twanging a guitar and following mademoiselle ferrarios eyes with the obedient kindly look of a dog  the entertainment wound up with a tombola or auction of lottery tickets  an admirable amusement with all the excitement of gambling and no hope of gain to make you ashamed of your eagerness for there all is loss you make haste to be out of pocket it is a competition who shall lose most money for the benefit of m de vauversin and mademoiselle ferrario  m de vauversin is a small man with a great head of black hair a vivacious and engaging air and a smile that would be delightful if he had better teeth  he was once an actor in the chatelet but he contracted a nervous affection from the heat and glare of the footlights which unfitted him for the stage  at this crisis mademoiselle ferrario otherwise mademoiselle rita of the alcazar agreed to share his wandering fortunes  i could never forget the generosity of that lady said he  he wears trousers so tight that it has long been a problem to all who knew him how he manages to get in and out of them  he sketches a little in watercolours he writes verses he is the most patient of fishermen and spent long days at the bottom of the inngarden fruitlessly dabbling a line in the clear river  you should hear him recounting his experiences over a bottle of wine such a pleasant vein of talk as he has with a ready smile at his own mishaps and every now and then a sudden gravity like a man who should hear the surf roar while he was telling the perils of the deep  for it was no longer ago than last night perhaps that the receipts only amounted to a franc and a half to cover three francs of railway fare and two of board and lodging  the maire a man worth a million of money sat in the front seat repeatedly applauding mlle ferrario and yet gave no more than three sous the whole evening  local authorities look with such an evil eye upon the strolling artist  alas i know it well who have been myself taken for one and pitilessly incarcerated on the strength of the misapprehension  once m de vauversin visited a commissary of police for permission to sing  the commissary who was smoking at his ease politely doffed his hat upon the singers entrance  mr commissary he began i am an artist  and on went the commissarys hat again  no courtesy for the companions of apollo  they are as degraded as that said m de vauversin with a sweep of his cigarette  but what pleased me most was one outbreak of his when we had been talking all the evening of the rubs indignities and pinchings of his wandering life  some one said it would be better to have a million of money down and mlle ferrario admitted that she would prefer that mightily  eh bien moi nonnot i cried de vauversin striking the table with his hand  if any one is a failure in the world is it not i  i had an art in which i have done things wellas well as somebetter perhaps than others and now it is closed against me  i must go about the country gathering coppers and singing nonsense  do you think i regret my life  do you think i would rather be a fat burgess like a calf  not i  i have had moments when i have been applauded on the boards  i think nothing of that but i have known in my own mind sometimes when i had not a clap from the whole house that i had found a true intonation or an exact and speaking gesture and then messieurs i have known what pleasure was what it was to do a thing well what it was to be an artist  and to know what art is is to have an interest for ever such as no burgess can find in his petty concerns  tenez messieurs je vais vous le direit is like a religion  such making some allowance for the tricks of memory and the inaccuracies of translation was the profession of faith of m de vauversin  i have given him his own name lest any other wanderer should come across him with his guitar and cigarette and mademoiselle ferrario for should not all the world delight to honour this unfortunate and loyal follower of the muses  may apollo send him rimes hitherto undreamed of may the river be no longer scanty of her silver fishes to his lure may the cold not pinch him on long winter rides nor the village jackinoffice affront him with unseemly manners and may he never miss mademoiselle ferrario from his side to follow with his dutiful eyes and accompany on the guitar  the marionnettes made a very dismal entertainment  they performed a piece called pyramus and thisbe in five mortal acts and all written in alexandrines fully as long as the performers  one marionnette was the king another the wicked counsellor a third credited with exceptional beauty represented thisbe and then there were guards and obdurate fathers and walking gentlemen nothing particular took place during the two or three acts that i sat out but you will he pleased to learn that the unities were properly respected and the whole piece with one exception moved in harmony with classical rules  that exception was the comic countryman a lean marionnette in wooden shoes who spoke in prose and in a broad patois much appreciated by the audience  he took unconstitutional liberties with the person of his sovereign kicked his fellowmarionnettes in the mouth with his wooden shoes and whenever none of the versifying suitors were about made love to thisbe on his own account in comic prose  this fellows evolutions and the little prologue in which the showman made a humorous eulogium of his troop praising their indifference to applause and hisses and their single devotion to their art were the only circumstances in the whole affair that you could fancy would so much as raise a smile  but the villagers of precy seemed delighted  indeed so long as a thing is an exhibition and you pay to see it it is nearly certain to amuse if we were charged so much a head for sunsets or if god sent round a drum before the hawthorns came in flower what a work should we not make about their beauty  but these things like good companions stupid people early cease to observe  and the abstract bagman tittups past in his spring gig and is positively not aware of the flowers along the lane or the scenery of the weather overhead    back to the world    of the next two days sail little remains in my mind and nothing whatever in my notebook  the river streamed on steadily through pleasant riverside landscapes  washerwomen in blue dresses fishers in blue blouses diversified the green banks and the relation of the two colours was like that of the flower and the leaf in the forgetmenot  a symphony in forgetmenot i think theophile gautier might thus have characterised that two days panorama  the sky was blue and cloudless and the sliding surface of the river held up in smooth places a mirror to the heaven and the shores  the washerwomen hailed us laughingly and the noise of trees and water made an accompaniment to our dozing thoughts as we fleeted down the stream  the great volume the indefatigable purpose of the river held the mind in chain  it seemed now so sure of its end so strong and easy in its gait like a grown man full of determination  the surf was roaring for it on the sands of havre  for my own part slipping along this moving thoroughfare in my fiddlecase of a canoe i also was beginning to grow aweary for my ocean  to the civilised man there must come sooner or later a desire for civilisation  i was weary of dipping the paddle i was weary of living on the skirts of life i wished to be in the thick of it once more i wished to get to work i wished to meet people who understood my own speech and could meet with me on equal terms as a man and no longer as a curiosity  and so a letter at pontoise decided us and we drew up our keels for the last time out of that river of oise that had faithfully piloted them through rain and sunshine for so long  for so many miles had this fleet and footless beast of burthen charioted our fortunes that we turned our back upon it with a sense of separation  we had made a long detour out of the world but now we were back in the familiar places where life itself makes all the running and we are carried to meet adventure without a stroke of the paddle  now we were to return like the voyager in the play and see what rearrangements fortune had perfected the while in our surroundings what surprises stood ready made for us at home and whither and how far the world had voyaged in our absence  you may paddle all day long but it is when you come back at nightfall and look in at the familiar room that you find love or death awaiting you beside the stove and the most beautiful adventures are not those we go to seek
