49733028	odd craft  by ww jacobs    the persecution of bob pretty  the old man sat on his accustomed bench outside the cauliflower  a generous measure of beer stood in a blue and white jug by his elbow and little wisps of smoke curled slowly upward from the bowl of his churchwarden pipe  the knapsacks of two young men lay where they were flung on the table and the owners taking a noontide rest turned a polite if bored ear to the reminiscences of grateful old age  poaching said the old man who had tried topics ranging from early turnips to horseshoeingpoaching aint wot it used to be in these ere parts  nothing is like it used to be poaching nor anything else but that there man you might ha noticed as went out about ten minutes ago and called me old truthfulness as e passed is the worst one i know bob pretty is name is and of all the sly artful deceiving men that ever lived in claybury e is the worstnever did a honest days work in is life and never wanted the price of a glass of ale  illustration poaching said the old man aint wot it used to be in these ere parts  bob prettys worst time was just after old squire brown died  the old squire couldnt afford to preserve much but byandby a gentleman with plenty o money from london named rockett took is place and things began to look up  pheasants was is favourites and e spent no end o money rearing of em but anything that could be shot at suited im too  he started by sneering at the little game that squire brown ad left but all e could do didnt seem to make much difference things disappeared in a most eggstrordinary way and the keepers went pretty near crazy while the things the squire said about claybury and claybury men was disgraceful  everybody knew as it was bob pretty and one or two of is mates from other places but they couldnt prove it  they couldnt catch im nohow and at last the squire ad two keepers set off to watch im by night and by day  bob pretty wouldnt believe it he said e couldnt  and even when it was pointed out to im that keeper lewis was follering of im he said that it just appened he was going the same way that was all  and sometimes ed get up in the middle of the night and go for a fifteen mile walk cos ed got the toothache and mr lewis who adnt got it had to tag along arter im till he was fit to drop  o course it was one keeper the less to look arter the game and byandby the squire see that and took im off  all the same they kept a pretty close watch on bob and at last one arternoon they sprang out on im as he was walking past grays farm and asked him wot it was he ad in his pockets  thats my bisness mr lewis ses bob pretty  mr smith the other keeper passed is hands over bobs coat and felt something soft and bulgy  you take your ands off of me ses bob you dont know ow partikler i am  he jerked imself away but they caught old of im agin and mr lewis put is hand in his inside pocket and pulled out two brace o partridges  youll come along of us he ses catching im by the arm  weve been looking for you a long time ses keeper smith and its a pleasure for us to ave your company  bob pretty said e wouldnt go but they forced im along and took im all the way to cudford four miles off so that policeman white could lock im up for the night  mr white was amost as pleased as the keepers and e warned bob solemn not to speak becos all e said would be used agin im  never mind about that ses bob pretty  ive got a clear conscience and talking cant urt me  im very glad to see you mr white if these two clever experienced keepers hadnt brought me i should ave looked you up myself  theyve been and stole my partridges  them as was standing round laughed and even policeman white couldnt elp giving a little smile  theres nothing to laugh at ses bob olding his ead up  its a fine thing when a working mana ardworking mancant take home a little game for is family without being stopped and robbed  i spose they flew into your pocket ses policeman white  no they didnt ses bob  im not going to tell any lies about it i put em there  the partridges in my inside coatpocket and the bill in my waistcoatpocket  the bill ses keeper lewis staring at im  yes the bill ses bob pretty staring back at im the bill from mr keen the poulterer at wickham  he fetched it out of is pocket and showed it to mr white and the keepers was like madmen amost cos it was plain to see that bob pretty ad been and bought them partridges just for to play a game on em  i was curious to know wot they tasted like he ses to the policeman worst of it is i dont spose my pore wifell know ow to cook em  you get off ome ses policeman white staring at im  but aint i goin to be locked up  ses bob  ave i been brought all this way just to ave a little chat with a policeman i dont like  you go ome ses policeman white handing the partridges back to im  all right ses bob and i may ave to call you to witness that these ere two men laid hold o me and tried to steal my partridges  i shall go up and see my loryer about it  he walked off ome with his ead up as high as e could hold it and the airs e used to give imself arter this was terrible for to behold  he got is eldest boy to write a long letter to the squire about it saying that ed overlook it this time but e couldnt promise for the future wot with bob pretty on one side and squire rockett on the other them two keepers lives was ardly worth living  then the squire got a headkeeper named cutts a man as was said to know more about the ways of poachers than they did themselves  he was said to ave cleared out all the poachers for miles round the place e came from and pheasants could walk into peoples cottages and not be touched  he was a sharplooking man tall and thin with screwedup eyes and a little red beard  the second day e came e was up here at this ere cauliflower having a pint o beer and looking round at the chaps as he talked to the landlord  the odd thing was that men whod never taken a hare or a pheasant in their lives could ardly meet is eye while bob pretty stared at im as if e was a waxworks  i ear you ad a little poaching in these parts afore i came ses mr cutts to the landlord  i think i ave eard something o the kind ses the landlord staring over his ead with a faraway look in is eyes  you wont hear of much more ses the keeper  ive invented a new way of catching the dirty rascals afore i came ere i caught all the poachers on three estates  i clear em out just like a ferret clears out rats  sort o mantrap ses the landlord  ah thats tellings ses mr cutts  well i ope youll catch em here ses bob pretty theres far too many of em about for my liking  far too many  i shall ave em afore long ses mr cutts nodding his ead  illustration i shall ave em afore long ses mr cutts  your good ealth ses bob pretty holding up is mug  weve been wanting a man like you for a long time  i dont want any of your impidence my man ses the keeper  ive eard about you and nothing good either  you be careful  i am careful ses bob winking at the others  i ope youll catch all them low poaching chaps they give the place a bad name and im amost afraid to go out arter dark for fear of meeting em  peter gubbins and sam jones began to laugh but bob pretty got angry with em and said he didnt see there was anything to laugh at  he said that poaching was a disgrace to their native place and instead o laughing they ought to be thankful to mr cutts for coming to do away with it all  any help i can give you shall be given cheerful he ses to the keeper  when i want your help ill ask you for it ses mr cutts  thankee ses bob pretty  i ony ope i shant get my face knocked about like yours as been thats all cos my wifes so partikler  wot dye mean  ses mr cutts turning on him  my face aint been knocked about  oh i beg your pardin ses bob i didnt know it was natural  mr cutts went black in the face amost and stared at bob pretty as if e was going to eat im and bob stared back looking fust at the keepers nose and then at is eyes and mouth and then at is nose agin  youll know me agin i spose ses mr cutts at last  yes ses bob smiling i should know you a mile offon the darkest night  we shall see ses mr cutts taking up is beer and turning is back on him  those of us as live the longestll see the most  im glad ive lived long enough to see im ses bob to bill chambers i feel more satisfied with myself now  bill chambers coughed and mr cutts arter finishing is beer took another look at bob pretty and went off boiling amost  the trouble he took to catch bob pretty arter that you wouldnt believe and all the time the game seemed to be simply melting away and squire rockett was finding fault with im all day long  he was worn to a shadder amost with watching and bob pretty seemed to be more prosperous than ever  sometimes mr cutts watched in the plantations and sometimes e hid imself near bobs house and at last one night when e was crouching behind the fence of frederick scotts front garden e saw bob pretty come out of is house and arter a careful look round walk up the road he held is breath as bob passed im and was just getting up to foller im when bob stopped and walked slowly back agin sniffing  wot a delicious smell o roses  he ses out loud  he stood in the middle o the road nearly opposite where the keeper was hiding and sniffed so that you could ha eard him the other end o the village  it cant be roses he ses in a puzzled voice becos there aint no roses hereabouts and besides its late for em  it must be mr cutts the clever new keeper  he put his ead over the fence and bid im good evening and said wot a fine night for a stroll it was and asked im whether e was waiting for frederick scotts aunt  mr cutts didnt answer im a word e was pretty near bursting with passion  he got up and shook is fist in bob prettys face and then e went off stamping down the road as if e was going mad  and for a time bob pretty seemed to ave all the luck on is side keeper lewis got rheumatic fever which e put down to sitting about night arter night in damp places watching for bob and while e was in the thick of it with the doctor going every day mr cutts fell in getting over a fence and broke is leg  then all the work fell on keeper smith and to ear im talk youd think that rheumatic fever and broken legs was better than anything else in the world  he asked the squire for elp but the squire wouldnt give it to im and he kept telling im wot a feather in is cap it would be if e did wot the other two couldnt do and caught bob pretty  it was all very well but as smith said wot e wanted was feathers in is piller instead of aving to snatch a bit o sleep in is chair or sitting down with his ead agin a tree  when i tell you that e fell asleep in this publicouse one night while the landlord was drawing a pint o beer he ad ordered youll know wot e suffered  o course all this suited bob pretty as well as could be and e was that goodtempered ed got a nice word for everybody and when bill chambers told im e was foolhardy e only laughed and said e knew wot e was about  but the very next night e had reason to remember bill chamberss words he was walking along farmer halls fieldthe one next to the squires plantationand so far from being nervous e was actually awhistling hed got a sack over is shoulder loaded as full as it could be and e ad just stopped to light is pipe when three men burst out o the plantation and ran toward im as ard as they could run  illustration three men burst out o the plantation  bob pretty just gave one look and then e dropped is pipe and set off like a hare  it was no good dropping the sack because smith the keeper ad recognised im and called im by name so e just put is teeth together and did the best he could and theres no doubt that if it adnt ha been for the sack e could ave got clear away  as it was e ran for pretty near a mile and they could ear im breathing like a pair o bellows but at last e saw that the game was up  he just managed to struggle as far as farmer pinnocks pond and then waving the sack round his ead e flung it into the middle of it and fell down gasping for breath  gotyouthis timebob pretty ses one o the men as they came up  wotmr cutts  ses bob with a start  thats me my man ses the keeper  whyi thoughtyou was  is that mr lewis  it cant be  thats me ses keeper lewis  we both got well suddenlike bob pretty when we eard you was out  you aint so sharp as you thought you was  bob pretty sat still getting is breath back and doing a bit o thinking at the same time  you give me a start he ses at last  i thought you was both in bed and knowing ow hard worked mr smith as been i just came round to elp im keep watch like  i promised to elp you mr cutts if you remember  wot was that you threw in the pond just now ses mr cutts  a sack ses bob pretty a sack i found in farmer halls field  it felt to me as though it might ave birds in it so i picked it up and i was just on my way to your ouse with it mr cutts when you started arter me  ah ses the keeper and wot did you run for  bob pretty tried to laugh  becos i thought it was the poachers arter me he ses  it seems ridikilous dont it  yes it does ses lewis  i thought youd know me a mile off ses mr cutts  i should ha thought the smell o roses would ha told you i was near  bob pretty scratched is ead and looked at im out of the corner of is eye but he adnt got any answer  then e sat biting his fingernails and thinking while the keepers stood argyfying as to who should take is clothes off and go into the pond arter the pheasants  it was a very cold night and the pond was pretty deep in places and none of em seemed anxious  make im go in for it ses lewis looking at bob e chucked it in  ony becos i thought you was poachers ses bob  im sorry to ave caused so much trouble  well you go in and get it out ses lewis who pretty well guessed whod ave to do it if bob didnt  itll look better for you too  ive got my defence all right ses bob pretty  i aint set a foot on the squires preserves and i found this sack a undred yards away from it  dont waste more time ses mr cutts to lewis  off with your clothes and in with you  anybodyd think you was afraid of a little cold water  whereabouts did e pitch it in  ses lewis  bob pretty pointed with is finger exactly where e thought it was but they wouldnt listen to im and then lewis arter twice saying wot a bad cold hed got took is coat off very slow and careful  illustration bob pretty pointed with is finger exactly where e thought it was  i wouldnt mind going in to oblige you ses bob pretty but the pond is so full o them cold slimy efts i dont fancy them crawling up agin me and besides that theres such a lot o deep holes in it  and wotever you do dont put your ead under you know ow foul that water is  keeper lewis pretended not to listen to im  he took off is clothes very slowly and then e put one foot in and stood shivering although smith who felt the water with his and said it was quite warm  then lewis put the other foot in and began to walk about careful arfway up to is knees  i cant find it he ses with is teeth chattering  you avent looked ses mr cutts walk about more you cant expect to find it all at once  try the middle  lewis tried the middle and e stood there up to is neck feeling about with his foot and saying things out loud about bob pretty and other things under is breath about mr cutts  well im going off ome ses bob pretty getting up  im too tenderarted to stop and see a man drownded  you stay ere ses mr cutts catching old of him  wot for ses bob youve got no right to keep me ere  catch old of im joe ses mr cutts quicklike  smith caught old of his other arm and lewis left off trying to find the sack to watch the struggle  bob pretty fought ard and once or twice e nearly tumbled mr cutts into the pond but at last e gave in and lay down panting and talking about is loryer  smith eld him down on the ground while mr cutts kept pointing out places with is finger for lewis to walk to  the last place e pointed to wanted a much taller man but it wasnt found out till too late and the fuss keeper lewis made when e could speak agin was terrible  youd better come out ses mr cutts you aint doing no good  we know where they are and well watch the pond till daylightthat is unless smith ud like to ave a try  its pretty near daylight now i think ses smith  lewis came out and ran up and down to dry imself and finished off on is pocketandkerchief and then with is teeth chattering e began to dress imself  he got is shirt on and then e stood turning over is clothes as if e was looking for something  never mind about your stud now ses mr cutts hurry up and dress  stud ses lewis very snappish  im looking for my trowsis  your trowsis ses smith elping im look  i put all my clothes together ses lewis amost shouting  where are they  im arf perished with cold  where are they  he ad em on this evening ses bob pretty cos i remember noticing em  they must be somewhere about ses mr cutts why dont you use your eyes  he walked up and down peering about and as for lewis he was opping round arf crazy  i wonder ses bob pretty in a thoughtful voice to smithi wonder whether you or mr cutts kicked em in the pond while you was struggling with me  come to think of it i seem to remember earing a splash  hes done it mr cutts ses smith never mind itll go all the arder with im  but i do mind ses lewis shouting  ill be even with you for this bob pretty  ill make you feel it  you wait till ive done with you youll get a month extra for this you see if you dont  dont you mind about me ses bob you run off ome and cover up them legs of yours  i found that sack so my conscience is clear  lewis put on is coat and waistcoat and set off and mr cutts and smith arter feeling about for a dry place set theirselves down and began to smoke  look ere ses bob pretty im not going to sit ere all night to please you im going off ome  if you want me youll know where to find me  you stay where you are ses mr cutts  we aint going to let you out of our sight  very well then you take me ome ses bob  im not going to catch my death o cold sitting ere  im not used to being out of a night like you are  i was brought up respectable  i dare say ses mr cutts  take you ome and then ave one o your mates come and get the sack while were away  then bob pretty lost is temper and the things e said about mr cutts wasnt fit for smith to ear  he threw imself down at last full length on the ground and sulked till the day broke  keeper lewis was there amost as soon as it was light with some long hayrakes hed borrowed and i should think that pretty near arf the folks in claybury ad turned up to see the fun  mrs pretty was crying and wringing er ands but most folks seemed to be rather pleased that bob ad been caught at last  in next to no time arfadozen rakes was at work and the things they brought out o that pond you wouldnt believe  the edge of it was all littered with rusty tin pails and saucepans and suchlike and byandby lewis found the things hed ad to go ome without a few hours afore but they didnt seem to find that sack and bob pretty wot was talking to is wife began to look opeful  but just then the squire came riding up with two friends as was staying with im and he offered a reward of five shillings to the man wot found it  three or four of em waded in up to their middle then and raked their ardest and at last henery walker give a cheer and brought it to the side all heavy with water  thats the sack i found sir ses bob starting up  it wasnt on your land at all but on the field next to it  im an honest ardworking man and ive never been in trouble afore  ask anybody ere and theyll tell you the same  squire rockett took no notice of im  is that the sack  he asks turning to mr cutts  thats the one sir ses mr cutts  id swear to it anywhere  youd swear a mans life away ses bob  ow can you swear to it when it was dark  mr cutts didnt answer im  he went down on is knees and cut the string that tied up the mouth o the sack and then e started back as if ed been shot and is eyes amost started out of is ead  wots the matter ses the squire  mr cutts couldnt speak he could only stutter and point at the sack with is finger and henery walker as was getting curious lifted up the other end of it and out rolled a score of as fine cabbages as you could wish to see  i never see people so astonished afore in all my born days and as for bob pretty e stood staring at them cabbages as if e couldnt believe is eyesight  and thats wot ive been kept ere all night for he ses at last shaking his ead  thats wot comes o trying to do a kindness to keepers and elping of em in their difficult work  praps that aint the sack arter all mr cutts  i could ha sworn they was pheasants in the one i found but i may be mistook never aving ad one in my ands afore  or praps somebody was trying to ave a game with you mr cutts and deceived me instead  the keepers ony stared at im  you ought to be more careful ses bob  very likely while you was taking all that trouble over me and keeper lewis was catching is death o cold the poachers was up at the plantation taking all they wanted and besides it aint right for squire rockett to ave to pay henery walker five shillings for finding a lot of old cabbages  i shouldnt like it myself  illustration you ought to be more careful ses bob  he looked out of the corner of is eye at the squire as was pretending not to notice henery walker touching is cap to him and then e turns to is wife and he ses  come along old gal e ses  i want my breakfast bad and arter that i shall ave to lose a honest days work in bed
