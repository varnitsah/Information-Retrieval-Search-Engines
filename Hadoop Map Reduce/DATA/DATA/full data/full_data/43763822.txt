43763822	questionable shapes  by  w d howells  author of literary friends and acquaintance literature and life the kentons their silver wedding journey etc etc  published may 1903        contents  his apparition  the angel of the lord  though one rose from the dead     illustrations  mrs alderling came out with a book in her hand  im afraid im responsible for that  why there isnt any punishment severe enough for a crime like that  he broke into a sobbing that seemed to wrench and tear                                             his apparition     i   the incident was of a dignity which the supernatural has by no means always had and which has been more than ever lacking in it since the manifestations of professional spiritualism began to vulgarize it hewson appreciated this as soon as he realized that he had been confronted with an apparition he had been very little agitated at the moment and it was not till later when the conflict between sense and reason concerning the fact itself arose that he was aware of any perturbation even then amidst the tumult of his whirling emotions he had a sort of central calm in which he noted the particulars of the occurrence with distinctness and precision he had always supposed that if anything of the sort happened to him he would be greatly frightened but he had not been at all frightened so far as he could make out his hair had not risen or his cheek felt a chill his heart had not lost or gained a beat in its pulsation and his prime conclusion was that if the mysteries had chosen him an agent in approaching the material world they had not made a mistake this becomes grotesque in being put into words but the words do not misrepresent except by their inevitable excess the mind in which hewson rose and flung open his shutters to let in the dawn upon the scene of the apparition which he now perceived must have been as it were selflighted the robins were yelling from the trees and the sparrows bickering under them catbirds were calling from the thickets of syringa and in the nearest woods a hermitthrush was ringing its crystal bells the clear day was penetrating the east with the subtle light which precedes the sun and a summer sweetness rose cool from the garden below gray with dew  in the solitude of the hour there was an intimation of privity to the event which had taken place an implication of the unity of the natural and the supernatural strangely different from that robust gayety of the plain day which later seemed to disown the affair and leave the burden of proof altogether to the human witness by this time hewson had already set about to putting it in such phrases as should carry conviction to the hearer and yet should convey to him no suspicion of the pride which hewson felt in the incident as a sort of tribute to himself he dramatized the scene at breakfast when he should describe it in plain matteroffact terms and hold every one spellbound as he or she leaned forward over the table to listen while he related the fact with studied unconcern for his own part in it but with a serious regard for the integrity of the fact itself which he had no wish to exaggerate as to its immediate meaning or remoter implications it did not yet occur to him that it had none they were simply to be matters of future observation in a second ordeal for the first emotion which the incident imparted was the feeling that it would happen again and in this return would interpret itself hewson was so strongly persuaded of something of the kind that after standing for an indefinite period at the window in his pajamas he got hardily back into bed and waited for the repetition he was agreeably aware of waiting without a tremor and rather eagerly than otherwise then he began to feel drowsy and this at first flattered him as a proof of his strange courage in circumstances which would have rendered sleep impossible to most men but in another moment he started from it if he slept every one would say he had dreamt the whole thing and he could never himself be quite sure that he had not  he got up and began to dress thinking all the time in a dim way how very long it would be till breakfast and wondering what he should do till then with his appetite and his apparition it was now only a little after four oclock of the june morning and nobody would be down till after eight most people at that very movable feast which st john had in the english fashion did not show themselves before nine it was impossible to get a book and read for five hours he would be dropping with hunger if he walked so long yet he must not sleep and he must do something to keep from sleeping he remembered a little interloping hotel which had lately forced its way into precincts sacred to cottage life and had impudently called itself the st johnswort inn after st johns place by a name which he prided himself on having poetically invented from his own and that of a prevalent wild flower upon the chance of getting an early cup of coffee at this hotel hewson finished dressing and crept down stairs to let himself out of the house  he not only found the door locked as he had expected but the key taken out and after some misgiving he decided to lift one of the long library windows from which he could get into the garden closing the window after him and so make his escape no one was stirring outside the house any more than within he knocked down a trellis by which a clematis was trying to climb over the window he emerged from and found his way out of the grounds without alarming any one he was not so successful at the hotel where a lank boy sweeping the long piazzas recognized one of the st johnswort guests in the figure approaching the steps and apparently had his worst fears roused for hewsons sanity when hewson called to him and wondered if he could get a cup of coffee at that hour he openly owned it was an unnatural hour and he had a fine inward sense that it was supernatural the boy dropped his broom without a word and vanished through the office door reappearing after a blank interval to pick up his broom and say i guess so as he began sweeping again it was well for one reason that he did not state his belief too confidently hewson thought but after another interval of unknown length a rude sad girl came to tell him his coffee was waiting for him he followed her back into the still dishevelled dining room and sat down at a long table to a cup of lukewarm drink that in color and quality recalled terrible mornings of atlantic travel when he haplessly rose and descended to the diningsaloon of the steamer and had a marine version of british coffee brought him by an alien tablesteward  he remembered the pockmarked nose of one alien steward and how he had questioned whether he should give the fellow sixpence or a shilling seeing that apart from this tribute he should have to fee his own steward for the voyage at the same time his fancy played with the question whether that uncouth melancholy waitress had found a moment to wash her face before hurrying to fetch his coffee he amused himself by contrasting her sloven dejection with the brisk neatness of the service at st johnswort but through all he never lost the awe the sense of responsibility which he bore to the vision vouchsafed him doubtless for some reason and to some end that it behooved him to divine  he found a yesterdays paper in the office of the hotel and read it till he began to drowse over it when he pulled himself up with a sharp jerk he discovered that it was now six oclock and he thought if he could walk about for an hour he might return to st johnswort and worry through the remaining hour till breakfast somehow he was still framing in his thoughts some sort of statement concerning the apparition which he should make when the largest number of guests had got together at the table with a fine question whether he should take them between the cantaloupe and the broiled chicken or wait till they had come to the corn griddlecakes which st johns cook served of a filigree perfection in homage to the good old american breakfast ideal there would be more women if he waited and he should need the sympathy and countenance of women his story would be wanting in something of its supreme effect without the electrical response of their keener nerves     ii   when hewson came up to the cottage he was sensible of a certain agitation in the air which was intensified to him by the sight of st john in his bare bald head and the négligé of a flannel housecoat inspecting with the gardener and one of the grooms the fallen trellis under the library window which from time to time they looked up at as they talked hewson made haste to join them through the garden gate and to say shamefacedly enough oh im afraid im responsible for that and he told how he must have thrown down the trellis in getting out of the window  oh said st john while the two men walked away with dissatisfied grins at being foiled of their sensation we thought it was burglars im so glad it was only you but in spite of his profession st john did not give hewson any very lively proof of his enjoyment deuced uncomfortable to have had ones guests murdered in their beds dont say anything about it please hewson the women would all fly the premises if thered been even a suspicion of burglars  oh no i wont hewson willingly assented but he perceived a disappointment in st johns tone and manner and he suspected him however unjustly of having meant to give himself importance with his guests by the rumor of a burglary in the house  he was a man quite capable of that hewson believed and failing it capable of pretending that he wanted the matter hushed up in the interest of others  in any case he saw that it was not to st john primarily or secondarily to st johns guests that he could celebrate the fact of his apparition in the presence of st johns potential vulgarity he keenly felt his own and he recoiled from what he had imagined doing he even realized that he would have been working st john an injury by betraying his house to his guests as the scene of a supernatural incident  nobody believes in ghosts but there is not one in a thousand of us who would not be uncomfortable in a haunted house or a house so reputed if hewson told what he had seen he would not only scatter st johns houseparty to the four winds but he would cast such a blight upon st johnswort that it would never sell for a tenth of its cost     iii   from that instant hewson renounced his purpose and he remained true to this renunciation in spite of the behavior of st john which might well have tempted him to a revenge in kind no one seemed to have slept late that morning several of the ladies complained that they had not slept a wink the whole night and two or three of the men owned to having waked early and not been able to hit it off again in a morning nap though it appeared that they were adepts in that sort of thing the hour of their vigils corresponded so nearly with that of hewsons apparition that he wondered if a mystical influence from it had not penetrated the whole house the adventitious facts were of such a nature that he controlled with the greater difficulty the wish to explode upon an audience so aptly prepared for it the prodigious incident which he was keeping in reserve but he did not yield even when st john carefully led up to the point through the sensation of his guests by recounting the evidences of the supposed visit of a burglar and then made his effect by suddenly turning upon hewson and saying with his broad guffaw and here you have the burglar in person he has owned his crime to me and ive let him off the penalty on condition that he tells you all about it the humor was not too rank for the horsey people whom st john had mainly about him but some of the women said poor mr hewson when the host failing hewsons confession went on to betray that he had risen at that unearthly hour to go down to the st johnswort inn for a cup of its famous coffee the coffee turned out to be the greatest kind of joke one of the men asked hewson if he could say on his honor that it was really any better than st johns coffee there before them and another professed to be in a secret more recondite than had yet been divined it was that long grim girl who served it she had lured hewson from his rest at five oclock in the morning and this humorist proposed a welsh rarebit some night at the inn where they could all see for themselves why hewson broke out of the house and smashed a trellis before sunrise  hewson sat silent not even attempting a defensive sally in fact it was only his surface mind which was employed with what was going on as before his deeper thought was again absorbed with his great experience he could not if his conscience had otherwise suffered him have spoken of it in that company and the laughter died away from his silence as if it had been his offence he was not offended but he was ashamed and not ashamed so much for st john as for himself that he could have ever imagined acquiring merit in such company by exploiting an experience which should have been sacred to him how could he have been so shabby he was justly punished in the humiliating contrast between being the butt of these poor wits and the hero of an incident which whatever its real quality was had an august character of mystery he had recognized this from the first instant he had perceived that the occurrence was for him and for him alone until he had reasoned some probable meaning into it or from it and yet he had been willing he saw it he owned it to win the applause of that crowd as a man who had just seen a ghost  he thought of them as that crowd but after all they were goodnatured people and when they fancied that he was somehow vexed with the turn the talk had taken they began to speak of other things st john himself led the way and when he got hewson alone after breakfast he made him a sort of amend i didnt mean to annoy you old fellow he said with my story about the burglary  oh thats all right hewson brisked up in response as he took the cigar st john offered him im afraid i must have seemed rather stupid i had got to thinking about something else and i couldnt pull myself away from it i wasnt annoyed at all  whether st john thought this sufficient gratitude for his reparation did not appear as hewson did not offer to break the silence in which they went on smoking his host made a pretext toward the end of their cigars after bearing the burden of the conversation apparently as long as he could of being reminded of something by the group of women descending into the garden from the terraced walk beyond it and then slowly with little pauses trailing their summer draperies among the flowerbeds and bushes toward the house  oh bytheway he said i should like to introduce you to miss hernshaw she came last night with mrs rock that tall girl there lagging behind a little shes an original  i noticed her at breakfast hewson answered now first aware of having been struck with the strange beauty and strange behavior of the slim girl who drooped in her chair with her little head fallen forward and played with her bread ignoring her food otherwise while she listened with a bored air to the talk which made hewson its prey she had an effect of being both shy and indifferent in this retrospect and when st john put up the window and led the way out to the women in the garden and presented hewson she had still this effect she did not smile or speak in acknowledgement of hewsons bow she merely looked at him with a sort of swift intensity and then when one of the women said we were coming to view the scene of your burglarious exploit mr hewson was that the very window the girl looked impatiently away  the very window hewson owned you wouldnt know it st john has had the trellis put up and the spot fresh turfed and he detached the interlocutory widow in the direction of their bachelor host as she perhaps intended he should and dropped back to the side of miss hernshaw  she was almost spiritually slender in common with all of us he had heard that shape of girl called willowy but he made up his mind that sweetbriery would be the word for miss hernshaw in whose face a virginal youth suggested the tender innocence and surprise of the flower while the droop of her figure at once delicate and selfreliant arrested the fancy with a sense of the pendulous thorny spray she looked not above sixteen in age but as she was obviously out in the society sense of the word this must have been a moral effect and hewson was casting about in his mind for some appropriate form of thought and language to make talk in when she abruptly addressed him  i dont see she said with her face still away why people make fun of those poor girls who have to work in that sort of public way  hewson silently picked his steps back through the intervening events to the drolling at breakfast and with some misgiving took his stand in the declaration you mean the waitress at the inn  yes cried the girl with a gentle indignation which was so dear to the young man that he would have given anything to believe that it veiled a measure of sympathy for himself as well as for the waitress we went in there last night when we arrived for some pinsmrs rock had had her dress stepped on getting out of the carand that girl brought them i never saw such a sad face and she was very nice she had no more manners than a cow  miss hernshaw added the last sentence as if it followed and in his poor masculine pride of sequence hewson wanted to ask if that were why she was so nice but he obeyed a better instinct in saying yes theres a whole tragedy in it i wonder if its potential or actual he somehow felt safe in being so metaphysical  does it make any difference miss hernshaw demanded whirling her face round and fixing him with eyes of beautiful fierceness tragedy is tragedy whether you have lived it or not isnt it and sometimes its all the more tragical if you have it still to live youve got it before you i dont see how any one can look at that girls face and laugh at her i should never forgive any one who did  then im glad i didnt do any of the laughing said hewson willing to relieve himself from the strain of this high mood and yet anxious not to fall too far below it perhaps i should though if i hadnt been the victim of it in some degree  it was the vulgarest thing i ever heard said the girl  hewson looked at her but she had averted her face again he had a longing to tell her of his apparition which quelled every other interest in him and as it were blurred his whole consciousness she would understand with her childlike truth and with her unconventionality she would not find it strange that he should speak to her of such a thing for no apparent reason or no immediate cause he walked silent at her side revolving his longing in his thought and hating the circumstance which forbade him to speak at once he did not know how long he was lost in this when he was suddenly recalled to fearful question of the fact by her saying with another flash of her face toward him you have lost sleep mr hewson and she whipped forward and joined the other women who were following the lead of st john and the widow  mrs rock to whom hewson had been presented at the same time as to miss hernshaw looked vaguely back at him over her shoulder but made no attempt to include him in her group and he thought for no reason that she was kept from doing so on account of miss hernshaw he thought he could be no more mistaken in this than in the resentment of miss hernshaw which he was aware of meriting however unintentionally later after lunch he made sure of this fact when mrs rock got him into a corner and cozily began i always feel like explaining rosalie a little and then her vague friendly eye wandered toward miss hernshaw across the room and stopped as if waiting for the girl to look away but miss hernshaw did not look away and that afternoon hewsons week being up he left st johnswort before dinner     iv   the time came before the following winter when hewson was tempted beyond his strength and told the story of his apparition he told it more than once and kept himself with increasing difficulty from lying about it he always wished to add something to amplify the fact to heighten the mystery of the circumstances to divine the occult significance of the incident in itself the incident when stated was rather bare and insufficient but he held himself rigidly to the actual details and he felt that in this at least he was offering the powers which had vouchsafed him the experience a species of atonement for breaking faith with them it seemed like breaking faith with miss hernshaw too though this impression would have been harder to reason than the other both impressions began to wear off after the first tellings of the story the wound that hewson gave his sensibility in the very first cicatrized before the second and at the fourth or fifth it had quite calloused over so that he did not mind anything so much as what always seemed to him the inadequate effect of his experience with his hearers some listened carelessly some nervously some incredulously as if he were trying to put up a job on them some compassionately as if he were not quite right and ought to be looked after there was a consensus of opinion among those who offered any sort of comment that he ought to give it to the psychical research and at the bottom of hewsons heart there was a dread that the spiritualists would somehow get hold of him this remained to stay him when the shame of breaking faith with miss hernshaw and with mystery no longer restrained him from exploiting the fact he was aware of lying in wait for opportunities of telling it and he swore himself to tell it only upon direct provocation or when the occasion seemed imperatively to demand it he commonly brought it out to match some experience of another but he could never deny a friendly appeal when he sat with some good fellows over their fiveoclock cocktails at the club and one of them would say in behalf of a newcomer hewson tell wilkins that odd thing that happened to you up country in the summer in complying he tried to save his selfrespect by affecting a contemptuous indifference in the matter and beginning reluctantly and poohpoohingly he had pangs afterwards as he walked home to dress for dinner but his selfreproach was less afflicting as time passed his suffering from it was never so great as from the slight passed upon his apparition when wilkins or what other it might be would meet the suggestion that he should tell him about it with the hurried interposition yes i have heard that good story this would make hewson think that he was beginning to tell his story too often and that perhaps the friend who suggested his doing so was playing upon his forgetfulness he wondered if he were really something of a bore with it and whether men were shying off from him at the club on account of it he fancied that might be the reason why the circle at the fiveoclock cocktails gradually diminished as the winter passed he continued to join it till the chance offered of squarely refusing to tell wilkins or whoever about the odd thing that had happened to him up country in the summer then he felt that he had in a manner retrieved himself and could retire from the fiveoclock cocktails with honor  that it was a veridical phantom which had appeared to him he did not in his inmost at all doubt though in his superficial consciousness he questioned it not indeed so disrespectfully as he poohpoohed it to others but still questioned it this he thought somehow his due as a man of intelligence who ought not to suffer himself to fall into superstition even upon evidence granted to few superficially however as well as interiorly he was aware of always expecting its repetition and now six months after the occurrence this expectation was as vivid with him as it was the first moment after the vision had vanished while his tongue was yet in act to stay it with speech he would not have been surprised at any time in walking into his room to find it there or waking at night to confront it in the electric flash which he kindled by a touch of the button at his bedside rather he was surprised that nothing of the sort happened to confirm him in his belief that he had been all but in touch with the other life or to give him some hint the slightest the dimmest why this vision had been shown him and then instantly broken and withdrawn in that inmost of his where he recognized its validity he could not deny that it had a meaning and that it had been sent him for some good reason special to himself though at the times when he had prefaced his story of it with terms of slighting scepticism he had professed neither to know nor to care why the thing had happened he always said that he had never been particularly interested in the supernatural and then was ashamed of a lie that was false to universal human experience but he could truthfully add that he had never in his life felt less like seeing a ghost than that morning it was not full day but it was perfectly light and there the thing was as palpable to vision as any of the men that moment confronting him with cocktails in their hands asked if he did not think he had dreamed it he answered scornfully that he did not think he knew he had not dreamed it he did not value the experience it was and had always been perfectly meaningless but he would stake his life upon its reality asked if it had not perhaps been the final office of a nightcap he disdained to answer at all though he did not openly object to the laugh which the suggestion raised  secretly within his inmost hewson felt justly punished by the laughter he had been unworthy of his apparition in lightly exposing it to such a chance he had fallen below the dignity of his experience he might never hope to fathom its meaning while he lived but he grieved for the wrong he had done it as if at the instant of the apparition he had offered that majestic silent figure some grotesque indignity thrown a pillow at it or hailed it in tones of mocking offence he was profoundly and exquisitely ashamed even before he ceased to tell the story for his listeners idle amusement when he stopped doing so and snubbed solicitation with the curt answer that everybody had heard that story he was retrospectively ashamed and mixed with the expectation of seeing the vision again was the formless wish to offer it some sort of reparation of apology  he longed to prove himself not wholly unworthy of the advance that had been made him from the other world upon grounds which he had done his worst to prove untenable he could not imagine what the grounds were though he had to admit their probable existence such an event might have no obvious or present significance but it had not happened for nothing it could not have happened for nothing hewson might not have been in what he thought any stressful need of ghostly comfort or reassurance in matters of faith he was not inordinately agnostic or in the way of becoming so he was simply an average skeptical american who denied no more than he affirmed and who really concerned himself so little about his soul though he tried to keep his conscience decently clean that he had not lately asked whether other people had such a thing or not he had not lost friends and he was so much alone in this world that it seemed improbable the fate of any uncle or cousin in the absence of more immediate kindred should be mystically forecast to him he was perfectly well at the time of the apparition and it could not have been the figment of a disordered digestion as the lusty hunger which willingly appeased itself with the coffee of the st johnswort inn sufficiently testified yet in spite of all this an occurrence so out of the course of events must have had some message for him and it must have been his fault that he could not divine it a sense of culpability grew upon him with the sense of his ignominy in cheapening it by making it subservient to what he knew was in the last analysis a wretched vanity at least he could refuse himself that miserable gratification hereafter and he got back some measure of selfrespect in forbidding himself the pleasure he might have taken in being noted for a strange experience he could never be got to speak of     v   the implication of any such study as this is that the subject of it is continuously if not exclusively occupied with the matter which is supposed to make him interesting but of course it was not so with hewson who perhaps did not think of his apparition once in a fortnight or oftener say than he thought of the odd girl with whom for no reason except contemporaneity in his acquaintance he associated with it if he never thought of the apparition without subconsciously expecting its return he equally expected when he thought of miss hernshaw that the chances of society would bring them together again and it was with no more surprise than if the vision had intimated its second approach that he one night found her name in the minute envelope which the footman presented him at a house where he was going to dine and realized that he was appointed to take her out it was a house where he rather liked to go for in that new york of his where so few houses had any distinctive character this one had a temperament of its own in so far that you might expect to meet people of temperament there if anywhere they were indeed held in a social solution where many other people of no temperament at all floated largely and loosely about but they were there all the same and it was worth coming on the chance of meeting them though the indiscriminate hospitality of the hostess might let the evening pass without promoting the chance now however she had unwittingly put into hewsons keeping for two hours at least the very temperament that had kept his fancy for the last halfyear and more he fairly laughed at sight of the name on the little card and hurried into the drawingroom where the first thing after greeting his hostess he caught the wandering look and vague smile of mrs rock the look and the smile became personal to him and she welcomed him with a curious resumption of the confidential terms in which they had seemed to part that afternoon at st johnswort he thought that she was going to begin talking to him where she had left off about rosalie as she had called her and he was disappointed in the commonplaces that actually ensued at the end of these however she did say miss hernshaw is here with me have you seen her  oh yes hewson returned for he had caught sight of the girl in a distant group on his way up to mrs rock but in view of the affluent opportunity before him had richly forborne trying even to make her bow to him though he believed she had seen him i am to have the happiness of going out with her  oh indeed said mrs rock that is nice and then the people began assorting themselves and the man who was appointed to take mrs rock out came and bowed hewson away  he hastened to that corner of the room where miss hernshaw was waiting and if he had been suddenly confronted with his apparition he could not have experienced a deeper and stranger satisfaction than he felt as the girl lifted up her innocent fierce face upon him  it brought back that whole day at st johnswort of which she with his vision formed the supreme interest and equally the mystery and it went warmly to his heart to have her peremptorily abolish all banalities by saying i was wondering if they were going to give me you as soon as you came in  she put her slim hand on his arm as she spoke and he thought she must have felt him quiver at her touch then you were not afraid they were going to give you me he bantered  no she said i wanted to talk with you i wanted you to tell me what mrs rock said about me  just now she said you were here  no i mean that day at st johnswort  hewson laughed out for pleasure in her frankness and then he felt a gathering up of his coatsleeve under her nervous fingers as if such a thing being imaginable she were going unwittingly to pinch him for his teasing she said she wanted to explain you a little  and then what  and then nothing she seemed to catch your eye and she stopped  the fingers relaxed their hold upon that gathering up of his coatsleeve i wont be explained and i have told her so if i choose to act myself and show out my real thoughts and feelings how is it any worse than if i acted somebody else  i should think it was very much better said hewson inwardly warned to keep his face straight     vi   they had time for no more talk between the drawingroom and the dinner table and when miss hernshaws chair had been pushed in behind her and she sat down she turned instantly to the man on her right and began speaking to him and left hewson to make conversation with any one he liked or could  he did not get on very well not because there were not enough amusing people beside him and over against him but because he was all the time trying to eavesdrop what was saying between miss hernshaw and the man on her right it seemed to be absolute trivialities they were talking so far as hewson made out they got no deeper than the new play which was then commanding the public favor apparently for the reason that it was altogether surface with no measure upwards or downwards upon this surface the comment of the man on miss hernshaws right wandered indefatigably  hewson could not imagine of her sincerity a deliberate purpose of letting the poor fellow show all the shallowness that was in him and of amusing itself with his satisfaction in turning his empty mind inside out for her inspection she seemed if not genuinely interested to be paying him an unaffected attention but when the lady across the table addressed a word to him miss hernshaw as if she had been watching for some such chance instantly turned to hewson  what do you think of ghosts she asked with imperative suddenness  ghosts he echoed  or perhaps you didnt go she suggested and he perceived that she meant ibsens tragedy but he did not answer at once he had had a shock and for a timeless space he had been back in his room at st johnswort with that weird figure seated at his table it seemed to vanish again when he gave a second glance as it had vanished before and he drew a long sigh and looked a little haggardly at miss hernshaw ah i see you did wasnt it tremendous i think the girl who did regina was simply awful dont you  i dont know said hewson still so trammeled in his own involuntary associations with the word as not fully to realize the strangeness of discussing ghosts with a young lady but he pulled himself together and nimbly making his reflection that the latitude of the stage gave room for the meeting of cultivated intelligences in regions otherwise tabooed if they were of opposite sexes he responded in kind i think that the greatest miracle of the playand to me it was altogether miraculous  oh im glad to hear you say that cried the girl it was the greatest experience of my life i cant bear to have people undervalue it i want to hit them but go on  hewson went on as gravely as he could in view of her potential violence he pictured miss hernshaw beating down the inadequate witnesses of ghosts with her fan which lay in her lap with her cobwebby handkerchief drawn through its ring and her long limp gloves looking curiously like her pretty young arms in their slenderness i was merely going to say that the most prodigious effect of the play was among the actorsi wont venture on the spectators  no dont it isnt speakable  its astonishing the effect a play of ibsens has with the actors they cant play false it turns the merest theatrical sticks into men and women and it does it through the perfect honesty of the dramatist he deals so squarely with himself that they have to deal squarely with themselves they have to be and not just seem  miss hernshaw sighed deeply im glad you think that she said and hewson felt very glad too that he thought that  why he asked  why because that is what i always want to do and its what i always shall do i dont care what they say  but i dont know whether i understand exactly  deal squarely with everybody say what i really feel then they say what they really feel  there was an obscure resentment unworthily struggling at the bottom of hewsons heart for her long neglect of him in behalf of the man on her left yes he said if they are capable of really feeling anything  what do you mean everybody really feels  well then thinking anything  she drew herself up a little with an air of question i believe everybody really thinks too and its your duty to let them find out what theyre thinking by truly saying what you think  then she isnt dealing quite honestly with him said hewson with a malicious smile  the man at miss hernshaws left was still talking about the play and he was at that moment getting off a piece of pure parrotry about it to the lady across the table just what everybody had been saying about it from the first  no i should think she was not said the girl gravely she looked hurt as if she had been unfairly forced to the logic of her postulate and hewson was not altogether pleased with himself but at least he had had his revenge in making her realize the mans vacuity  he tried to get her back to talk about ghosts again but she answered with indifference and just then he was arrested by something a man was saying near the head of the table     vii   it was rather a large dinner but not so large that a striking phrase launched in a momentary lull could not fuse all the wandering attentions in a sole regard the man who spoke was the psychologist wanhope and he was saying with a melancholy that mocked itself a little in his smile i shouldnt be particular about seeing a ghost myself i have seen plenty of men who had seen men who had seen ghosts but i never yet saw a man who had seen a ghost if i had it would go a long way to persuade me of ghosts  hewson felt his heart thump in his throat there was a pause and it was as if all eyes but the eyes of the psychologist turned upon him these rested upon the ice which the servant had just then silently slipped under them hewson had no reason to think that any of the people present were acquainted with his experience but he thought it safest to take them upon the supposition that they had and after he had said to the psychologist will you allow me to present him to you he added im afraid every one else knows him too well already  you said his visàvis arching her eyebrows and others up and down the table looked round or over at hewson where he sat midway of it with miss hernshaw drooping beside him she alone seemed indifferent to his pretension she seemed even insensible of it as she broke off little corners of her ice with her fork  the psychologist fixed his eyes on him with scientific challenge as well as scientific interest do you mean that you have seen a ghost  yesghost genericallyprovisionally we always consider them ghosts dont we till they prove themselves something else i once saw an apparition  several people who were nearsighted or farplaced put on their eyeglasses to make out whether hewson were serious a lady who had a handsome forearm put up a lorgnette and inspected him through it she had the air of questioning his taste and the subtle aura of her censure penetrated to him though she preserved a face of rigid impassivity he returned her stare defiantly though he was aware of not reaching her through the lenses as effectively as she reached him most of those who prepared themselves to listen seemed to be putting him on trial and they apparently justified themselves in this from the crossquestioning method the psychologist necessarily took in his wish to clarify the situation  how long ago was it he asked coldly  last summer  was it after dark  very much after it was at daybreak  oh you were alone  quite  you made sure you were not dreaming  i made sure of that instantly i was not awakened by the apparition i was already fully awake  had your mind been running on anything of the kind  nothing could have been farther from it i was thinking what a very long while it would be till breakfast this was not true as to the order of the fact but hewson could not keep himself from saying it and it made a laugh and created a diversion in his favor  how long did it seem to last  the vision that was very curious the whole affair was quite achronic as i may say the figure was there and it was not there  it vanished suddenly  i cant say it vanished at all it ought still to be there have you ever returned to a place where you had always been wrong as to the points of the compass and found yourself right up to a certain moment as you approached and then without any apparent change found yourself perfectly wrong again the figure was not there and it was there and then it was not there  i think i see what you mean said the psychologist warily the evanescence was subjective  altogether but so was the apparescence  ah said wanhope you hadnt any headache  not the least  ah the psychologist desisted with the effect of letting the defence take the witness  a general dissatisfaction diffused itself and hewson felt it but he disdained to do anything to appease it he remained silent for that appreciable time which elapsed before his host said almost compassionately wont you tell us all about it mr hewson  the guests all but miss hernshaw seemed to return to their impartial frame with a leaning in hewsons favor such as the courtroom feels when the accused is about to testify in his own behalf the listeners cannot help wishing him well though they may have their own opinions of his guilt  why there isnt any allaboutit said hewson the whole thing has been stated as to the circumstances and conditions he could see the baffled greed in the eyes of those who were hungering for a morsel of the marvellous and he made it as meagre as he could he had now no temptation to exaggerate the simple fact and he hurried it out in the fewest possible words     viii   the general disappointment was evident in the moment of waiting which followed upon his almost contemptuous ending his audience some of them took their cue from his own ironical manner and joked others looked as if they had been trifled with the psychologist said curious he did not go back to his position that belief in ghosts should follow from seeing a man who had seen one he seemed rather annoyed by the encounter the talk took another turn and distributed itself again between contiguous persons for the brief time that elapsed before the women were to leave the men to their coffee and cigars  when their hostess rose hewson offered his arm to miss hernshaw she had not spoken to him since he had told the story of his apparition now she said in an undertone so impassioned that every vibration from her voice shook his heart if i were you i would never tell that story again and she pressed his arm with unconscious intensity while she looked away from him  you dont believe it happened he returned  it did  of course it happened why shouldnt i believe that but thats the very reason why i wouldnt have told it if it happened it was something sacredawful oh i dont see how you could bear to speak of it at a dinner when people were all torpid with  she stopped breathlessly with a break in her voice that sounded just short of a sob  well im sufficiently ashamed of doing it and not for the first time he said in sullen discontent with himself and ive been properly punished you cant think how sick it makes me to realize what a detestable sensation i was seeking  she did not heed what he was saying was it that morning at st johnswort when you got up so early and went for a cup of coffee at the inn  yes  i thought so i could follow every instant of it i could see just how it was if such a thing had happened to me i would have died before i spoke of it at such a time as this oh why do you suppose it happened to you the girl grieved  me of all men said hewson with a selfcontemptuous smile  i thought you were different she said absently then abruptly what are you standing here talking to me so long for you must go back all the men have gone back and hewson perceived that they had arrived in the drawingroom and were conspicuously parleying in the face of a dozen interested women witnesses  in the diningroom he took his way toward a vacant place at the table near his host who was saying behind his cigar to another old fellow i used to know her mother she was rather original too but nothing to this girl i dont envy mrs rock her job  i dont know what the pay of a chaperon is but i suppose hernshaw can make it worth her while if hes like the rest out there said the other old fellow i imagine hes somewhere in his millions  the host held up one of his fingers is that all i thought more mines  cattle ah mr hewson said the host turning to welcome him to the chair on his other side have a cigar that was a strong story you gave us it had a good fault though it was too short     ix   hewson had begun now to feel a keen persistent painful sympathy for the apparition itself as for some one whose confidence had been abused and this feeling was none the less but all the more poignant because it was he himself who was guilty towards it he pitied it in a sort as if it had been the victim of a wrong more shocking perhaps for the want of taste in it than for any real turpitude this was a quality of the event not without a strange consolation in arraying him on the side of the apparition it antagonized him with what he had done and enabled him to renounce and disown it  from the night of that dinner hewson did not again tell the story of his apparition though the opportunities to do so now sought him as constantly as he had formerly sought them they offered him a fresh temptation through the different perversions of the fact that had got commonly abroad but he resisted this temptation and let the perversions sometimes annoyingly sometimes amusingly but always more and more wildly wide of the reality take their course in his reticence he had the sense of atoning not only to the apparition but to miss hernshaw too  illustration im afraid im responsible for that  before he met her again miss hernshaw had been carried off to europe by mrs rock perhaps with the purpose of trying the veteran duplicities of that continent in breaking down the insurgent sincerity of her ward hewson heard that she was not to be gone a great while it was well into the winter when they started and he understood that they were merely going to rome for the end of the season and were then going to work northward and after june in london were coming home he did not fail to see her again before she left for any want of wishing but he did not happen to meet her at other houses and at the house of mrs rock if she had one he had not been asked to call or invited to any function in thinking the point over it occurred to hewson that this was so because he was not wanted there and not wanted by miss hernshaw herself for it had been in his brief experience of her that she let people know what she wanted and that with mrs rock whose character seemed to answer to her name but poorly she had ways of getting what she wanted if miss hernshaw had wished to meet him again he could not doubt that she would have asked him or at the least had him asked to come and see her and not have left it to the social fortutities to bring them together towards the end of the term which rumor had fixed to her stay abroad hewsons folly was embittered to him in a way that he had never expected in his deepest shame and darkest forboding but evil like good does not cease till it has fulfilled itself in every possible consequence it seeing even more active and persistent good seems to satisfy itself sometimes in the direct effect but evil winds sinuously in and out and reaches round and over and under its wretched author and strikes him in every tender and fatal place with an ingenuity in finding the places out that seems truly of hell hewson thought he had paid the principal of his debt in full through the hurt to his vanity in failing to gain any sort of consequence from his apparition but the interest of his debt had accumulated and the sorest pinch was in paying the interest his penalty took the form that was most of all distasteful to him the form of publicity in the sunday edition of a newspaper a young lady attached to the staff of this journal had got hold of his story and had made her reporters story of it which she imaginatively cast in the shape of an interview with hewson but worse than this and really beyond the vagary of the wildest nightmare she gave st johnswort as the scene of the apparition with all the circumstances of the supposed burglary while tastefully disguising hewsons identity in the figure of a wellknown societyman  when hewson read this story and it seemed to him that no means of bringing it to his notice at the club and on the street and by mail was left unemployed he had two thoughts one was of st john and one was of miss hernshaw in all his exploitations of his experience he had carefully he thought religiously concealed the scene except that one only time when miss hernshaw suddenly got it out of him by that demand of hers was it that morning at st johnswort when you got up so early and went for a cup of coffee at the inn he had confided so absolutely in her that his admission had not troubled him at the time and it had not troubled him since till now when he found the fact given this hideous publicity and knew that it could have become known only through her through her who had seemed to make herself the protectress of his apparition and to guard it with indignation even against his own slight  he could not tell himself what to think of her and in this disability he had at least the sad comfort of literally thinking nothing of her but he could not keep his thoughts away from st john it appeared to him that he thought and lived nothing else till his dread concreted itself in the letter which came from st john as soon as that fatal newspaper could reach him and his demand for an explanation could come back to hewson he wrote from st johnswort where he had already gone for the season and he assumed as no doubt he had a right to do that the whole thing was a fake and that if hewson was hesitating about denying it for fear of giving it further prominence or out of contempt for it he wished that he would not hesitate there were reasons which would suggest themselves to hewson why the thing if merely and entirely a fake should be very annoying and he thought that it would be best to make the denial immediate and imperative to this end he advised hewsons sending the newspaper people a lawyers letter with the ulterior trouble which this would intimate they would move in the matter with a quickened conscience  apparently st john was very much in earnest and hewson would eagerly have lied out of it he felt in sudden depravity from a just regard for st johns right to privacy in his own premises but no lying not the boldest not the most ingenious could now avail scores of people could witness that they had heard hewson tell the story at first hand at second hand hundreds could still more confidently affirm its truth but if he admitted the truth of the fact and denied merely that it had happened at st johnswort he would have miss hernshaw to deal with and what could he hope from truth so relentless as hers she was of a moral make so awful that if he ventured to deny it without appeal for her support which was impossible she was quite capable of denying his denial  he did the only thing he could he wrote to st john declaring that the newspaper story though utterly false in its pretensions to be an interview with him was true in its essentials the thing had really happened he had seen an apparition and he had seen it at st johnswort that morning when st john supposed his house to have been invaded by burglars he vainly turned over a thousand deprecatory expressions in his mind with which to soften the blow but he let his letter go without including one     x   a week of silence passed and then one night st john himself appeared at hewsons apartment hewson almost knew that it was his ring at the door and in the tremulous note of his voice asking the man if he were at home he recognized the great blubbery fellows most plaintive mood  well hewson he whimpered without staying for any form of greeting when they stood face to face this has been a terrible business for me you cant imagine how its broken me up in every direction  iim afraid i can st john hewson began but st john cut him off  oh no you cant look here he showed a handful of letters all from people who had promised to stay with me taking it back since that infernal interview of yours or from people who hadnt answered before saying they cant come of course they make all sorts of civil excuses i shouldnt know what to do with these people if any of them came there isnt a servant left on the place except the gardener who lives in his own house and the groom who sleeps in the stable for the last three days ive had to take my meals at that infernal inn where you got your coffee  is it so bad as that hewson gasped  yes it is its so bad that sometimes i cant realize it do you actually mean to tell me hewson that you saw a ghost in my house  i never said a ghost i said an apparition i dont know what it was it may have been an optical delusion i call it an apparition because thats the shortest way out you know im not a spiritualist  yes thats the devil of it said st john thats the very thing that makes people believe it is a ghost there isnt one of them that dont say to himself and the other fellows that if a cool clearheaded chap like you saw something queer it must have been a ghost and so they go on knocking my house down in price till i dont believe it would fetch fifteen hundred under the hammer tomorrow its simply ruin to me  ruin hewson echoed  yes ruin st john repeated before this thing came out i refused twentyfive thousand for the place because i knew i could get twentyeight thousand now i couldnt get twentyeight hundred couldnt you understand that the reputation of being haunted simply plays the devil with a piece of property yes yes i did understand that and for that very reason i was always careful  careful to tell people that you had seen a ghost in my house  no not to tell them where i had seen a ghost i never  how did it get out then  i hewson began and then he stood with his mouth open unable to close it for the articulation of the next word which he at last huskily whispered forth cant tell you  cant tell me wailed st john well i call that pretty rough  it is rough hewson admitted and heaven knows that i would make it smooth if i could i never onceexcept once onlymentioned your place in connection with the matter i was scrupulously careful not to do so for i did imagine something like what has happened i would do anythinganythingin reparation but i cant even tell you how the name of your place got out in the connection though certainly you have a right to ask and to know the circumstances werepeculiar the person was one that i wouldnt have dreamt was capable of repeating it it was as if i had said the words over to myself  well i cant understand all that said st john with rueful sulkiness from which he brisked up to ask as if by a sudden inspiration if it was only to one person why couldnt you deny it and throw the onus on the other fellow he looked up at hewson standing nerveless before him from where he lay mournfully wallowing in an easychair as if now for the first time there might be a gleam of hope for them both in some such notion  hewson slowly shook his head it wouldnt work the personisnt that kind of person  why but see here st john urged there must be something in the fellow that you can appeal to if you went and told him how it was playing the very deuce with me pecuniarily he would see the necessity of letting you deny it and taking the consequences if he was anything of a man at all  he isnt anything of a man at all said hewson in mechanical and melancholy parody  then in heavens name what is he demanded st john savagely  a woman oh st john fell back in his chair but he pulled himself up again with a sudden renewal of hope why see here if shes the right kind of woman shell enjoy denying the story and putting the people in the wrong that have circulated it  hewson shook his head in rejection of the general principle while as to the particular instance he could only say she isnt that kind shes the kind that would rather die herself and let everybody else die than be party to any sort of deception  she must be a queer woman st john bewailed himself looking at the point of his cigar and discovering to his surprise that it was out he did not attempt to light it of course i cant ask you who she is but why shouldnt i see her and try what i can do with her im the one thats the principal sufferer in this matter he added perhaps seeing refusal in hewsons troubled eye  becausefor one reasonshes in london  oh lord st john lamented  but if she were here in new york i couldnt allow it he continued it was in confidence between us  she doesnt seem to have thought so said st john with sarcasm which hewson could not resent  theres only one thing for me to do said hewson who had been thinking the point over and saw no other way out for him as a gentleman or even merely as a just man he was not rich and in the face of the mounting accumulations of other men he had grown comparatively poor without actually losing money since he had begun to lead the life which had long been his ideal after carefully ascertaining at the time in question that he had sufficient income from inherited means to live without his profession he had closed his lawoffice without shutting many clients out and had contributed himself to the formation of a leisure class which he conceived was regrettably lacking in our conditions he had taste he had reading he had a pretty knowledge of the world from travel he had observed manners and it seemed to him that he might not immodestly pretend to supply as far as one man went a wellrecognized want  hitherto he had been able to live up to his ideal with sufficient satisfaction and in proposing to himself never to marry but to grow old gradually and gracefully as a bachelor of adequate income he saw no difficulties in his way for the future until this affair of the apparition if now he incurred the chances of an open change in his way of livingthe end was simply a question of very little time he must not only declass he must depatriate himself for he would not have the means of living even much more economically than he now lived in new york if he did what a sense of honor of just responsibility urged him to do with regard to st john  he would have been glad of any interposition of providence that would have availed him against his obvious duty he would have liked to recall the words saying that there was only one thing for him to do but he could not recall them and he was forced to go on will you sell me your place he said to st john colorlessly  sell you my place what do you mean  simply that if you will i shall be glad to buy it at your own valuation  oh look here now hewson i cant let you do this st john began trying to feel a magnanimity which proved impossible to him what do you want with my place you couldnt get anybody to live there with you  i couldnt afford to live there in any case said hewson but i am entirely willing to risk the purchase  was it possible that hewson knew something of the neighborhood or its future which encouraged him to take the chances of the property appreciating in value this thought passed through st johns mind and he was not the man to let himself be overreached in a deal the place ought to be worth thirty thousand he said for a bluff  it was a relief for hewson to feel ashamed of st john instead of himself for a moment very well ill give you thirty thousand  st john examined himself for a responsive generosity the most he could say was youre doing this because of what id said  what does it matter i make you a bonafide offer i will give you thirty thousand dollars for st johnswort said hewson haughtily i ask you to sell me that place i cannot see that it will ever be any good to me but i can assure you that it would be a far worse burden for me to carry round the sense of having injured you however unwillinglygod knows i never meant you harmthan to shoulder the chance of your place remaining worthless on my hands  st john caught at the hope which the form of words suggested if anything can bring it up it will be the fact that you have bought it such a thing would give the lie to that ridiculous story as nothing else could every one will see that a house cant be very badly haunted if the man that the ghost appeared to is willing to buy it  perhaps said hewson sadly  no perhaps about it st john retorted all the more cheerfully because he would have been glad before this incident to take twenty thousand for his place its just on the borders of lenox and its bound to come up when this blows over he talked on for a time in an encouraging strain while hewson standing with his back against the mantel looked absently down upon him st john was inwardly struggling through all to say that hewson might have the property for twentyeight thousand but he could not possibly he made himself believe that he was letting it go a great bargain at thirty at any rate he ended by saying well its yoursif you really mean it  i mean it said hewson  st john floundered up out of his chair with seallike struggles do you want the furniture he panted  the furniture yes why not said hewson he did not seem to know what he was saying or to care  i will put that in for a mere nominal considerationthe rugs alone are worth the moneysay a thousand more  hewsons man came in with a note the messenger is waiting sir he said  hewson was aware of wondering that he had not heard any ring will you excuse me he said toward st john  by all means said st john  hewson opened the note and read it with an expression which can only be described as a radiant frown he sat down at his desk and wrote an answer to the note and gave it to his man who was still waiting then he said to st john what did you say the rugs were worth  a thousand  ill take them and what do you want for the rest of the furniture  clearly he had not understood that the furniture rugs and all had been offered to him for a thousand dollars but what was a man in st johns place to do as it was he was turning himself out of house and home for hewson and that was sacrifice enough he hesitated sighed deeply and then said well i will throw all that in for a couple of thousand more  all right said hewson i will give it have the papers made out and i will have the money ready at once  oh theres no hurry about that my dear fellow said st john handsomely     xi   hewsons note was from mrs rock asking him to breakfast with her at the walholland the next morning she said that they were just off the steamer which had got in late and they had started so suddenly from london that she had not had time to write and have her apartment opened she came to business in the last sentence where she said that miss hernshaw joined her in kind remembrances and wished her to say that he must not fail them or if he could not come to breakfast to let them know at what hour during the day he would be kind enough to call it was very important they should see him at the earliest possible moment  hewson instantly decided that this summons was related to the affair of his apparition without imagining how or why and when miss hernshaw met him and almost before she could say that mrs rock would be down in a moment began with it he made no feint of having come for anything else  illustration why there isnt any punishment severe enough for a crime like that  as he entered the door of mrs rocks parlor where the breakfast table was laid the girl came swiftly toward him with the air of having turned from watching for him at the window well what do you think of me she demanded as soon as she had got over mrs rocks excuses for having her receive him he had of course to repeat what do i think of you but he knew perfectly what she meant  she disdained to help him pretend that he did not know it was i who told that horrible woman about your experience at st johnswort i didnt dream that she was an interviewer but that doesnt excuse me and i am willing to take any punishment for myi dont know what to call itmischief  she was so intensely ready so magnificently prepared for the stake if that should be her sentence that hewson could not help laughing why there isnt any punishment severe enough for a crime like that he began but she would not allow him to trifle with the matter  oh i didnt think you would be so uncandid the instant i read that interview i made mrs rock get ready to come and we started the first steamer it seemed to me that i could not eat or sleep till i had seen you and told you what i had done and taken the consequences and now do you think it right to turn it off as a joke  i dont wish to make a joke of it said hewson gravely in compliance with her mood but i dont understand quite how you could have got the story over there in time for you  it was cabled to their london editionthats what it said in the paper and by this time they must have it in australia said miss hernshaw with unrelieved severity  oh said hewson giving himself time to realize that he was the psychical hero of two hemispheres well he resumed what do you expect me to say  i dont know what i expect i expected you to say something without my prompting you you know that it was outrageous for me to talk about your apparition without your leave and to be the means of its getting into the newspapers  im not sure you were the means i have told the story a hundred times myself  but that doesnt excuse me you knew the kind of people to tell it to and i didnt  oh i am afraid i was willing to tell it to all kinds of peopleto any kind that would listen  you are trying to evade me mr hewson she said with a severity he found charming i didnt expect that of you  the appeal was not lost upon hewson what do you want me to say  i want you said miss hernshaw with an effect of giving him another trial to sayto acknowledge that you were terribly annoyed by that interview  if you will excuse me from attaching the slightest blame to you for it i will acknowledge that i was annoyed  miss hernshaw drew a deep breath as of relief i will arrange about the blame she said loftily and now i wish to tell you how i never supposed that girl was an interviewer we were all together at an artists house in rome and after dinner we got to telling ghoststories the way people do around the fire and i told mineyours i mean and before we broke up this girl came to meit was while we were putting on our wrapsand introduced herself and said how much she had been impressed by my storyof course i mean your storyand she said she supposed it was made up i said i should not dream of making up a thing of that kind and that it was every word true and i had heard the person it happened to tell it himself i dont know i was vain of having heard it so at first hand  i can understand said hewson sadly  and then i told her who the person was and where it happenedand about the burglary you cant imagine how silly people get when they begin going in that direction  i am afraid i can said hewson  she seemed very grateful somehow i couldnt see why but i didnt ask and then i didnt think about it again till i saw it in that awful newspaper she sent it to me herself she was such a simpleton she thought i would actually like to see it she must have written it down and sent it to the paper and they printed it when they got ready to she needed the money i suppose then i began to wonder what you would say when you remembered how i blamed you for telling the same storyonly not half so badat that dinner  i always felt you were quite right said hewson i have always thanked you in my own mind for being so frank with me  well and what do you think now when you know that i was ten times as bad as youten times as foolish and vulgar  i havent had time to formulate my ideas yet hewson urged  you know perfectly well that you despise me can you say that i had any right to give your name  it must have got out sooner or later i never asked any one not to mention my name when i told the story  i see that you think i took a liberty and i did but thats nothing that isnt the point how i do keep beating about the bush mrs rock says it was a great deal worse to tell where it happened for that would give the place the reputation of being haunted and nobody could ever live there afterwards for they couldnt keep servants even if they didnt have the creeps themselves and it would ruin the property  hewson had not been able when she touched upon this point to elude the keen eye with which she read his silent thought  is that true she demanded  oh no oh no he began but he could not frame in plausible terms the lies he would have uttered he only succeeded in saying those things soon blow over  then how she said sternly does it happen that in every town and village almost there are houses that you can hardly hire anybody to live in because people say they are haunted no mr hewson its very kind of you and i appreciate it but you cant make me believe that it will ever blow over about st johnswort have you heard from mr st john since  yes hewson was obliged to own  and was he very much troubled about it i should think he was a man that would be from the way he behaved about the burglary was he she persisted seeing that hewson hesitated  yes i must say he was  there was a sound of walking to and fro in the adjoining room a quick shutting as of trunklids a noise as of a skirt shaken out and steps advanced to the door miss hernshaw ran to it and turned the key in the lock not yet mrs rock she called to the unseen presence within and she explained to hewson as she faced him again she promised that i should have it all out with you myself and now im not going to have her in here interrupting well did he write to you  yes he wrote to me he wanted me to deny the story  and did you  of course not said hewson with a note of indignation it was true besides it wouldnt have been of any use  no it would have been wicked and it would have been useless and then what did he say  nothing  nothing and you have never heard another word from him  yes he came to see me last night  here in new york is he here yet  i suppose so  where  i believe at the overpark  miss hernshaw caught her breath as if she were going to speak but she did not say anything  why do you insist upon all this miss hernshaw he entreated it can do you no good to follow the matter up  do you think i want to do myself good she returned i want to do myself harm what did he say when he came to see you  well you can imagine said hewson not able to keep out of his tone the lingering disgust he felt for st john  he complained  he all but shed tears said hewson recalled to a humorous sense of st johns behavior i felt sorry for him though he added darkly i cant say that i do now  miss hernshaw didnt seek to fathom the mystery of his closing words had he been actually inconvenienced by that thing in the paper  yessomewhat  how much  oh hewson groaned if you must know  i must the worst  it had fairly turned him out of house and home his servants had all left him and he had been reduced to taking his meals at the inn he showed me a handful of letters from people whom he had asked to visit him withdrawing their acceptances or making excuses for not accepting  ah said miss hernshaw with a deep inward breath as if this now were indeed something like the punishment she had expected and will itdid he thinkdid he say anything about the pecuniary effectthewhether it would hurt the property  he seemed to think it would answered hewson reluctantly and he added unfortunately for his generous purpose i really cant enter upon that part  she arched her eyebrows in grieved surprise but that is the very part that i want you to enter upon mr hewson you must tell me now did he say that it had injured the property very much  he did but  but what  i think st john is a man to put the worst face on that matter  you are saying that to keep me from feeling badly but i ought to feel badlyi wish to feel badly i suppose he said that it wasnt worth anything now  something of that sort hewson helplessly admitted  very well then i will buy it for whatever he chooses to ask with the precipitation which characterized all her actions miss hernshaw rose from the chair in which she had been provisionally sitting pushed an electric button in the wall swirled away to the other side of the room unlocked the door behind which those sounds had subsided and flinging it open said you can come out mrs hock ive rung for breakfast  mrs rock came smoothly forth with her vague eyes wandering over every other object in the room till they rested upon hewson directly before her then she gave him her hand and asked with a smile as if taking him into the joke well has rosalie had it out with you  i have had it out with him mrs rock miss hernshaw answered and i will tell you all about it later now i want my breakfast     xii   hewson ate the meal before him and it was a very good one as from time to time he noted in a daze which was as strange a confusion of the two consciousnesses as he had ever experienced whatever the convention was between miss hernshaw and mrs rock with regard to the matter in hand or lately in hand it dropped after a few uninterested inquiries from mrs rock who was satisfied or seemed so to know that miss hernshaw had got at the worst she led the talk to other things like the comparative comforts and discomforts of the line to genoa and the line to liverpool and hewson met her upon these polite topics with an apparent fulness of interest that would have deceived a much more attentive listener  all the time he was arguing with miss hernshaw in his nether consciousness pleading with her to keep her away from the fact that he had himself bought st johnswort until he could frame some fitting form in which to tell her that he had bought it with his outward eyes he saw her drooping on the opposite side of the table and in spite of her declaration that she wanted her breakfast making nothing of it after the preliminary melon while to his inward vision she was passionately refusing by every charming perversity to be tempted away from the subject  as the cunard boats always get in on saturday this morrow of their arrival was naturally sunday and after a while hewson fancied symptoms of going to church in mrs rock she could not have become more vague than she ordinarily was but her wanderings were of a kind of devotional character she spoke of the american church in rome and asked hewson if he knew the rector then when he said he was afraid he was keeping her from going to church she said she did not know whether rosalie intended going at the same time she rose from the table and hewson found that he should not be allowed to sit down again unless by violence he had to go away and he went as little at ease in his mind as he very well could be  he was no sooner out of the house than he felt the necessity of returning he did not know how or when miss hernshaw would write to st john but that she would do so he did not at all doubt and then when the truth came out what would she think of him he did not think her a very wise person she seemed to him rather a wild and whirling person in her ideals of conduct an unbridled and undisciplined person and yet he was aware of profoundly and tenderly respecting her as a creature of the most inexpugnable innocence and final goodness he could not bear to have her feel that he had trifled with her there had not been many meetings between them but each meeting had been of such event that it had advanced their acquaintance far beyond the point that it could have reached through weeks of ordinary association from the first there had been that sort of intimacy which exists between spirits which encounter in the region of absolute sincerity she had never used the least of those arts which women use in concealing the candor of their natures from men unworthy of it she had not only practiced her rule of instant and constant veracity but had avowed it and as it were invited his judgment of it hitherto he had met her halfway at least but now he was in the coil of a disingenuousness which must more and more trammel him from her unless he found some way to declare the fact to her  this ought to have been an easy matter but it was not easy upon reflection it grew rather more difficult hewson did not see how he could avow the fact which he wished to avow without intolerable awkwardness without the effect of boasting without putting upon her a burden which he had no right to put to be sure she had got herself in for it all by her divine imprudence but she had owned her error in that as promptly as if it had been the blame of some one else still hewson doubted whether her magnanimity was large enough to go round in the case of a man who tried to let his magnanimity come upon her with any sort of dramatic surprise this was what he must seem to be doing if he now left her to learn from another how he had kept st john from loss by himself assuming the chance of depreciation in his property but if he went and told her that he had done it how much better for him would that be  he took a long unhappy walk up into the park and then he walked back to the walholland by this time he thought mrs rock and miss hernshaw must have been to church but he had not the courage to send up his name to them he waited about in the region of the diningroom in the senseless hope that it would be better for him to surprise them on their way to luncheon and trust to some chance for introducing his confession than to seek a direct interview with miss hernshaw but they did not come to luncheon and then hewson had the clerk send up his card word came back that the ladies would see him and he followed the messenger to mrs rocks apartment where if he was surprised he was not disappointed to be received by miss hernshaw alone  mrs rock is lying down she explained but i thought that it might be something important and you would not mind seeing me  not at all said hewson with what seemed to him afterwards superfluous politeness and then they both waited until he could formulate his business miss hernshaw drooping forward and looking down in a way that he had found was most characteristic of her it is something importantat least it is important to me miss hernshaw may i ask whether you have done anythingit seems a very unwarrantable questionabout st johnswort  about buying it  yes it will be useless to make any offer for it  why will it be useless to do that  becausebecause i have bought it myself  you have bought it  yes when he came to me last night and made those representationswell in short i have bought the place  to save him from losing money by thatstory  wellyes i ought to have told you the fact this morning as soon as you said you would buy the place i know that you like people to be perfectly truthful buti couldntwithout seeming tobrag  i understand said miss hernshaw  i took the risk of your writing to st john but then i realized that if he answered and told you what i ought to have told you myself it would make it worse and i came back  i dont know whether it would have made it worse but you have come too late said miss hernshaw ive just written to mr st john  they were both silent for what hewson thought a long time at the end of it he asked did youyou must excuse merefer to me at all  no certainly not why should i  i dont know i dont know that it would have mattered he was silent again with bowed head when he looked up he saw tears in the girls eyes  i suppose you know where this leaves me she said gently  i cant pretend that i dont answered hewson what can i do  you can sell me the place for what it cost you  oh no i cant do that said hewson  why do you say that it isnt as if i were poor but even then you wouldnt have the right to refuse me if i insisted it was my fault that it ever came out about st johnswort it might have come out about you but the harm to mr st johni did that and why should you take it upon yourself  because i was really to blame from the beginning to the end if it had not been for my pitiful wish to shine as the confidant of mystery nothing would have been known of the affair even when you asked me that night if it had not happened at st johnswort i know now that i had a wretched triumph in saying that it had and i was so full of this that i did not think to caution you against repeating what i had owned  yes said the girl with her unsparing honesty if you had given me any hint i would not have told for the world of course i did not thinka girl wouldntof the effect it would have on the property  no you wouldnt think of that said hewson though he agreed with her he would have preferred that she should continue to blame herself but he took himself severely in hand again so you see the fault was altogether mine and if there is to be any penalty it ought to fall upon me  yes said miss hernshaw and if there has been a fault there ought to be a penalty dont you think it would have been no penalty for me to buy st johnswort my father wouldnt have minded it she blushed suddenly and added i dont mean thatyou may be so rich thati think i had better stop  no no said hewson amused and glad of the relief go on i will tell you anything you wish to know  i dont wish to know anything said miss hernshaw haughtily  her words seemed to put an end to an interview for which there was no longer any excuse  hewson rose goodby he said and he was rather surprised at her putting out her hand but he took it gratefully will you make my adieux to mrs rock and excuse my coming a second time to trouble you  i dont see how you could have helped coming said miss hernshaw when you thought i might write to mr st john at once  whether this implied excuse or greater blame hewson had to go away with it as her final response and he went away certainly in as great discomfort as he had come he did not feel quite well used it seemed to him that hard measure had been dealt him on all sides but especially by miss hernshaw after her futile effort at reparation to st john she had apparently withdrawn from all responsibility in the matter he did not know when he was to see her again if ever and he did not know what he was to wait for if anything  still he had the sense of waiting for something or for some one and he went home to wait there he perceived that it was for st john who did not keep him waiting long his nervous ring roused hewson half an hour after his return and st john came in with a look in his greedy eyes which hewson rightly interpreted at the first glance  see here hewson st john said with his habitual lack of manners i dont want to get you in for this thing at st johnswort i know why you offered to buy the place and though of course you are the original cause of the trouble i dont feel that its quite fair to let you shoulder the consequences altogether  have i been complaining hewson asked dryly  no and thats just it youve behaved like a little man through it all and i dont like to take advantage of you if you want to rue your bargain ill call it off ive had some fresh light on the matter and i believe i can let you off without loss to myself so that if its me youre considering  whats your fresh light asked hewson  well said st john and he swallowed rather hard as if it were a pill the fact is ive had another offer for the place  a better one  well i dont know that i can say that it is answered st john saving his conscience in the form of the words  hewson knew that he was lying and he had no mercy on him then i believe ill stick to my bargain you say that the other party hasnt bettered my offer and so i neednt withdraw on your account im not bound to withdraw for any other reason  no of course not st john rubbed his chin as if hesitating to eat his words however unpalatable but in the end he seemed not to find it possible well he said disgustedly as he floundered up to take his leave i thought i ought to come and give you the chance  its very nice of you said hewson with a smile that made itself a derisive grin in spite of him and a laugh of triumph when the door had closed upon st john     xiii   after the first flush of hewsons triumph had passed he began to enjoy it less and byandby he did not enjoy it at all he had done right not only in keeping st john from plundering miss hernshaw but in standing firm and taking the punishment which ought to fall upon him and not on her but the sense of having done right sufficed him no more than the sense of having got the better of st john what was lacking to him in the casuistry of the moment which was perhaps rather emotional than rational it appeared to hewson that he had again a duty toward miss hernshaw and that his feeling of dissatisfaction was the first effect of its nonfulfilment but it was clearly impossible that he should go again to see her and tell her what had passed between him and st john and it was clearly impossible that he should write and tell her what it was quite as clearly her right to know from him if he went to her or wrote to her he felt himself in danger of wanting to shine in the affair as her protector against the rapacity of st john and as the man of superior quality who had outwitted a greedy fellow the fear that she might not admire his splendor in either sort caused him to fall somewhat nervelessly back upon providence but if the moral government of the universe finally favored him it was not by traversing any of its own laws by the time he had determined to achieve both the impossibilities which formed his dilemmahad decided to write to miss hernshaw and call upon her and leave his letter in the event of failing to find herhis problem was as far solved as it might be by the arrival of a note from miss hernshaw herself hoping that he would come to see her on business of pressing importance  she received him without any pretence of mrs rocks intermediary presence and put before him a letter which she had received before writing him from st john and which she could not answer without first submitting it to him it was a sufficiently straightforward expression of his regret that he could not accept her very generous offer for st johnswort because the place was already sold he had the taste to forbear any allusion to the motives which she told hewson she had said prompted her offer but then he became very darkling and sinuous in a suggestion that if miss hernshaw wished to have her offer known as hers to the purchaser of st johnswort he would be happy to notify him of it  you see she eagerly commented to hewson he does not give your name but i know who it is though i did not know when i made him my offer i must answer his letter now and what shall i say shall i tell him i know who it is i should like to i hate all concealments will it do any harm to tell him i know  hewson reflected i dont see how it can i was trying to come to you when i got your note to say that st john had been to see me and offered to release me from my offer because as i thought you had made him a better one hes amusingly rapacious st john is  and what did youi beg your pardon  oh not at all i said i would stand to my offer  she repressed apparently some form of protest and presently asked and what shall i say  oh if you like that you have learned who the purchaser of st johnswort is and that you know he will not give way  well she said with a quick sigh as of disappointment after an indefinite pause she asked shall you be going to st johnswort  why i dont know hewson answered i had thought of going to europe but yes i think i shall go to st johnswort first at any rate one cant simply turn ones back on a piece of real estate in that way he said recognizing a fact that would doubtless have presented itself in due order for his consideration my one notion was to forget it as quickly as possible  i should not think you would want to do that said the girl seriously  no one oughtnt to neglect an investment  i dont mean that but if such a thing had happened to me there i should want to go again and again  you mean the apparition did i tell you how i had always had the expectation that i should see it again and perhaps understand it but when i had behaved so shabbily about it i began to feel that it would not come again  if i were in your place said the girl i should never give up i should spend my whole life trying to find out what it meant  ah he sighed i wish you could put yourself in my place  i wish i could she returned intensely  they looked into each others faces  miss hernshaw he demanded solemnly do you really like people to say what they think  of course i do  then i wish you would come to st johnswort with me  would that do she asked if mrs rock  he saw how far she was from taking his meaning but he pushed on i dont want mrs rock i want youyou alone dont you understand me i love you iof course its ridiculous weve only met three or four times in our lives but i knew this as well the first moment as i do now i knew it when you came walking across the garden that morning and i havent known it any better since and i couldnt in a thousand years but of course  sit down she said wafting herself into a chair and he obeyed her i should have to tell my father she began  why certainly and he sprang to his feet again  she commanded him to his chair with an imperative gesture i have got to find out what i think first myself if i were sure that i loved youbut i dont know i believe you are good i believed that when they were all joking you there at breakfast and you took it so nicely i have always believed that you were good  she seemed to be appealing to him for confirmation but he could not very well say that she was right and he kept silent i didnt like your telling that story at the dinner and i said so and then i went and did the same thing or worse so that i have nothing to say about that and i think you have behaved very nobly to mr st john as if at some sign of protest in hewson she insisted yes i do but all this doesnt prove that i love you again she seemed to appeal to him and this time he thought he might answer her appeal  i couldnt prove that i love you but i feel sure of it  and do you believe that we ought to take our feelings for a guide  thats what people do he ventured with the glimmer of a smile in his eyes which she was fixing so earnestly with her own  i am not satisfied that it is the right way she answered if there is really such a thing as love there ought to be some way of finding it out besides our feelings dont you think its a thing we ought to talk sensibly about  of all things in the world though it isnt the custom  miss hernshaw was silent for a moment then she said i believe i should like a little time  oh i didnt expect you to answer me at oncei  but if you are going to europe  i neednt go to europe at all i can go to st johnswort and wait for your answer there  it might be a good while she urged i should want to tell my father that i was thinking about it and he would want to see you before he approved  why of course  not she added that it would make any difference if i was sure of it myself he has always said that he would not try to control me in such a matter and i think he would like you i do like you very much myself mr hewson but i dont think it would be right to say i loved you unless i could prove it  hewson was tempted to say that she could prove it by marrying him but he had not the heart to mock a scruple which he felt to be sacred what he did say was then i will wait till you can prove it do you wish me not to see you again before you have made up your mind  i dont know i cant see what harm there would be in our meeting no i cant either said hewson as she seemed to refer the point to him should you mind my coming again say this evening  tonight she reflected a moment yes come tonight  when he came after dinner hewson was sensible from the perfect unconsciousness of mrs rocks manner that miss hernshaw had been telling her her habit of a wandering eye contributed to the effect she wished to produce if this were the effect and her success was such that it might easily have deceived herself but when mrs rock in a supreme exercise of her unconsciousness left him with the girl for a brief interval before it was time for him to go miss hernshaw said mrs rock knows about it and she says that the best way for me to find out will be to try whether i can live without you  was that mrs rocks idea asked hewson as gravely as he could  no it was mine i suggested it to her but she approves of it dont you like it  yes i hope i shant die while you are trying to live without me shall you be very long she frowned and he hastened to say i do like your idea its the best way and i thank you for giving me a chance  we are going out to my fathers ranch in colorado at once she explained we shall start tomorrow morning  oh may i come to see you off  no i would rather begin at once  may i write to you  i will write to youwhen ive decided  she gave him her hand but she would not allow him to keep it for more than farewell and then she made him stay till mrs rock came back and take leave of her too he had frankly forgotten mrs rock who bade him adieu with averted eyes and many civilities about seeing him again she could hardly have been said to be seeing him then     xiv   the difficulties of domestication at st johnswort had not been misrepresented by the late proprietor hewson found when he went to take possession of his estate he thought it right in engaging servants to say openly that the place had the reputation of being haunted and if he had not thought it right he would have thought it expedient for he knew that if he had concealed the fact it would have been discovered to them within twentyfour hours of their arrival his declaration was sufficient at once with most who recoiled from his service as if he had himself been a ghost with one or two sceptics who seemed willing to take the risks probably in a guilty consciousness of records that would have kept them out of other employ his confession that he had himself seen the spectre which haunted st johnswort was equally effective he prevailed at last against the fact and his own testimony with a japanese who could not be made to understand the objection to the place and who willingly went with hewson as his valet and general houseworkman with the wife of the gardener coming in to cook for them during the long daylight he got on in as much comfort as he could have expected and by night he suffered no sort of disturbance from the apparition he had expected to be annoyed by believers in spiritualism and other psychical inquirers but it sufficed with them to learn from him that he had come to regard his experience of which he had no more question now than ever as purely subjective  it seemed to hewson in the six weeks time which he spent at st johnswort waiting to hear from rosalie he had come already to think of her as rosalie that all his life was subjective it passed so like a dream he had some outward cares as to the place he kept a horse in the stable where st john had kept half a dozen and he had the gardener look after that as well as the shrubs and vegetables but all went on in a suspensive and provisional sort in the mean time rosalies charm grew upon him everything that she had said or looked was hourly and daily sweeter and dearer her truth was intoxicating beyond the lures of other women in which the quality of deceit had once fascinated him now so late in his youthful life he realized that there was no beauty but that of truth and he pledged himself a thousand times that if she should say she could not live without him he would henceforward live for truth alone and not for the truth merely as it was in her but as it was in everything in those days he learned to know himself as he never had before and to put off a certain shell of worldliness that had grown upon him in his remoteness from it new york became very distasteful to him he thought with reluctance of going back to it his club which had been his home now appeared a joyless exile the life of a leisure class which he had made his ideal looked pitifully mean and little in the retrospect he wondered how he could have valued the things that he had once thought worthy he did not know what he should replace it all with but rosalie would know in the event of not being able to live without him in that event there was hardly any use of which he could not be capable in any other eventhe surprised himself by realizing that in any other eventstill the universe had somehow more meaning than it once had somehow he felt himself an emancipated man  he began many letters to rosalie and some he finished and some not but he sent none and when her letter came at last he was glad that he had waited for it in implicit trust of its coming though he believed she would have forgiven him if he had not had the patience the letter was quite what he could have imagined of her she said that she had put herself thoroughly to the test and she could not live without him but if he had found out that he could live without her then she should know that she had been to blame and would take her punishment apparently in her philosophy which now seemed to him so divine without punishment there must be perdition it was the penalty that redeemed that was the token of forgiveness  hewson hurried out to colorado where he found hernshaw a stout silent impersonal man whose notion of the paternal office seemed to be a ready acquiescence in a daughters choice of a husband he appeared to think this could be best expressed to hewson in a good cigar he perceptibly enjoyed the business details of the affair but he enjoyed despatching them in the least possible time and the fewest words and then he settled down to the pleasure of a superficial passivity hewson could not make out that he regarded his daughter as at all an unusual girl and from this he argued that her mother must have been a very unusual woman his only reason for doubting that rosalie must have got all her originality from her mother was something that fell from hernshaw when they were near the end of their cigars he said irrelevantly to their talk at that point i suppose you know rosalie believes in that ghost of yours  was it a ghostive never been sure myself said hewson  how do you explain it asked his prospective fatherinlaw  i dont explain it i have always left it just as it was i know that it was a real experience  i think i should have left it so too said hernshaw that always gives it a chance to explain itself if such a thing had happened to me i should give it all the time it wanted  well i havent hurried it hewson suggested  what i mean and hernshaw stepped to the edge of the porch and threw the butt of his cigar into the darkness where it described a glimmering arc is that if anything came to me that would help shore up my professed faith in what most of us want to believe in i would take the commonlaw view of it i would believe it was innocent till it proved itself guilty i wouldnt try to make it out a fraud myself  im afraid thats what ive really done said hewson but before people ive put up a bluff of despising it oh yes i understand that said hernshaw a man thinks that if he can have an experience like that he must be something out of the common and if he can despise it  youve hit my case exactly said hewson and the two men laughed     xv   after his marriage which took place without needless delay hewson returned with his wife to spend their honeymoon at st johnswort the honeymoon prolonged itself during an entire year and in this time they contrived so far to live down its reputation of being a haunted house that they were able to conduct their ménage on the ordinary terms they themselves never wished to lose the sense of something supernatural in the place and were never quite able to accept the actual conditions as final that is to say rosalie was not for she had taken hewsons apparition under her peculiar care and defended it against even his question she had a feeling it was scarcely a conviction that if he believed more strenuously in the validity of his apparition as an authorized messenger from the unseen world it would yet come again and declare its errand she could not accept the theory that if such a thing actually happened it could happen for nothing at all or that the reason of its occurrence could be indefinitely postponed she was impatient of that as often as he urged the possibility and she wished him to use a seriousness of mind in speaking of his apparition which should form some sort of atonement to it for his past levity though since she had taken his apparition into her keeping he had scarcely hazarded any suggestion concerning it in fact it had become so much her apparition that he had a fantastic reluctance from meddling with it  you are always requiring a great occasion for it he said at last what greater event could it have foreshadowed or foreshown than that which actually came to pass  i dont understand you arthur she said letting her hand creep into his where it trembled provisionally as they sat together in the twilight  why that was the day i first saw you  now you are laughing she said pulling her hand away  indeed im not i couldnt imagine anything more important than the union of our lives and if that was what the apparition meant to portend it could not have intimated it by a more noble and impressive behavior simply to be there and then to be gone and leave the rest to us it was majestic it wasdelicate  yes it was but it was too much for it was out of proportion a mere earthly loveaffair is it merely for earth  oh husband i hope you dont think so i wanted you to say you didnt and if you dont think so yes ill believe it came for that  you may be sure i dont think so  then i know it will come again                                            the angel of the lord     i   all that sort of personification said wanhope is far less remarkable than the depersonification which has now taken place so thoroughly that we no longer think in the old terms at all it was natural that the primitive peoples should figure the passions conditions virtues vices forces qualities in some sort of corporal shape with each a propensity or impulse of its own but it does not seem to me so natural that the derivative peoples should cease to do so it is rational that they should do so and i dont know that any stronger proof of our intellectual advance could be alleged than the fact that the old personifications survive in the parlance while they are quite extinct in the consciousness we still talk of death at times as if it were an embodied force of some kind and of love in the same way but i dont believe that any man of the commonest commonschool education thinks of them so if you try to do it yourself you are rather ashamed of the puerility and when a painter or a sculptor puts them in an objective shape you follow him with impatience almost with contempt  how about the poets asked minver less with the notion perhaps of refuting the psychologist than of bringing the literary member of our little group under the disgrace that had fallen upon him as an artist  the poets said i are as extinct as the personifications  thats very handsome of you acton said the artist but go on wanhope  yes get down to business said rulledge being of no employ whatever and spending his whole life at the club in an extraordinary idleness rulledge was always using the most strenuous expressions and requiring everybody to be practical he leaned directly forward with the difficulty that a man of his girth has in such a movement and vigorously broke off the ash of his cigar against the edge of his saucer we had been dining together and had been served with coffee in the turkish room as it was called from its cushions and hangings of indian and egyptian stuffs what is the instance youve got up your sleeve he smoked with great energy and cast his eyes alertly about as if to make sure that there was no chance of wanhopes physically escaping him from the corner of the divan where he sat pretty well hemmed in by the rest of us spreading in an irregular circle before him  you unscientific people are always wanting an instance as if an instance were convincing an instance is only suggestive a thousand instances if you please are convincing said the psychologist but i dont know that i wish to be convincing i would rather be enquiring that is much more interesting and perhaps profitable  all the same minver persisted apparently in behalf of rulledge but with an aftergrudge of his own youll allow that you were thinking of something in particular when you began with that generalization about the lost art of personifying  oh that is very curious said the psychologist we talk of generalizing but is there any such thing arent we always striving from one concrete to another and isnt what we call generalizing merely a process of finding our way  i see what you mean said the artist expressing in that familiar formula the state of the man who hopes to know what the other man means  thats what i say rulledge put in youve got something up your sleeve what is it  wanhope struck the little bell on the table before him but without waiting for a response he intercepted a waiter who was passing with a coffeepot and asked oh couldnt you give me some of that  the man filled his cup for him and after wanhope put in the sugar and lifted it to his lips rulledge said with his impetuous business air its easy to see what wanhope does his high thinking on  yes the psychologist admitted coffee is an inspiration but you can overdo an inspiration it would be interesting to know whether there hasnt been a change in the quality of thought since the use of such stimulants came inwhether it hasnt been subtilized  was that what you were going to say demanded rulledge relentlessly come weve got no time to throw away  everybody laughed  you havent anyway said i  well none of his own minver admitted for the idler  i suppose you mean i have thrown it all away well i dont want to throw away other peoples go on wanhope     ii   the psychologist set his cup down and resumed his cigar which he had to pull at pretty strongly before it revived i should not be surprised he began if a good deal of the fear of death had arisen and perpetuated itself in the race from the early personification of dissolution as an enemy of a certain dreadful aspect armed and threatening that conception wouldnt have been found in mens minds at first it would have been the result of later crude meditation upon the fact but it would have remained through all the imaginative ages and the notion might have been intensified in the more delicate temperaments as time went on and by the play of heredity it might come down to our own day in certain instances with a force scarcely impaired by the lapse of incalculable time  you said just now said rulledge in rueful reproach that personification had gone out  yes it has i did say that and yet i suppose that though such a notion of death say no longer survives in the consciousness it does survive in the unconsciousness and that any vivid accident or illusory suggestion would have force to bring it to the surface  i wish i knew what you were driving at said rulledge  you remember ormond dont you asked wanhope turning suddenly to me  perfectly i said ihe isnt living is he  no he died two years ago  i thought so i said with the relief that one feels in not having put a fellowcreature out of life even conditionally  you knew mrs ormond too i believe the psychologist pursued  i owned that i used to go to the ormonds house  then you know what a type she was i suppose he turned to the others and as theyre both dead its no contravention of the club etiquette against talking of women to speak of her i cant very well give the instancethe signthat rulledge is seeking without speaking of her unless i use a great deal of circumlocution we all urged him to go on and he went on i had the facts im going to give from mrs ormond you know that the ormonds left new york a couple of years ago  he happened to look at minver as he spoke and minver answered no i must confess that i didnt even know they had left the planet  wanhope ignored his irrelevant ignorance they went to live provisionally at a place up the housatonic road somewhereperhaps canaan but it doesnt matter ormond had been suffering some time with an obscure affection of the heart  oh come now said rulledge youre not going to spring anything so pat as heartdisease on us  acton is all ears said minver nodding toward me he hears the weird note afar  the psychologist smiled im afraid youre not interested im not much interested myself in these unrelated instances  oh no dont do go on the different entreaties came and after a little time taken to recover his lost equanimity wanhope went on i dont know whether you knew that ormond had rather a peculiar dread of death we none of us could affirm that we did and again wanhope resumed i shouldnt say that he was a coward above other men i believe he was rather below the average in cowardice but the thought of death weighed upon him you find this much more commonly among the russians if we are to believe their novelists than among americans he might have been a character out of one of tourguéniefs books the idea of death was so constantly present with him he once told me that the fear of it was a part of his earliest consciousness before the time when he could have had any intellectual conception of it it seemed to be something like the projection of an alien horror into his lifea prenatal influence  jove rulledge broke in i dont see how the women stand it to look forward nearly a whole year to death as the possible end of all theyre hoping for and suffering for talk of mens courage after that i wonder were not all marked  i never heard of anything of the kind in ormonds history said wanhope tolerant of the incursion  minver took his cigar out to ask the more impressively perhaps what do you fellows make of the terror that a two months babe starts in its sleep with before it can have any notion of what fear is on its own hook  we dont make anything of it the psychologist answered perhaps the pathologists do  oh its easy enough to say wind rulledge indignantly protested  too easy i agree with you wanhope consented we cannot tell what influences reach us from our environment or what our environment really is or how much or little we mean by the word the sense of danger seems to be inborn and possibly it is a survival of our race life when it was wholly animal and took care of itself through what we used to call the instincts but as i was saying it was not danger that ormond seemed to be afraid of if it came short of death he was almost abnormally indifferent to pain i knew of his undergoing an operation that most people would take ether for and not wincing because it was not supposed to involve a fatal result  perhaps he carried his own anodyne with him said minver like the chinese  you mean a sort of selfanaesthesia wanhope asked that is very interesting how far such a principle if there is one can be carried in practice the hypnotists  im afraid i didnt mean anything so serious or scientific said the painter  then dont switch wanhope off on a side track rulledge implored you know how hard it is to keep him on the main line hes got a mind that splays all over the place if you give him the least chance now wanhope come down to business  wanhope laughed amiably why theres so very little of the business im not sure that it wasnt mrs ormonds attitude toward the fact that interested me most it was nothing short of devout she was a convert she believed he really sawi suppose he turned to me theres no harm in our recognizing now that they didnt always get on smoothly together  did they ever i asked  oh yesoh yes said the psychologist kindly they were very fond of each other and often very peaceful  i never happened to be by i said  used to fight like cats and dogs said minver and they didnt seem to mind people it was very swell in a way their indifference and it did help to take away a fellows embarrassment  that seemed to come mostly to an end that summer said wanhope if you could believe mrs ormond  you probably couldnt the painter put in  at any rate she seemed to worship his memory  oh yes she hadnt him there to claw  well she was quite frank about it with me the psychologist pursued she admitted that they had always quarreled a good deal she seemed to think it was a token of their perfect unity it was as if they were each quarreling with themselves she said im not sure that there wasnt something in the notion there is no doubt but that they were tremendously in love with each other and there is something curious in the bickerings of married people if they are in love its one way of having no concealments its perfect confidence of a kind  or unkind minver suggested  what has all that got to do with it rulledge demanded  nothing directly wanhope confessed and im not sure that it has much to do indirectly still it has a certain atmospheric relation it is very remarkable how thoughts connect themselves with one another its a sort of wireless telegraphy they do not touch at all there is apparently no manner of tie between them but they communicate  oh lord rulledge fumed  wanhope looked at him with a smiling concern such as a physician might feel in the symptoms of a peculiar case i wonder he said absently how much of our impatience with a fact delayed is a survival of the childhood of the race and how far it is the effect of conditions in which possession is the ideal  rulledge pushed back his chair and walked away in dudgeon im a busy man myself when youve got anything to say you can send for me  minver ran after him as no doubt he meant some one should oh come back hes just going to begin and when rulledge after some pouting had been pushed down into his chair again wanhope went on with a glance of scientific pleasure at him     iii   the house they had taken was rather a lonely place out of sight of neighbors which they had got cheap because it was so isolated and inconvenient i fancy of course mrs ormond with her exaggeration represented it as a sort of solitude which nobody but tramps of the most dangerous description ever visited as she said she never went to sleep without expecting to wake up murdered in her bed  like her said minver with a glance at me full of relish for the touch of character which i would feel with him  she said wanhope went on that she was anxious from the first for the effect upon ormond in the stress of any danger she gave me to understand he always behaved very well but out of its immediate presence he was full of all sorts of gloomy apprehensions unless the surroundings were cheerful she could not imagine how he came to take the place but when she told him so  ive no doubt she told him so pretty promptly the painter grinned  he explained that he had seen it on a brilliant day in spring when all the trees were in bloom and the bees humming in the blossoms and the orioles singing and the outlook from the lawn down over the river valley was at its best he had fallen in love with the place that was the truth and he was so wildly in love with it all through that he could not feel the defect she did in it he used to go gaily about the wide harking old house at night shutting it up and singing or whistling while she sat quaking at the notion of their loneliness and their absolute helplessnessan invalid and a little womanin case anything happened she wanted him to get the man who did the odd jobs about the house to sleep there but he laughed at her and they kept on with their usual town equipment of two servingwomen she could not account for his spirits which were usually so low when they were alone  and not fighting minver suggested to me  and when she asked him what the matter was he could not account for them either but he said one day that the fear of death seemed to be lifted from his soul and that made her shudder  rulledge fetched a long sigh and minver interpreted beginning to feel that its something like now  he said that for the first time within his memory he was rid of that nether consciousness of mortality which had haunted his whole life and poisoned more or less all his pleasure in living he had got a reprieve or a respite and he felt like a boyanother kind of boy from what he had ever been he was full of all sorts of brilliant hopes and plans he had visions of success in business beyond anything he had known and talked of buying the place he had taken and getting a summer colony of friends about them he meant to cut the property up and make the right kind of people inducements his world seemed to have been emptied of all trouble as well as all mortal danger  havent you psychologists some message about a condition like that i asked  perhaps its only the pathologists again said minver  the alienists rather more specifically said wanhope they recognize it as one of the beginnings of insanitfolie des grandeurs as the french call the stage  is it necessarily that rulledge demanded with a resentment which we felt so droll in him that we laughed  i dont know that it is said wanhope i dont know why we shouldnt sometimes in the absence of proofs to the contrary give such a fact the chance to evince a spiritual import of course it had no other import to poor mrs ormond and of course i didnt dream of suggesting a scientific significance  i should think not rulledge puffed  wanhope went on i dont think i should have dared to do so to a woman in her exaltation concerning it i could see that however his state had affected her with dread or discomfort in the first place it had since come to be her supreme hope and consolation in view of what afterward happened she regarded it as the effect of a mystical intimation from another world that was sacred and could not he considered like an ordinary fact without sacrilege there was something very pathetic in her absolute conviction that ormonds happiness was an emanation from the source of all happiness such as sometimes where the consciousness persists comes to a deathbed that the dying are not afraid of dying is a fact of such common such almost invariable observation  you mean i interposed when the vital forces are beaten so low that the natural dread of ceasing to be has no play it has less play ive noticed in age than in youth but for the same reason that it has when people are weakened by sickness  ah said wanhope that comparative indifference to death in the old to whom it is so much nearer than it is to the young is very suggestive there may be something in what you say they may not care so much because they have no longer the strengththe muscular strengthfor caring they are too tired to care as they used there is a whole region of most important inquiry in that direction  did you mean to have him take that direction rulledge asked sulkily  he can take any direction for me i said he is always delightful  ah thank you said wanhope  but i confess i went on that i was wondering whether the fact that the dying are indifferent to death could be established in the case of those who die in the flush of health and strength like for instance people who are put to death  wanhope smiled i think it canmeasurably most murderers make a good end as the saying used to be when they end on the scaffold though they are not supported by religious fervor of any kind or the exaltation of a high ideal they go meekly and even cheerfully to their death without rebellion or even objection it is most exceptional that they make a fight for their lives as that woman did a few years ago at dannemora and disgusted all refined people with capital punishment  i wish they would make a fight always said rulledge with unexpected feeling it would do more than anything to put an end to that barbarity  it would be very interesting as wanhope says minver remarked but arent we getting rather far away from the ormonds i mean  we are rather said wanhope though i agree that it would be interesting i should rather like to have it tried you know frederick douglass acted upon some such principle when his master attempted to whip him he fought and he had a theory that if the slave had always fought there would soon have been an end of whipping and so an end of slavery but probably it will be a good while before criminals are  educated up to the idea minver proposed  yes wanhope absently acquiesced there seems to be a resignation intimated to the parting soul whether in sickness or in health by the mere proximity of death in ormonds case there seems to have been something more positive his wife says that in the beginning of those days he used to come to her and wonder what could be the matter with him he had a joy he could not account for by anything in their lives and it made her tremble  probably it didnt i dont think there was anything that could make mrs ormond tremble unless it was the chance that ormond would get the last word said minver  no one minded him and wanhope continued of course she thought he must be going to have a fit of sickness as the people say in the country or used to say those expressions often survive in the common parlance long after the peculiar mental and moral conditions in which they originated have passed away they must once have been more accurate than they are now when one said fit of sickness one must have meant something specific it would be interesting to know what women use those expressions longer than men they seem to be inveterate in their nerves and women apparently do their thinking in their nerves rather than their brains     iv   wanhope had that distant look in his eyes which warned his familiars of a possible excursion and i said in the hope of keeping him from it then isnt there a turn of phrase somewhat analogous to that in a personification  ah yesa personification he repeated with a freshness of interest which he presently accounted for the place they had taken was very completely furnished they got it fully equipped even to linen and silver but what was more important to poor ormond was the library very rich in the english classics which appeared to go with the house the owner was a girl who married and lived abroad and these were her fathers books mrs ormond said that her husband had the greatest pleasure in them their print which was good and black and their paper which was thin and yellowish and their binding which was tree calf in the poets he specially liked they were english editions as well as english classics and she said he caressed the books as he read them with that touch which the booklover has he put his face into them and inhaled their odor as if it were the bouquet of wine he wanted her to like it too  then she hated it minver said unrelentingly  perhaps not if there was nobody else there i urged  for once wanhope was not to be tempted off on another scent there was a good deal of oldfashioned fiction of the suspiratory and exclamatory sort like mackenzies and sternes and his followers full of feeling as people understood feeling a hundred years ago but what ormond rejoiced in most were the poets good and bad like gray and collins and young and their contemporaries who personified nearly everything from contemplation to indigestion through the whole range of the vices virtues passions propensities attributes and qualities and gave them each a dignified capital letter to wear she said he used to come roaring to her with the passages in which these personifications flourished and read them off with mock admiration and then shriek and sputter with laughter you know the way he had when a thing pleased him especially a thing that had some relish of the quaint or rococo as nearly as she would admit in view of his loss he bored her with these things he was always hunting down some new personification and when he had got it adding it to the list he kept she said he had thousands of them but i suppose he had not so many he had enough though to keep him amused and she said he talked of writing something for the magazines about them but probably he never would have done it he never wrote anything did he wanhope asked of me  oh no he was far too literary for that i answered he had a reputation to lose  pretty good said minver even if ormond is dead  wanhope ignored us both after awhile his wife said she began to notice a certain change in his attitude toward the personifications she noticed this always expecting that fit of sickness for him but she was not so much troubled by his returning seriousness oh i ought to tell you that when she first began to be anxious for him she privately wrote home to their family doctor telling him how strangely happy ormond was and asking him if he could advise anything he wrote back that if ormond was so very happy they had better not do anything to cure him that the disease was not infectious and was seldom fatal  what an ass said rulledge  yes i think he was in this instance but probably he had been consulted a good deal by mrs ormond said wanhope the change that began to set her mind at rest about ormond was his taking the personifications more seriously why he began to ask but always with a certain measure of joke in it why shouldnt there be something in the personifications why shouldnt morn and eve come corporeally walking up their lawn with little or no clothes on or despair be sitting in their woods with her hair over her face or famine coming gauntly up to their back door for a handout why shouldnt they any day see popeyed rapture passing on the trolley or meditation letting the car she intended to take go by without stepping lively enough to get on board he pretended that we could have the personifications back again if we were not so conventional in our conceptions of them he wanted to know what reason there was for representing life as a very radiant and bounding party when life usually neither shone nor bounded and why death should be figured as an enemy with a dart when it was so often the only friend a man had left and had the habit of binding up wounds rather than inflicting them the personifications were all right he said but the poets and painters did not know how they really looked by the way wanhope broke off did you happen to see hauptmanns hånnele when it was here  none of us had and we waited rather restively for the passing of the musing fit which he fell into after a while he resumed at a point whose relation to the matter in hand we could trace  it was extremely interesting for all reasons by its absolute fearlessness and freshness in regions where there has been nothing but timid convention for a long time but what i was thinking of was the personification of death as it appears there the poor little dying pauper lying in her dream at the almshouse sees the figure of death it is not the skeleton with the dart or the phantom with the shrouded face but a tall beautiful young manas beautiful as they could get into the cast at any rateclothed in simple black and standing with his back against the mantlepiece with his hands resting on the hilt of a long twohanded sword he is so quiet that you do not see him until some time after the child has seen him when she begins to question him whether she may not somehow get to heaven without dying he answers with a sort of sorrowful tenderness a very sweet and noble compassion but unsparingly as to his mission it is a singular moment of pure poetry that makes the heart ache but does not crush or terrify the spirit  and what has it got to do with ormond asked rulledge but with less impatience than usual  why nothing im afraid that i can make out very clearly and yet there is an obscure connection with ormond or his vision if it was a vision mrs ormond could not be very definite about what he saw perhaps because even at the last moment he was not definite himself what she was clear about was the fact that his mood though it became more serious by no means became sadder it became a sort of solemn joy instead of the light gaiety it had begun by being she was no sort of scientific observer and yet the keenness of her affection made her as closely observant of ormond as if she had been studying him psychologically sometimes the light in his room would wake her at night and she would go to him and find him lying with a book faced down on his breast as if he had been reading and his fingers interlaced under his head and a kind of radiant peace in his face the poor thing said that when she would ask him what the matter was he would say nothing just happiness and when she would ask him if he did not think he ought to do something he would laugh and say perhaps it would go off of itself but it did not go off the unnatural buoyancy continued after he became perfectly tranquil i dont know he would say i seem to have got to the end of my troubles i havent a care in the world jenny i dont believe you could get a rise out of me if you said the nastiest thing you could think of it sounds like nonsense of course but it seems to me that i have found out the reason of things though i dont know what it is maybe ive only found out that there is a reason of things that would be enough wouldnt it     v   at this point wanhope hesitated with a kind of diffidence that was rather charming in him i dont see he said just how i can keep the facts from this on out of the line of facts which we are not in the habit of respecting very much or that we relegate to the company of things that are not facts at all i suppose that in stating them i shall somehow make myself responsible for them but that is just what i dont want to do i dont want to do anything more than give them as they were given to me  you wont be able to give them half as fully said minver if mrs ormond gave them to you  no wanhope said gravely and thats the pity of it for they ought to be given as fully as possible  go ahead rulledge commanded and do the best you can im not sure the psychologist thoughtfully said that i am quite satisfied to call ormonds experiences hallucinations there ought to be some other word that doesnt accuse his sanity in that degree for he apparently didnt show any other signs of an unsound mind  none that mrs ormond would call so minver suggested  well in his case i dont think she was such a bad judge wanhope returned she was a tolerably unbalanced person herself but she wasnt altogether disqualified for observing him as ive said before they had a pretty hot summer as the summer is apt to be in the housatonic valley but when it got along into september the weather was divine and they spent nearly the whole time out of doors driving over the hills they got an old horse from a native and they hunted out a rickety buggy from the carriagehouse and they went wherever the road led they went mostly at a walk and that suited the horse exactly as well as mrs ormond who had no faith in ormonds driving and wanted to go at a pace that would give her a chance to jump out safely if anything happened they put their hats in the front of the buggy and went about in their bare heads the country people got used to them and were not scandalized by their appearance though they were both getting a little gray and must have looked as if they were old enough to know better  they were not really old as age goes nowadays he was not more than fortytwo or three and she was still in the late thirties in fact they were  nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita  in that hour when life and the conceit of life is strongest and when it feels as if it might go on forever women are not very articulate about such things and it was probably ormond who put their feeling into words though she recognized at once that it was her feeling and shrank from it as if it were something wicked that they would be punished for so that one day when he said suddenly jenny i dont feel as if i could ever die she scolded him for it poor women said wanhope musingly they are not always cross when they scold it is often the expression of their anxieties their forebodings their sextimidities they are always in double the danger that men are and their nerves double that danger again who was that famous salonnièremme geoffrin was itthat marmontel says always scolded her friends when they were in trouble and came and scolded him when he was put into the bastille i suppose mrs ormond was never so tender of ormond as she was when she took it out of him for suggesting what she wildly felt herself and felt she should pay for feeling  wanhope had the effect of appealing to minver but the painter would not relent i dont know ive seen heror heard herin very devoted moments  at any rate wanhope resumed she says she scolded him and it did not do the least good she could not scold him out of that feeling which was all mixed up in her retrospect with the sense of the weather and the season the leaves just beginning to show the autumn the wild asters coming to crowd the goldenrod the crickets shrill in the grass and the birds silent in the trees the smell of the rowan in the meadows and the odor of the old logs and fresh chips in the woods she was not a woman to notice such things much but he talked of them all and made her notice them his nature took hold upon what we call nature and clung fondly to the lowly and familiar aspects of it once she said to him trembling for him i should think you would be afraid to take such a pleasure in those things and when he asked her why she couldnt or wouldnt tell him but he understood and he said ive never realized before that i was so much a part of them either i am going to have them forever or they are going to have me we shall not part for we are all members of the same body if it is the body of death we are members of that if it is the body of life we are members of that either i have never lived or else i am never going to die she said of course you are never going to die a spirit cant die but he told her he didnt mean that he was just as radiantly happy when they would get home from one of their drives and sit down to their supper which they had countryfashion instead of dinner and then when they would turn into their big lamplit parlor and sit down for a long evening with his books sometimes he read to her as she sewed but he read mostly to himself and he said he hadnt had such a bath of poetry since he was a boy sometimes in the splendid nights which were so clear that you could catch the silver glint of the gossamers in the thin air he would go out and walk up and down the long veranda once when he coaxed her out with him he took her under the arm and walked her up and down and he said isnt it like a ship the earth is like a ship and were sailing sailing oh i wonder where then he stopped with a sob and she was startled and asked him what the matter was but he couldnt tell her she was more frightened than ever at what seemed a break in his happiness she was troubled about his reading the bible so much especially the old testament but he told her he had never known before what majestic literature it was there were some turns or phrases in it that peculiarly took his fancy and seemed to feed it with inexhaustible suggestion the angel of the lord was one of these the idea of a divine messenger embodied and commissioned to intimate the creative will to the creature it was sublime it was ineffable he wondered that men had ever come to think in any other terms of the living law that we were under and that could much less conceivably operate like an insensate mechanism than it could reveal itself as a constant purpose he said he believed that in every great moral crisis in every ordeal of conscience a man was aware of standing in the presence of something sent to try him and test him and that this something was the angel of the lord  he went off that night saying to himself the angel of the lord the angel of the lord and when she lay a long time awake waiting for him to go to sleep she heard him saying it again in his room she thought he might be dreaming but when she went to him he had his lamp lighted and was lying with that rapt smile on his face which she was so afraid of she told him she was afraid and she wished he would not say such things and that made him laugh and he put his arms round her and laughed and laughed and said it was only a kind of swearing and she must cheer up he let her give him some trional to make him sleep and then she went off to her bed again but when they both woke late she heard him as he dressed repeating fragments of verse quoting quite without order as the poem drifted through his memory he told her at breakfast that it was a poem which longfellow had written to lowell upon the occasion of his wifes death and he wanted to get it and read it to her she said she did not see how he could let his mind run on such gloomy things but he protested he was not the least gloomy and that he supposed his recollection of the poem was a continuation of his thinking about the angel of the lord  while they were at table a tramp came up the drive under the window and looked in at them hungrily he was a very offensive tramp and quite took mrs ormonds appetite away but ormond would not send him round to the kitchen as she wanted he insisted upon taking him a plate and a cup of coffee out on the veranda himself when she expostulated with him he answered fantastically that the fellow might be an angel of the lord and he asked her if she remembered parnells poem of the hermit of course she didnt but he neednt get it for she didnt want to hear it and if he kept making her so nervous she should be sick herself he insisted upon telling her what the poem was and how the angel in it had made himself abhorrent to the hermit by throttling the babe of the good man who had housed and fed them and committing other atrocities till the hermit couldnt stand it any longer and the angel explained that he had done it all to prevent the greater harm that would have come if he had not killed and stolen in season ormond laughed at her disgust and said he was curious to see what a tramp would do that was treated with real hospitality he thought they had made a mistake in not asking this tramp in to breakfast with them then they might have stood a chance of being murdered in their beds to save them from mischief     vi   mrs ormond really lost her patience with him and felt better than she had for a long time by scolding him in good earnest she told him he was talking very blasphemously and when he urged that his morality was directly in line with parnells and parnell was an archbishop she was so vexed that she would not go to drive with him that morning though he apologized and humbled himself in every way he pleaded that it was such a beautiful day it must be the last they were going to have it was getting near the equinox and this must be a weatherbreeder she let him go off alone for he would not lose the drive and she watched him out of sight from her upper window with a heavy heart as soon as he was fairly gone she wanted to go after him and she was wild all the forenoon she could not stay indoors but kept walking up and down the piazza and looking for him and at times she went a bit up the road he had taken to meet him she had got to thinking of the tramp though the man had gone directly off down another road after he had his breakfast at last she heard the old creaking rattling buggy and as soon as she saw ormonds bare head and knew he was all right she ran up to her room and shut herself in but she couldnt hold out against him when he came to her door with an armful of wild flowers that he had gathered for her and boughs from some young maples that he had found all red in a swamp she showed herself so interested that he asked her to come with him after their midday dinner and see them and she said perhaps she would if he would promise not to keep talking about the things that made her so miserable he asked her what things and she answered that he knew well enough and he laughed and promised  she didnt believe he would keep his word but he did at first and he tried not to tease her in any way he tried to please her in the whims and fancies she had about going this way or that and when she decided not to look up his young maples with him because the first autumn leaves made her melancholy he submitted he put his arm across her shoulder as they drove through the woods and pulled her to him and called her poor old thing and accused her of being morbid he wanted her to tell him all there was in her mind but she could not she could only cry on his arm he asked her if it was something about him that troubled her and she could only say that she hated to see people so cheerful without reason that made him laugh and they were very gay after she had got her cry out but he grew serious again then her temper rose and she asked well what is it and he said at first oh nothing as people do when there is really something and presently he confessed that he was thinking about what she had said of his being cheerful without reason then as she said he talked so beautifully that she had to keep her patience with him though he was not keeping his word to her his talk as far as she was able to report it didnt amount to much more than this that in a world where death was people never could be cheerful with reason unless death was something altogether different from what people imagined after people came to their intellectual consciousness death was never wholly out of it and if they could be joyful with that black drop at the bottom of every cup it was proof positive that death was not what it seemed otherwise there was no logic in the scheme of being but it was a cruel fraud by the creator upon the creature a poor practical joke with the laugh all on one side he had got rid of his fear of it in that light which seemed to have come to him before the fear left him and he wanted her to see it in the same light and if he died before herbut there she stopped him and protested that it would kill her if she did not die first with no apparent sense even when she told me of her fatuity which must have amused poor ormond he said what he wanted to ask was that she would believe he had not been the least afraid to die and he wished her to remember this always because she knew how he always used to be afraid of dying then he really began to talk of other things and he led the way back to the times of their courtship and their early married days and their first journeys together and all their youngpeople friends and the simplehearted pleasure they used to take in society in teas and dinners and going to the theater he did not like to think how that pleasure had dropped out of their life and he did not know why they had let it and he was going to have it again when they went to town  they had thought of staying a long time in the country perhaps till after thanksgiving for they had become attached to their place but now they suddenly agreed to go back to new york at once she told me that as soon as they agreed she felt a tremendous longing to be gone that instant as if she must go to escape from something some calamity and she felt looking back that there was a prophetic quality in her eagerness  oh she was always so said minver when a thing was to be done she wanted it done like lightning no matter what the thing was  well very likely wanhope consented i never make much account of those retroactive forebodings at any rate she says she wanted him to turn about and drive home so that they could begin packing and when he demurred and began to tease as she called it she felt as if she should scream till he turned the old horse and took the back track she was wild to get home and kept hurrying him and wanting him to whip the horse but the old horse merely wagged his tail and declined to go faster than a walk and this was the only thing that enabled her to forgive herself afterward  why what had she done rulledge asked she would have been responsible for what happened according to her notion if she had had her way with the horse she would have felt that she had driven ormond to his doom  of course said minver she always found a hole to creep out of why couldnt she go back a little further and hold herself responsible through having made him turn round  poor woman said rulledge with a tenderness that made minver smile what was it that did happen  wanhope examined his cup for some dregs of coffee and then put it down with an air of resignation i offered to touch the bell but no dont he said im better without it and he went on there was a lonely piece of woods that they had to drive through before they struck the avenue leading to their house which was on a cheerful upland overlooking the river and when they had got about halfway through this woods the tramp whom ormond had fed in the morning slipped out of a thicket on the hillside above them and crossed the road in front of them and slipped out of sight among the trees on the slope below ormond stopped the horse and turned to his wife with a strange kind of whisper did you see it he asked and she answered yes and bade him drive on he did so slowly looking back round the side of the buggy till a turn of the road hid the place where the tramp had crossed their track she could not speak she says till they came in sight of their house then her heart gave a great bound and she broke out on him blaming him for having encouraged the tramp to lurk about as he must have done all day by his foolish sentimentality in taking his breakfast out to him he saw that you were a delicate person and now tonight he will be coming round and she says ormond kept looking at her while she talked as if he did not know what she was saying and all at once she glanced down at their feet and discovered that her hat was gone  that she owned made her frantic and she blazed out at him again and accused him of having lost her hat by stopping to look at that worthless fellow and then starting up the horse so suddenly that it had rolled out he usually gave her as good as she sent when she let herself go in that way and she told me she would have been glad if he had done it now but he only looked at her in a kind of daze and when he understood at last he bade her get out and go into the housethey were almost at the doorand he would go back and find her hat himself indeed youll do nothing of the kind she said she told him i shall go back with you or youll be hunting up that precious vagabond and bringing him home to supper ormond said all right with a kind of dreamy passivity and he turned the old horse again and they drove slowly back looking for the hat in the road right and left she had not noticed before that it was getting late and perhaps it was not so late as it seemed when they got into that lonely piece of woods again and the veils of shadow began to drop round them as if they were something falling from the trees she said they found the hat easily enough at the point where it must have rolled out of the buggy and he got down and picked it up she kept scolding him but he did not seem to hear her he stood dangling the hat by its ribbons from his right hand while he rested his left on the dashboard and lookinglooking down into the wooded slope where the tramp had disappeared a cold chill went over her and she stopped her scolding oh jim she said do you see something what do you see he flung the hat from him and ran plunging down the hillsideshe covered up her face when she told me and said she should always see him runningtill the dusk among the trees hid him she ran after him and she heard him calling calling joyfully yes im coming and she thought he was calling back to her but the rush of his feet kept getting farther and then he seemed to stop with a sound like falling he couldnt have been much ahead of her for it was only a moment till she stood on the edge of a boulder in the woods looking over and there at the bottom ormond was lying with his face turned under him as she expressed it and the tramp with a heavy stick in his hand was standing by him stooping over him and staring at him she began to scream and it seemed to her that she flew down from the brink of the rock and caught the tramp and clung to him while she kept screaming murder the man didnt try to get away he only said over and over i didnt touch him lady i didnt touch him it all happened simultaneously like events in a dream and while there was nobody there but herself and the tramp and ormond lying between them there were some people that must have heard her from the road and come down to her they were neighborfolk that knew her and ormond and they naturally laid hold of the tramp but he didnt try to escape he helped them gather poor ormond up and he went back to the house with them and staid while one of them ran for the doctor the doctor could only tell them that ormond was dead and that his neck must have been broken by his fall over the rock one of the neighbors went to look at the place the next morning and found one of the roots of a young tree growing on the rock torn out as if ormond had caught his foot in it and that had probably made his fall a headlong dive the tramp knew nothing but that he heard shouting and running and got up from the foot of the rock where he was going to pass the night when something came flying through the air and struck at his feet then it scarcely stirred and the next thing he said the lady was onto him screeching and tearing he piteously protested his innocence which was apparent enough at the inquest and before for that matter he said ormond was about the only man that ever treated him white and mrs ormond was remorseful for having let him get away before she could tell him that she didnt blame him and ask him to forgive her     vii   wanhope desisted with a provisional air and rulledge went and got himself a sandwich from the lunchtable  well upon my word said minver i thought you had dined rulledge  rulledge came back munching and said to wanhope as he settled himself in his chair again well go on  why thats all  the psychologist was silent with rulledge staring indignantly at him  i suppose mrs ormond had her theory i ventured  oh yessuch as it was said wanhope it was her beliefher religionthat ormond had seen death in person or personified or the angel of it and that the sight was something beautiful and not terrible she thought that she should see death too in the same way as a messenger i dont know that it was such a bad theory he added impartially  not said minver if you suppose that ormond was off his nut but in regard to the whole matter there is always a question of how much truth there was in what she said about it  of course the psychologist admitted that is a question which must be considered the question of testimony in such matters is the difficult thing you might often believe in supernatural occurrences if it were not for the witnesses it is very interesting he pursued with his scientific smile to note how corrupting anything supernatural or mystical is such things seem mostly to happen either in the privity of people who are born liars or else they deprave the spectator so through his spiritual vanity or his love of the marvelous that you cant believe a word he says  they are as bad as horses on human morals said minver not that i think it ever needed the coming of a ghost to invalidate any statement of mrs ormonds rulledge rose and went away growling something partially audible to the disadvantage of minvers wit and the painter laughed after him he really believes it  wanhopes mind seemed to be shifted from mrs ormond to her convert whom he followed with his tolerant eyes nothing in all this sort of inquiry is so impossible to predicate as the effect of any given instance upon a given mind it would be very interesting  excuse me said minver theres whitley i must speak to him  he went away leaving me alone with the psychologist  and what is your own conclusion in this instance i asked  why i havent formulated it yet                                            though one rose from the dead     i   you are very welcome to the alderling incident my dear acton if you think you can do anything with it and i will give it as circumstantially as possible the thing has its limitations i should think for the fictionist chiefly in a sort of roundedness which leaves little play to the imagination it seems to me that it would be more to your purpose if it were less pat in its catastrophe but you are a better judge of all that than i am and i will put the facts in your hands and keep my own hands off so far as any plastic use of the material is concerned  the first i knew of the peculiar alderling situation was shortly after william jamess will to believe came out i had been telling the alderlings about it for they had not seen it and i noticed that from time to time they looked significantly at each other when i had got through he gave a little laugh and she said oh you may laugh and then i made bold to ask what is it  marion can tell you he said he motioned towards the coffeepot and asked more i shook my head and he said come out and let us see what the maritime interests have been doing for us pipe or cigar i chose cigarettes and he brought the box off the table stopping on his way to the veranda and taking his pipe and tobaccopouch from the hall mantel  mrs alderling had got to the veranda before us and done things to the chairs and cushions and was leaning against one of the slender fluted pine columns like some rich blond caryatid just off duty with the blue of her dress and the red of her hair showing deliciously against the background of white housewall he and she were an astonishing and satisfying contrast in the midst of your amazement you felt the divine propriety of a woman like her wanting just such a wiry smokycomplexioned blackbrowed blackbearded baldheaded little man as he was before he sat down where she was going to put him he stood stoopingly and frowned at the waters of the cove lifting from the foot of the lawn that sloped to it before the house three lumbermen two goodishsized yachts a dozen slooprigged boats not so bad about the usual number that come loafing in to spend the night you ought to see them when it threatens to breeze up then theyre here in flocks go on marion  he gave a soft groan of comfort as he settled in his chair and began pulling at his short black pipe and she let her eyes dwell on him in a rapture that curiously interested me people in love are rarely interestingthat is fleshandblood people of course i know that lovers are the life of fiction and that a story of any kind can scarcely hold the reader without them the loveinterest as they call it is also supposed to be essential to the drama and friends of mine who have tried to foist their plays upon managers have been overthrown by the objection that the loveinterest is not strong enough in what they have done yet lovers in real life are so far as i have observed them bores they are confessed to be disgusting before or after marriage when they let their fondness appear but even when they try to hide it they are tiresome character goes down before passion in them nature is reduced to propensity then how is it that the novelist manages to keep these and to give us nature and character while seeming to offer nothing but propensity and passion perhaps he does not give them perhaps what he does is to hypnotize us so that we each of us identify ourselves with the lovers and add our own natures and characters to the single principle that animates them the reason we like that we endure to read about them may be that they are ourselves rendered objective in an instant of intense vitality without the least trouble or risk to us but if we have them there before us in the tiresome reality they exclude us from their pleasure in each other and stop up the perspective of our happiness with their hulking personalities bare of all the iridescence of potentiality which we could have cast about them something of this iridescence may cling to unmarried lovers in spite of themselves but wedded bliss is a sheer offence  i do not know why it was not an offence in the case of the alderlings unless it was because they both in their different ways saw the joke of the thing at any rate i found that in their charm for each other they had somehow not ceased to be amusing for me and i waited confidently for the answer she would make to his whimsically abrupt bidding but she did not answer very promptly even when he had added wanhope here is scenting something psychological in the reason of my laughing at you instead of accepting the plain inference in the case  what is the plain inference i asked partly to fill up mrs alderlings continued silence  when a man laughs at a woman for no apparent reason it is because he is amused at her being afraid of him when he is so much more afraid of her or puzzled by him when she is such an incomparable riddle herself or caring for him when he knows he is not worth his salt  you dont expect to put me off with that sort of thing i said  well then go on marion alderling repeated     ii   mrs alderling stood looking at him not me with a smile hovering about the corners of her mouth which when it decided not to alight anywhere scarcely left her aspect graver for its flitting she said at last in her slow deepthroated voice i guess i will let you tell him  oh ill tell him fast enough said alderling nursing his knee and bringing it well up toward his chin between his clasped hands marion has always had the notion that i should live again if i believed i should and that as i dont believe i shall i am not going to the joke of it is and he began to splutter laughter round the stem of his pipe shes as much of an agnostic as i am she doesnt believe she is going to live again either  mrs alderling said i dont care for it in my case that struck me as rather touching but i had no right to enter uninvited into the intimacy of her meaning and i said looking as little at her as i need arent you both rather belated  you mean that protoplasm has gone out he chuckled  not exactly i answered but you know that a great many things are allowed now that were once forbidden to the true disbeliever  you mean that we may trust in the promises as they used to be called and still keep the unfaith  something like that  alderling took his pipe out apparently to give his whole face to the pleasure of teasing his wife  thatll be a great comfort to marion he said and he threw back his head and laughed  she smiled faintly vaguely tolerantly as if she enjoyed his pleasure in teasing her  where have you been i asked that you dont know the changed attitude in these matters  well here for the last three years we tried it the first winter after we came and found it was not so bad and we simply stayed on but i havent really looked into the question since i gave the conundrum up twenty years ago on what was then the best authority marion doesnt complain she knew what i was when she married me she was another we were neither of us very bigoted disbelievers we should not have burned anybody at the stake for saying that we had souls  alderling put back his pipe and cackled round it taking his knee between his hands again  you know she explained more in my direction than to me that i had none to begin with but alderling had his people believed in the future life  thats what they said alderling crowed and marion has always thought that if she had believed that way she could have kept me up to it and so when i died i should have lived again it is perfectly logical though it isnt capable of a practical demonstration if marion had come of a believing family she could have brought me back into the fold her great mistake was in being brought up by an uncle who denied that he was living here even the poor girl could not do a thing when it came to the life hereafter  the smile now came hovering back and alighted at a corner of mrs alderlings mouth making it look oddly enough rather rueful it didnt matter about me i thought it a pity that alderlings talent should stop here  did you ever know anything like that he cried perfectly willing to thrust me out into a cold otherworld and leave me to struggle on without her when i had got used to her looking after me now im not so selfish as that i shouldnt want to have marion living on through all eternity if i wasnt with her it would be too lonely for her  he looked up at her with his dancing eyes and she put her hand down over his shoulder into the hand that he lifted to meet it in a way that would have made me sick in some people but in her the action was so casual so absent that it did not affect me disagreeably  do you mean that you havent been away since you came here three years ago i asked  we ran up to the theatre once in boston last winter but it bored us to the limit alderling poked his knifeblade into the bowl of his pipe as he spoke having freed his hand for the purpose while mrs alderling leaned back against the slim column again he said gravely it was a great thing for marion though in view of the railroad accident that didnt happen she convinced herself that her sole ambition was that we should die together then whether we found ourselves alive or not we should be company for each other shes got it arranged with the thunderstorms so that one bolt will do for us both and she never lets me go out on the water alone for fear i shall watch my chance and get drowned without her  i did not trouble myself to make out how much of this was mocking and as there was no active participation in the joke expected of me i kept on the safe side of laughing no wonder youve been able to do such a lot of pictures i said but i should have thought you might have found it dulli mean dull togetherat odd times  dull he shouted its stupendously dull especially when our country neighbors come in to liven us up weve got neighbors here that can stay longer in half an hour than most people can in a week we get tired of each other at times but after a call from the people in the next house we return with rapture to our delusion that we are interesting  and you never i ventured making my jocosity as ironical as possible wear upon each other  horribly said alderling and his wife smiled contentedly behind him we havent a whole set of china in the house from exchanging it across the table and i havent made a study of marionyou must have noticed how many marions there were that she hasnt thrown at my head especially the madonnas she likes to throw the madonnas at me  i ventured still farther addressing myself to mrs alderling does he keep it up all the timethis blague  pretty much she answered passively with entire acquiescence in the fact if it were the fact or the joke if it were the joke  but i didnt see anything of yours mrs alderling i said she had had her talent as a girl and some people preferred it to her husbandsbut there was no effect of it anywhere in the house  the housekeeping is enough she answered with her tranquil smile  there was nothing in her smile that was leading and i did not push my inquiry especially as alderling did not seem disposed to assist well i said i suppose you will forgive to science my feeling that your situation is most suggestive  oh dont mind us said alderling  i wont thank you i answered why its equal to being cast away together on an uninhabited island  quite he assented  there cant i went on be a corner of your minds that you havent mutually explored you must know each other i cast about for the word and added abruptly by heart  i dont suppose he meant anything pretty said alderling with a look up over his shoulder at his wife and then he said to me we do and there are some very curious things i could tell you if marion would ever let me get in a word  do let him mrs alderling i entreated humoring his joke at her silence  she smiled and softly shrugged and then sighed  i could make your flesh creep he went on or i could if you were not a psychologist i assure you that we are quite weird at times  as how  oh just knowing what the other is thinking at a given moment and saying it there are times when marions thinking is such a nuisance to me that i have to yell down to her from my loft to stop it the racket it makes breaks me all up its a relief to have her talk and i try to make her when shes posing just to escape the din of her thinking then the willing we experimented with it after we had first noticed it but we dont any more its too dead easy  what do you mean by the willing i asked  oh just wishing one that the other was there and there he or she is  is he trying to work me mrs alderling i appealed to her and she answered from her calm  it is very unaccountable  then you really mean it why cant you give me an illustration  why you know said alderling more seriously than he had yet spoken i dont believe those things if they are real can ever be got to show off thats the reason why your quests in the occult are mainly such rubbish as far as the evidences are concerned if marion and i tried to give you an illustration as you call it the occult would snub us but is there anything so very strange about it the wonder is that a man and wife ever fail of knowing each what the other is thinking they pervade each others minds if they are really married and they are so present with each other that the tacit wish should be the same as a call marion and i are only an intensified instance of what may be done by living together there is something though that is rather queer but it belongs to psychomancy rather than psychology as i understand it  ah i said what is that queer something  being visibly present when absent it has not happened often but it has happened that i have seen marion in my loft when she was really somewhere else and not when i had willed her or wished her to be there  now really i said i must ask you for an instance  you want to heap up facts lombroso fashion well this is as good as most of lombrosos facts or better i went up one morning last winter to work at a study of a madonna from marion directly after breakfast and left her below in the diningroom putting away the breakfast things she has to do that occasionally between the local helps who are all we can get in the winter she professes to like it but you never can tell from what a woman says she has to do it anyway it is hard to convey a notion of the serene impersonal acquiescence of mrs alderling in taking this talk of her i was banging away at it when i knew she was behind me looking over my shoulder rather more stormily than she usually does usually she is a dead calm i glanced up and saw the calm succeed the storm i kept on and after awhile i was aware of hearing her step on the stairs  alderling stopped and smoked definitively as if that were the end  well i said after waiting a while i dont exactly get the unique value of the incident  oh he said as if he had accidentally forgotten the detail the steps were coming up  yes  she opened the door which she had omitted to do before and when she came in she denied having been there already she owned that she had been hurrying through her work and thinking of mine so as to make me do something or undo something to it and then all at once she lost her impatience and came up at her leisure i dont exactly like to tell what she wanted  he began to laugh provokingly and she said tranquilly i dont mind your telling mr wanhope  well then strictly in the interest of psychomancy i will confide that she had found some traces of a model that i used to paint my madonnas from before we were married in that picture she had slept on her suspicion and then when she could not stand it any longer she had come up in the spirit to say that she was not going to be mixed up in a madonna with any such minx the words are mine but the meaning was marions when she found me taking the minx out she went quietly back to washing her dishes and then returned in the body to give me a sitting     iii   we were silent a moment till i asked is this true mrs alderling  about she said i dont remember the storm exactly  well i dont see why you bother to remain in the body at all i remarked  we havent arranged just how to leave it together said alderling marion here if i managed to get off first would have no means of knowing whether her theory of the effect of my unbelief on my future was right or not and if she gave me the slip she would always be sorry that she had not stayed here to convert me  why dont you agree that if either of you lives again he or she shall make some sign to let the other know i suggested well that has been tried so often and has it ever worked its open to the question whether the dead do not fail to show up because they are forbidden to communicate with the living and you are just where you were as to the main point no i dont see any way out of it  mrs alderling went into the house and came out with a book in her hand and her fingers in it at two places it was that impressive collection of christs words from the new testament called the great discourse she put the book before me first at one place and then at another and i read whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die and then nay but except ye repent ye shall all likewise perish she did not say anything in showing me these passages and i found something in her action touchingly childlike and elemental as well as curiously heathenish it was as if some poor pagan had brought me his fetish to test its effect upon me yes i said those are things that we hardly know what to do with in our philosophy they seem to be said as with authority and yet somehow we cannot admit their validity in a philosophical inquiry as to a future life arent they generally taken to mean that we shall be unhappy or happy hereafter rather than that we shall be or not be at all and what is believing is it the mere act of acknowledgement or is it something more vital which expresses itself in conduct  she did not try to say in fact she did not answer at all whatever point was in her mind she did not or could not debate it i perceived in a manner that her life was so largely subliminal that if she had tried she could not have met my question any more than if she had not had the gift of speech at all but in her inarticulate fashion she had exposed to me a state of mind which i was hardly withheld by the decencies from exploring you know i said that psychology almost begins by rejecting the authority of these sayings and that while we no longer deny anything we cannot allow anything merely because it has been strongly affirmed supposing that there is a life after this how can it be denied to one and bestowed upon another because one has assented to a certain supernatural claim and another has refused to do so that does not seem reasonable it does not seem right why should you base your conclusion as to that life upon a promise and a menace which may not really refer to it in the sense which they seem to have  isnt it all there is she asked and alderling burst into his laugh  im afraid shes got you there wanhope when it comes to polemics theres nothing like the passive obstruction of mrs alderling marion might never have been an early christian herselfi think shes an inexpugnable paganbut she would have gone round making it awfully uncomfortable for the other unbelievers  you know she said to him and i never could decide how much she was in earnest that i cant believe till you do i couldnt take the risk of keeping on without you  alderling followed her indoors where she now went to put the book away with the mock addressed to me did you ever know such a stubborn woman     iv   one conclusion from my observation of the alderlings during the week i spent with them was that it is bad for a husband and wife to be constantly and unreservedly together not because they grow tired of each other but because they grow more intensely interested in each other children when they come serve the purpose of separating the parents they seem to unite them in one care but they divide them in their employments at least in the normally constituted family if they are rich and can throw the care of the children upon servants then they cannot enjoy the relief from each other that children bring to the mother who nurtures and teaches them and to the father who must work for them harder than before the alderlings were not rich enough to have been freed from the wholesome responsibilities of parentage but they were childless and so they were not detached from the perpetual thought of each other if they had only had different tastes it might have been better but they were both artists she not less than he though she no longer painted when their common thoughts were not centred upon each others being they were centred on his work which viciously enough was the constant reproduction of her visible personality i could always see them studying each other he with an eye to her beauty she with an eye to his power  he was every now and then saying to her hold on marion and staying her in some pose or movement while he made mental note of it and i was conscious of her preying upon his inmost thoughts and following him into the recesses of his reveries where it is best for a man to be alone even if he is sometimes a beast there she was not like those wives who ask their husbands when they do not happen to be talking what are you thinking about and i put this to her credit till i realized that she had no need to ask for she knew already now and then i saw him get up and shake himself restively but i am bound to say in her behalf that her pursuit of him seemed quite involuntary and that she enjoyed it no more than he did twenty times i was on the point of asking why dont you people go in for a good long separation is there nothing to call you to europe alderling havent you got a mother or sister or some one that you could visit mrs alderling it would do you both a world of good  but it happened oddly enough that the alderlings were as kinless as they were childless and if he had gone to europe he would have taken her with him and prolonged their seclusion by the isolation in which people necessarily live in a foreign country i found i was the only acquaintance who had visited them during the years of their retirement on the coast where they had stayed partly through his inertia and partly from his superstition that he could paint better away from the ordinary associations and incentives and they ceased before i left to get the good they might of my visit because they made me a part of their intimacy instead of making themselves part of my strangeness  after a day or two their queer experiences began to resume themselves unabashed by my presence these were mostly such as they had already more than hinted to me the thoughttransferences and the unconscious hypnotic suggestions which they made to each other there was more novelty in the last than the first if i could trust them and they did not seem to wish to exploit their mysteries for the effect on me they were with each other because one or the other had willed it she would say if we were sitting together without him i think rupert wants me ill be back in a moment and he if she were not by for some time would get up with excuse me i must go to marion shes calling me  i had to take a great deal of this on faith in fact none of it was susceptible of proof but i have not been able since to experience all the skepticism which usually replaces the impression left by sympathy with such supposed occurrences the thing was not quite what we call uncanny the people were so honest both of them that the morbid character of like situations was wanting the events if they could be called so were not invited i was quite sure and they were varied by such diversions as we had in reach i went blueberrying with mrs alderling in the morning after she had got her breakfast dishes put away in order that we might have something for dessert at our midday dinner and i went fishing off the old stone crib with alderling in the afternoon so that we might have cunners for supper the farmerfolks and fisherfolks seemed to know them and to be on tolerant terms with them though it was plain that they still considered them probational in their fellowcitizenship i do not think they were liked the less because they did not assume to be of the local sort but let their difference stand if it would there was nothing countrified in her dress which was frankly conventional the short walkingskirt had as sharp a slant in front as her dinnergown would have had and he wore his knickerbockersit was then the nowfaded hour of knickerbockerswith an air of going out golfing in the suburbs they stood on ceremony in addressing the natives who might have been jim or liza to each other but were always mr donald or mrs moody with the alderlings they said they would not like being called by their first names themselves and they did not see why they should take that freedom with others neither by nature nor by nurture were they out of the ordinary in their ideals and it was by a sort of accident that they were so different in their realities she had stayed on with him through the first winter in the place they had taken for the summer because she wished to be with him rather than because she wished to be there and he had stayed because he had not just found the moment to break away though afterwards he pretended a reason for staying they had no more voluntarily cultivated the natural than the supernatural he kindled the fire for her and she made the coffee for him not because they preferred but because they must and they had arrived at their common ground in the occult by virtue of being alone together and not by seeking the solitude for the experiment which the solitude promoted mrs alderling did not talk less nor he more when either was alone with me than when we were all together perhaps he was more silent and she not quite so much she was making up for him in his absence as he was for her in her presence but they were always hospitable and attentive hosts and though under the peculiar circumstances of mrs alderlings having to do the housework i necessarily had to do a good many things for myself there were certain little graces which were never wanting from her hands my curtains were always carefully drawn and my coverlet triangularly opened so that i did not have to pull it down myself there was a freshly trimmed lamp on the stand at my bedhead and a book and papercutter put there with a decanter of whiskey and a glass of water i note these things to you because they are touches which help remove the sense of anything intentional in the occultism of the alderlings  i do not know whether i shall be able to impart the feeling of an obscure pathos in the case of mrs alderling which i certainly did not experience in alderlings temperamentally he was less fitted to undergo the rigors of their seclusion than she was in his liking to talk he needed an audience and a variety of listening and she in her somewhat feline calm could not have been troubled by any such need you can be silent to yourself but you cannot very well be loquacious without danger of having the devil for a listener if the old saying is true yet still i felt a keener poignancy in her sequestration her beauty had even greater claim to regard than his eloquence she was a woman who could have commanded a whole roomful with it and no one would have wanted a word from her she could only have been entirely herself in society where and in spite of everything that can be said against it we can each if we will be more natural than out of it the reason that most of us are not natural in it is that we want to play parts for which we are more or less unfit and marion alderling never wished to play a part i was sure it would have sufficed her to be herself wherever she was and the more people there were by the more easily she could have been herself  i am not able to say now how much of all this is observation of previous facts and how much speculation based upon subsequent occurrences at the best i can only let it stand for characterization in the same interest i will add a fact in relation to mrs alderling which ought to have its weight against any undue appeal i have been making in her behalf without in the least blaming her i will say that i think that mrs alderling ate too much she must have had naturally a strong appetite which her active life sharpened and its indulgence formed a sort of refuge from the pressure of the intense solitude in which she lived and which was all the more a solitude because it was solitude à deux i noticed that beyond the habit of cooks she partook of the dishes she had prepared and that after alderling and i had finished dinner and he was impatient to get at his pipe she remained prolonging her dessert one night when he and i came in from the veranda she was standing at the sideboard bent over a saucer of something and she made me think of a large tortoiseshell cat which has got at the cream i expected in my nerves to hear her lap and my expectation was heightened by the soft purring laugh with which she owned that she was hungry and those berries were so nice  at the risk of giving the effect of something sensuous even sensual in her i find myself insisting upon this detail which did not lessen her peculiar charm as far as the mystical quality of the situation was concerned i fancy your finding that rather heightened by her innocent gourmandise you must have noticed how inextricably for this life at least the spiritual is trammeled in the material how personal character and ancestral propensity seem to flow side by side in the same individual without necessarily affecting each other on the moral side mrs alderling was no more to be censured for the refuge which her nerves sought from the situation in overeating than alderling for the smoking in which he escaped from the pressure they both felt from one another and she was not less fitted than he for their joint experience     v   i do not suppose it was with the notion of keeping her weight down that mrs alderling rowed a good deal on the cove before the cottage but she had a boat which she managed very well and which she was out in pretty much the whole time when she was not cooking or eating or sleeping or roaming the berrypastures with me or sitting to alderling for his madonnas he did not care for the water himself he said he knew every inch of that cove and was tired of it but he rather liked his wifes going and they may both have had an unconscious relief from each other in the absences which her excursions promoted she swam as well as she rowed and often we saw her going down waterproofed to the shore where we presently perceived her pulling off in her bathingdress well out in the cove she had the habit of plunging overboard and after a good swim she rowed back and then discreetly waterproofed again she climbed the lawn back to the house now and then she took me out in her boat but so far as i remember alderling never went with her once i ventured to ask him if he never felt anxious about her he said no he should not have been afraid to go with her and she could take better care of herself than he could besides by means of their telepathy they were in constant communion and he could make her feel at any sort of chance that he did not wish her to take it and she would not this was the only occasion when he treated their peculiar psychomancy boastfully and the only occasion when i felt a distinct misgiving of his sincerity  the day before i left mrs alderling went down about eleven in the morning to her boat and rowed out into the cove she rowed far toward the other shore whither following her with my eyes from alderlings window i saw its ridge blotted out by a long low cloud it was straight and level as a wall and looked almost as dense and i called alderling  oh that fog wont come in before afternoon he said we usually get it about four oclock but even if it does he added dreamily marion can manage id trust her anywhere in this cove in any kind of weather  he went back to his work and painted away for five or six minutes then he asked me still at the window whats that fog doing now  well i dont know i answered i should say it was making in  do you see marion  yes she seems to be taking her bath  again he painted a while before he asked has she had her dip  shes getting back into her boat  all right said alderling in a tone of relief shes good to beat any fog in these parts ashore i wish you would come and look at this a minute  i went and we lost ourselves for a time in our criticism of the picture he was harder on it than i was he allowed cest un bon portrait as the french used to say of a faithful landscape though i believe now the portrait cant be too good for them i cant say about landscape but in a madonna i feel that there can be too much marion not for me of course but for the ideal which i suppose we are bound to respect marion is not spiritual but i would not have her less of the earth earthy for all the angels that ever spread themselves in strong level flight  i recognized the words from the blessed damozel and i made bold to be so personal as to say if her hair were a little redder than the color of ripe corn one might almost feel that the blessed damozel had been painted from mrs alderling its the lingering earthiness in her that makes the damozel so divine  yes that was a great conception i wonder none of the fellows do that kind of thing now  i laughed and said well so few of them have had the advantage of seeing mrs alderling and besides rosettis dont happen every day  it was the period too i always tell her that she belongs among the later eighteen sixties but she insists that she wasnt even born then marion is tremendously singleminded  she has her mind all on you  he looked askance at me youve noticed  ive noticed that your mind is all on her  not half as much he protested fervidly i dont think its good for her though of course i like it that is in a way sometimes its rather too he suddenly flung his brush from him and started up with a loudly shouted yes yes im coming and hurled himself out of the garret which he used for his studio and cleared the stairs with two bounds  by the time i reached the outer door of the cottage he was a dark blur in the white blur of the fog which had swallowed up the cove and was rising round the housewalls from the grass i heard him shouting marion and a faint mellow answer far out in the cove hello and then  where are you and her answer here i heard him jump into a boat and the thump of the oars in the rowlocks and then the rapid beat of the oars while he shouted keep calling and she answered  i will and called hello hello hello  i made my mental comment that this time their mystical means of communication was somehow not working but after her last hello no sound broke the white silence of the fog except the throb of alderlings oars she was evidently resting on hers lest she should baffle his attempts to find her by trying to find him  i suppose ten minutes or so had passed when the dense air brought me the sound of low laughing that was also like the sound of low sobbing and then i knew that they had met somewhere in the blind space i began to hear rowing again but only as of one boat and suddenly out of the mist almost at my feet alderlings boat shot up on the shelving beach and his wife leaped ashore from it and ran past me up the lawn while he pulled her boat out on the gravel she must have been trailing it from the stern of his     vi   i was abroad when mrs alderling died but i heard that it was from a typhoid fever which she had contracted from the water in their well as was supposed the watersupply all along that coast is scanty and that summer most of the wells were dry and quite a plague of typhoid raged among the people from drinking the dregs the fever might have gone the worse with her because of her overfed robustness at any rate it went badly enough  i first heard of her death from minver at the club and i heard with still greater astonishment that alderling was down there alone where she had died minver said that somebody ought to go down and look after the poor old fellow but nobody seemed to feel it exactly his office certainly i did not feel it mine and i thought it rather a hardship when a few days after i found a letter from alderling at the club quite piteously beseeching me to come to him he had read of my arrival home in a stray new york paper and he was firing his letter he said at the club with one chance in a thousand of hitting me with it rulledge was by when i read it and he decided with that unsparing activity of his where other people are concerned that i must go i certainly could not resist such an appeal as that he had a vague impression he said of something weird in the situation down there and i ought to go and pull alderling out of it besides i might find my account in it as a psychologist i hesitated a day out of selfrespect or selfassertion and then the weather coming on suddenly hot in the beginning of september i went  of course i had meant to go all along but i was not so glad when i arrived as i might have been if alderling had given me a little warmer welcome his mood had changed since writing to me and the strongest feeling he showed at seeing me was what affected me very like a cold surprise  if i had broken in on a solitude in that place before i was now the intruder upon a desolation alderling was living absolutely alone except for the occasional presence of a neighboring widowall the middleaged women there are widows with dim or dimmer memories of husbands lost off the banks or elsewhere at seawho came in to get his meals and make his bed and then had instructions to leave it was in one of her prevailing absences that i arrived with my bag and i had to hammer a long time with the knocker on the open door before alderling came clacking down the stairs in his slippers from the top of the house and gave me his somewhat defiant greeting i could almost have said that he did not recognize me at the first bleared glance and his inability when he realized who it was to make me feel at home encouraged me to take the affair into my own hands  he looked frightfully altered but perhaps it was the shaggy beard that he had let grow over his poor lean muzzle that mainly made the difference his clothes hung gauntly upon him and he had a weakkneed stoop his coat sleeves were tattered at the wrists and one of them showed the white lining at the elbow i simply shuddered at his shirt  will you smoke he asked huskily almost at the first word and with an effect of bewilderment in his hospitality that almost made me shed tears  well not just yet alderling i said shall i go to my old room  go anywhere he answered and he let me carry my bag to the chamber where i had slept before  it was quite as his wife would have arranged it even to the detail of a triangular portion of the bedding turned down as she used to do it for me the place was well aired and dusted and gave me the sense of being as immaculately clean and fresh as alderling was not he sat down in a chair by the window and he remained while i laid out my things and made my brief toilet unabashed by those incidents for which i did not feel it necessary to banish him if he liked staying  we had supper byandby a very wellcooked meal of fried fresh cod and potatoes with those belated blackberries which grow so sweet when they hang long on the canes into september there was a third plate laid and i expected that when the housekeeper had put the dishes on the table she would sit down with us as the countryfashion still is but she did not reappear till she came in with the dessert and coffee alderling ate hungrily and much more than i had remembered his doing but perhaps i formerly had the impression of mrs alderlings fine appetite so strongly in mind that i had failed to note his certainly however there was a difference in one sort which i could not be mistaken in and that was in his not talking her mantle of silence had fallen upon him and whereas he used hardly to give me a chance in the conversation he now let me do all of it he scarcely answered my questions and he asked none of his own but i saw that he liked being talked to and i did my best shying off from his sorrow as people foolishly do and speaking banalities about my trip to europe and the psychological congress in geneva and the fellows at the club and heaven knows what rot else  he listened but i do not know whether he heard much of my clack and i got very tired of it myself at last when i had finished my blackberries he asked mechanically in an echo of my former visit with a repetition of his gesture towards the coffeepot more i shook my head and then he led the way out to the veranda stopping to get his pipe and tobacco from the mantel on the way but when we sat down in the early falling september twilight outside he did not light his pipe letting me smoke my cigarette alone  are you off your tobacco i asked  i dont smoke he answered but he did not explain why and i did not feel authorized to ask  the talk went on as lopsidedly as before and i began to get sleepy i made bold to yawn but alderling did not mind that and then i made bold to say that i thought i would go to bed he followed me indoors saying that he would go to bed too the hall was lighted from a hanginglamp and two clearburning handlamps which the widow had put for us on a small table she had evidently gone home and left us to ourselves he took one lamp and i the other and he started up stairs before me if he were not coming down again he meant to let the hanginglamp burn and i had nothing to say about that but i suggested concerning the wideopen door behind me shall i close the door alderling and he answered without looking round i dont shut it  he led the way into my room and he sat down as when i had come and absently watched my processes of getting into bed there was something droll and yet miserable in his behavior at first i thought he might be staying merely for the comfort of a human presence and again i thought he might be afraid for i felt a little creepy myself for no assignable reason except that absence which he must have been incomparably more sensible of than i from certain ineffectual movements that he made and from certain preliminary noises in his throat which ended in nothing i decided that he wished to say something to me tell me something and could not but i was selfishly sleepy and it seemed to me that anything he had on his mind would keep there till morning at least and that if he got it off on mine now it might give me a night of wakeful speculation so when i got into bed and pulled the sheet up under my chin i said well i dont want to turn you out old fellow  he stared and answered oh and went without other words carrying his lamp with him and moving with a weakkneed shuffle like a very old man  he was going to leave the door open behind him but i called out i wish youd shut me in alderling and after a hesitation he came back and closed the door     vii   we breakfasted as silently on his part as we had supped but when we had finished and i was wondering what he was going to let me do with myself and on the whole what the deuce i had come for he said in the longest speech i had yet had from him wouldnt you like to come up and see what ive been doing  i said i should like it immensely and he led the way up stairs as far as his attic studio the door of that like the other doors in the house stood open and i got the emotion which the interior gave me full force at the first glance the place was so startlingly alive with that dead woman on a score of canvases in the character in which he had always painted her that i could scarcely keep from calling out but i went about pretending to examine the several madonnas and speaking rubbish about them while he stood stoopingly in the midst of them like the little withered old man he looked when i had emptied myself of my chaff i perceived that the time had come  i glanced about for a seat and was going to take that in which mrs alderling used to pose for him but he called out with sudden sharpness not that and without appearing to notice i found a box which i inverted and sat down on  tell me about your wife alderling i said and he answered with a sort of scream i wanted you to ask me why didnt you ask me before what did you suppose i got you here for  with that he shrank down a miserable heap in his own chair and bowed his hapless head and cried it was more affecting than any notion i can give you of it and i could only wait patiently for his grief to wash itself out in one of those paroxysms which come to bereavement and leave it somehow a little comforted when they pass  i was waiting for the stupid reasons you will imagine to let you speak first i said but here in her presence i couldnt hold in any longer  he asked with strange eagerness you noticed that  i chose to feign that he meant in the pictures over and over again i answered  he would not have my feint i dont mean in these wretched caricatures  well i assented provisionally  i mean her very self listening looking livingwaiting  whether i had insanity or sorrow to deal with i could not gainsay the unhappy man and i only said what i really felt yes the place seems strangely full of her i wish you would tell me about her  he asked with a certain slyness have you heard anything about her already at the club from that fool woman in the kitchen  for heavens sake no alderling  or about me  nothing whatever  he seemed relieved of whatever suspicion he felt but he said finally and with an air of precaution i should like to know just how much you mean by the place seeming full of her  oh i suppose the association of her personality with the whole house and especially this room i didnt mean anything preternatural i believe  then you dont believe in a life after death he demanded with a kind of defiance  i thought this rather droll seeing what his own position had been but that was not the moment for the expression of my amusement the tendency is to a greater tolerance of the notion i said men like james and royce among the psychologists and shaler among the scientists scarcely leave us at peace in our doubts any more much less our denials  he said as if he had forgotten the question they called it a very light case and they thought she was getting well in fact she did get well and thenthere was a relapse they laid it to her eating some fruit which they allowed her  alderling spoke with a kind of bitter patience but in my own mind i was not able to put all the blame on the doctors neither did i blame that innocently earthy creature who was of no more harm in her strong appetite than any other creature which gluts its craving as simply as it feels it the sense of her presence was deepened by the fact of those childlike selfindulgences which alderlings words recalled to me i made no comment however and he asked gloomily as if with a return of his suspicion and you havent heard of anything happening afterward  i dont know what you refer to i told him but i can safely say i havent for i havent heard anything at all  they contended that it didnt happen he resumed she died they said and by all the tests she had been dead two whole days she died with her hand in mine i was not trying to hold her back she had a kind of majestic preoccupation in her going so that i would not have dared to detain her if i could youve seen them go and how they seem to draw those last long deep breaths as if they had no thought in the world but of the work of getting out of it when her breathing stopped i expected it to go on but it did not go on and that was all nothing startling nothing dramatic just simple natural like her i gave her hand back i put it on her breast myself and crossed the other on it she looked as if she were sleeping with that faint color hovering in her face which was not wasted but i did not makebelieve about it i accepted the fact of her death in your quests of the occult alderling broke off with a kind of superiority that was of almost the quality of contempt i believe you dont allow yourself to be daunted by a diametrical difference of opinion among the witnesses of an occurrence as to its nature or as to its reality even not exactly that i said i think i argued that the passive negation of one witness ought not to invalidate the testimony of another as to his experience one might hear and see things and strongly affirm them and another absorbed in something else or in a mere suspense of the observant faculties might quite as honestly declare that so far as his own knowledge was concerned nothing of the kind happened i held that in such a case countertestimony should not be allowed to invalidate the testimony for the fact  yes that is what i meant said alderling you say it more clearly in the book though  oh of course     viii   he began again more remotely from the affair in hand than he had left off as if he wanted to give himself room for parley with my possible incredulity you know how it was with marion about my not believing that i should live again her notion was a sort of joke between us especially when others were by but it was a serious thing with her in her heart perhaps it had originally come to her as a mere fancy and from entertaining it playfully she found herself with a mental inmate that finally dispossessed her judgment you remember how literally she brought those scripture texts to bear on it  yes may i say that it was very affecting  affecting alderling repeated in a tone of amaze at the inadequacy of my epithet she was always finding things that bore upon the point after awhile she got to concealing them as if she thought they annoyed me they never did they amused me and when i saw that she had something of the sort on her mind i would say well out with it marion she would always begin well you may laugh and as he repeated her words alderling did laugh forlornly and as i must say rather bloodcurdlingly  i could not prompt him to go on but he presently did so himself desolately enough i suppose if i was in her mind at all in that supreme moment when she seemed to be leaving this life behind with such a solemn effect of rating it at nothing it may have been a pang to her that i was not following her into the dark with any ray of hope for either of us she could not have returned from it with the expectation of convincing me for i used to tell her that if one came back from the dead i should merely know that he had been mistaken about being dead and was giving me a dream from his trance she once asked me if i thought lazarus was not really dead with a curious childlike interest in the miracle and she was disheartened when i reminded her that lazarus had not testified of any life hereafter and it did not matter whether he had been really dead or not when he was resuscitated as far as that was concerned last year we read the bible a good deal together here and to tease her i pretended to be convinced of the contrary by the very passages that persuaded her as she told you she did not care for herself you remember that  distinctly i said  it was always so she never cared i was perfectly aware that if she could have assured life hereafter to me she would have given her life here to do it you know how some women when they are married absolutely give themselves up try to lose themselves in the behoof of their husbands i dont say it rightly there are no words that will express the utterness of their abdication  i know what you mean i said and it was one of the facts which most interested me in mrs alderling  because i wasnt worthy of it no man is  it wasnt a question of that in my mind i dont believe that occurred to me it was the ding an sich that interested me or as it related itself to her and not the least as it related itself to you such a womans being is a cycle of selfsacrifice so perfect so essential from birth to death as to exclude the notion of volition she is what she does of course she has to put her sacrifice into words from time to time but its true language is acts and the acts themselves only clumsily express it there is a kind of tyranny in it for the man of course it requires selfsacrifice to be sacrificed to and i dont suppose a woman has any particular merit in what is so purely natural it appears pathetic when it is met with ingratitude or rejection but when it has its way it is no more deserving our reverence than eating or sleeping it astonishes men because they are as naturally incapable of it as women are capable of it  i was mounted and was riding on forgetful of alderling and what he had to tell me if he had anything but he recalled me to myself by having apparently forgotten me for when i paused he took up his affair at a quite different point and as though that were the question in hand  that gift or knack or trick or whatever it was of one compelling the presence of the other by thinking or willing it was as much mine as hers and she tried sometimes to get me to say that i would use it with her if she died before i did and if she were where the conditions were opposed to her coming to me my will would help her to overcome the hinderance our united wills would form a current of volition that she could travel back on against all obstacles i dont know whether i make myself clear he appealed  yes perfectly i said it is very curious he said in a kind of muse i dont know just where i was then he began again oh yes it was at the ceremonydown there in the library some of the country people came in i suppose they thought they ought and i suppose they wanted to it didnt matter to me i had sent for doctor norrey as soon as the relapse came and he was there with me of course there was the minister conducting the services he made a prayer full of helpless repetitions which i helplessly noticed and some scrambling remarks mostly misdirected at me affirming and reaffirming that the sister they had lost was only gone before and that she was now in a happier world  the singing and the praying and the preaching came to an end and then there was that soulsickening hush that exanimate silence of which the noise of rustling clothes and scraping feet formed a part as the people rose in the hall where chairs had been put for them leaving me and norrey alone with marion every fibre of my frame recognized the moment of parting and protested a tremendous wave of will swept through me and from me a resistless demand for her presence and it had power upon her i heard her speak and say as distinctly as i repeat the words i will come for you and the youth and the beauty that had been growing more and more wonderful in her face ever since she died shone like a kind of light from it i answered her i am ready now and then norrey scuffled to his feet with a conventional face of sympathy and said no hurry my dear alderling and i knew he had not heard or seen anything as well as i did afterwards when i questioned him he thought i was giving them notice that they could take her away what do you think  how what do i think i asked  do you think that it happened  there was something in alderlings tone and manner that made me instead of answering directly that i did not temporize and ask why  becausebecause and alderling caught his breath like a child that is trying to keep itself from crying because i dont he broke into a sobbing that seemed to wrench and tear his poor little body and if i had thought of anything to say i could not have said it to his headlong grief with any hope of assuaging it i am satisfied now he said at last wiping his wet face and striving for some composure of its trembling features that it was all a delusion the effect of my exaltation of my momentary aberration perhaps dont be afraid of saying what you really think he added scornfully with the notion of sparing me you couldnt doubt it or deny it more completely than i do  illustration he broke into a sobbing that seemed to wrench and tear  i confess this unexpected turn struck me dumb i did not try to say anything and alderling went on  i dont deny that she is living but i cant believe that i shall ever live to see her again or if you prefer die to see her there is the play of the poor animal instinct or the mechanical persistence of expectation in me so that i cant shut the doors without the sense of shutting her out cant put out the lights without feeling that i am leaving her in the dark but i know it is all foolishness as well as you do all craziness if she is alive it is because she believed she should live and i shall perish because i didnt believe i should like to believe now if only to see her again but it is too late if you disuse any member of your body or any faculty of your mind it withers away and if you deny your soul your soul ceases to be  i found myself saying that is very interesting from a certain force of habit which you have noted in me when confronted with a novel instance of any kind but i suggested why not act upon the reverse of that principle and create the fact by affirmation which you think your denial destroys  because he repeated wearily it is too late you might as well ask the fakir who has held his arm upright for twenty years till it has stiffened there to restore the dry stock by exercise it is too late i tell you  but look here alderling i pursued beginning to taste the joy of argument you say that your will had such power upon her after you knew her to be dead that you made her speak to you  no i dont say that now he returned i know now that it was a delusion  but if you once had that power of summoning her to you by strongly wishing for her presence when you were both living here why doesnt it stand to reason that you could do it still if she is living there and you are living here  i never had any such power he replied with the calm of absolute tragedy that was a delusion too i leave the doors open for her night and day because i must but if she came i should know it was not she     ix   of course you know your own business my dear acton but if you think of using the story of the alderlingsand there is no reason why you should not for they are both dead without kith or kin surviving so far as i know unless he has some relatives in germany who would never penetrate the disguise you could give the caseit seems to me that here is your true climax but i necessarily leave the matter to you for i shall not touch it at any point where we could come into competition in fact i doubt if i ever touch it at all for though all psychology is in a manner dealing with the occult still i think i have done my duty by that side of it as the occult is usually understood and i am shy of its grosser instances as things that are apt to bring ones scientific poise into question however you shall be the judge of what is best for you to do when you have the whole story and i will give it you without more ado merely premising that i have a sort of shame for the aptness of the catastrophe i shall respect you more if i hear that you agree with me as to the true climax of the tragedy and have the heroism to reject the final event  i stayed with alderling nearly a week and i will own that i bored myself in fact i am not sure but we bored each other at any rate when i told him the night before i intended going that i meant to leave him in the morning he seemed resigned or indifferent or perhaps merely inattentive from time to time we had recurred to the matter of his experience or his delusion but with apparently increasing impatience on his part and certainly decreasing interest on mine so that at last i think he was willing to have me go but in the morning he seemed reluctant and pleaded with me to stay a few days longer with him i alleged engagements more or less unreal for i was never on such terms with alderling that i felt i need make any special sacrifice to him he gave way suspiciously rather and when i came down from my room after having put the last touches to my packing i found him on the veranda looking out to seaward where a heavy fogbank hung  you will sense here the sort of patness which i feel cheapens the catastrophe and yet as i consider it again the fact is not without its curious importance and its bearing upon what went before i do not know but it gives the whole affair a relief which it would not otherwise have  he was to have driven me to the station some miles away before noon and i supposed we should sit down together and try to have some sort of talk before i went but alderling appeared to have forgotten about my going and after a while took himself off to his studio and left me alone to watch the inroads of the fog it came on over the harbor rapidly as on that morning when mrs alderling had been so nearly lost in it and presently the masts and shrouds of the shipping at anchor were sticking up out of it as if they were sunk into a body as dense as the sea under them  i amused myself watching it blot out one detail of the prospect after another while the foghorn lowed through it and the bellbuoy far out beyond the lighthouse ledge tolled mournfully the milkwhite mass moved landward and soon the air was blind with the mist which hid the grass twenty yards away there was an awfulness in the silence which nothing broke but the lowing of the horn and the tolling of the bell except when now and then the voice of a sailor came through it like that of some drowned man sending up his hail from the bottom of the bay  suddenly i heard a joyful shout from the attic overhead  i am coming i am coming  it was alderling calling out through his window and then a cry came from over the water which seemed to answer him but which there is no reason in the world to believe was not a girlish shout from one of the yachts swallowed up in the fog  his lunging descent of the successive stairways followed and he burst through the doorway beside me and without heeding me ran bareheaded down the sloping lawn  i followed with what notion of help or hinderance i should not find it easy to say but before i reached the waters edgein fact i never did reach it and had some difficulty making my way back to the housei heard the rapid throb of the oars in the rowlocks as he pulled through the white opacity  you know the rest for it was the common property of our enterprising press at the time when the incident was fully reported with my ineffectual efforts to be satisfactorily interviewed as to the nothing i knew  the oarless boat was found floating far out to sea after the fog lifted it was useless to look for alderlings body and i do not know that any search was made for it
