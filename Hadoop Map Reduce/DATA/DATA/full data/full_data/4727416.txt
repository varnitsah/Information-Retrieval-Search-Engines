4727416	the iron horse by rm ballantyne    chapter one  treats of the enginedrivers house and household  talk of earthquakes not all the earthquakes that have rumbled in ecuador or toppled over the spires and dwellings of peru could compare in the matter of dogged pertinacity with that earthquake which diurnally and hourly shocked little gerties dwelling quivered the white dimity curtains of little gerties bed and shook little gerties frame  a graceful rounded little frame it was yet strong and firmly knitperhaps in consequence of its having been from infancy so constantly and so well shaken together  her neat little body was surmounted by a head which no sculptor in search of an antique model would have chosen  gerties profile was not grecian her features were not classicbut they were comely and rosy and so sweet that most people wanted to kiss them and many people did gertie did not object  probably being only six she imagined that this was the ordinary and natural method of salutation  yet it was observable that the child did not reciprocate kisses except in one or two special cases  she had evidently a mind of her own a fact which was displayed most strikingly in the passionate manner in which she reciprocated the embraces of john marrot her father when that large hairy individual came in of an evening and catching her in his long arms pressed her little body to his damp pilotclothcoated breast and her chubby face to his oily smokeandsoot begrimed countenance forgetful for the moment of the remonstrance from his wife that was sure to follow  now then john there you go again  you aint got no more power of subjewin your feelings than one of your own ingines wich is the schreechinist fizzinist crashinist bustin things i ever ad the misfortune to ave to do with  theres a clean frock just put on this mornin only fit for the washtub now  but john was an easygoing man  he was mild kind sedate undemonstrative by nature and looked upon slight matrimonial breezes as being good for the health  it was only gertie who could draw him into demonstrations of feeling such as we have described and as we have said she always reciprocated them violently increasing thereby the washtub necessity tenfold  it would have been strange indeed if john marrot could have been much put about by a small matrimonial breeze seeing that his life was spent in riding on an iron monster with whitehot lungs and boiling bowels which carried him through space day and night at the rate of fifty miles an hour  this by the way brings us back to our textearthquakes  gerties houseor gerties fathers house if you prefer itstood close to the embankment of one of our great arterial railwayswhich of them for reasons best known to ourself we dont intend to tell but for the readers comfort we shall call it the grand national trunk railway  so close did the house stand to the embankment that timid female passengers were known occasionally to scream as they approached it under the impression that the train had left the rails and was about to dash into itan impression which was enhanced and somewhat justified by the circumstance that the house stood with one of its corners instead of its side front or back towards the line thereby inducing a sudden sensation of wrongness in the breasts of the twenty thousand passengers who swept past it daily  the extreme edge of its most protruding stone was exactly three yards four inchesby measurement from the left rail of the down line  need we say more to account for the perpetual state of earthquakedom in which that house was involved  but the tremors and shocks to which it was exposedby night and by daywas not all it had to bear  in certain directions of the wind it was intermittently enveloped in clouds of mingled soot and steam and being situated at a curve on the line where signalling became imminently needful it was exposed to all the varied horrors of the whistle from the sharp screech of interrogation to the successive bursts of exasperation or the prolonged and deadly yell of intimidation with all the intermediate modulationsso that what with the tremors and shocks and crashes and shrieks and thunderous roar of trains gerties fathers house maintained an upright front in circumstances that might have been equalled but could not have been surpassed by those of the eddystone lighthouse in the wildest of winter storms while it excelled that celebrated building in this that it faced a storm which knew no calm but raged furiously all the year round  john marrot was an enginedriver on the grand national trunk railway this is equivalent to saying that he was a steady sober trustworthy man  none but men of the best character are nowadays put in so responsible a position  nearly all the drivers on the line were of this kindsome better than others no doubt but all good  of course there are exceptions to every rule  as in the best regulated families accidents will happen so on the best conducted lines an occasional black sheep will get among the drivers but this is the exception that proves the rule  the rule in the grand national trunk railway wasget the best drivers and pay them well  the same may be said of the firemen whose ambition was ultimately to drive the iron chargers which they fed  besides being all that we have said john was a big burly softhearted hardheaded man who knew that two and two in ordinary circumstances made four and who didnt require to be told that his left foot was not his right one  it was generally supposed that john marrot had no nerves and that his muscles had imbibed some of the iron of which his engine was composed this was a mistake though there was some truth in both suppositions  johns family consisted of himself when at home which although often was never for long his wifefat and fair capable of being roused but on the whole a good sensible loving woman his eldest daughter lucy or loonineteen dark pretty and amiable his youngest daughter gertrude alias gertiesix sunny and serious at least as serious as was possible for one so young so innocent so healthy and so happy as she his son bob aged twelve who was a lampboy at the great station not far off and of whom it may be briefly said that he was no better than he should be and lastly the babynot yet at the walking period of life with a round head round body round eyes and a round dozen at leastif not moreof hairs standing straight up on the top of his bald pate suggesting the idea that he must at some period of his life have been singed by a passing locomotivean event not by any means beyond the bounds of possibility for it may be written with more truth of this than of any other infant that he had been born and nurtured amid thunder smoke and blazes  as might have been expected in the circumstances he was a powerful baby  we cannot afford space for a full description but it would be wrong to omit mention of the strength of his lungs  the imitative tendency of children is proverbial  clearly the locomotive was baby marrots pattern in many things  no infant that ever drew breath equalled this one at a yell  there was absolutely a touch of sublimity in the sound of the duetfrequently heardwhen baby chanced to be performing a solo and his fathers engine went shrieking past with a running accompaniment  it is a disputed point to this day which of the two beat the other and it is an admitted fact that nothing else could equal either  there were two other inmates of john marrots housenot members of the family  one was his fireman william garvie who lodged with him the other a small servant or maidofallwork who led a rugged existence but appeared to enjoy it although it kept her thin  her name was ann stocks familiarly known as nanny  we are thus particular in describing the enginedrivers household because apart from other reasons a group of human beings who could live and thrive and eat and sleep and love and learn and so forth in such circumstances is noteworthy  it was quite a treatbelieve it readerto see little gertie and the baby slumber while the engines were apparently having a night of it outside  come with us and behold  it is 1030 pm  father is crossing country on the limited mail at any pace you choose between fifty and eighty miles an hour time having been lost at the last station owing to the unaccountable disappearance of a firstclass passenger and time having to be made up by fair means or otherwise  his mate stands beside him  in the family mansion pretty loo sleeps like a good angel as she is in a small room farthest from the corner next the line but with her we have nothing to do at present  nanny also sound asleep lies in some place of profound obscurity among the coals in the lower regions of the house laying in that store of health and vigour which will enable her to face the rugged features of the following day  we dismiss her also with the hope that she may survive the coaldust and the lack of oxygen and turn to the chief room of the housethe kitchen parlour diningroom drawingroom nursery and family bedroom all in one enginedrivers are not always so badly off for space in their domiciles but circumstances which are not worth mentioning have led john marrot to put up with little  in this apartment which is wonderfully clean and neat there are two boxbeds and a sort of crib  baby sleepsas only babies canin perfect bliss in the crib gertie slumbers with her upturned sweet little face shaded by the white dimity curtains in one bed mrs molly marrot snores like a grampus in the other  it is a wide bed let deep into the wall as it were and mrs ms red countenance looms over the counterpane like the setting sun over a winter fogbank  hark  a rumble in the far distanceominous and low at first but rapidly increasing to the tones of distant thunder  it is the night express for the northgoing at fifty miles an hour  at such a rate of speed it might go right round the world in twentyone days  while yet distant the whistle is heard shrill threatening and prolonged louder and louder it is nearing the curve now and the earth trembles the house trembles too but gerties parted lips breathe as softly as before babys eyes are as tight and his entire frame as still as when he first fell asleep  mrs marrot too maintains the monotony of her snore  round the curve it comes at last hammer and tongs thundering like olympus and yelling like an iron fiend  the earthquake is on the embankment shudders the house quivers the doors windows cups saucers and pans rattle  outside all the sledgehammers and anvils in vulcans smithy are banging an obbligato accompaniment to the hissing of all the serpents that saint patrick drove out of ireland as the express comes up still gerties rest is unbroken  she does indeed give a slight smile and turn her head on the other side as if she had heard a pleasant whisper but nothing more  baby too vents a prolonged sigh before plunging into a profounder depth of repose  mrs marrot gives a deprecatory grunt between snores but it is merely a complimentary hallo s that you sort of question which requires no answer  as the rushing storm goes by a timid and wakeful passenger happens to lower the window and look out  he sees the house  its all over are his last words as he falls back in his seat and covers his face with his hands  he soon breathes more freely on finding that it is not all over but fifteen or twenty miles lie between him and the house he expected to annihilate before his nervous system has quite recovered its tone  this reader is a mere sample of the visitations by which that family was perpetually affected though not afflicted  sometimes the rushing masses were heavy goods trains which produced less fuss but more of earthquake  at other times red lights intimating equally danger and delay brought trains to a stand close to the house and kept them hissing and yelling there as if querulously impatient to get on  the uproar reached its culminating point about 1245 on the night of which we write when two trains from opposite directions were signalled to wait which they did precisely opposite john marrots windows and there kept up such a riot of sound as feeble language is impotent to convey to the accustomed ears the whistle and clank of a checked and angry pilotengine might have been discerned amid the hullabaloo but to one whose experience in such matters was small it might have seemed as though six or seven mad engines were sitting up on end like monster rabbits on a bank pawing the air and screaming out their hearts in the wild delirium of unlimited power and ungovernable fury  still although they moved a little the sleepers did not awakeso potent is the force of habit  however it did not last long  the red lights removed their ban the white lights said come on the monster rabbits gave a final snort of satisfaction and went awayeach with its tail of livestock or minerals or goods or human beings trailing behind it  the temporary silence round the house was very intense as may well be believedso much so that the heavy footfall of a man in the bypath that led to it sounded quite intrusive  he was a tall broadshouldered man in a large pilot coat cap and boots and appeared to walk somewhat lame as he approached the door  he tried the handle  it was locked of course  i thought so he muttered in a low bass voice so much for a bad memory  he rapped twice on the door loudly with his knuckles and then kicked it with his boot  vain hope  if a burglar with a sledgehammer had driven the door in he would have failed to tickle the drum of any ear there  the man evidently was aware of this for changing his plan he went round to a back window on the groundfloor and opened it at the top with some difficulty  peeping in he gazed for some time intently and then exclaimed under his breath ha its open by good luck gathering a handful of gravel he threw it into the house with considerable force  the result proved that he had not aimed at random for the shower entered the open door of nannys sleepingcellar and fell smartly on her face  it is wellknown that sailors although capable of slumbering through loud and continuous noises can be awakened by the slightest touch so likewise nanny  on receiving the shower of gravel she incontinently buried her head in the blankets drew an empty coalscuttle over her shoulders and began to shout thieves and murder at the top of her voice  having taken such pains to muffle it of course no one heard her cries  the man if a burglar had evidently a patient philosophical turn of mind for he calmly waited till the damsel was exhausted and when she at length peeped out to observe the effect of her heroic efforts at selfpreservation he said quietly nanny lass dont be a fool  its me open the door ive gone an forgot my latchkey  oh la master it aint you is it  it aint thieves and robbers is it  no no  open the door like a good girl  and it aint an accident is it continued nanny partially dressing in haste  oh i knows its a accident missus always prophesied as a accident would come to pass some day which has come true  youre not maimed master  no no be quick girl  nor willum aint maimed is he  he aint dead  oh dont say willum is  bill garvies all right said the enginedriver as he brushed past the girl and went upstairs  now although mrs marrots ears were totally deaf to locomotives they were alert enough to the sound of her husbands voice  when therefore he entered the kitchen he found her standing on the floor with an ample shawl thrown round her  nothing wrong she inquired anxiously  nothing molly my dear only i got a slight bruise on the leg in the engineshed today and i had to go up an show it to the doctor dye see before comin home which has made me later than usual  are you sure its not a back hurt father asked loo coming in at the momentalso enveloped in a shawl and looking anxious  sure ay im sure enough its only a scratch  see here  saying this he removed one of his boots and pulling up his trousers displayed a bandaged leg  well but we cant see through the bandages you know said mrs marrot  let me take them off father and ill replace  take em off exclaimed john pulling down the leg of his trouser and rising with a laugh  no no loo why its only just bin done up all snug by the doctor whod kick up a pretty shindy if he found i had undid it  theres one good will come of it anyhow i shall have a day or two in the house with you all for the doctor said i must give it a short rest  so off to bed again loo  this is not an hour for a respectable young woman to be wanderin about in her nightdress  away with you  was any one else hurt father said loo  she asked the question anxiously but there was a slight flush on her cheek and a peculiar smile which betrayed some hidden feeling  no one else returned her father  i tell ee it wasnt an accident at allit was only a engine that brushed up agin me as i was comin out o the shed  thats all so i just came home and left will garvie to look after our engine  there run away  loo smiled nodded and disappeared followed by mrs marrot who went like a sensible woman to see that her alarmed domestic was all right while she was away john went to the crib and kissed the rosy cheek of his sleeping boy  then he bent over the bed with the white dimity curtains to miss gerties forehead for which purpose he had to remove a mass of curly hair with his big brown hand  bless you my darling he said in silent speech you came near bein fatherless this nightnearer than you ever was before  he kissed her again tenderly and a fervent thank the lord rose from his heart to heaven  in less than halfanhour after this the enginedrivers family sank into profound repose serenaded by the music of a mineral train from the black country which rushed laboriously past their dwelling like an overweighted thunderbolt    chapter two  the driver visits a little elderly gentlewoman and prepares the iron horse for action  next day john marrot spent the brief period of repose accorded by the doctor to his leg in romping about the house with the baby in his arms being a large man accustomed to much elbowroom and rapid motion and the house being small john may be said to have been a dangerous character in the family on such occasions  apart from baby no elephant was ever more sluggish in his motions but when coupledprofessionally speakingto his own tender infant john knew no bounds his wife knew no rest and his baby knew no higher earthly bliss  sometimes it was on his shoulder sometimes on his head and often on his foot riding with railway speed to banbury cross  again it was on its back in the crib or on the bed being tickled into fits of laughter which bid fair at times to merge into fits of convulsion to the horror of little gertie who came in for a large share of that delightful holidays enjoyment but whose spirit was frequently harrowed with alarm at the riotous conduct of her invalid father  in his glee the man might have been compared to a locomotive with a bad driver who was constantly shutting off the steam and clapping on the brakes too soon or too late thus either falling short of or overshooting his mark  what between the door and the dresser the fire the crib the window and the furniture john showed himself a dreadfully bad pilot and was constantly running into or backing out of difficulties  at last towards the afternoon of that day while performing a furious charge round the room with baby on his head he overturned the washtub which filled the baby with delirious joy and gertie with pleasurable alarm  as for mrs marrot she was too happy to have her husband at home for a whole day to care much about trifles nevertheless she felt it her duty to reprove him lest the children should learn a bad lesson  there now john i knew youd do it at last  youre much too violent and you shouldnt ought to risk the babys neck in that way  such a mess  how can you expect me to keep things tidy if you go on so  john was very penitent  he did not reply at first but putting baby into the cribwhere it instantly drowned with a great yell the shriek of a passing trainhe went down on his knees and began to swab up the water with a jacktowel  loo ran laughingly from the corner where she had been sewing and insisted on doing it for him  youll hurt your leg father if you bend it so and im sure it must be swelled and pained enough already with so much romping  not a bit loo objected john  it was me as caused the mess an justice requires that i should swab it up  there go sew that sentiment into a sampler an hang it up over yer bed  but loo would not give in  while they were still engaged in the controversy the door opened and young bob marrot stood before them with his eyes wide open and his hair straight up on end as if he had recently seen a ghost  this aspect however was no sign of alarm being his normal condition  ha seems to me somehow that somebodys bin up to somethin  right bob replied his father rising from his knees and throwing the jacktowel at him  the lad easily evaded the shot being well accustomed to elude much more deadly missiles and picking up the towel quietly set to work to perform the duty in dispute  youre wanted he said looking up at his father while he wrung the towel over a tin basin  eh  where  up at the shed  im on sick leave said john  cant help that  the 630 pm passenger train must be drove and theres nobody left but you to drive it  jones is away with a goods train owin to maxwell having sprained his ankle and long thompson is down with smallpox so youll have to do it  i offered em my services but the manager he said that intelligent lads couldnt be spared for such menial work and told me to go and fetch you  maxwell had no business to sprain his ankle said john marrot howsever he added cheerfully ive had a rare good holiday an the legs all but right again so molly lets have an early tea ill give it a good rest for another halfhour and then be ready for the 630 pmers  cut off your steam will you  this last observation was made to the baby and was accompanied by a shake and a toss towards the ceiling which caused him to obey instantly under the impression no doubt that the fun was to be renewed  being however consigned to the care of gertie he again let on the steam and kept it up during the whole time the family were at teawhich meal they enjoyed thoroughly quite regardless of the storm  he was asleep when his father rose at last and buttoned his heavy coat up to the chin while mrs marrot stood on tiptoe to arrange more carefully the woollen shawl round his neck  now dont stand more than you can help on your hurt leg john  certainly not duckie said john stooping to kiss the upturned face ill sit on the rail as much as i can like a merican racoon  by the way he added turning suddenly to loo you delivered that note from young mr tipps to his mother  yes immediately after i got it from you and i waited to see if there was an answer but she said there wasnt  it must have contained bad news i fear for she turned pale while she read it  hm well said john putting on his cap dont know nothin about what was in it so its no bizzness o mine  with a hearty goodevening to all and a special embrace to gertie the enginedriver left his home accompanied by bob his hopeful son  mr sharp said bob as they walked along has bin makin oncommon partikler inquiries among us about some o the porters  i raither think theyre a bad lot  not at all replied his father severely  theyre no more a bad lot than the drivers or for the matter of that than the clerks or the directors or the lampboys  you ought to be gittin old enough by this time bob to know that every lot o fish in this world however good has got a few bad uns among em  as a rule railway directors and railway clerks and railway porters and railway officials of all sorts are goodmore or lessthe same may be said of banks an insurances an all sorts of thingsbut do what ye may a black sheep or two will git in among em and of course the bigger the consarn the more numerous the black sheep  even the clergy aint free from that uniwersal law of natur  but whats mr sharp bin inquiring arter  ahwot indeed replied bob ow should i know  mr sharp aint the man to go about the line with a ticket on his back tellin wot hes arter  by no means  plice superintendents aint usually given to that but hes arter somethin partickler  well that aint no bizzness of ours bob so we dont need to trouble our heads about it  theres nothin like mindin yer own bizzness same time added john after a short pause thats no reason why as a seafarin friend o mine used to say a man shouldnt keep his weathereye open dye see  bob intimated that he did see by winking with the eye that chanced to be next his parent but further converse between father and son was interrupted at a turn in the road where they were joined by a stout broadshouldered young man whose green velveteen jacket vest and trousers bespoke him a railway porter  evenin sam said our driver with a friendly nod goin on night dooty eh  yes worse luck replied sam thrusting his powerful hands into his pockets  why so sam you aint used to mind night dooty  no more i do said sam testily but my missus is took bad and theres no one to look after her properlyfor that old ooman we got aint to be trusted  tis a hard thing to have to go on night dooty when a higher dooty bids me stay at home  there was a touch of deep feeling in the tone in which the latter part of sam natlys remark was uttered  his young wife to whom he had been only a year married had fallen into bad health and latterly the doctors had given him little encouragement to hope for her recovery  sam said john marrot stopping ill go an send a friend as i knows of to look after yer wife  a friend said sam you cant mean any o your own family john for you havent got time to go back that length now and  well never mind ive got time to go where im agoin  you run on to the shed bob and tell garvie that ill be there in fifteen minutes  the enginedriver turned off abruptly and increasing his pace to a smart walk soon stood before the door of one of those uncommonly small neat suburban villas which the irrigating influence of the grand national trunk railway had caused to spring up like mushrooms around the noisy smoky bustling town of clatterbyto the unspeakable advantage of that class of gentlefolk who possess extremely limited incomes but who nevertheless prefer fresh air to smoke  is your missus at ome he inquired of the stout elderly woman who answered to his modest summonsfor although john was wont to clatter and bang through the greater part of his daily and nightly career he was tender of touch and act when out of his usual professional beat  yes do you wish to see her  i does my dear  sorry i avent got a card with me but if youll just say that its john marrot the enginedriver i dessay thatll do for a free pass  the elderly woman went off with a smile but returned quickly with an anxious look and bade the man follow her  he was ushered into a small and poorly furnished but extremely neat and clean parlour where sat a thin little old lady in an easychair looking very pale  evnin maam said john bowing and looking rougher and bigger than usual in such a small apartment  youyoudont bring bad news i hopemy son joseph  oh no mrs tipps not by no means said marrot hasting to relieve the timid old ladys feelings mr joseph is all rightnothing wotiver wrong with himnor likely to be maam  leastwise he wos all right wen i seed im last  and when might that be asked the timid old lady with a sigh of relief as she clasped her hands tightly together  wy let me see said john touching his forehead it was yesterday evenin wen i came up with the northern express  but many accidents might have happened since yesterday evening said mrs tipps still in an anxious tone  thats true maam  all the engines on the grand trunk from the pentland firth to the channel might have busted their bilers since that timebut it aint likely replied john with a bland smile  andand what was my son doing when you passed him  did you speak to him  speak to him  bless your heart maam said john with another benignant smile i went past langrye station at sixty mile an hour so we hadnt much chance to speak to each other  it would have been as much as we could have managed if wed tried it to exchange winks  dreadful exclaimed mrs tipps in a low tone  is that the usual rate of travelling on your railway  oh dear no maam  its only my express train as goes at that rate other expresses run between forty and fifty miles an ornary trains average about thirty miles an hourgoods they go at about twenty more or less but they varies a good deal  the train i drives is about the fastest in the kingdom wich is pretty much the same as sayin its the fastest in the world maam  sometimes im obleeged to go as high as nigh seventy miles an hour to make up time  the fastest mailcoaches in my young days said mrs tipps used to go at the rate of ten miles an hour i believe  pretty much so said john  they did manage a mile or two more im told but that was their average of crawlin with full steam on  and you sometimes drive at sixty or seventy miles an hour  yes maam  with people in the carriages  cernly maam  how i wish that i had lived a hundred years ago sighed poor mrs tipps  youd have bin a pretty old girl by this time if you had thought the enginedriver but he was too polite to give utterance to the thought  and what was my son doing when you passed him at that frightful speed you could see him i suppose  oh yes maam i could see him well enough  he was talkin an laughin as far as i could make out with an uncommon pretty girl  indeed exclaimed mrs tipps flushing slightlyfor she was extremely sensitiveand evidently much relieved by this information  well my good man what do you wish me to do for you anything that is in my power to  thankee maam but i dont want you to do nothin for me  then what have you to say to me added the old lady with a little smile that was clearly indicative of a kind little heart  ive come to take the liberty maam of askin you to do one of my mates a favour  most willingly said mrs tipps with animation  i shall never forget that you saved my dear josephs life by pulling him off the line when one of your dreadful engines was going straight over him  anything that i am capable of doing for you or your friends will be but a poor return for what you have done for me  i have often asked you to allow me to make me some such return mr marrot and have been grieved at your constant refusal  i am delighted that you come to me now  youre very good to say so maam  the fact is that one o my friends a porter on the line named sam natly has a young wife who is i fear far gone wi consumption shes worse tonight an poor sams obliged to go on night dooty so he cant look arter her an the old ooman theyve got aint worth nothin  so i thought id make bold maam to ask you to send yer servant to git a proper nurse to take charge of her tonight it would be  ill go myself exclaimed mrs tipps interrupting and starting up with a degree of alacrity that astonished the enginedriver  here write down the address on that piece of paperyou can write i suppose  yes maam replied john modestly as he bent down and wrote the address in a bold flowing hand i raither think i can write  i write notes on a paper ive got to fill up daily on the engine an wen a mans trained to do that maam its my opinion hes fit to write in any circumstances whatsomedever  why youd hardly believe it maam but i do assure you that i wrote my fust an last loveletter to my missus on the engine  i was drivin the lightenin at the timethats the name o my engine maam an they calls me jack blazes in consikencewell id bin courtin molly offanon for about three months  she blonged to pinchley station you must know where we used to stop to give her a drink  what to give molly a drink  no maam replied john with a slight smile to give the ingine a drink  well she met me nigh every day xcept sundays at that station and as wed a pretty long time thereabout five minuteswe used to spend it beside the pump an made the most of it  but somehow i took it into my head that molly was playin fast an loose with me an i was raither cool on her for a time  howsever her father bein a pointsman she wos shifted along with him to langrye stationthats where your son is maaman as we dont stop there we was obleeged to confine our courtship to a nod an a wave of a handkerchief  leastwise she shook out a white handkerchief an i flourished a lump o cottonwaste  well one day as we was close upon langrye stationabout two milesi suddenly takes it into my head that id bring the thing to a pint so i sings out to my matethat was my fireman maamsays i look out jim an i draws out my pencil an bends my legsyou must always bend your legs a little maam wen you writes on a locomotive it makes springs of em so to speakan i writes on the back of a blank timebill molly my dear no more shillyshallyin with me times up  if youll be tender ill be locomotive  only say the word and were coupled for life in three weeks  a white handkerchief means yes a red un no  if red youll see a noo driver on the 1015 am express day after tomorrow  john marrot  i was just in time to pitch the paper crumpled up right into her bosom continued the driver wiping his forehead as if the deep anxiety of that eventful period still affected him an let me tell you maam it requires a deal o nice calculation to pitch a piece o crumpled paper true off a locomotive goin between fifty and sixty miles an hour but it went all straighti could see that before we was gone  and what was the result asked the little old lady as earnestly as if that result were still pending  wy the result wos as it should be  my letter was a short un but it turned out to be a powerful brake  brought her up sharpan we was coupled in less than six weeks  amazing phase of human life observed mrs tipps gazing in admiration at the stalwart giant who stood deferentially before her  well it was a raither coorious kind o proposal said marrot with a smile but it worked uncommon well  ive never wanted to uncouple since then  pardon me mr marrot said mrs tipps with little hysterical laughknowing that she was about to perpetrate a jokemay i ask if there are anyany little tenders  oh lots of em replied john quite a train of em four livin an three gone dead  the last was coupled on only a short time ago  youll excuse me now maam he added pulling out and consulting the ponderous chronometer with which the company supplied him i must go now havin to take charge o the 630 pm trainit aint my usual train but im obleeged to take it tonight owin to one of our drivers havin come by an accident  evenin maam  john bowed and retired so promptly that poor mrs tipps had no time to make further inquiry into the accident referred toat the very mention of which her former alarm came back in full force  however she wisely got the better of her own anxieties by throwing herself into those of others  putting on her bonnet she sallied forth on her errand of mercy  meanwhile john marrot proceeded to the engineshed to prepare his iron horse for action  here he found that his fireman will garvie and his cleaner had been attending faithfully to their duty  the huge locomotive which looked all the more gigantic for being under cover was already quivering with that tremendous energythat artificial lifewhich rendered it at once so useful and so powerful a servant of man  its brasses shone with golden lustre its iron rods and bars cranks and pistons glittered with silvery sheen and its heavier parts and body were gay with a new coat of green paint  every nut and screw and lever and joint had been screwed up and oiled examined tested and otherwise attended to while the oblong pit over which it stood when in the shedand into which its ashes were periodically emptiedglowed with the light of its intense furnace  ever and anon a little puff issued from its safetyvalve proving to john marrot that there was life within his fiery steed sufficient to have blown the shed to wreck with all its brother engines of which there were at the time two or three dozen standingsome disgorging their fire and water after a journey and preparing to rest for the night some letting off steam with a fiendish yell unbearably prolonged others undergoing trifling repairs preparatory to starting next day and a few like that of our enginedriver ready for instant action and snorting with impatience like warhorses scenting the battle from afar  the begrimed warriors whose destiny it was to ride these iron chargers were also variously circumstanced  some in their shirt sleeves busy with hammer and file at benches hard by others raking out fireboxes or oiling machinery all busy as bees save the few who having completed their preparations were buttoning up their jackets and awaiting the signal to charge  at last that signal came to john marrotnot in a loud shout of command or a trumpetblast but by the silent hand of time as indicated on his chronometer  but how it may be asked does john marrot know precisely the hour at which he has to start the stations he has to stop at the various little acts of coupling on and dropping off carriages and trucks and returning with trains or with empties within fixed periods so punctually that he shall not interfere with run into or delay the operations of the hundreds of drivers whose duties are as complex nice important and swift as his own  reader we reply that john knows it all in consequence of the perfection of system attained in railway management  without this our trains and rails all over the kingdom would long ago have been smashed up into what irishmen expressively name smithereens  the duty of arranging the details of the system devolves on the superintendents of departments on the line namely the passenger goods and locomotive superintendents each of whom reigns independently and supreme in his own department but of course like the members of a wellordered family they have to consult together in order that their trains may be properly horsed and the time of running so arranged that there shall be no clashing in their distinct though united interests when the number of trains and time of running have been fixed and finally published by the passenger superintendentwho is also sometimes the outdoor superintendent and who has duties to perform that demand very considerable powers of generalshipit is the duty of the locomotive superintendent to supply the requisite engines  this officer besides caring for all the plant or rollingstock new and old draws out periodically a schedule in which is detailed to a nicety every minute act that has to be done by driversthe hour at which each engine is to leave the shed on each day of the week the number of each engine its driver and fireman and the duties to be performed and this sheet contains complete daily nay almost hourly directions for passenger goods and pilotengines  in order to secure attention to these regulations each engineman is fined one shilling for every minute he is behind time in leaving the shed  the difficulty of making these runnings of trains dovetail into each other on lines where the traffic is great and constant may well be understood to be considerable particularly when it is remembered that ordinary regular traffic is interfered with constantly by numerous excursion special and other irregular trains in the midst of which also time must be provided for the repair and renewal of the line itself the turning of old rails laying down of new ones raising depressed sleepers renewing broken chairs etceteraall which is constantly going on and that too at parts of the line over which hundreds of trains pass in the course of the twentyfour hours  besides the arrangements for the regular traffic which are made monthly a printed sheet detailing the special traffic repairs of lines new and altered signals working arrangements etcetera is issued weekly to every member of the staff particularly to enginedrivers and guards  we chance to possess one of these private sheets issued by one of our principal railways  let us peep behind the scenes for a moment and observe how such matters are managed  the vacation has come to an end and the boys of rapscallion college will on a certain day pour down on the railway in shoals with money in hand and a confident demand for accommodation  this invading army must be prepared for  ordinary trains are not sufficient for it  delay is dangerous on railways it must not be permitted therefore the watchful superintendent writes an order which we find recorded as follows    wednesday 26th aprilaccommodation must be provided on this day   in the 310 and 625 pm up and 225 and 610 pm down trains for   the cadets returning to rapscallion college  by the trains named   rapscallion college tickets will be collected at whitewater on the   down journey and at smokingham on the up journey  oldershot to send   a man to whitewater to assist in the collection of these tickets  againa relief train has to be utilised  it wont pay to run empty trains on the line unnecessarily therefore the superintendent has his eye on it and writes    april 23rdan empty train will leave whiteheath for woolhitch at   about 810 pm to work up from woolhitch at 905 pm calling at   woolhitch dockyard and curlton and forming the 915 pm up ordinary   train from whiteheath  greatgun street to provide engines and guards   for this service  this is but a slight specimen of the providing dovetailing timing and guarding that has to be done on all the lines in the kingdom  in the same sheet from which the above is quoted we find notes cautions and intimations as to such various matters as the holding of the levers of facing points when trains are passing through junctions the attention required of drivers to new signals the improper use of telegraph bells the making search for lost passes the more careful loading of goods waggons the changes in regard to particular trains the necessity of watchfulness on the part of stationmasters robberies having been committed on the line the intimation of dates when and places where ballast trains are to be working on the line the times and places when and where repairs to line are to take place during the brief intervals between trains of the ordinary traffic and many other matters which naturally lead one to the belief that superintendents of railways must possess the eyes of argus the generalship of wellington and the patience of job  being carefully hedged in as we have shown with strict rules and regulations backed by fines in case of the slightest inattention and the certainty of prompt dismissal in case of gross neglect or disobedience with the possibility of criminal prosecution besides looming in the far distance our friend john marrot knowing his duties well and feeling perfect confidence in himself and his superiors consulted his chronometer for the last time said now then bill and mounted his noble steed  will garvie who was putting a finishing drop of oil into some part of the machinery took his station beside his mate and eased off the brake john let off two sharp whistles an imperative duty on the part of every driver before starting an engine and let on the steam  the first was a very soft pulsationa mere puffbut it was enough to move the ponderous engine as if it had been a cork though its actual weight with tender was fiftythree tons  another puff and slowly the iron horse moved out of its stable  there was a gentle oily gliding effect connected with its first movements that might have won the confidence even of timid mrs captain tipps  another puff of greater strength shot the engine forward with a sudden grandeur of action that would certainly have sent that ladys heart into her throat  in a few seconds it reached and passed the place where the siding was connected with the main line and where a pointsman stood ready to shift the points  here the obedient spirit of the powerful steed was finely displayed  will garvie reversed the action of the engines by a process which though beautifully simple and easily done cannot be easily described  john let on a puff of steam and the engine glided backwards as readily as it had run forward  a few seconds afterwards it moved slowly under the magnificent arch of clatterby station and its buffers met those of the train it was destined to draw as if with a gentle touch of friendly greeting  at the station all was bustle and noise but here we must venture to do what no human being could accomplish in reality compel the 630 pm train to wait there until it shall be our pleasure to give it the signal to start  meanwhile we shall put back the clock an hour or so ask the reader to return to mrs tipps residence and observe what transpired there while john marrot was in the shed getting his iron steed ready for action    chapter three  in which the widow holds converse with a captain makes the acquaintance of a young man and receives a telegraphic shock which ends in a railway journey  mrs captain tipps was as we have said a thin old lady of an excessively timid temperament  she was also as we have shown impulsively kind in disposition  moreover she was birdlike in aspect and action  we would not have it supposed however that her features were sharp  on the contrary they were neat and rounded and well formed telling of great beauty in youth but her little face and mouth were of such a form that one was led irresistibly to expect to hear her chirp she fluttered rather than walked and twittered rather than talked  altogether she was a charming little old lady with a pair of beadlike eyes as black as sloes  happy that captaina seacaptain by the way long since deadround whom she had fluttered in days gone bye and happy that son joseph round whom when at home she fluttered now  but joseph was not often at home at the time we write of  he was an honest soula gentle affectionate man with a handsome face neat dapper little frame something like his mother in many ways yet not unmanly  he was too earnest simple unassuming and unaffected to be that  he was a railway clerk and had recently been appointed to langrye station about fifty miles from clatterby which necessitated his leaving his mothers roof but mrs tipps consoled herself with the intention of giving up her little villa and going to live at langrye  poverty after the captains death had seized upon the widow and held her tightly down during the whole of that period when joseph and his only sister netta were being educated  but mrs tipps did her duty bravely by them  she was a practically religious woman and tried most earnestly to rule her life in accordance with the blessed word of god she trained up her children in the way that they should go in thorough reliance on the promise that they would not depart from it when they were old  she accepted the command owe no man anything but to love one another as given to herself as well as to the world at largehence she kept out of debt and was noted for deeds of kindness wherever she went  but she was pinched during this periodterribly pinchedno one knew how severely save her daughter netta to whom she had been in the habit of confiding all her joys and sorrows from the time that the child could form any conception of what joy or sorrow meant  but mrs tipps did not weep over her sorrows neither did she become boisterous over her joys she was an equable wellbalanced woman in everything except the little matter of her nervous system  netta was a counterpart of her mother as time went on expenses increased and living on small means became more difficult so that mrs tipps was compelled to contemplate leaving the villa poor and small though it was and taking a cheaper residence at this juncture a certain captain lee an old friend of her late husbandalso a seacaptain and an extremely gruff onecalled upon the widow found out her straitened circumstances and instantly offered her five hundred pounds which she politely but firmly refused  but madam said the excitable captain on that memorable occasion i must insist on your taking it  excuse me i have my own reasonsand they are extremely good onesfor saying that it is my duty to give you this sum and yours to take it  i owe it to your late husband who more than once laid me under obligations to him  mrs tipps shook her little head and smiled  you are very kind captain lee to put it in that way and i have no doubt that my dear husband did as you say lay you under many obligations because he was always kind to every one but i cannot i assure you  very well interrupted the captain wiping his bald head with his pockethandkerchief angrily then the money shall go to some charity somesome ridiculous asylum or hospital for teaching logarithms to the hottentots of the cape or something of that sort  i tell you madam he added with increased vehemence seeing that mrs tipps still shook her head i tell you that i robbed your husband of five hundred pounds  robbed him exclaimed mrs tipps somewhat shocked  oh captain lee impossible  yes i did replied the captain crossing his arms and nodding his head firmly robbed him  i laid a bet with him to that extent and won it  that is not usually considered robbery captain lee said mrs tipps with a smile  but that ought to be considered robbery replied the captain with a frown  betting is a mean shabby contemptible way of obtaining money for nothing on false pretences  the man who bets says in his heart i want my friends money without the trouble of working for it therefore ill offer to bet with him  in so doing ill risk an equal sum of my own money  thats fair and honourable  is that logic demanded the captain vehemently it is not  in the first place it is mean to want not to speak of accepting another mans money without working for it and it is a false pretence to say that you risk your own money because it is not your own it is your wifes and your childrens money who are brought to poverty mayhap because of your betting tendencies and it is your bakers and butchers money whose bread and meat you devour as long as theyll let you without paying for it because of your betting tendencies and a proportion of it belongs to your church which you rob and to the poor whom you defraud because of your betting tendencies and if you say that when you win the case is altered i reply yes it is altered for the worse because instead of bringing all this evil down on your own head you hurl it not angrily not desperately but worse with fiendish indifference on the head of your friend and his innocent family  yes madam although many men do not think it so betting is a dishonourable thing and im ashamed of having done it  i repent mrs tipps the money burns my fingers and i must return it  dear me exclaimed the old lady quite unable to reply at once to such a gush  but captain lee did you not say that it is mean to accept money without working for it and yet you want me to accept five hundred pounds without working for it  oh monstrous sophistry cried the perplexed man grasping desperately the few hairs that remained on his polished head is there no difference then between presenting or accepting a gift and betting  are there not circumstances also in which poverty is unavoidable and the relief of it honourable as well as delightful not to mention the courtesies of life wherein giving and receiving in the right spirit and within reasonable limits are expressive of goodwill and conducive to general harmony  besides i do not offer a gift  i want to repay a debt by rights i ought to add compound interest to it for twenty years which would make it a thousand pounds  now do accept it mrs tipps cried the captain earnestly  but mrs tipps remained obdurate and the captain left her vowing that he would forthwith devote it as the nucleus of a fund to build a collegiate institute in cochinchina for the purpose of teaching icelandic to the japanese  captain lee thought better of it however and directed the fund to the purchase of frequent and valuable gifts to little joseph and his sister netta who had no scruples whatever in accepting them  afterwards when joseph became a stripling the captain being a director in the grand national trunk railway procured for his protege a situation on the line  to return to our story after this long digression  we left mrs tipps in the last chapter putting on her bonnet and shawl on philanthropic missions intent  she had just opened the door when a handsome gentlemanly youth apparently about one or two and twenty with a very slight swagger in his gait stepped up to it and lifting his hat said  mrs tipps i presume  i bring you a letter from clatterby station another messenger should have brought it but i undertook the duty partly for the purpose of introducing myself as your sons friend  i my name is gurwood  whatedwin gurwood about whom joseph speaks so frequently and for whom he has been trying to obtain a situation on the railway through our friend captain lee exclaimed mrs tipps  yes replied the youth somewhat confused by the earnestness of the old ladys gaze but pray read the letterthe telegrami fear  he stopped for mrs tipps had torn open the envelope and stood gazing at it with terrible anxiety depicted on her face  there is no cause for immediate fear i believe began edwin but mrs tipps interrupted him by slowly reading the telegram  from joseph tipps langrye station to mrs tipps eden villa clatterby  dear mother netta is not very wellnothing serious i hopedont be alarmedbut youd better come and nurse her  she is comfortably put up in my lodgings  mrs tipps grew deadly pale  young gurwood knowing what the message was having seen it taken down while lounging at the station had judiciously placed himself pretty close to the widow  observing her shudder he placed his strong arm behind her and adroitly sinking down on one knee received her on the other very much after the manner in which while at school he had been wont to act the part of second to pugilistic companions  mrs tipps recovered almost immediately sprang up and hurried into the house followed by gurwood  youll have time to catch the 630 train he said as mrs tipps fluttered to a cupboard and brought out a black bottle  thank you  yes ill go by that  you shall escort me to it  please ring the bell  the stout elderly femalenettas nurseanswered  come here durby said the widow quickly i want you to take this bottle of wine to a poor sick woman  i had intended to have gone myself but am called away suddenly and shant be back tonight  you shall hear from me tomorrow  lock up the house and stay with the woman to look after her if need beand now mr gurwood  they were gone beyond recall before mrs durby could recover herself  i never did see nothink like my poor missus she muttered there must be somethink wrong in the ead  but shes a good soul  with this comforting reflection mrs durby proceeded to obey her missuss commands  on reaching the station mrs tipps found that she had five minutes to wait so she thanked gurwood for escorting her bade him goodbye and was about to step into a thirdclass carriage when she observed captain lee close beside her with his daughter emma who we may remark in passing was a tall dark beautiful girl and the bosom friend of netta tipps  oh there is captain lee  how fortunate exclaimed mrs tipps he will take care of me  come mr gurwood i will introduce you to him and his daughter  she turned to gurwood but that youth did not hear her remark having been forced from her side by a noiseless luggage truck on indiarubber wheels  turning then towards the captain she found that he and his daughter had hastily run to recapture a small valise which was being borne off to the luggage van instead of going into the carriage along with them  at the same moment the guard intervened and the captain and his daughter were lost in the crowd  but edwin gurwood although he did not hear who they were had obtained a glance of the couple before they disappeared and that glance brief though it was had taken deadly effect  he had been shot straight to the heart  love at first sight and at railway speed is but a feeble way of expressing what had occurred  poor edwin gurwood up to this momentous day womanproof felt on beholding emma as if the combined powers of locomotive force and electric telegraphy had smitten him to the hearts core and for one moment he stood rooted to the earth or to speak more appropriatelynailed to the platform  recovering in a moment he made a dash into the crowd and spent the three remaining minutes in a wild search for the lost one  it was a marketday and the platform of clatterby station was densely crowded  sam natly the porter and his colleagues in office were besieged by all sorts of persons with all sorts of questions and it said much for the tempers of these harassed men that in the midst of their laborious duties they consented to be stopped with heavy weights on their shoulders and while perspiration streamed down their faces answered with perfect civility questions of the most ridiculous and unanswerable description  wheres my wife frantically cried an elderly gentleman seizing sam by the jacket  i dont know sir replied sam with a benignant smile  there she is shouted the elderly gentleman rushing past and nearly overturning sam  what a boar it must be to the poatas to b wearied so by stoopid people observed a tall stout superlative fop with sleepy eyes and long whiskers to another fop in largecheck trousers  yaas assented the checked trousers  take your seats gentlemen said a magnificent guard over six feet high with a bushy beard  oah said the dandies getting into their compartment  meanwhile edwin gurwood had discovered emma  he saw her enter a firstclass carriage  he saw her smile ineffably to her father  he heard the guard cry take your seats take your seats and knew that she was about to be torn from him perhaps for ever  he felt that it was a last look because how could he hope in a populous city to meet with her again  perhaps she did not even belong to that part of the country at all and was only passing through  he did not even know her name what was he to do  he resolved to travel with her but it instantly occurred to him that he had no ticket  he made a stride or two in the direction of the ticket office but paused remembering that he knew not her destination and that therefore he could not demand a ticket for any place in particular  doors began to slam and john marrots iron horse let off a little impatient steam  just then the late passenger arrived  there is always a late passenger at every train  on this occasion the late passenger was a shortsighted elderly gentleman in a brown topcoat and spectacles  he was accompanied by a friend who assisted him to push through the crowd of people who had come to see their friends away or were loitering about for pastime  the late passenger carried a bundle of wraps the boots of his hotel followed with his portmanteau  all right sir plenty of time observed sam natly coming up and receiving the portmanteau from boots  which class sir  ehohthird no stay second cried the shortsighted gentleman endeavouring vainly to open his purse to pay boots  here hold my wraps fred  his friend fred chanced at that moment to have been thrust aside by a fat female in frantic haste and edwin gurwood occupying the exact spot he had vacated had the bundle thrust into his hand  he retained it mechanically in utter abstraction of mind  the bell rang and the magnificent guard whose very whiskers curled with an air of calm serenity said now then take your seats make haste  edwin grew desperate  emma smiled bewitchingly to a doting female friend who had nodded and smiled bewitchingly to emma for the last five minutes under the impression that the train was just going to start and who earnestly wished that it would start and save her from the necessity of nodding or smiling any longer  am i to lose sight of her for ever muttered gurwood between his teeth  the magnificent guard sounded his whistle and held up his hand  edwin sprang forward pulled open the carriage door leaped in and sat down opposite emma lee  the iron horse gave two sharp responsive whistles and sent forth one mighty puff  the train moved but not with a jerk it is only clumsy drivers who jerk trains sometimes pulling them up too soon and having to make a needless plunge forward again or overrunning their stopping points and having to check abruptly so as to cause in timorous minds the impression that an accident has happened  in fact much more of ones comfort than is generally known depends upon ones driver being a good one  john marrot was known to the regular travellers on the line as a firstrate driver and some of them even took an interest in ascertaining that he was on the engine when they were about to go on a journey  it may be truly said of john that he never started his engine at all  he merely as it were insinuated the idea of motion to his iron steed and so glided softly away  just as the train moved the late passenger thrust head and shoulders out of the window waved his arms glared abroad and shouted or rather spluttered  my bbbundlewrapsruglost  a smart burly man with acute features stepped on the footboard of the carriage and moving with the train asked what sort of rug it was  eh a bbblue one wiwi  with interrupted the man black outside and noo straps  yeyeyesyes  all right sir you shall have it at the next station said the acutefaced man stepping on the platform and allowing the train to pass  as the guards van came up he leaped after the magnificent guard into his private apartment and shut the door  hallo  davy blunt somethin up asked the guard  yes joe turner there is somethin up replied the acute man leaning against the brakewheel  you saw that tall goodlookin feller wi the eyeglass and light whiskers  i did  seemed to me as if his wits had gone on wi the last train an he didnt know how to overtake em  i dont know about his wits said blunt but it seems to me that hes gone on in this train with somebody elses luggage  the guard whistlednot professionally but orally  you dont say so  the acute man nodded and leaning his elbows on the windowsill gazed at the prospect contemplatively  in a few minutes the 630 pm train was flying across country at the rate of thirtyfive or forty miles an hour    chapter four  a double dilemma and its consequences  meanwhile the tall goodlooking fellow with the eyeglass and light whiskers sat quaking opposite emma lee  the extreme absurdity not to say danger of his position as a traveller to nowhere without a ticket flashed upon him when too late and he would have cheerfully given fifty pounds had he possessed such a sum if the boards under his feet would have opened and let him drop between the rails  in fact he felt so confused and guilty thatalbeit not naturally a shy youthhe did not dare to look at emma for some time after starting but sat with downcast eyes revolving in his mind how he was to get out of the dilemma but the more he revolved the matter the more hopeless did his case appear at length he ventured to look at emma and their eyes encountered  of course gurwood looked pointedly out at the window and became fascinated by the landscape and of course emma looked out at the other window and became equally interested in the landscape  feeling very unhappy edwin soon after that took out a newspaper and tried to read but failed so completely that he gave it up in despair and laid the paper on the seat beside him  just then a happy thought flashed into his mind  he would go on to langrye station get out there and make a confidant of his friend joseph tipps who of course could easily get him out of his difficulty  he now felt as if a mighty load were lifted off his heart and his natural courage returning he put up his eyeglass which had been forgotten during the period of his humiliation and gazed at the prospect with increasing interestnow through the right window and then through the lefttaking occasion each time to glance with still greater interest at emma lees beautiful countenance  the captain whose disposition was sociable and who had chatted a good deal with his daughter while their visavis was in his agony soon took occasion to remark that the scenery was very fine  edwin gazing at the black walls of a tunnel into which they plunged and thinking of emmas face replied that it wasextremely  emerging from the tunnel and observing the least possible approach to a smile on  emmas lips edwin remarked to the captain that railway travelling presented rather abrupt changes and contrasts in scenery  the captain laughingly agreed with this and so from one thing to another they went on until the two got into a lively conversationcaptain lee thinking his travelling companion an extremely agreeable young fellow and edwin esteeming the captain one of the jolliest old boys he had ever met  these are the very words he used long after in commenting on this meeting to his friend joseph tipps  during a pause in the conversation emma asked her father to whom a certain villa they were passing belonged  i dont know replied the captain stay let me see i ought to know most of the places hereaboutsno i cant remember  i rather think it belongs to a colonel jones said gurwood for the first time venturing to address emma directly  a friend of mine who is connected with this railway knows him and has often spoken to me about him  the colonel has led an extremely adventurous life i believe  indeed  there was not much apparently in that little word but there must have been something mysterious in it for it caused edwins heart to leap as it had never leapt before  on the strength of it he began to relate some of colonel joness adventures addressing himself now partly to the captain and partly to emma  he had a happy knack of telling a story and had thoroughly interested his hearers when the train slowed and stopped but as this was not the station at which he meant to get out langrye being the nexthe took no notice of the stoppage  neither did he pay any regard to a question asked by the acute man whose face appeared at the window as soon as the train stopped  is that your bundle sir repeated mr blunt a little louder  eh yes yesall right replied edwin annoyed at the interruption and thinking only of emma lee to whom he turned and went onwell when colonel jones had scaled the first wall  come sir said blunt entering the carriage and laying his hand on edwins shoulder its not all right  this is another mans property  the youth turned round indignantly and with a flushed countenance said what do you mean  i mean that you are travelling with another mans property said blunt quietly pointing to the strapped rug  that is not my property said edwin looking at it with a perplexed air i never said it was  didnt you though exclaimed blunt with an appealing look to the captain  didnt you say when i asked you yes its all right moreover young man if its not yours why did you bring it into the carriage with you  i did not bring it into the carriage said edwin firmly and with increasing indignation  i came down to this train with a lady who is now in it and who can vouch for it that i brought no luggage of any kind with me  i  at this moment the elderly gentleman with brown topcoat and spectacles bustled up to the carriage recognised his rug and claimed it with a good deal of fuss and noise  where are you travelling to demanded blunt with a touch of sarcasm in his tone  poor gurwoods countenance fell  he became somewhat pale and said in a much less resolute voice you have no right to ask that question but since you suspect me i may tell you that i am going to langrye  show your ticket said the guard looking in at that moment  a glance showed the unhappy youth that captain lee was regarding him with surprise and emma with intense pity  desperation gave him courage he turned abruptly to the captain and said  i regret deeply sir that we part with such a foul suspicion hanging over me  come he added sternly to blunt i will go with you and shall soon prove myself innocent  he leaped to the platform closely accompanied by blunt  where do you intend to take me he asked turning to his guardian whom he now knew to be a detective  here step this way said blunt leading his prisoner towards the rear of the train  such a nicelooking young man too whod ave thought it whispered one of the many heads that were thrust out at the carriagewindows to look at him as he passed  get in here said blunt holding open the door of an empty secondclass compartment of the same train we shant want a ticket for this part of the journey  but the lady i mentioned said poor edwin she can  you can see her at langrye young man come get in said blunt sternly the trains just starting  edwins blood boiled  he turned to smite the acutevisaged man to the earth but encountering the serene gaze of the magnificent guard who stood close beside him he changed his mind and sprang into the carriage  blunt followed the door was banged and locked the signal was given and the train moved on  why do you take me to langrye instead of back to town asked edwin after proceeding some distance in silence  because we have an hour to wait for the up train and its pleasanter waiting there than here replied blunt besides i have business at langrye i want to see one of my friends there who is looking after lightfingered gentry  as this was said significantly edwin did not deign a reply but leaning back in a corner gazed out at the window and brooded over his unhappy fate  truly he had something to brood over  besides being in the unpleasant position which we have described he had quite recently lost his only relative a rich uncle as he was called who had brought edwin up and had led him to believe that he should be his heir  it was found however on the examination of the old gentlemans affairs that his fortune was a myth and that his house furniture and personal effects would have to be sold in order to pay his debts  when all was settled edwin gurwood found himself cast upon his own resources with good health a kind but wayward disposition a strong handsome frame a middling education and between three and four hundred pounds in his pocket  he soon found that this amount of capital melted with alarming rapidity under the influence of a good appetite and expensive tastes so he resolved at once to commence work of some kind  but what was he to turn to  his uncle had allowed him to do as he pleased  naturally it pleased the energetic and enthusiastic boy to learn very little of anything useful to read an immense amount of light literature and to indulge in much openair exercise  bitterly did he now feel poor fellow that this course although somewhat pleasing at the time did not fit him to use and enjoy the more advanced period of life  he had disliked and refused to sit still even for an hour at a time in boyhood it now began to dawn upon him that he was doomed for life to the greatest of all his horrors the top of a threelegged stool  he had hated writing and figures and now visions of ledgers cashbooks invoicebooks and similar literature with endless arithmetical calculations began to float before his mental vision  with intense regret he reflected that if he had only used reasonably well the brief period of life which as yet lay behind him he might by that time have been done with initial drudgery and have been entering on a brilliant career in one of the learned professions  as to the army and navy he was too old to get into either even if he had possessed interest which he did not  sternly did he reproach his departed uncle when he brooded over his wrongs and soliloquised thusyou ought to have known that i was a fool that i could not be expected to know the fact or to guide myself aright in opposition to and despite of my own folly and you ought to have forced me to study when i declined to be ledbah its too late to say all this now come if there is any manhood in me worthy of the name let me set to work at once and make the most of what is left to me  edwin reflected with complacency on the fact that one part of what was left to him was a tall strong frame and broad shoulders but his judgment told him that though these were blessings not to be despised and for which he had every reason to be thankful he ought not to plume himself too much on them seeing that he shared them in common with numerous prizefighters and burglars besides which they could not prove of very much value professionally unless he took to mining or coalheaving  he also reflected sadly on the fact that beyond the three rs a little latin and french and a smattering of literary knowledge he was little better than a red indian  being as we have said a resolute fellow he determined to commence a course of study without delay but soon found that the necessity of endeavouring to obtain a situation and of economising his slender fortune interfered sadly with his efforts  however he persevered  in the time of his prosperity young gurwood had made many friends but a touch of pride had induced him to turn aside from thesealthough many of them would undoubtedly have been glad to aid him in his aimsto quit the house of his childhood and betake himself to the flourishing town of clatterby where he knew nobody except one soft amiable little schoolfellow whom in boyish days he had always deemed a poor miserable little creature but for whom nevertheless he entertained a strong affection  we need scarcely say that this was joseph tipps the clerk at langrye station    chapter five  an accident and its consequences  locomotives and telegraphy are mere snails compared to thought  let us therefore use our advantage reader stride in advance of the 630 pm train which by the way has now become a 745 pm train and see what little joseph tipps is doing  there he standsfive feet four in his highestheeled bootsas sterling and warmhearted a little man as ever breathed  he was writing at a little desk close to a large window which owing to the station being a temporary one and its roof low was flimsy and came nearer to the ground than most windows do  mr tipps wrote somewhat nervously  he inherited his mothers weakness in this respect and besides his nerves had been a little shaken by the sudden illness with which his sister had been seized that day at his lodgings  outside on the platform a few people lounged waiting the arrival of the expected train  among them was one whose bulky frame and firm stronglylined countenance spoke of much power to dare and do  he was considerably above the middle height and somewhere about middle age his costume was of that quiet unobtrusive kind which seems to court retirement and the sharp glance of his eyes seemed to possess something of the gimblet in their penetrating power  this was no less a personage than mr sharp the inspector of police on the grand national trunk railway  mr inspector sharp had evidently an eye for the beautiful for he stood at the farther extremity of the platform gazing in rapt attention at the sun which just then was setting in a flood of golden light  but mr sharp had also a peculiar faculty for observing several things at once  indeed some of his friends referring to this were wont to remark that he was a perfect argus with eyes in his elbows and calves and back of his head  it would seem indeed that this or something like it must really have been the case for he not only observed and enjoyed the sunset but also paid particular attention to the conversation of two men who stood not far from him and at the same time was cognisant of the fact that behind him a couple of hundred yards or more up the line a goods engine was engaged in shunting trucks  this process of shunting we may explain for the benefit of those who dont know consists in detaching trucks from trains of goods and shoving them into sidings so that they may be out of the way until their time comes to be attached to other trains which will convey them to their proper destination or to have their contents if need be unloaded and distributed among other trucks  shunting is sometimes a tedious process involving much hauling pushing puffing and whistling on the part of the engine and uncoupling of trucks and shifting of points on the part of pointsmen and porters  there is considerable danger too in the processor rather there was danger before the introduction of the block system which now when it is adopted renders accidents almost impossibleof which system more shall be said hereafter  the danger lies in this that shunting has frequently to be done during intervals between the passing of passengertrains and on lines where passenger and goods traffic is very great these intervals are sometimes extremely brief  but strange to say this danger is the mother of safety for the difficulty of conducting extensive traffic is so great that a combination of all but perfect systems of signalling telegraphing and organisation is absolutely needful to prevent constant mishap  hence the marvellous result that in the midst of danger we are in safety and travelling by railway is really less dangerous than travelling by stagecoach used to be in days of old  yes timid reader we assure you that if you travel daily by rail your chances of coming to grief are very much fewer than if you were to travel daily by mail coach  facts and figures prove this beyond all doubt so that we are entitled to take the comfort of it the marvel is not that loss of life is so great but that it is so small  do you doubt it reader  behold the facts and figureswonder be thankful and doubt no more  a blue book captain tylers general report to the board of trade on railway accidents during the year 1870 tells us that the number of passengers killed on railways last year was ninety  the number of passenger journeys performed was 307 millions which gives in round numbers one passenger killed for every three and a half millions that travelled  in the best mail and stagecoaching days the yearly number of travellers was about two millions  the present railway deathrate applied to this number amounts to a little more than onehalf of a unit  will any one out of bedlam have the audacity to say that in coaching days only half a passenger was killed each year  we leave facts to speak for themselves and commonsense to judge whether men were safer then than they are now  but to return  when mr sharp was looking at the distant waggons that were being shunted he observed that the engine which conducted the operation was moved about with so much unnecessary fuss and jerking that he concluded it must be worked by a new or at all events a bad driver he shook his head therefore pulled out his watch and muttered to himself that it seemed to him far too near the time of the arrival of a train to make it safe to do such work  the calculations however had been made correctly and the train of trucks would have been well out of the way if the driver had been a smarter man  even as things stood however there should have been no danger because the distant signal was turned to danger which thus said to any approaching train stop for your life  but here occurred one of these mistakes or pieces of carelessness or thoughtlessness to which weak and sinful human nature is and we suppose always will be liable  perhaps the signalman thought the goods train had completed its operation or fancied that the express was not so near as it proved to be or he got confusedwe cannot tell there is no accounting for such things but whatever the cause he turned off the dangersignal half a minute too soon and set the line free  suddenly the down train came tearing round the curve  it was at reduced speed certainly but not sufficiently reduced to avoid a collision with the trucks on a part of the line where no trucks should be  our friend john marrot was on the lookout of course and so was his mate  they saw the trucks at once  like lightning john shut off the steam and at the same instant touched his whistle several sharp shrieks which was the alarm to the guard to turn on his brakes  no men could have been more prompt or cool  joe turner and will garvie had on full brakepower in a second or two  at the same time john marrot instantly reversing the engine let on full steambut all in vain  fire flew in showers from the shrieking wheelsthe friction on the rails must have been tremendous nevertheless the engine dashed into the goods train like a thunderbolt with a stunning crash and a noise that is quite indescribable  the police superintendent who was all but run over stood for a few seconds aghast at the sight and at the action of the engine  not satisfied with sending one of its own carriages into splinters the iron horse made three terrific plunges or efforts to advance and at each plunge a heavy truck full of goods was as it were pawed under its wheels and driven out behind under the tender in the form of a mass of matchwoodall the goods hard and soft as well as the heavy frame of the truck itself being minced up together in a manner that defies description  it seemed as though the monster had been suddenly endued with intelligence and was seeking to vent its horrid rage on the thing that had dared to check its pace  three loaded trucks it crushed down overran and scattered wide in this way in three successive plunges and then rushing on a few yards among chaotic debris turned slowly on its side and hurled the driver and fireman over the embankment  the shock received by the people at the station was tremendous  poor tipps standing at his desk was strucknervouslyas if by electricity  he made one wild involuntary bolt right through the window as if it had been made of tissue paper and did not cease to run until he found himself panting in the middle of a turnipfield that lay at the back of the station  turning round ashamed of himself he ran back faster than he had run away and leaping recklessly among the debris began to pull broken and jagged timber about under the impression that he was rescuing fellowcreatures from destruction  strange to say no one was killed on that occasionno one was even severely hurt except the driver  but of course this was not known at first and the people who were standing about hurried with terrible forebodings to lend assistance to the passengers  mr sharp seemed to have been smitten with feelings somewhat similar to those of tipps for without knowing very well how or why he suddenly found himself standing up to the armpits in debris heaving might and main at masses of timber  hallo lift away this beam will you shouted a halfsmothered voice close beside him  it came from beneath the carriage that we have described as having been broken to splinters  sharp was a man of action  he hailed a porter near him and began with energy and power to tear up and hurl aside the boards  presently on raising part of the broken framework of the carriage a man struggled to his feet and wiping away the blood that flowed from a wound in his forehead revealed the countenance of edwin gurwood to the astonished tipps  what  edwin he exclaimed  aydont stand there man  your mother is in the train  poor tipps could not speakhe could only gasp the word where  in a thirdclass behindthere it is safe i see  his friend at once leaped towards the vehicle pointed out but edwin did not follow he glanced wildly round in search of another carriage  you are hurtmr gurwood if i mistake notlean on me said mr sharp  its nothingonly a scratch  ha thats the carriage follow me cried edwin struggling towards a firstclass carriage which appeared considerably damaged though it had not left the rails  he wrenched open the door and springing in found captain lee striving in vain to lift his daughter who had fainted  edwin stooped raised her in his arms and kicking open the door on the opposite side leaped down followed by the captain  they quickly made their way to the station where they found most of the passengers hurt and unhurt already assembled with two doctors who chanced to be in the train attending to them  edwin laid his light burden tenderly on a couch and one of the doctors immediately attended to her  while he was applying restoratives mr blunt touched edwin on the elbow and requested him to follow him  with a feeling of sudden anger gurwood turned round but before he could speak his eye fell on mrs tipps who sat on a bench leaning on her sons breast and looking deadly pale but quite composed  my dear mrs tipps exclaimed the youth stepping hastily forward i hopei trust  oh edwinthank you my dear fellow cried joseph grasping his hand and shaking it  she is not hurt thank godnot even a scratchonly a little shaken  fetch a glass of water youll find one in the bookingoffice  gurwood ran out to fetch it  as he was returning he met captain lee leading his daughter out of the waitingroom  i sincerely hope that your daughter is not hurt he said in earnest tones  perhaps a little water might  no thank you said the captain somewhat stiffly  the carriage is waiting sir said a servant in livery coming up at the moment and touching his hat  emma looked at edwin for a second and with a slight but perplexed smile of acknowledgment passed on  next moment the carriage drove away and she was gone  edwin at the same time became aware of the fact that the pertinacious blunt was at his side  walking quickly into the waitingroom he presented the glass of water to mrs tipps but to his surprise that eccentric lady rose hastily and saidthank you mr gurwood many thanks but i am better  come josephlet us hasten to our darling netta  have you sent for a fly  there is one waiting mothertake my arm  many many thanks for your kindness in coming with her gurwood said tipps  i cant ask you to come with me just now i  the rest of his speech was lost in consequence of the impatient old lady dragging her son away but what had been heard of it was sufficient to fill mr blunt with surprise and perplexity  well blunt said mr superintendent sharp coming up at that moment what has brought you here  the detective related his story privately to his superior and remarked that he began to fear there must be some mistake  yes there is a mistake of some sort said sharp with a laugh for ive met him frequently at clatterby station and know him to be a friend of mr tipps but you have done your duty blunt so you can now leave the gentleman to me saying which he went up to edwin and entered into an undertoned conversation with him during which it might have been observed that edwin looked a little confused at times and mr sharp seemed not a little amused  well its all right he said at last we have telegraphed for a special train to take on the passengers who wish to proceed and you can go back if you choose in the up train which is about due  it will be able to get past in the course of halfanhour  fortunately the rails of the upline are not damaged and the wreck can soon be cleared  just then the dandy with the sleepy eyes and long whiskers sauntered up to the porter on duty with an unconcerned and lazy air  he had received no further injury than a shaking and therefore felt that he could afford to affect a cool and noteasytoberuffled demeanour  awpotaw said he twirling his watchkey wen dyou expect anotha twain to take us on  dont know sir probably halfanhour  aw  dooced awkwad  my fwend has got the bwidge of his nose damaged besides some sort of internal injuway and wont be able to attend to business tonight i feardooced awkwad  dyou hear that whispered sharp to gurwood as the fwend in questionhe with the checked trouserssauntered past holding a handkerchief to his nose  i know by the way in which that was said that there will be something more heard some day hence of our fop in checks  just come and stand with me in the doorway of the waitingroom and listen to what some of the other passengers are saying  very hard observed a middleaged man with a sour countenance who did not present the appearance of one who had sustained any injury at all very hard this  i shall miss meeting with a friend and perhaps lose doin a good stroke of business tonight  be thankful you havent lost your life said will garvie who supported the head of his injured mate  mayhap i have lost my life young man replied the other sharply internal injuries from accidents often prove fatal and dont always show at first  ive had a severe shake  here the sourfaced man shook himself slightly partly to illustrate and partly to prove his point  youre quite right sur remarked an irishman who had a bandage tied round his head but who did not appear to be much if at all the worse of the accident  its a disgrace intirely that the railways should be allowed to trait us in this fashion  if theyd only go to the trouble an expense of havin proper signals on lines there would be nothing o this kind  and if government would make a law to have an armchair fitted up in front of every locomotive and a director made to travel with sich train wed hear of fewer accidents  but its meself ll come down on em for heavy damages for this  he pointed to his bandaged head and nodded with a significant glance at the company  a gentleman in a blue travellingcap who had hitherto said nothing and who turned out to have received severer injuries than any other passenger here looked up impatiently and said  it appears to me that there is a great deal of unjust and foolish talk against railway companies as if they any more than other companies could avoid accidents  the system of signalling on a great part of this line is the best that has been discovered up to this date and it is being applied to the whole line as fast as circumstances will warrant but you cant expect to attain perfection in a day  what would you have  how can you expect to travel at the rate you do and yet be as safe as if you were in one of the old mailcoaches  right sir youre right cried john marrot energetically raising himself a little from the bench on which he lay right in sayin we shouldnt ought to expect parfection but wrong in supposin the old mailcoaches was safer  wy railways is safer  they wont stand no comparison  here ave i bin drivin on this ere line for the last eight year an only to come to grief three times an killed no more than two people  there aint a old coach goin or gone as could say as much  an wen you come to consider that in them eight years ive bin goin more than twothirds o the time at an average o forty mile an houroff an onall night amost as well as all day an run thousands and thousands o miles besides carryin millions of passengers more or less it do seem most rediklous to go for to say that coaches was safer than railwaysthe revarse bein the truth  turn me round a bit bill so thatll do  its the bad leg i come down on else i shouldnt have bin so hardup  yes sir as you truly remark railway companies aint fairly dealt with by no means  at this point the attention of the passengers was attracted by a remarkably fat woman who had hitherto lain quietly on a couch breathing in a somewhat stertorous manner  one of the medical men had been so successful in his attention to her as to bring her to a state of consciousness  indeed she had been more or less in this condition for some time past but feeling rather comfortable than otherwise and dreamy she had lain still and enjoyed herself  being roused however to a state of activity by means of smellingsalts and hearing the doctor remark that except a shaking she appeared to have sustained no injury this stout woman deemed it prudent to go off into hysterics and began by uttering a yell that would have put to shame a comanchee indian and did more damage perhaps to the nerves of her sensitive hearers than the accident itself  she followed it up by drumming heavily on the couch with her heels  singularly enough her yell was replied to by the whistle of the up train that had been due for some time past  she retorted by a renewed shriek and became frantic in her assurances that no power yet discoveredwhether mechanical moral or otherwisecould or would ever persuade her to set foot again in a railway train  it was of no use to assure her that no one meant to exert such a power even if he possessed it that she was free to go where she pleased and whenever she felt inclined  the more that stout woman was implored to compose herself the more she discomposed herself and everybody else and the more she was besought to be calm the more a great deal did she fill the waitingroom with hysterical shrieks and fiendish laughter until at last every one was glad to go out of the place and get into the train that was waiting to take them back to clatterby  then the stout woman became suddenly calm and declared to a porterwho must have had a heart of stone so indifferent was he to her woesthat she would be glad to proceed to the nearest otel if e would be good enough to fetch her a fly  hm said mr sharp as he and young gurwood entered a carriage together after having seen john marrot placed on a pile of rugs on the floor of a firstclass carriage theres been work brewin up for me tonight  how  what do you mean asked edwin  i mean that from various indications which i observed this evening we are likely to have some little correspondence with the passengers of the 630 pm train  however were used to it perhaps well get not to mind it in course of time  we do all that we can to accommodate the publicfit up our carriages and stations in the best style compatible with giving our shareholders a small dividendcarry them to and fro over the land at little short of lightning speed every day and all day and night too for extremely moderate fares and with excessive safety and exceeding comfort enable them to live in the country and do business in the city as well as afford facilities for visiting the very ends of the earth in a few days not to mention other innumerable blessings to which we run them or which we run to them and yet no sooner does a rare accident occur as it will occur in every human institution though it occurs less on railways than in most other institutions than down comes this ungrateful public upon us with indignant cries of disgraceful and in many cases unreasonable demands for compensation  such is life said gurwood with a smile  on the rail added mr superintendent sharp with a sigh as the whistle sounded and the train moved slowly out of the station    chapter six  history of the iron horse  having gone thus far in our tale permit us good reader to turn aside for a little to make a somewhat closer inspection of the iron horse and his belongings  railways existed long before the iron horse was born  they sprang into being two centuries ago in the form of tramways which at first were nothing more or less than planks or rails of timber laid down between the newcastleontyne collieries and the river for the purpose of forming a better way over which to run the coaltrucks  from simple timberrails men soon advanced to planks having a strip of iron nailed on their surface to prevent too rapid tear and wear but it was not till the year 1767 that castiron rails were introduced  in order to prevent the trucks from slipping off the line the rails were cast with an upright flange or guide at one side and were laid on wooden or stone sleepers  this form of rail being found inconvenient the flange was transferred from the rails to the wheels and this arrangement under various modifications has been ever since retained  these innocent railroadsas they have been sometimes and most appropriately named seeing that they were guiltless alike of blood and high speedwere drawn by horses and confined at first to the conveyance of coals  modest though their pretensions were however they were found to be an immense improvement on the ordinary roads insomuch that ten horses were found to be capable of working the traffic on railroads which it required 400 horses to perform on a common road these iron roads therefore began to multiply and about the beginning of the present century they were largely employed in the coalfields and mineral districts of the kingdom  about the same time thoughtful men seeing the immense advantage of such ways began to suggest the formation of railways or tramways to run along the side of our turnpikeroadsa mode of conveyance by the way in regard to towns which thoughtful men are still ever at the present day of supposed enlightenment endeavouring to urge upon an unbelieving publica mode of conveyance which we feel very confident will entirely supersede our cumbrous and antiquated bus in a very short time  what we ask in the name of science and art and commonsense is to prevent a tramway being laid from kensington to the bank or elsewhere which shall be traversed by a succession of roomy carriages following each other every five minutes which tramway might be crossed and recrossed and run upon or in other words used by all the other vehicles of london except when the rightful carriages were in the way  nothing prevents save that same unbelief which has obstructed the development of every good thing from the time that noah built the ark  but we feel assured that the thing shall be and those who read this book may perhaps live to see it  but to return  among these thoughtful and farseeing men was one dr james anderson who in 1800 proposed the formation of railways by the roadsides and he was so correct in his views that the plans which he suggested of keeping the level by going round the base of hills or forming viaducts or cutting tunnels is precisely the method practised by engineers of the present day  two years later a mr edgeworth announced that he had long before formed the project of laying iron railways for baggage waggons on the great roads of england and in order to prevent tear and wear he proposed instead of conveying heavy loads in one huge waggon to have a train of small waggons  with the modesty of true genius which never overestimates or forms wildly sanguine expectations he thought that each waggon might perhaps carry one ton and a half  edgeworth also suggested that passengers might travel by such a mode of conveyance  bold man  what a goose many people of his day must have thought him  if they had been alive now what geese they might have thought themselves  the society of arts however were in advance of their time  they rewarded edgeworth with their gold medal  this man seems to have been a transcendent genius because he not only devised and made on a small scale iron railways but proposed to take ordinary vehicles such as mailcoaches and private carriages on his trucks and convey them along his line at the rate of six or eight miles an hour with one horse  he also propounded the idea of the employment of stationary steamengines locomotives not having been dreamed of to drag the trains up steep inclines  another semiprophetic man of these days was thomas gray of leeds who in 1820 published a work on what he styled a general iron railway or land steam conveyance to supersede the necessity of horses in all public vehicles showing its vast superiority in every respect over the present pitiful methods of conveyance by turnpikeroads and canals gray whose mind appears to have been unusually comprehensive proposed a system of railway communication between all the important cities and towns in the kingdom and pointed out the immense advantage that would be gained to commerce by such a ready and rapid means of conveying fish vegetables and other perishable articles from place to place  he also showed that two post deliveries in the day would become possible and that fire insurance companies would be able to promote their interests by keeping railway fireengines ready to be transported to scenes of conflagration without delay  but gray was not esteemed a prophet  his suggestions were not adopted nor his plans acted on though unquestionably his wisdom and energy gave an impulse to railway development of which we are reaping the benefit today  his labours were not in vain  horse railways soon began to multiply over the country  the first authorised by act of parliament was the surrey railway in 1801  twenty years later twenty lines of railway were in operation  about this time too another man of note and of great scientific and mechanical sagacity lent his powerful aid to advance the interests of the railway cause  this was charles maclaren of edinburgh editor of the scotsman newspaper for nearly thirty years  he had long foreseen and boldly asserted his belief in the certain success of steam locomotion by rail at a time when opinions such as his were scouted as wild delusive dreams  but he did more he brought his able pen to bear on the subject and in december 1825 published a series of articles in the scotsman on the subject of railways which were not only extensively quoted and republished in this country and in america but were deemed worthy of being translated into french and german and so disseminated over europe  mr maclaren was thus among the foremost of those who gave a telling impulse to the cause at that critical period when the iron horse was about to be put on the railthe right horse in the right placefor it was not many years afterwards that that auspicious event took place  mr maclaren not only advocated generally the adoption of railways but logically demonstrated the wonderful powers and capacities of the steam locomotive arguing from the experiments on friction made more than half a century before by vince and colomb that by the use of steampower on railroads a much more rapid and cheaper transit of persons as well as merchandise might be confidently anticipated  he leaped far ahead of many of even the most hopeful advocates of the cause and with almost prophetic foresight wrote there is scarcely any limit to the rapidity of movement these iron pathways will enable us to command  and againwe have spoken of vehicles travelling at twenty miles an hour but we see no reason for thinking that in the progress of improvement a much higher velocity might not be found practicable and in twenty years hence a shopkeeper or mechanic on the most ordinary occasion may probably travel with a speed that would leave the fleetest courser behind  wonderful words these  at a first glance we may not deem them so being so familiar with the ideas which they convey but our estimate of them will be more just if we reflect that when they were penned railways had scarcely sprung into being steam locomotives had only just been born and not only men in general but even many learned scientific and practical men regarded the statement of all such opinions as being little short of insanity  nevertheless many deepthinking men thought differently and one contemporary reviewing this subject in after years said of mr maclarens papers that they prepared the way for the success of railway projectors  we have said that the steam locomotivethe material transformer of the worldour iron horse had just been born  it was not however born on the rails but on the common road and a tremendous babygiant it was tearing up its cradle in such furious fashion that men were terrified by it and tried their best to condemn it to inactivity just as a weak and foolish father might lock up his unruly boy and restrain him perforce instead of training him wisely in the way in which he should go  but the progenitors of the iron horse were like their herculean child men of mettle  they fought a gallant fight for their darlings freedom and came off victorious  of course many men and many nations were anxious to father this magnificent infant and to this day it is impossible to say precisely who originated him  he is said by some to have sprung from the brains of englishmen others assert that brains in france and switzerland begat him and we believe that brother jonathan exercised his prolific brain on him before the actual time of his birth  the first name on record in connexion with this infant hercules is that of dr robison who communicated his ideas to watt in 1759  the latter thereupon made a model locomotive but entertained doubts as to its safety  oliver evans of philadelphia patented a steam waggon in 1782  william murdoch the friend and assistant of watt made a model in 1787 which drew a small waggon round a room in his house in cornwall  in the same year symington exhibited a model locomotive in edinburgh and in 1795 he worked a steamengine on a turnpikeroad in lanarkshire  richard trevethick who had seen murdochs model made and patented a locomotive in 1802  it drew on a tramway a load of ten tons at the rate of five miles an hour  trevethick also made a carriage to run on common roads and altogether did good service in the cause  blenkinsop of middleton colliery near leeds made locomotives in 1811 which hauled coals up steep ascents by means of a toothed rail with a toothed propelling wheel working into it  this unnatural infant however turned out to be not the true child  it was found that such a powerful creature did not require teeth at all that he could bite quite well enough by means of his weight aloneso the teeth were plucked out and never allowed to grow again  after this in 1813 came brunton of butterley with a curious contrivance in the form of legs and feet which were attached to the rear of his engine and propelled it by a sort of walking motion  it did not walk well however and very soon walked off the field of competition altogether  at last in the fulness of time there came upon the scene the great railway king george stephenson who if he cannot be said to have begotten the infant at all events brought him up and effectually completed his training  george stephenson was one of our most celebrated engineers and the father of the railway system  he may truly be said to have been one of mankinds greatest benefactors  he was a selftaught man was born near newcastle in 1781 began life as a pitengine boy with wages at twopence a day and ultimately rose to fame and fortune as an engineer  in 1814 he made a locomotive for the killingworth colliery railway  it drew thirty tons at the rate of four miles an hour and was regarded as a great success  in 1825 an engine of the same kind was used on the stockton and darlington railway of which stephenson had been made engineer  but the great crowning effort of stephenson and the grand impulse to the railway cause which carried it steadily and swiftly on to its present amazing degree of prosperity did not occur till the year 1829  previous to that date the manchester and liverpool railway was being constructed and so little was known as to the capabilities of railways and the best mode of working them that the directors and engineers had some difficulty in deciding whether the line should be worked by fixed engines or by locomotives  it was ultimately decided that the latter should be used and a premium of 500 pounds was offered for the best locomotive that could be produced in accordance with certain conditions  these werethat the chimney should emit no smokethat the engine should be on springsthat it should not weigh more than six tons or fourandahalf tons if it had only four wheelsthat it should be able to draw a load of twenty tons at the rate of ten miles an hour with a pressure of fifty pounds to the square inch in the boiler and should not cost more than 500 pounds  the iron horse was now at last about to assume its right position  it was no longer an infant but a powerful striplingthough still far from its full growth as far as six tons is from sixty  four iron steeds were entered to compete for the prize  it was in october 1829 that this celebrated trial came off and great was the interest manifested on the occasion for not only did the public entertain doubts as to the capabilities of locomotives but very few even of the engineers of the country would admit the possibility of a locomotive engine attaining a speed greater than ten miles an hour first came the novelty of braithwaite and ericson then the sans pareil of hawkworth the perseverance of burstall and lastly the rocket of stephenson  of the first three we shall merely say that the novelty being weak in the wheels broke down the sans pareil burst one of her cylinders and the perseverance turned out to be too heavy to comply with the conditions of the trial  the rocket advanced and was harnessed to a train of waggons weighing thirteen tons the fire was lighted and the steam got up  the valves lifted at the stipulated fifty pounds pressure and away it went with its load at an average speed of fifteen and a maximum speed of twentynine miles an hour  thus triumphantly the rocket won the prize of 500 pounds and the iron horse was fairly and finally married to the iron road  one of the important elements of stephensons success lay in the introduction of numerous tubes into his boiler through which the fire and heat passed and thus presented a vast amount of heating surface to the water  another point was his allowing the waste steam to pass through the chimney thus increasing the draught and intensifying the combustion for heat is the life of the locomotive and without much of this high rates of speed could not be attained  the difference between the first locomotive and those now in use is very greatas may be seen any day in london by any one who chooses to visit one of our great railway stations and go thence to the kensington museum where the rocket is now enshrineda memorial of stephensons wisdom and of the beginning of our magnificent railway system  yet though the difference be great it is wonderful how complete the rocket was all things considered  the modern improvements made on locomotives consist chiefly in clothing the boiler with wood felt and other nonconductors to increase the lifegiving heat in heating the feedwater coupling the drivingwheels working the cylinders horizontally economising steam by cutting off the supply at any part of the stroke that may be required and economising fuel by using raw coal instead of coke and consuming the smoke besides many other minor contrivances but all the great principles affecting the locomotive were applied by george stephenson and illustrated in the rocket  it is no wonder that the first iron horse was clumsy in appearance and somewhat grotesque owing to the complication of rods cranks and other machinery which was all exposed to view  it required years of experience to enable our engineers to construct the grand massive simple chargers which now run off with our monstertrains as if they were feathers  when the iron horse was first made men were naturally in haste to ascertain his power and paces  he was trotted out so to speak in his skeleton with his heart and lungs and muscles exposed to view in complex hideosity  nowadays he never appears without his skin wellgroomed and made gay with paint and polished brass and steel  we have said that the rocket drew thirteen tons at nearly thirty miles an hour  our best engines can now draw hundreds of tons and they can run at the rate of above sixty miles an hour at maximum speed  the more ordinary speed however for passengertrains is from thirty to fortyfive miles an hour  the weight of the rocket was six tons that of some of our largest engines with tenders is from forty to above fifty tons  from the time of the opening of the old manchester and liverpool railway in 1830 to the present daya period of little more than forty years railway construction has gone forward throughout the landand we may add the worldwith truly railway speed insomuch that england has become covered from end to end with an absolute network of iron roads and the benefit to our country has been inconceivably great  it would require a large volume to treat of these and correlative subjects as they deserve  two hundred years ago the course of post between london and edinburgh was one month before an answer could be received two months had to elapse  about a hundred years later there was one stagecoach between the two cities which did the distance in a fortnight rendering communication and reply possible once in each month  in those days roads were uncommonly bad  one writer tells us that while travelling in lancashire a county now traversed by railways in all directions he found one of the principal roads so bad that there were ruts in it which he measured four feet deep and that the only mending it received was the tumbling of stones into these holes to fill them up  the extremely limited goods traffic of the country was conducted by the slow means of carts and waggons  enterprising men however then as now were pushing the world forward though they were by no means so numerous then as now  in 1673 it took a week to travel between london and exeter and cost from forty to fortyfive shillings  about the same period a sixhorse coach took six days to perform the journey between edinburgh and glasgow and back  to accomplish fifty miles or thereabouts in two days with a sixhorse stagecoach was considered good work and high speed about the beginning of last century  near the middle of it 1740 travelling by night was for the first time introduced and soon after that a coach was started with a wickerbasket slung behind for outside passengers  some years afterwards an enterprising individual started a flying coach drawn by eight horses which travelled between london and dover in a daythe fare being one guinea  even at the beginning of the present century four miles an hour was deemed a very fair rate of travelling for a stagecoach  with the improvement of roads by the famous macadam in 1816 began improved travelling and increased speed  the process was rapid mailcoaches began to overrun the country in all directions at the then remarkable pace of from eight to ten miles an hourand let us remark in passing there was a whirl and dash about these stagecoaches which railway trains with all their velocity can never hope to attain to except when they dash into each other  man is but a weak creature in some senses  facts are scarcely facts to him unless they touch his eye or ear  the smooth run of a train at twenty or even thirty miles an hour with its gradual start and gentle pull up has but a slight effect on him now compared with the splendid swing of the wellappointed mail coach of old as it swept round the bend of a road and with redcoated driver and guard cracking whip flying dust and stones and reeking foamflecked horses dashed into town and pulled up while at nearly full speed amid all the glorious crash and turmoil of arrival  no doubt the passing of an express train within a yard of your nose is something peculiarly awful and if you ever get permission to ride on the engine of an express the real truth regarding speed weight momentum will make a profound impression on you but in ordinary circumstances the arrival of a train cannot for a moment compare with the dash the animal spirit the enthusiasm the romance of the mail coach of days gone by  about the time that the day of slow speed was drawing to a close 1837 licenses were granted to 3026 stagecoaches of which 1507 went to and from london besides 103 mailcoaches  and it has been estimated that the number of passengers carried in the year about that time was two millions  in regard to the merchandise traffic of the kingdom we cannot give statistics but we ask the reader to bear in mind that it was all conducted by means of heavy waggons and slowgoing canal barges  now let us contrast this state of things with the condition and influence of railways up to the present time  as we have said the iron horse began his career in 1830 on the liverpool and manchester line long since become part of the london and northwestern railwayat that time thirtyone miles long  eight years later liverpool manchester and birmingham were completely connected with london by railway  then as success attended the scheme new lines were undertaken and opened at a still more rapid rate until in 1843despite the depression caused for a time by overspeculatingthere were nearly 2000 miles of railway open for traffic  in 1850 there were above 6000 miles open in 1860 above 10000  in 1864 the railways of the kingdom employed upwards of 7200 locomotives 23470 passenger carriages and 212900 goods and mineral waggons  in that one year about five million passengers and goods trains ran 130 millions of milesa distance that would encircle the earth 5221 timesthe earth being 24896 miles in circumference  in 1866 the gross receipts of railways was about forty millions of pounds sterling  at the present date 1871 above 14000 miles of railway are open in the united kingdom  this mileage is divided amongst about 430 companies but a considerable number of these have been incorporated with the larger companies such as the london and north west the great western etcetera  all the lines carried in one year 1870 somewhere about 307 millions of passengersin other words that number of passenger journeys were performed on them  the mail and stagecoaches in their best days only conveyed as we have said two millions  see note at end of chapter  it is almost overwhelming to consider what a vast change in the condition and habits of the people of this country is implied in these figures  forty years ago none travelled but the comparatively rich and that only to an extent equal to about twothirds of the present population of london  nowadays the poorest artisan can and does afford to travel and the number of journeys performed each year on all our british railways is equal to more than the entire population of europe which in stewarts modern geography is set down at 285 millions  from this of course it follows that as many thousands of men women and children never travel at all many others must have undertaken numerous journeys in that year  the facilities afforded by railways are altogether innumerable  if so disposed you may sup one night in the south of england and the next night in the north of scotland  thousands of families dwell in the country while the heads thereof go to their business in town by rail every morning and return home every evening  huntsmen booted and spurred are whirled off horses and all to distant fields whence after crossing country all day they return to the railway and are whirled back to town in time for dinner  navvys and artisans are conveyed to their work at a penny a mile and monstertrains carry thousands of excursionists to scenes of rural delight that our fathers never dreamed of in their wildest flights of fancy  one of the most remarkable and interesting facts in connexion with all this is that although mailcoaches have been beaten off the field there are actually more horses employed in this country now than there were in 1837 while canals are doing more business than they ever did and are making higher profits too  in 1865 the carriage of cattle by railway amounted to between fourteen or fifteen million head of all kinds  the consumption of coal in the same year by our railways amounted to four million tons and the quantity of that and other minerals carried by rail continually is enormous  the benefit derived by the postoffice also from our railways is incalculable  we cannot afford space to enter into details but it may be truly said that but for railways the postoffice savings bank system could not have existed and of course also our frequent deliveries of letters and rapid as well as cheap communication with all parts of the kingdom would have been impossible  the railway service of the postoffice is over 60000 miles a day and the gross sum paid by the postoffice to railways in one year was 570500 pounds  these are but a few of the amazing statistics connected with our railway system which if fully enlarged upon would fill a bulky volume  if our readers desire more there are several most interesting and instructive works on the subject which are well worthy of perusal  see note 2 at the end of the chapter  before closing this perhaps too statistical chapter we shall say a few words as to the construction of a railway  no one who has not looked pretty closely into the subject can form any adequate conception of the difficulties that beset an engineerinchief in the formation of a line of railway  we will suppose that all the parliamentary battles have been fought opposition overcome the heavy expenses connected therewith paid and the work begun  the engineer has walked again and again over the country through which the railway is to be carried and selected the best route his assistants having meanwhile taken for him flying levels and cross levels  too frequently prejudice ignorance and selfishness interpose to prevent the best route being taken and immense sums that might have been saved are spent in constructing the line on the next best route  as soon as the course of a line is fixed accurate surveys are made by the assistant engineers copies of which are placed according to act of parliament with the various clerks of the peace of the counties through which the line is to pass with the commissioners of railways and others besides which there has to be prepared for each parish its proportion and for each landholder a section showing the greatest depth of cutting or embankment in any of his fields  as soon as all this has been done and the act of parliament authorising the line obtained an accurate plan and section of the whole line is made from which the engineer ascertains and lays down its gradients in other words its ascents and descents determines the number and size of the bridges and viaducts to be made calculates the quantity of embankments required to fill up hollows and the number of cuttings to level obstructions in which latter calculations he estimates that the cutting down of elevations will be made subservient as far as may be to the elevation of depressions  all this involves very nice and exact calculation as to quantity of material masonry etcetera and the sinking of trial shafts to ascertain the nature of the various strata to be excavated or tunnelled  then the cost of all the works has to be estimated in detail apportioned into lengths and advertised for execution by contract  to each section of the line thus apportioned forty or fifty milesan experienced engineer is appointed having under him subassistants who superintend from ten to fifteen miles each and these again are assisted by inspectors of masonry mining earthwork and permanent way to each of whom a district is assigned  these managing and guiding men having been appointed the physical workers are then called into action in the form of bands of navvies as the steam and mechanism of the locomotive are useless except in regulated combination so brain and muscle can achieve nothing without wise and harmonious union  if boys and men would reflect more deeply on this great truth pride boasting and the false separation of classes would be less rife  we say false because there is a separation of classes which is natural and unavoidable  no one ever complains of that  if illadvised or angry navvies were to refuse to work what could directors and engineers do  if on the other hand illadvised or angry directors and engineers refused to pay what could navvies do antagonism is an unhealthy condition of things  there is far too much of it between employers and employed in this world  agree with thine adversary quickly is a command which applies to bodies of men quite as much as to individuals and the word is agree not coerce or force if we cannot agree let us agree to differ or if that wont do in our peculiar circumstances then let us agree to separate  fighting save in selfdefence is only fit for fools  but to return  when bone and muscle have been for the time welded to brain then the work of construction goes on full swing  difficulties and obstructions are overcome in a way that appears to the unskilled eye nothing less than miraculous  but the work is often hindered and rendered greatly more expensive by the sudden appearance of evils against which no amount of human wisdom or foresight could have guarded  the kilsby tunnel of the london and north west railway is a case in point  when that tunnel was proposed it was arranged that it should be about 3000 yards long and 160 feet below the surface with two great ventilating shafts 60 feet in diameter  it was a gigantic work  the engineer examined the ground in the usual way with much care and then advertised for tenders  the various competing contractors also examined the ground minutely and the offer of one of them to work it for 99000 pounds was accepted  forthwith the contractor went to work and all went well and busily for some time until it was suddenly discovered that a hidden quicksand extended 400 yards into the tunnel which the trial shafts had just passed without touching  this was a more tremendous blow to the contractor than most readers may at first thought suppose for he believed that to solidify a quicksand was impossible  the effect on him was so great that he was mentally prostrated and although the company generously and justly relieved him from his engagement the reprieve came too late for he died  it then came to be a question whether or not the tunnel should be abandoned many advised that it should  at this juncture mr robert stephenson son of the great george came forward and undertook the work  he placed his chief dependence on the steamengine to keep the water down while the work was in progress  at first he was successful but one day while the men were busy laying their bricks in cement one of them drove into the roof and a deluge of water burst in on them and although they tried to continue their work on a raft the water prevailed and at last drove them out  they escaped with difficulty up one of the airshafts the water having put an effectual stop to the work the directors felt disposed to give it up but stephenson begged for a fortnight more  it was granted  by means of thirteen steamengines the amazing quantity of 1800 gallons of water per minute was pumped out of the quicksand night and day for eight months  with the aid of 1250 men and 200 horses the work was finally completed having occupied altogether thirty months from the laying of the first brick  two very singular accidents occurred during the course of the construction of this tunnel  on one occasion a man who had been working in it was being hauled up one of the shafts when his coat caught in an angular crevice of the partition that separated the pumps from the passage for the men and became so firmly jammed that he was compelled to let go the rope and was left there dangling in the air about a hundred feet from the bottom until his horrified comrades went down and rescued him by cutting away the piece of his coat  this piece of cloth was long preserved in the engineers office as a memorial of the event on another occasion some men were at work on a platform halfway down the shaft executing some repairs when a huge navvy named jack pierson fell from the surface went right through the platform as if it had been made of paper and fell to the bottom  fortunately there was water to receive him there else he had been killed on the spot the men whom of course he had narrowly missed in his fall began to shout for a rope to those above and they hallooed their advice down the shaft in reply  in the midst of the confusion jack pierson himself calmly advised them to make less noise and pull him out which they very soon did and the poor man was carried home and put to bed  he lay there for many weeks unable to move but ultimately recovered  what we have said of the kilsby tunnel gives a slight glimpse of some of the expenses difficulties and dangers that occasionally attend the construction of a railway  of course these difficulties and expenses vary according to the nature of the ground  in some places the gradients are slight bridges few and cuttings etcetera insignificant but in other places the reverse is emphatically the case and costly laborious works have to be undertaken  one such work which occurred at the very opening of our railway system in 1828 was the bridging of the chat moss on the liverpool and manchester line  george stephenson the constructer of the rocket was also the hero of the chat moss  this moss was a great swamp or bog four miles in extent which was so soft that it could not be walked on with safety and in some places an iron rod laid on the surface would sink by its own weight  like many other difficulties in this world the solidification of the chat moss was said to be impossible but the great engineer scarce admitted the propriety of allowing the word impossible to cumber our dictionaries  he began the work at once by forming an embankment twenty feet high which he carried some distance across the treacherous soil when the whole affair sank down one day and disappeared  undismayed stephenson began again and went on steadily depositing thousands on thousands of tons of earth which were greedily swallowed up until at last a solid foundation was obtained over the greater part of the bog  but there was a particularly soft part of it known by the name of the flow moss which was insatiable  over this hurdles interwoven with heath were spread and on these earth and gravel were laid down  when this road showed a tendency to sink below the level stephenson loaded the moss beyond the track to balance it when water oozed through he invented a new kind of drainpipe formed of old tallow casks headed into each other and ballasted to keep them down and at last the feat was accomplishedthe railway was run over the wet quaking moss on firm dry land  it was in the formation of this the true beginning of railways that the british navvy was called into being  to perform the laborious work stephenson employed the men called inland navigators in other words the canal excavators  this body of strong navigators or navvies formed the nucleus which gathered recruits from all parts of the kingdom  as the work of railway making which thenceforward grew fast and furious was unusually severe only men who were unusually powerful were suited for the navvy ranks so that they became a distinct class of gigantic men whose capacity for bread and beef was in accordance with their muscular development and power to toil  splendid fellows they were and are somewhat rugged and untamed no doubt with a tendency to fight occasionally and a great deal of genuine kindness and simplicity  that they are capable of being imbued with refined feeling noble sentiment and love to god has been shown by the publications of miss marsh which detail that ladys interesting and earnest labours to bring the unbelievers among these men to our saviour  another celebrated piece of railway engineering is the britannia bridge over the menai straits which separates caernarvonshire from the island of anglesey  this was the first bridge ever built on the tubular principle  the importance of crossing the strait was very great as it lay in the direct route to holyhead and ireland  telford the engineer daringly resolved to span the strait with a suspension bridge 100 feet above the water  he began it in 1818 and on the last day of january 1826 the london mail coach passed over the estuary  the bridge remains to this day a vast and beautiful monument of engineering skill  but when railways began to play something more ponderous and powerful became necessary  a bridge with arches was talked of but this was considered likely to be obstructive to the navigation of the strait therefore another plan was demanded  at this juncture robert stephenson came forward with a plan  pounding his opinion on the known fact that hollow columns are stronger than solid ones that hollow beams are better than solid beams he leaped to the bold conclusion that a hollow iron beam or tube could be made large enough to allow a train to pass through it  as usual there sprang up a host of coldwaterers but thanks to british enterprise which can dare anything there were found enough of men willing to promote the scheme  it was no sooner resolved on than begun  massive abutments of stone were raised on each shore to the height of 100 feet above highwater  the width of the strait between these abutments is nearly 500 yards  midway across is the britannia rock just visible at half tide  the engineer resolved to found one of his towers on that rock  it was done but the distance being too great for a single span of tube two other towers were added the centre towel rises 35 feet higher than the abutments thus giving to the tube a very slight arch which however is barely perceptible  the tubes were rectangular with double top and bottom made of plates of wroughtiron from threeeighths to threequarters of an inch thick and varying in length according to their positionthe whole when put together forming a single tube about 500 yards long  the two centre ones were the largest and most difficult to manage each having to be built on shore floated off on barges and lifted by hydraulic power a height of about 100 feet  some idea of what this implied may be gathered from the following fact  each tube weighed 1800 tonsthe weight of a goodlysized ocean steamer  a perfect army of men worked at the building of the tubes cutting punching fitting riveting etcetera and as the place became the temporary abode of so many artificers and labourers with their wives and children a village sprang up around them with shops a school and a surgery  two fireengines and large tanks of water were kept in constant readiness in case of fire and for many months rivetmaking machines punching machines shearing machines etcetera were in full work  there were two million rivets used altogether and the quantity of threequarterinch iron rod used in making them measured 126 miles  the total weight of iron used was nearly 12000 tons  the bridge was strengthened by eightythree miles of angle iron  for many months the outlay in wages alone was 6000 pounds a week and the cost for the whole of the works more than 600000 pounds  a curious fact connected with this enormous mass of iron is that arrangements had to be made to permit of shrinkage and expansion  the tubes were placed on a series of rollers and iron balls and it was afterwards found that in the hottest part of summer they were twelve inches longer than in wintera difference which if not provided for would have caused the destruction of the towers by a constant and irresistible pull and thrust  the menai bridge was begun in 1846 and opened for traffic in march 1850  space would fail us were we to attempt even a slight sketch of the great engineering works that railways have called into being  we can merely point to such achievements as the highlevel bridges at newcastleontyne berwickontweed and at saltash over the tamar there are viaducts of great height length and beauty in all parts of the kingdom there are terminal stations so vast and magnificent as to remind one of the structures of eastern splendour described in the arabian nights entertainments and there are hundreds of miles of tunnelling at the present time in the united kingdom  the metropolitan railway is the most important and singular of these tunnelsfor it is entitled to be regarded as a gigantic tunnelwhich burrows under the streets of london  this stupendous work was undertaken in order to relieve the traffic in the streets of london  the frequent blocks that used to occur not many years ago in the main thoroughfares of the metropolis had rendered relief absolutely necessary  when the increase of railways began to pour human beings and goods from all parts of the kingdom into london in a continuous and everincreasing stream it became obvious that some new mode of conveyance must be opened up  after much deliberation as to the best method it was finally resolved that an underground railway should be made encircling the metropolis so that travellers arriving from all points of the compass might find a ready and sufficient means of conveyance into the central parts of the city  there was opposition to the scheme of course but through the persevering energy of the solicitor to the undertaking and others the work was at length begun and the line opened for traffic in january 1863  its extraordinary success soon proved the wisdom of its promoters  at first it was thought that the chief revenues would be derived from the conveyance of goods from the west to the eastern districts of london but its enormous passenger traffic eventually became the chief cause of its great prosperity  in the very first year of its opening the number of passengers who travelled by it between farringdon street and bishops road paddington amounted to nearly nine and a half millions of individuals which is more than three times the entire population of londonalso let us add more than three times the entire population of scotland  the number of trains which are constantly following each other in quick succession at times every two or three minutes on this magnificent railway has rendered a most perfect system of signalling necessary as well as a working staff of superior intelligence and activity  the drivers are all picked men and indeed it is obvious to every one who travels by it that the porters and guards and all employed on the line are unusually smart men  the engineering difficulties connected with the metropolitan railway were very great as may easily be believed seeing that it had to be formed under streets whose foundations were unavoidably shaken and amongst an infinite ramification of gas and waterpipes and sewers whose separate action had to be maintained intact while the process of construction was going on  some of the stations are most ingeniously lighted from the streets above by bright reflecting tilework while others too deep for such a method or too much overtopped with buildings to admit of it are lit perpetually with gas the whole of the works are a singular instance of engineering skill reflecting great credit on mr fowler the engineerinchief  despite its great length of tunnelling the line is perfectly dry throughout  at first fears were entertained that human beings could not with safety travel through such tunnels as were here formed but experience has proved those fears like many others to have been groundless and a very thorough analysis of the atmosphere of the line in all circumstances and by the most competent men of the day has demonstrated that the air of the metropolitan railway is not injurious to health  the excellent general health of the employes also affords additional and conclusive testimony to this fact even although it is unquestionably true that there is at times a somewhat sulphurous smell there  this thorough ventilation of course could only have been achieved by ingenious arrangements and a peculiar construction of the engines whereby the waste steam and fumes of the furnaces should be prevented from emitting their foul and sulphurous odours  the carriages are brilliantly lighted with gas contained in long indiarubber bags on their roofs and the motion of the trains is much gentler than that of ordinary railways although they travel at the rate of from fifteen to twenty miles an hour including stoppagesa rate be it observed which could not have been ventured on at all but for the thorough and effective system of telegraphic and semaphore signalling employed to indicate from station to station the exact state of the lineas to trainsat all times  on the whole the metropolitan railway has proved one of the most useful and successful undertakings of modern times  see note 3 at the end of the chapter  in reference to foreign railways we have only space to say that there are works as grand and as worthy of note as any of which we can boast and it is with much regret that we feel constrained to do no more than point to such magnificent undertakings as the mont cenis railway which ascends and tunnels through the alps and that stupendous line the union pacific railroad 3000 miles in length formed by the daring and enterprising americans by means of which the prairies and the rocky mountains are made of no account and new york is brought within seven days of san francisco  the engineering works on the sommering railway between vienna and trieste the mighty victoria tubular bridge at montreal the railway bridge over niagara the difficulties encountered and overcome in india the bold achievements of railway engineers amid the dizzy heights and solitudes of the andesall these subjects must be passed over in silence else our readers will we fear come to the conclusion that we have lost command of the iron horse altogether allowed him to take the bit in his teeth and fairly run away    note 1  many readers may find it difficult to form an adequate conception of such a vast number as 307 millions  it may help one to some idea of it to know that if a man were to devote himself to count it one by onesitting down after breakfast counting at the rate of one every moment and working without intermission for eight hours every day excepting sundayshe would not conclude his task until the thirtyfifth year    note 2  we would refer them particularly to messrs w and

but the nature of our book forbids it  we quit the subject regretfully referring the reader who may desire to know more to an able notice of the metropolitan railway in the shops and companies of london edited by henry mayhew    chapter seven  little gertie comes out in a new light and bob receives good news  poor little earnest curlyhaired gertie had been so thoroughly reared in the midst of crashing sounds and dire alarms without any mischance resulting that she had come to feel at last as if the idea of danger or disaster were a mere fiction  it was therefore a new and terrible shock which she received when she saw her father carried to his cottage by four railway porters and tenderly laid in his bed and it went to her heart with an unaccountable thrill when she heard her fathers usually loud hearty voice say in soft womanly tones thank ee lads thank ee  ill be all right soon please god  goodnight and thank ee kindly  goodnightgoodnight jack they replied in various tones of cheeriness for these hardmuscled men had soft hearts and although they entertained fears for their friend they were anxious by the hearty tones of their voices to keep up his spirits  you mustnt take on like that missis whispered one of them as they were leaving the cottage door the doctor said for sartin that there warnt no bones broken and e didnt think there was nothink internal  it aint that im afeard of whimpered poor mrs marrot but it does go to my art so to ear my john speak in that voice  i never eard him do it except once before when he was very low with fever an thought himself adyin  but e aint agoin to die this time returned the kindly porter so cheer up missis  goodnight  mrs marrot returned to the room where her husband lay evidently suffering severe pain for he was very pale and his lips were compressed  he was anxious not to alarm gertie and loo who stood at the bedside  the former could not speak and the blood had so completely fled from her face and her small tightlyclasped hands that she resembled a creature of wax  can i do nothing to relieve the pain dear father said loo as she wiped the perspiration from his brow  nothin nothin dear lass said john with some of his wonted heartiness except git me a cup o tea  mayhap thatll do me good but the doctorll be here soon and hell put me all to rights in no time  the idea of a cup of tea was a deep device on the part of john who meant thereby to give loo some active work to do and thus take her attention off himself  and dont you be uneasy molly he added turning to his wife it aint a bad hurt im told an it aint hard for a man to suffer a bit o pain now an agin when its the lords will  come thats the doctors knock  dont keep him waitin  i knew hed be here soon cause mr able said hed send him without delay  a prolonged and somewhat painful examination of johns injuries ensued during which time little gertie with clasped hands parted lips and eager eyes watched the doctors countenance intently  after it was over the doctor turned to mrs marrot and said  im happy to tell you that your husbands injuries although severe and painful are not serious  no bones are broken but he has been severely bruised and will require careful nursing for some timeand he added turning with a smile to the patient no more rushing about the country at sixty miles an hour for several weeks to come  little gertie began to breathe freely again  her hands unclasped and the colour came slowly back as she crept quietly to the bedside and taking her fathers large horny hand laid her cheek softly upon it  are you easier now daddy she asked  ay much easier god bless you gertie  the doctor has made things much more comfortable  theyve got a wonderful knack o puttin things rightthese doctors have  wy it minds me o my ingine after a longish run she looks dirty an all out o sorts but wen i gits her into the shed and gives her an overhaul youd scarce know er again  at this moment baby marrot who had been sleeping when his father was brought in became suddenly conscious of internal vacuity and forthwith set up a lusty howl whereupon mrs marrot pounced upon and throttled himto some extent  dont stop him molly my dear you  the remainder of the sentence was drowned by the night express which rushed past joining baby marrot in a yell as the latter freed his throat from his mothers grip  dont stop him molly repeated john you dont suppose that after drivin a locomotive for eight years im agoin to be disturbed by the small pipe of our own youngster  let him yell molly it does him good and it dont do me no harm  it was now arranged that gertie was to be head nurse on this trying occasionnot that the appointment was considered appropriate but it was unavoidable seeing that gertie wanted it intensely and her father was pleased to have it so  gertie had never before been called upon to do anything in the nursing way more serious than to look after baby when he had eaten too much or scalded himselfnevertheless the way in which she went about her nursing would have done credit to an hospital training  she evidently possessed a natural aptitude for the work and went about it with a sense of the importance of the trust that was quite charming  she was at that tender age when such work becomes barely possible and the performance of it seems quite miraculous  her father gazed at her in bewilderment while she went about gravely smoothing his pillow and tucking in corners of blankets and bringing cups and tumblers and spoons and handkerchiefs and sundry other articles to a chair at his bedside so as to be within reach of his hand  molly and loo besides being highly interested were intensely amused  it is a matter of dispute even to this day whether baby did not perceive the marvellous aptitude of gertie for he continued for a prolonged period to gaze at her as if in solemn wonder  mrs marrot declared babys gaze to be one of admiration but john held that it was owing to the state of exhaustion that resulted from an unusually long fit of yelling  while he stared thus gertie having completed a number of little operations and put the finishing touches or pats to them became suddenly aware that every one was laughing quietly  what is it she asked relaxing the severity of her brow and brightening up  they all laughed still more at this and gertie looking round for an explanation encountered babys glaring eyes whereupon supposing that she had found out the cause she laughed too  but she quickly dismissed her levity and recurred to her work with renewed diligence  it was well for the enginedriver that he had been trained in a rough school for his powers of endurance were severely tested that night by the attentions of his numerous friends who called to inquire for him and in some cases insisted on seeing him  among others came one of the directors of the company who seeing how matters stood with much consideration said that he would not sit down but had merely looked in for a moment to tell john marrot that an appointment had been found for his son robert in the works and that if he would send him over in the morning he would be introduced to the locomotive superintendent and initiated into the details of his new sphere of action  this was very gratifying to the enginedriver of course but much more so to bob himself whose highest earthly ambition was to become as he styled it an engineer  when that aspiring youth came home that night after cleaning his lamps he wiped his oily hands on a bundle of waste and sat down beside his sire to inquire considerately into his state of body and to give him as he expressed it the noos of the line  you see daddy he said the doctor tells me youre to be kep quiet an not allowed to talk so in course youve got nothin to do but lie still an listen while i give ee the noos  so ere goes  an dont you sit too near baby mother else youll wake im up an well have a yell asll put talkin out o the question  well then  bob said loo interrupting her brother as she sat down opposite and began to mend one of babys pinaforeswhich by the way was already so mended and patched as to have lost much of its original form and appearancebob mr able has been here and  whos mr able demanded bob  one of the directorsdont you know  how should i know retorted bob you dont suppose that the drectors is all my partikler friends do you  theres only two or three of em as has the honer of my acquaintance  well resumed loo with a laugh you ought to consider mr able one of your particular friends at all events for he has been here this evening making kind inquiries after father and telling him that he has got you appointed to the works that youve been so long hankering  what interrupted bob in great excitement you dont mean that loo  yes i do  to the great clatterby works where the big hammer is  well i suppose it is to these works said loo  ay bob to the clatterby works lad so youre a made man if you only behave yourself and do your dooty said john marrot in reply to his sons look of inquiry  in the strength of his satisfaction the boy rose and taking loo round the neck kissed her pretty mouth heartily after which he bestowed the same favour on his mother and little gertie and looked as if he meant to do it to baby too but he thought better of it  why mother he said resuming his seat at the bedside these are the works where theyve got the big hammersso big mother oh youve no notion how big they are and heavy  why one of em is full five tons in weightthink o that equal to five carts of coals mother all rolled into one  nonsense said mrs marrot  but its true said bob earnestly  nonsense repeated mrs marrot wy what would be the use of a hammer as no one could lift  steam lifts it mother said bob as easyyes as easy as you lift the rollin pin  the unbelieving woman still shook her head smiled and said nonsense  moreover continued bob waxing enthusiastic on his favourite topic im told for i havent seen em yet that theyve got a pair o scissors there as can cut cold iron as easy as you can cut paperthey could cut through said bob pausing and looking round they could cut through the poker and tongs and shovel all at one go as easy as if they was straws  gammon said mrs marrot  isnt it a fact daddy cried bob  quite true molly my dear  i must take you over to see the works some day and convince you said john with a faint smile  but whats the news you were goin to give us bob he added  the noosah that good noos drove it all out o my ead  well as i wos agoin to say theres a great todo down at the shed cause its said that an awful lot o thefts has bin goin on of late at bingly station and its bin reported that some of the drivers or firemen are consarned in it  an dee know father continued bob suddenly becoming grave and very earnest i heard one o the men say that will garvie is suspected  there was a momentary deep silence as if every one had received a shock then mrs marrot exclaimed what say ee boy  at the same time her husband demanded sternly who said that  i dont know father  i was passing through the shed at the time and didnt see who spoke i only heerd im  father said leo over whose face a deep crimson flush had spread surely you dont for a moment believe it  believe it replied john believe that my mate will garvie is a thief  id as soon believe that my molly was a murderer  the energetic driver here struck his fist so violently on the bed as to cause his wounded side an acute twinge of pain  it had scarcely passed away when the door opened and will garvie himself entered  well jack he said going up to his friends couch and taking his hand how dyou feel nowbetter  the frank open countenance of the young manalbeit begrimed with smoke and his clear laughing blue eyes were such a flat contradiction to the charge which had been made against him that john looked up in his face and laughed  well you must be better if thats the way you answer me  oh im all right said john quietly leastwise im on the rails agin an only shunted on to a sidin to be overhauled and repaired a bit  youve heard the noos i fancy  what of bobs appointment said will glancing at loo for he knew that anything that was for bobs advantage gave her intense delight and he liked to watch her countenance in such circumstancesof course ive heard of that  moreover ive bin to the locomotive superintendent and got leave to go over with him tomorrow and show him through the works along with any of his family that might want to go  i made a special request for this thinkin that mayhap  he looked pointedly at loo and loo looked pointedly at the pinafore which suddenly claimed her undivided attention  bob before will could finish his sentence broke in with  now aint that a sucumstance wy we was just talkin of havin mother over to see the works an lettin her be convinced by her own eyes that there is a hammer there of five ton weight drove by steam an a pair o scissors as can cut cold iron an inch thick  youll go mother wont you  well i dessay it would be amoosin yes ill go bob if fathers better  accordingly much to will garvies disappointment it was arranged that mrs marrot was to accompany him and bob to the great railway works on the following day    chapter eight  mrs marrot and bob visit the great clatterby works  we cannot presume to say what sort of a smiddy vulcans was but we feel strongly inclined to think that if that gentleman were to visit the works of the grand national trunk railway which are about the finest of the kind in the kingdom he would deem his own old shop a very insignificant affair  the stupendous nature of the operations performed there the colossal grandeur of the machinery employed the appalling power of the forces called into action the startling chiaro scuro of the furnaces the herculean activity of the 3500 hands the dread pyrotechnic displays the constant din and clangourpshaw the thing is beyond conception why then you will say attempt description  because reader of two evils we always choose the less  description is better than nothing  if you cannot go and see and hear for yourself there is nothing left for you but to fall back on description  but of all the sights to be seen there the most interesting perhaps and the most amusing was the visage of worthy mrs marrot as she followed will garvie and her son and gazed in rapt amazement at the operations and listened to the sounds sometimes looking all round with a halfimbecile expression at the rattling machinery at other times fixing her eyes intently down on one piece of mechanism in the vain hope of penetrating its secrets to the core  bob was not much less amazed than his mother but he had his sharp wits about him and was keenly alive to the delight of witnessing his mothers astonishment  the works covered several acres of ground and consisted of a group of huge buildings which were divided into different departments and in these the railway company manufactured almost every article used on the linefrom a locomotive engine to a screwnail  here as we have said above 3500 men and boys were at work and all sorts of trades were represented  there were draughtsmen to make designs and from these detailed working drawings  smiths to forge all the wroughtironwork with hammermen as assistants  patternmakers to make wooden patterns for castings  moulders including loam drysand and greensand moulders and brassfounders  dressers to dress the rough edges off the castings when brought from the foundry  turners in iron and brass  planers and nibblers and slotters and drillers joiners and sawyers and coachbuilders and painters  fitters and erecters to do the rougher and heavier part of fitting the engines together  boilermakers including platers or fitters caulkers and riveters  finishers to do the finer part of fittingdetails and polishing  in short almost every trade in the kingdom concentrated in one grand whole and working harmoniously like a vast complex machine towards one common endthe supply of railway rollingstock or plant to the line  all these were busy as bees for they were engaged on the equitable system of pieceworkwhich means that each man or boy was paid for each piece of work done instead of being paid by time which of course induced each to work as hard as he could in order to make much as possiblea system which suited both masters and men  of course there are some sorts of employment where it would be unjust to pay men by the amount of work doneas for instance in some parts of tinmines where a fathom of rock rich in tin is as difficult to excavate as a fathom of rock which is poor in tinbut in work such as we are describing the piecework system suits best  like a wise general will garvie began with the department in which the less astonishing operations were being performed  this was the timber and sawing department  here hard wood in all sizes and forms was being licked into shape by machinery in a way and with an amount of facility that was eminently calculated to astonish those whose ideas on such matters had been founded on the observation of the laborious work of human carpenters the very first thing that struck bob marrot was that the tools were so heavy thick and strong that the biggest carpenter he had ever seen would not have been able to use them  bobs idea of a saw had hitherto been a long sheet of steel with small teeth that could be easily bent like a hoopan implement that went slowly through a plank and that had often caused his arm to ache in being made to advance a few inches but here he saw circular steeldiscs with fangs more than an inch long which became invisible when in a state of revolution  what is that said mrs marrot concentrating herself on one of these implements after having indulged in a stare of bewildered curiosity round the long shed  thats a circular saw replied will garvie one of the large ones about four feet in diameter  a saw exclaimed mrs marrot in surprise  wy will its round how can a round thing saw  an it hant got no andle  how could any man lay old of it to saw  the carpenter here dont require no handles replied will  hes a queer fellow is the carpenter of this shop as well as powerful  he works away from morning till night with the power of more than a hundred horses an does exactly what hes bid without ever making any mistakes or axin any questions  hes a steamcarpenter missis but indeed hes a jackofalltrades and carries em on all at the same time  see theyre goin to set him to work nowwatch and you shall see  as he spoke two men approached the circular saw bearing a thick log of oak  one of them fitted it in position on rollers with its edge towards the saw then he seized a handle by means of which he connected the steamcarpenter with the saw which instantly revolved so fast that the teeth became invisible at the same time the plank advanced rapidly and met the saw  instantly there was a loud hissing yet ringing sound accompanied by a shower of sawdust and long before mrs marrot had recovered from her surprise the log was cut into two thick substantial planks  after two or three more had been cut up in this way in as many minutes will garvie said  now lets see what they do with these planks  come here  he led them to a place close beside the saw where there was a strong iron machine to one part of which was attached a very large chiselit might have been equal to two or three dozen of the largest ordinary chisels rolled into one  this machine was in motion but apparently it had been made for a very useless purpose for it was going vigorously up and down at the time cutting the atmosphere  its like a lot of people as i knows of observed mrs marrot very busy about nothin  itll have somethin to do soon mother said bob who was already beginning to think himself very knowing  bob was right  one of the oakplanks had been measured and marked for morticeholes in various ways according to pattern and was now handed over to the guardian of the machine who having had it placed on rollers pushed it under the chisel and touched a handle  down came the implement and cut into the solid wood as if it had been mere putty  a dozen cuts or so in one direction then round it wentfor this chisel could be turned with its face in either direction without stopping it for the purposeanother dozen cuts were made and an oblong hole of three or four inches long by two broad and three deep was made in the plank in a few seconds  even mrs marrot had sufficient knowledge of the arts to perceive that this operation would have cost a human carpenter a very much greater amount of time and labour and that therefore there must have been a considerable saving of expense  had she been aware of the fact that hundreds of such planks were cut marked morticed and turned out of hands every week all the year round and every year continuously she would have had a still more exalted conception of the saving of time labour and expense thus effected  the guardian of the chisel having in a few minutes cut the requisite half dozen or so of holes guided the plank on rollers towards a pile where it was laid to be afterwards carried off to the carriagebuilders who would fit it as one side of a carriageframe to its appropriate fellowplanks which had all been prepared in the same way  not far from this machine the visitors were shown another in which several circular saws of smaller dimensions than the first were at work in concert and laid at different angles to each other so that when a plank was given into their clutches it received cuts and slices in certain parts during its passage through the machine and came out much modified and improved in formall that the attendants had to do merely being to fit the planks in their places and guide them safely through the ordeal  elsewhere mrs marrot and bob beheld a framefull of gigantic saws cut a large log into half a dozen planks all in one sweep in a few minuteswork which would have drawn the sweat from the brows of two sawpit men for several hours  one thing that attracted the attention of bob very strongly was the simple process of holeboring  of course in forming the massive frames of railway carriages it becomes necessary to bore numerous holes for large nails or bolts  often had bob at a neighbouring seaport watched the heavy work and the slow progress of shipcarpenters as they pierced the planks of ships with augers but here he beheld what he called augers and drills gone madaugers small and great whirling furiously or as bob put it like all possessed  some acting singly others acting together in rows of five or six and these excited things were perpetually whirling whether at work or not ready for service at a moments notice  while bob was gazing at one huge drillprobably an inch and a half broad if not morea man came up to it with a plank on the surface of which were several dots at various distances  he put the plank under the drill brought it down on a dot whizz went the drill and straightway there was a huge round hole right through almost before bob had time to winkand bob was a practised hand at winking  several holes were bored in this way and then the plank was carried to another machine where six lesser holes were drilled at one and the same time by six furious little augers and thus the planks passed on from one machine to another until finished undergoing in the course of a few minutes treatment that would have cost them hours of torture had they been manipulated by human hands in addition to which the work was most beautifully and perfectly and regularly done  many other operations did the visitors behold in this departmentall more or less interesting and to them surprisingso that mrs marrot was induced at last to exclaim  wy willum it seems to me that if you go on improvin things at this rate there wont be no use in a short time for uman ands at all well just ave to sit still an let machinery do our work for us an all the tradespeople will be throwd out of employment  how can you say that missis said will garvie you bein old enough to remember the time wen there wasnt five joiners shops in clatterby with prhaps fifty men and boys employed and now theres hundreds of joiners and other shops of all kinds in the town besides these here railway works which as you know keeps about 3500 hands goin all the year round  thats so willum assented mrs marrot in a meditative tone  thus meditating she was conducted into the smiths department  here about 140 forges and 400 men were at work  any one of these forges would have been a respectable smiddy in a country village  they stood as close to each other as the space would allowso close that their showers of sparks intermingled and kept the whole shed more or less in the condition of a chronic eruption of fireworks  to bobs young mind it conveyed the idea of a perpetual keeping of the queens birthday  to his mother it was suggestive of singed garments and sudden loss of sight  the poor woman was much distressed in this department at first but when she found after five minutes or so that her garments were unscathed and her sight still unimpaired she became reconciled to it  in this place of busy vulcanseach of whom was the beauideal of the village blacksmith all the smaller work of the railway was done  as a specimen of this smaller work will garvie drew mrs marrots attention to the fact that two vulcans were engaged in twisting redhot iron bolts an inch and a half thick into the form of hooks with as much apparent ease as if they had been hairpins  these he said were hooks for couplings the hooks by which railway carriages were attached together and on the strength and unyielding rigidity of which the lives of hundreds of travellers might depend  the bending of them was accomplished by means of a powerful lever  it would be an endless business to detail all that was done in this workshop  every piece of comparatively small ironwork used in the construction of railway engines carriages vans and trucks from a doorhinge to a couplingchain was forged in that smithy  passing onward they came to a workshop where iron castings of all kinds were being made cylinders fireboxes etceteraand a savagelooking place it was with numerous holes and pits of various shapes and depths in the black earthy floor which were the moulds ready or in preparation for the reception of the molten metal  still farther on they passed through a workroom where every species of brasswork was being made  and here bob marrot was amazed to find that the workmen turned brass on turninglathes with as much facility as if it had been wood  some of the pieces of brazen mechanism were very beautiful and delicate especially one piece a stopcock for letting water into a boiler the various and complex parts of which when contrasted with the huge workmanship of the other departments resembled fine watchwork  as they passed on bob observed a particularly small boy in whom he involuntarily took a great and sudden interesthe looked so small so thin so intelligent and withal so busy  ah you may well look at him said will garvie observing bobs gaze that boy is one of the best workers of his age in the shop  what is e doin inquired bob  hes preparin nuts for screws replied will and gets one penny for every hundred  most boys can do from twelve to fourteen hundred a day so you see they can earn from six to seven shillins a week but that little fellerthey call him tomtit dorkinearns a good deal more i believe and he has much need to for he has got an old granny to support  thats the work that you are soon to be set to lad  is it said bob quite pleased at the notion of being engaged in the same employment with tomtit im glad to ear it  you see mother when you gits to be old an elpless youll not need to mind cause ill support you  the next place they visited was the great point of attraction to bob it was the forge where the heavy work was done and where the celebrated hammer and terrific pair of scissors performed their stupendous work  at the time the visitors entered this department the various hammers chanced to be at rest nevertheless even mrs marrots comparatively ignorant mind was impressed by the colossal size and solidity of the iron engines that surrounded her  the roof of the shed in which they stood had been made unusually high in order to contain them  well i spose the big ammer that bob says is as eavy as five carts of coals must be ereabouts observed mrs marrot looking round  yes there it is said will pointing in front of him  were  i dont see no ammer  why there that big thing just before you he said pointing to a machine of iron shaped something like the letter v turned upside down with its two limbs on the earth its stem lost in the obscurity of the root and having a sort of tongue between the two limbs which tongue was a great square block of solid iron apparently about five feet high and about three feet broad and deep  this tongue will garvie assured his companion was the hammer  no no willum said mrs marrot with a smile you mustnt expect me for to believe that  i may believe that the moon is made of green cheese but i wont believe that thats a ammer  no but is it bill asked bob whose eyes gleamed with suppressed excitement  indeed it is you shall see presently  several stalwart workmen with bare brawny arms who were lounging before the closed mouth of a furnace regarded the visitors with some amusement  one of these came forward and said  youd better stand a little way back maam  mrs marrot obediently retreated to a safe distance  then the stalwart men threw open the furnace door  mrs marrot exclaimed almost shrieked with surprise at the intense light which gushed forth casting even the modified daylight of the place into the shade  the proceedings of the stalwart men thereafter were in mrs marrots eyes absolutely appallingalmost overpoweringbut mrs m was tough both in mind and body  she stood her ground  several of the men seized something inside the furnace with huge pincers tongs forcepswhatever you choose to call themand drew partly out an immense rudely shaped bar or log of glowing irons thicker than a mans thigh  at the same time a great chain was put underneath it and a crane of huge proportions thereafter sustained the weight of the glowing metal  by means of this crane it was drawn out of the furnace and swung round until its glowing head or end came close to the tongue before mentioned  then some of the stalwart men grasped several iron handles which were affixed to the cool end of the bar and prepared themselves to act  a signal was given to a man who had not hitherto been noticed he was so small in comparison with the machine on which he stoodperhaps it would be better to say to which he stuck because he was perched on a little platform about seven or eight feet from the ground which was reached by an iron ladder and looked down on the men who manipulated the iron bar below  on receiving the signal this man moved a small lever  it cost him no effort whatever nevertheless it raised the iron tongue about six feet in the air revealing the fact that it had been resting on another square block of iron embedded in the earth  this latter was the anvil on the anvil the end of the whitehot bar was immediately laid  another signal was given and down came the fivecartsofcoals weight with a thud that shook the very earth caused the bar partially to flatten as if it had been a bit of putty and sent a brilliant shower of sparks over the whole place  mrs marrot clapped both hands on her face and capped the event with a scream  as for bob he fairly shouted with delight  blow after blow was given by this engine and as each blow fell the stalwart men heaved on the iron handles and turned the bar this way and that way until it was pounded nearly square  by this time mrs marrot had recovered so far as to separate her fingers a little and venture to peep from behind that protecting screen  by degrees the unwieldy mass of misshapen metal was pounded into a cylindrical form and will garvie informed his friends that this was the beginning of the drivingaxle of a locomotive  pointing to several of those which had been already forged each having two enormous iron projections on it which were afterwards to become the cranks he said  youll see how these are finished in another department  but mrs marrot and bob paid no attention to him  they were fascinated by the doings of the big hammer and especially by the cool quiet way in which the man with the lever caused it to obey his will  when he moved the lever up or down a little up or down went the hammer a little when he moved it a good deal the hammer moved a good deal when he was gentle the hammer was gentle when he gave a violent push the hammer came down with a crash that shook the whole place  he could cause it to plunge like lightning to within a hairsbreadth of the anvil and check it instantaneously so that it should not touch  he could make it pat the red metal lovingly or pound it with the violence of a fiend indeed so quick and sympathetic were all the movements of that steamhammer that it seemed as though it were gifted with intelligence and were nervously solicitous to act in prompt obedience to its masters will  there were eleven steamhammers of various sizes in this building with a staff of 175 men to attend to them half of which staff worked during the day and half during the nightbesides seven smaller steamhammers in the smiths shops and other departments  with difficulty will garvie tore his friends away from the big hammer but he could not again chain their attention to anything else until he came to the pair of scissors that cut iron  with this instrument mrs marrot at first expressed herself disappointed  it was not like a pair of scissors at all she said and in this she was correct for the square clumsylooking bluntlike mass of iron about five feet high and broad which composed a large portion of it was indeed very unlike a pair of scissors  why mother exclaimed bob you didnt surely expect to see two large holes in it for a giants thumb and fingers did you  well but said mrs marrot it aint got no blades that i can see  ill let ee see em missis in a minute said a workman who came up at that moment with a plate of iron more than a quarter of an inch thick  turn it on johnny  a small boy turned on the steam the machine moved and will garvie pointed out to mrs marrot the fact that two sharp edges of steel in a certain part of it crossed each other exactly in the manner of a pair of scissors  well remarked mrs m after contemplating it for some time it dont look very like scissors but im free to confess that them two bits of iron do act much in the same way  and with the same result missus observed the machineman putting the plate between the clippers which closing quietly snipped off about a foot of iron as if it had been paper  there was however a crunching sound which indicated great power and drew from mrs marrot an exclamation of surprise not altogether unmingled with alarm  the man then seized a bit of iron about as thick as his own wristfull an inch and a half in diameterwhich the scissors cut up into lengths of eighteen inches or so as easily as if it had been a bar of lead or wood  didnt i say it could cut through the poker mother cried bob with a look of triumph  the poker boy it could cut poker tongs shovel and fender all at once replied mrs marrotwell i never can it do anything else  in reply to this the man took up several pieces of hard steel which it snipped through as easily as it had cut the iron  but if mrs marrots surprise at the scissors was great not less great was it at the punching machine which punched little buttons the size of a sixpence out of cold iron full halfaninch thick  this vicious implement not only punched holes all round boilerplates so as to permit of their being riveted together but it cut patterns out of thick iron plates by punching rows of such holes so close to each other that they formed one long cutting straight or crooked as might be required  in short the punching machine acted the part of a saw and cut the iron plates in any shape that was desired  here also they saw the testing of engine springsthose springs which to most people appear to have no spring in them whateverso very powerful are they  one of these was laid on an iron table with its two ends resting against an iron plate a man approached and measured it exactly  then a hydraulic ram was applied and there was something quite impressive in the easy quiet way in which the ram shoved a spring which the weight of a locomotive can scarcely affect quite flat against the iron plate and held it there a moment or two  being released the spring resumed its proper form  it was then remeasured found not to have expanded a hairsbreadth and thereforeas will garvie took care to explain was passed as a sound welltempered spring whereat bob remarked that it would need to be a goodtempered spring to suffer such treatment without grumbling  it seemed to mrs marrot now as if her capacity for surprise had reached its limit but she little knew the wealth of capacity for creating surprise that lay in these amazing works of the grand national trunk railway  the next place she was ushered into was a vast apartment where iron in every shape size and form was being planed and turned and cut  the ceiling of the building or rather the place where a ceiling ought in ordinary circumstances to have been was alive with moving bands and whirling wheels  the first thing she was called on to contemplate was the turning of the tyre or rim of one of the drivingwheels of a locomotive  often had mrs marrot heard her husband talk of tyres and drivingwheels and many a time had she seen these wheels whirling halfconcealed in their appropriate places but never till that day had she seen the iron hoop eight feet in diameter elevated in bare simplicity on a turninglathe where its size impressed her so much that she declared she never could ave imagined enginewheels was so big and asked ow did they ever manage to get em lifted up to were they was  to which an overseer kindly replied by pointing out a neat little crane fitted on a tail which when required ran along the apartment like a strong obedient little domestic servant lifting wheels etcetera that a man could scarcely move and placing them wherever they were wanted mrs marrot was then directed to observe the rim of the wheel where she saw a small chisel cutting iron curls off it just as easily to all appearance as a turner cuts shavings off woodand these iron curls were not delicate they were thick solid unpliant ringlets that would have formed a suitable decoration for the fair brow of a locomotive or perhaps a chignonsupposing that any locomotive could have been prevailed on to adopt such a wild monstrosity  this same species of chisel applied in different ways reduced masses of iron in size planed down flat surfaces enlarged holes made cylinders true and smooth inside besides doing a variety of other things  after seeing the large tyre turned mrs marrot could not be induced to pay much regard to the various carriage and truck wheels which were being treated in a similar manner in that department but she was induced to open her ears and her eyes too when the overseer informed her that the works turned out complete no fewer than one hundred and thirty pairs of locomotive carriage and waggon wheels a week  how many did you say she asked  a hundred and thirty pair of wheels in the week repeated the overseer  every week asked mrs marrot  yes every week  sometimes more sometimes less but altogether pretty well on for 6000 pairs of wheels every year  wy what do you make of em all  oh we make good use of em replied the overseer laughing  we wear them out so fast that it keeps us working at that rate to meet our necessities  but that he continued is only a small part of what we do  we turn out of the works 156 firstclass carriages besides many seconds and thirds and about 1560 trucks every year besides three engines new and complete every fortnight  three noo engines every fortnight echoed mrs marrot how manys that in the year bob  seventyeight replied bob promptly  bob was a swift mental calculator and rather proud of it  where ever do they all go to murmured mrs marrot  why replied will garvie they go to all the stations on the line of course some of em go to smash at once in cases of accidents and all of em goes to destruction more or less in about fifteen or twenty years  we reckon that to be the life of a locomotive  see theres a drivin axle such as you saw forged by the big hammer being turned now and cut to shape and size by the same sort of machine that you saw cuttin the tyres  they passed on after looking at the axle for a few minutes until they came to a part of the building where rails were being forged  this also although not done by hammer was a striking process  the place was so hot owing to the quantity of uncooled metal on the floor that it was not possible to remain long they therefore took a rapid survey  in one place several men were in the act of conveying to the steamhammer a mass of shapeless whitehot iron which had just been plucked from a furnace with a pair of grippers  they put it below the hammer for a few minutes which soon reduced it to a clumsy bar then they carried it to a pair of iron rollers driven by steam  the end of the bar being presented to these it was gripped dragged in between them and passed out at the other side flat and very much lengthened as well as thinned  having been further reduced by this process it was finally passed through a pair of rollers which gave it shape and sent it out a complete rail ready to be laid down on the line  here garvie took occasion to explain that steel rails although very expensive were now being extensively used in preference to iron rails because they lasted much longer  for instance he said steel costs about 12 pounds a ton and iron only costs about 7 pounds but then dye see steel rails will last two years and more whereas iron rails get wore out and have to be renewed every six weeks in places where theres much traffic  now i cant stand no more o this said mrs marrot down whose face the perspiration was streaming im amost roasted alive an dont understand your explanations one bit willum so come along  oh mother do hold on a moment pleaded bob whose mechanical soul was in a species of paradise  youd better come bob interposed garvie else we wont have time to see the department where the engines are fitted  this was sufficient for bob who willingly followed  the fitting shed at that time contained several engines in various stages of advancement  in one place men were engaged in fitting together the iron framework or foundation of a locomotive with screws and bolts and nuts and rivets  others were employed near them on an engine more advanced in putting on the wheels and placing the boilers and fireboxes while another gang were busy covering the boiler of a third engine with a coating of wood and felt literally for the purpose of keeping it warm or preventing its heat from escaping  farther on three beautiful new engines that had just been made and stood ready for action were receiving a few finishing touches from the painters fresh spotless and glittering these were to make their debut on the morrow and commence their comparatively brief career of furious activitygay things doomed emphatically to a fast life  beyond these young creatures lay a number of aged and crippled engines all more or less disabled and sent there for repair one to have a burst steampipe removed and replaced another to have a wheel or a firebox or a cylinder changed and one that looked as if it had recently run amuck against all the other engines on the line stood sulkily grim in a corner evidently awaiting its sentence of condemnationthe usual fate of such engines being to be torn bored battered chiselled clipt and otherwise cut to pieces and cast into the furnaces  while gazing round this apartment mrs marrots eyes suddenly became transfixed  wots the matter now demanded bob in some alarm  i do believewytheres a locomotive in the air said mrs marrot in an undertone  so it is exclaimed bob  and reader so it was  in that shed they had a crane which rested on a framework overhead and ran on wheels over the entire shop  it was capable of lifting above fifty tons weight and as a large locomotive ponderous though it be is not much over twenty tons of course this giant crane made short work of such  when the men have occasion to remove a wheel from the iron horse not being able to make it lift up its leg so to speak to have it taken off they bring it under the crane swing it up as a little boy might swing a toycart and operate on it at their leisure  mrs marrot felt an unpleasant sensation on beholding this  as the wife of an enginedriver she had long felt the deepest respect almost amounting to reverence for locomotives in regard to the weight speed and irresistible power of which she had always entertained the most exalted ideas  to see one of the raceand that too of the largest sizetreated in this humiliating fashion was too much for her she declared that she had seen enough of the works and wouldnt on any account remain another minute  but you wont go without seein the carriage and truck department surely said bob  well ill just take a look to please you said the amiable woman  accordingly to the truck and van department they went and there bob whose mind was sharp as a needle saw a good many pieces of mechanism which formerly he had only seen in a transition state now applied to their ultimate uses  the chiselled sawn and drilled planks seen in the first department were here being fitted and bolted together in the form of trucks while the uses of many strange pieces of iron which had puzzled him in the blacksmiths department became obvious when fitted to their appropriate woodwork  here also he saw the internal machinery of railway carriages laid bare especially the position and shape of the springs that give elasticity to the buffers which he observed were just the same in shape as ordinary carriage springs placed so that the ends of the bufferrods pressed against them  but all this afforded no gratification to mrs marrot whose sensitive mind dwelt uneasily on the humiliated locomotive until she suddenly came on a row of new firstclass carriages where a number of people were employed stuffing cushions  well i declare she exclaimed if here aint cushionstuffing going on  i expect we shall come to coatandshiftmaking for porters and guards next  no we havent got quite that length yet laughed will garvie but if you look along youll see gilding and glazing and painting going on at that firstclass carriage  still farther along in the direction were going is the infirmary  the infirmary willum  ay the place where old and damaged trucks and carriages are sent for repair  theyre all in a bad way you seemuch in need o the doctors sarvices  this was true  looking at some of these unfortunates with crushedin planks twisted buffers and general dismemberment it seemed a wonder that they had been able to perform their last journey or crawl to the hospital  some of the trucks especially might have been almost said to look diseased they were so dirty while at the corners where address cards were wont to be affixed they appeared to have broken out in a sort of smallpox irruption of iron tackets  at last mrs marrot left the works declaring that her brain was whirling worser than was the wheels and machinery they had just left while bob asseverated stoutly that his appetite for the stupendous had only been whetted  in this frame of mind the former went home to nurse her husband and the latter was handed over to his future master the locomotive superintendent of the line  reader it is worth your while to visit such works to learn what can be done by the men whom you are accustomed to see only while trooping home at meal hours with dirty garments and begrimed hands and facesto see the grandeur as well as the delicacy of their operations while thus labouring amongst din and dust and fire to provide you with safe and luxurious locomotion  we cannot indeed introduce you to the particular works we have described but if you would see something similar hie thee to the works of our great arterial railwaysto those of the london and northwestern at crewe the great western at swindon the southeastern at ashford the great northern at doncaster the north british at cowlairs the caledonian at glasgow or any of the many others that exist throughout the kingdom for in each and all you will see with more or less modification exactly the same amazing sights that were witnessed by worthy mrs marrot and her hopeful son bob on that nevertobeforgotten day when they visited the preeminently great clatterby works of the grand national trunk railway    note  the foregoing description is founded on visits paid to the locomotive works of the great western at swindon and those of the north british near glasgowto the general managers and superintendents of both which railways we are indebted for much valuable information rm ballantyne    chapter nine  concerning domestic economy and difficultiessurprises and explanations  how to make the two ends meet is a question that has engaged the attention and taxed the brains of hundreds and thousands of human beings from time immemorial and which will doubtless afford them free scope for exercise to the end of time  this condition of things would appear to arise from a misconception on the part of those who are thus exercised as to the necessities of life they seem to imagine as a rule that if their income should happen to be say three hundred pounds a year it is absolutely impossible by any effort of ingenuity for them to live on less than two hundred and ninetynine pounds nineteen shillings and elevenpence three farthing they therefore attempt to regulate their expenditure accordingly and rather plume themselves than otherwise on the fact that they are firmly resolved to save and lay bye the farthing  they fail in this attempt as a matter of course and hence the difficulty of making the two ends meet  if these unfortunates had been bred to the profession of engineering or contracting they would have known that it is what we may style a law of human nature to underestimate probable expenses  so thoroughly is this understood by the men of the professions above referred to that after they have formed an estimateset down every imaginable expense and racked their brains in order to make sure that they have provided for every conceivable and inconceivable item they coolly add to the amount a pretty large sum as a margin to cover unexpected and unthoughtof contingencies  but anything of this sort never seems to enter into the calculations of the people who are so much tormented with those obstinate two ends that wont meet  there is one sure and easy mode of escape for them but they invariably hold that mode to be ridiculous until in dire extremity they are forced to adopt it  this is simply to make ones calculations for living considerably within ones income  we make no apology for going into the minutiae of this remarkable phase of human existence because it is necessary in order to the correct appreciation of the circumstances and feelings of good little mrs tipps when several weeks after the accident described in a previous chapter she sat down in her little parlour to reconsider the subject of her annual expenditure  netta sat beside her looking somewhat pale for she had not quite recovered from the effects of her recent illness  my darling said mrs tipps how can you charge me with having made an error somewhere  have i not got it all down here on black and white as your dear father used to say  this is the identical paper on which i made my calculations last year and i have gone over them all and found them perfectly correct  look there  mrs tipps held up in triumph as if it were an incontestable evidence of the rectitude of her calculations a sheet of notepaper so blotted and bespattered with figures that it would have depressed the heart even of an accountant because besides the strong probability that it was intrinsically wrong it was altogether illegible  dear mamma remonstrated netta with a twinkle of her eye i do not call in question the correctness of your calculations but i suggest that there may perhaps be an error of some sort somewhere  at all events the result would seem to indicateto implythatthat everything was not quite right you know  quite true darling replied mrs tipps who was a candid though obtuse soul the result is unsatisfactory eminently so yet i cannot charge myself with careless omissions  seehere it is on one side are my receipts  your dear father always impressed it so earnestly on me that i should keep the receipts of money on one side of the accounts and the payments on the other  i never could remember by the way on which side to put the receipts and on which the payments until he hit on the idea of making me contradict myself and then i should be sure to keep right  he used to say how well i remember it now darling this is the way whenever you receive a sum of money to enter in your cashbook always say to yourself what side shall i put it on  if your mind suggests on the right at once say nobecause that would be wrongright being wrong in this case and he did use to laugh so over that little pleasantry  mrs tipps gravity deepened as she recalled these interesting lessons in bookkeeping  yes she continued with a sigh and then he would go on to say that if it was wrong to go to the right of course it must be right to go the other way  at first i used to be a good deal puzzled and said but suppose my mind when i receive a sum of money should suggest putting it on the left am i to contradict myself then  oh no he would say with another laugh in that case you will remember that your mind is to be left alone to carry out its suggestion  i got to understand it at last after several years of training but i never could quite approve of it for it causes so much waste of paper  just look here she said holding up a little accountbook here are all the right pages quite filled up while all the left pages are blank  it takes only four lines to enter my receipts because you know i receive my money only once a quarter  well that brings me back to the point here are all the receipts on one side my whole income deducting incometaxwhich by the way i cannot help regarding as a very unjust taxamounts to two hundred and fifty pounds seventeen shillings and twopence  then here you have my paper of calculationseverything set downrent taxes water rates food clothing coals gas candles sundries sundries my darling including such small articles as soap starch etcetera nothing omitted even the cats food provided for the whole mounting to two hundred and fortyfive pounds  you see i was so anxious to keep within my income that i resolved to leave five pounds seventeen shillings and twopence for contingencies  but how does the case actually stand  here poor mrs tipps pointed indignantly to her accountbook and to a pile of papers that lay before her as if they were the guilty cause of all her troubles  how does it stand the whole two hundred and fifty pounds seventeen shillings spentonly the twopence leftand accounts to tradesmen amounting to fifty pounds remaining unpaid  and have we nothing left to pay them asked netta in some anxiety  nothing my love replied mrs tipps with a perplexed look except she added after a moments thought the tuppence  the poor lady whimpered as she said this seeing which netta burst into tears whereupon her mother sprang up scattered the accounts right and left and blaming herself for having spoken on these disagreeable subjects at all threw her arms round nettas neck and hugged her  dont think me foolish mamma said netta drying her eyes in a moment really it almost makes me laugh to think that i should ever come to cry so easily but you know illness does weaken one so that sometimes in spite of myself i feel inclined to cry  but dont mind me there its past now  let us resume our business talk  indeed i will not protested mrs tipps  then i will call nurse and go into the subject with her said netta  dont be foolish dear  well then go on with it mamma  tell me now is there nothing that we could sell  nothing  to be sure there is my gold watch but that would not fetch more than a few pounds and my weddingring which i would sooner die than part with  netta glanced as she spoke at an unusually superb diamond ring of eastern manufacture which adorned her own delicate hand  it was her fathers last gift to her a few days before he died  what are you thinking of darling inquired mrs tipps  of many things replied netta slowly  it is not easy to tell you exactly what  here she was saved the necessity of further explanation by the entrance of joseph tipps who after kissing his mother and sister heartily threw his hat and gloves into a corner and rubbing his hands together as he sat down inquired if edwin gurwood had been there  no we have neither seen nor heard of him said netta  then you shall have him to luncheon in halfanhour or so said joseph consulting his watch  i got leave of absence today and intend to spend part of my holiday in introducing him to captain lee who has promised to get him a situation in the head office  youve no idea what a fine hearty fellow he is continued tipps enthusiastically so full of humour and good sense  but what have you been discussing not accounts surely  why mother whats the use of boring your brains with such things  let me have em ill go over them for you  what dyou want done  the additions checked eh  on learning that it was not the accounts so much as the discrepancy between the estimate and the actual expenditure that puzzled his mother tipps seized her book and turning over the leaves said here let me see ill soon find it outah well rent yes taxes hm wine to mrs natly you put that in your estimate under the head of food i suppose  nno i think not  under physic then  no not under that  i have no head for that  what no head for physic  if youd said you had no stomach for it i could have understood you butwellwhat did you put it under sundries eh  im afraid joseph that i have not taken note of that in my extract your dear father used to call the thing he did with his cashbook at the end of the year an extracti think ive omitted that  just so said tipps jotting down with a pencil on the back of a letter  ill soon account to you for the discrepancy  here are six bottles of wine to mrs natly the railway porters wife at threeandsixone pound onenot provided for in your estimate  any more physic i wonder  hm subscription for coals to the poor halfaguineano head for charities in your estimate i suppose  of course pleaded mrs tipps in making an estimate i was thinking only of my own expenses you knownot of charities and suchlike things but when poor people come you know what is one to do  well not discuss that just now mother  hallo ten guineas doctors fee  of course you have not that in the estimate seeing that you did not know netta was going to be ill  whats thisfive pounds for twenty wax dollsnakedto be dressed by   really joseph the book is too private to be read aloud said mrs tipps snatching it out of her sons hand  these dolls were for a bazaar in aid of the funds of a blind asylum and i dressed them all myself last winter  well well mother said tipps laughing i dont want to pry into such secrets but here you see we have seventeen pounds odd of the discrepancy discovered already and ive no doubt that the remainder could soon be fished up  yes sighed mrs tipps sadly i see it now  as the poet truly saysevil is wrought by want of thought as well as want of heart  i have been assisting the poor at the expense of my tradespeople  mother exclaimed tipps indignantly you have been doing nothing of the sort  dont imagine that i could for a moment insinuate such a thing  you have only made a little mistake in your calculations and all that you have got to do is to put down a larger sum for contingencies next time  what nonsense you talk about your tradespeople  every one of them shall be paid to the last farthing  here tipps was interrupted by the entrance of edwin gurwood who at once began with much interest to inquire into the health of mrs tipps and hoped that she had not suffered in any way from her recent accident  mrs tipps replied she was thankful to say that she had not suffered in any way beyond being a little shaken and dreadfully alarmed  but railways have suffered said tipps laughing for mother is so strongly set against them now that she would not enter one for a thousand pounds  they have suffered in worse ways than that said gurwood if all that i hear be true for that accident has produced a number of serious compensation cases  hereupon gurwood and his friend plunged into an animated conversation about railway accidents and their consequences to the intense interest and horror of mrs tipps  meanwhile netta left the room and went to her old nurses apartment  nurse she said hurriedly when did you say you proposed paying your brother in london a visitabout this time was it not  yes dear said old mrs durby taking off her tortoiseshell spectacles and laying down her work i thought of going next week if it is quite convenient  it is quite convenient nurse continued netta in a somewhat flurried manner it would be still more convenient if you could go tomorrow or next day  deary mewhats wrong inquired mrs durby in some surprise  listen i have not time to explain much said netta earnestly sitting down beside her faithful nurse and putting her hand on her shoulder  we have got into difficulties nursetemporary difficulties i hopebut they must be got over somehow  now i want you to take this diamond ring to london with youpawn it for as much as you can get and bring me the money  me pawn it my dear  i never pawned a thing in my life and dont know how to go about it  but your brother knows how to do it suggested netta  now you wont refuse me this favour dear nurse  i know it is an unpleasant business but what else can be done  the ring is my own besides i hope to be able to redeem it soon  i know no more about pawning than yourself but i do know that a considerable time must elapse before the ring shall be lost to me  and you know our bills must be paid  good mrs durby did not require much persuasion  she consented to set off as soon as possible if she should obtain permission from mrs tipps who was aware that she had intended to visit her brother about that time  she received the precious ring which for security was put into a pillbox this was introduced into an empty matchbox which netta wrapped in a sheet of notepaper and put mrs durbys name on it for further security mrs durby enlarged the parcel by thrusting the matchbox into an old slipper the heel of which she doubled over the toe and then wrapped the whole in several sheets of brown paper until the parcel assumed somewhat the shape and size of her own head  it was also fastened with strong cords but mrs durbys powers of making a parcel were so poor that she left several uncouth corners and ragged ends of paper sticking out here and there  she wrote on it in pencil the simple namedurby  meanwhile joseph and his friend having finished luncheon prepared to set out on their visit to captain lee  as they quitted the house tipps ran back to the door and called his sister out of the parlour  i say netta what about this fifty pounds that mother was talking of he said  do you mean to say that you are really short of that sum and in debt  we are but i see a way out of the difficulty  dont distress yourself joe we shall have everything squared up as you call it in a few days  are you quite sure of that asked tipps with a doubting look  you know i have got an uncommonly cheap lodging and a remarkably economical landlady who manages so splendidly that i feed on a mere trifle a week seventyfive pounds a year you know is more than i know what to do with  i can live on thirtyfive or so and the other forty is  we dont require it joe said netta laughing  there go away you are giving me cold by keeping me in the passage and your friend is getting impatient  she pushed him out nodded and shut the door  tipps hastened after his friend apologised for the delay and stepping out smartly they were soon ushered into captain lees drawingroom  the captain was writing emma was seated near the window sewing  ha  tipps my fine fellow glad to see you why i was just thinking of you said the captain extending his hand  i have called began tipps bowing to emma and shaking the captains hand to introduce mymyehah mywhats the matter  there was some reason for these exclamations for captain lee stood gazing in mute amazement at young gurwood while the latter returned the compliment with his eyebrows raised to the roots of his hair  the similarity of their expressions did not however last long for edwin became gradually confused while the captain grew red and cholericlooking  so said the latter at length in a very stern voice this is your friend mr tipps  sir exclaimed edwin flushing crimson you ought not to condemn any one unheard  i do not condemn you sir retorted the captain  by word no but by look and tone and gesture you do  captain lee exclaimed tipps who had stood perfectly aghast with amazement at this scene what do you meansurely  i mean said the captain that this youth was taken up by one of our own detectives as a thief some weeks ago and was found travelling in a firstclass carriage without a ticket  young gurwood who had by this time recovered his selfpossession turned to his friend and saidexplain this matter tipps you know all about it  the only point that can puzzle you is that i did not know the name of captain lee when i travelled with him and therefore did not connect him with the gentleman to whom you said you meant to introduce me  tipps drew a long breath  oh said he i see it all now  why captain lee my friend is perfectly innocent  it was quite a mistake i assure you and the best proof of it is that he is a personal friend of our police superintendent who was on the spot at the time the accident occurred but we were all thrown into such confusion at the time that i dont wonder things were not cleared up  tipps hereupon went into a detailed account of the matter as far as he knew it at first to the surprise and then to the amusement of captain lee  fortunately for gurwood who would have found it difficult to explain the circumstance of his travelling without a ticket the captain was as prompt to acknowledge his erroneous impression as he had been to condemn  instead of listening to tipps he stopped him by suddenly grasping gurwoods hand and thanking him heartily for the prompt and able assistance he had rendered in rescuing his daughter from her perilous position on the day of the accident  of course edwin would not admit that rescue was the proper term to apply to his action and refused to admit that miss lee was in the slightest degree indebted to him at the same time assuring her and her father that it had afforded him the highest possible pleasure to have been of the slightest service to them  the end of it was that they all became extremely good friends and the captain in particular became quite jocular in reference to mistakes in general and stealing in particular until tipps pulling out his watch declared that procrastination was the thief of time and that as he happened to have business to transact with the police superintendent in reference to the very accident which had caused them all so much trouble he must unwillingly bid them adieu  stay tipps exclaimed the captain rising i shall accompany you to the station and introduce our friend gurwood to the scene of his future labours where continued the captain turning with a hearty air and patronising smile to edwin i hope you will lay the foundation of a career which will end in a managers or secretarys situation or some important post of that sort  goodbye emma ill not be back till dinnertime  emma bowed to the young men and said goodbye to her father with a smile so ineffably captivating that edwin resolved then and there to lay the foundation of a career which would end in a wife with nutbrown hair and large lustrous eyes  poor edwin  he was not the first man whose wayward spirit had been chained his impulses directed to good ends and aims and his destiny fixed by the smile of an innocent loving pretty girl  assuredly also he was not the last    chapter ten  sharp practice  standing with his back to the fireplace his legs slightly apart his hands in his pockets and his eyes fixed on the ceiling mr sharp police superintendent of the grand national trunk railway communed with himself and dived into the future  mr sharps powers of diving were almost miraculous  he had an unusually keen eye for the past and the present but in regard to the future his powers were all but prophetic  he possessed a rare capacity for following up clues investigating cases detecting falsehoods not only of the lip but of the eye and complexion and in a word was able to extract golden information out of the most unpromising circumstances he was also all but ubiquitous  now tracking a suspicion to its source on his own line in one of the midland counties anon comparing notes with a brother superintendent at the terminus of the great western or great northern or southeastern in london  sometimes called away to give evidence in a county court at other times taking a look in at his own home to kiss his wife or dandle his child before dashing off per express to follow up a clue to john ogroats or the lands end  here and there and everywherecalm selfpossessed and selfcontained making notes in trains writing reports in his office making discoveries and convictions and sometimes making prisoners with his own hands by night and day with no fixed hours for work or rest or meals and no certainty in anything concerning him save in the uncertainty of his movements mr sharp with his myrmidons was the terror of evil doers and we may truly add the safeguard of the public  little did that ungrateful public know all it owed to the untiring watchfulness and activity of mr sharp and his men  if he and his compeers were to be dismissed from our lines for a single week the descent of a host of thieves and scoundrels to commit widespread plunder would teach the public somewhat severely how much they owe to the efficient management of this department of railway business and how well constantly and vigilantlythough unobtrusivelytheir interests are cared for  but to return  mr sharp as we have said stood communing with himself and diving into the future  apparently his thoughts afforded him some amusement for his eyes twinkled slightly and there was a faintly humorous twist about the corners of his mouth  david blunt sat at a desk near him writing diligently  against the wall over his head hung a row of truncheons  besides the desk a bench two or three wooden chairs and a chest there was little furniture in the room  blunts busy pen at length ceased to move and sharp looked at him  well blunt he said i see nothing for it but to make a railway porter of you  by all means sir said blunt with a smile laying down his pen  gorton station continued sharp has become a very nest of thieves it is not creditable that such a state of things should exist for a week on our line  they have managed things very cleverly as yet  five or six bales of cloth have disappeared in the course of as many days besides several loaves of sugar and halfadozen cheeses  i am pretty sure who the culprits are but cant manage to bring it home to them so as i have said we must convert you into a porter  you have only been once engaged on this part of the linethat was at the accident when you were so hard on poor mr gurwood so that none of the gorton people will know you  i have arranged matters with our passenger superintendent  it seems that macdonell the stationmaster at gorton has been complaining that he is shorthanded and wants another porter that just suits us so we have resolved to give you that responsible situation  you will get a porters uniform from  at this point mr sharp was interrupted by the door opening violently and a detective in plain clothes entering with a stout young man in his grasp  who have we here asked mr sharp  man travelling without a ticket sir replied the detective whose calm demeanour was in marked contrast to the excitement of his prisoner  ha come here what have you to say for yourself demanded the superintendent of the man  hereupon the man began a violent exculpation of himself which entailed nearly halfanhour of vigorous crossquestioning and resulted in his giving a halfsatisfactory account of himself some trustworthy references to people in town and being set free  this case having been disposed of mr sharp resumed his conversation with blunt  having been changed then into a railway porter blunt you will proceed to gorton to discharge your duties there and while doing so you will make uncommonly good use of your eyes ears and opportunities  mr sharp smiled and blunt chuckled and at the same time joseph tipps entered the room  goodevening mr sharp he said  well anything more about these gorton robberies  nothing more yet mr tipps but we expect something more soon for a new porter is about to be sent to the station  tipps who was a very simple matteroffact man in some ways looked puzzled  why how will the sending of a new porter to the station throw light on the matter  you shall know in the course of time mr tipps replied the superintendent  we have wonderful ways of finding out things here  indeed you have said tipps and by the way that reminds me that they have some wonderful ways of finding out things on the continent as well as here  i have just heard of a clever thing done by a german professor  it seems that on one of the linesi forget whicha large box full of silverplate was despatched  it had a long way to go and before reaching its destination the plate was stolen and the box filled up with sand  on this being discovered of course every sort of investigation was set on foot but without success  at last the thing came to the ears of a professor of chemistryor the police went to him i dont know whichand it occurred to him that he might get a clue to the thieves by means of the sand in the box  you see the great difficulty the police had was to ascertain at which of the innumerable stations on the long line it was likely that the theft had taken place the professor ordered samples of the sand at all the stations on the line to be sent to him  these he analysed and examined with the microscope and found that one of the samples was precisely similar in all respects to the sand in the box  the attention of the police was at once concentrated on the station from which that sand had been gathered and in a short time the guilty parties were discovered and the theft brought home to them  now wasnt that clever  very good very good indeed said mr sharp approvingly and rather peculiar  i had a somewhat peculiar case myself last week  you know some time ago there was a quantity of cloth stolen on this line for which by the way we had to pay full compensation  well i could not get any clue to the thieves but at last i thought of a plan  i got some patterns of the cloth from the party that lost it and sent one of these to every station on the line where it was likely to have been stolen  just the other day i got a telegram from croon station stating that a man had been seen going about in a new suit exactly the same as the pattern  off i went immediately pounced on the man taxed him with the theft and found the remainder of the cloth in his house  capital exclaimed tipps that was smartly managed  and by the way wasnt there something about a case of stealing muffs and boas lately  yes and we got hold of that thief too the day before yesterday replied mr sharp  i felt sure from the way in which the theft was committed that it must be one of our own men and so it turned out  he had cut open a bale and taken out several muffs and boas of firstrate sable  one set of em he gave to his sweetheart who was seen wearing them in church on sunday  i just went to her and said i was going to put a question to her and warned her to speak the truth as it would be worse for all parties concerned if she attempted to deceive me  i then asked her if she had got the muff and boa from jim croydon the porter she blushed scarlet and admitted it at once but said poor thing that she had no idea they had been stolen and i believe her  this case occurred just after i had watched the milktruck the other night for three hours and found that the thief who had been helping himself to it every morning for some weeks past was the watchman at the station  i fear there are a great many bad fellows amongst us said tipps shaking his head  you are quite mistaken replied the superintendent  there were a good many bad fellows but i flatter myself that there are very few now in proportion to the number of men on the line  we are constantly winnowing them out purifying the ore as it were so that we are gradually getting rid of all the dross and leaving nothing but sterling metal on the line  why mr tipps you surely dont expect that railways are to be exempted from black sheep any more than other large companies  just look at the army and navy and see what a lot of rascals have to be punished and drummed out of the service every now and then  same everywhere  why when i consider that we employ over twenty thousand men and boys and that these men and boys are tempted more almost than any other class of people by goods lying about constantly in large quantities in the open air and in all sorts of lonely and outoftheway places my surprise is that our bad men are so few  no doubt we shall always have one or two prowling about and may occasionally alight on a nest of em but we shall manage to keep em downto winnow them out faster perhaps than they come in  i am just going about some little pieces of business of that sort now added mr sharp putting on his hat  did you wish to speak with me about anything in particular mr tipps  yes i wished to ask you if that fat woman mrs  whats her name  you mean mrs podge i suppose suggested sharp she who kicked her heels so vigorously at langrye after the accident  ah  mrs podgeyes  does she persist in her ridiculous claim for damages  she does having been urged to do so by some meddling friend for im quite sure that she would never have thought of doing so herself seeing that she received no damage at all beyond a fright  im going to pay her a visit today in reference to that very thing  thats all right then i wont detain you longer  goodbye mr sharp said tipps putting on his hat and quitting the office  not long afterwards mr sharp knocked at the door of a small house in one of the suburbs of clatterby and was ushered into the presence of mrs podge  that amiable lady was seated by the fire knitting a stocking  good afternoon mrs podge said mr sharp bowing and speaking in his blandest tones  i hope i see you quite well  mrs podge charmed with the strangers urbanity wished him good afternoon admitted that she was quite well and begged him to be seated  thank you mrs podge said mr sharp complying  i have taken the liberty of calling in regard to a small matter of businessbut pardon me he added rising and shutting the door i inadvertently left the door open which is quite inexcusable in me considering your delicate state of health  i trust that  my delicate state of health exclaimed mrs podge who was as fat as a prize pig and rather piqued herself on her good looks and vigour of body  yes continued mr sharp in a commiserating tone i have understood that since the accident on the railway your  oh as to that laughed mrs podge im not much the worse ofbut sir she said becoming suddenly grave you said you had called on business  i did  my business is to ask said mr sharp with a very earnest glance of his penetrating eyes on what ground you claim compensation from the grand national trunk railway  instantly mrs podges colour changed  she became languid and sighed  oh sirdamagesyesmy nerves  i did not indeed suffer much damage in the way of cuts or bruises though there was a good piece of skin torn off my elbow which i could show you if it were proper tobut my nerves received a terrible shock  they have not yet recovered indeed your abrupt way of putting it has quitethrown a  as mrs podge exhibited some symptoms of a hysterical nature at this point mr sharp assumed a very severe expression of countenance and said  now mrs podge do you really think it fair or just to claim damages from a company from whom you have absolutely received no damage  but sir said mrs podge recovering my nerves did receive damage  i do not doubt it mrs podge but we cannot compensate you for that if you had been laid up money could have repaid you for lost time or if your goods had been damaged it might have compensated for that but money cannot restore shocked nerves  did you require medical attendance  nno said mrs podge reddening  a friend did indeed insist on my seeing a doctor to whom at his suggestion i gave a fee of five shillings but to say truth i did not require him  ha was it the same friend who advised you to claim compensation  yees replied mrs podge a little confused  well mrs podge from your own admission i rather think that there seems something like a fraudulent attempt to obtain money here  i do not for a moment hint that you are guilty of a fraudulent intention but you must know maam that the law takes no notice of intentions only of facts  but have i not a right to expect compensation for the shock to my nervous system pleaded mrs podge still unwilling to give in  certainly not maam if the shock did not interfere with your ordinary course of life or cause you pecuniary loss  and does it not seem hard on railways if you can view the subject candidly to be so severely punished for accidents which are in many eases absolutely unavoidable perfection is not to be attained in a moment  we are rapidly decreasing our risks and increasing our safeguards  we do our best for the safety and accommodation of the public and as directors and officials travel by our trains as frequently as do the public concern for our own lives insures that we work the line in good faith  why maam i was myself near the train at the time of the accident at langrye and my nerves were considerably shaken  moreover there was a director with his daughter in the train both of whom were severely shaken but they do not dream of claiming damages on that account  if you could have shown mrs podge that you had suffered loss of any kind we should have offered you compensation promptly but as things stand  well well exclaimed mrs podge testily  i suppose i must give it up but i dont see why railway companies should be allowed to shock my nerves and then refuse to give me any compensation  but we do not absolutely refuse all compensation said mr sharp drawing out his purse if a sovereign will pay the five shilling fee of your doctor and any other little expenses that you may have incurred you are welcome to it  mrs podge extended her hand mr sharp dropped the piece of gold into it and then wishing her good afternoon quitted the house  the superintendent of police meditated as he walked smartly away from mrs podge on the wonderful differences that were to be met with in mankind as to the matter of acquisitiveness and his mind reverted to a visit he had paid some time before to another of the passengers in the train to which the accident occurred  this was the commercial traveller who had one of his legs rather severely injured  he willingly showed his injured limb to our superintendent when asked to do so but positively declined to accept of any compensation whatever although it was offered and appeared to think himself handsomely treated when a few free passes were sent to him by the manager  contrasting mrs podge unfavourably with this rare variety of the injured human race mr sharp continued his walk until he reached a part of the line not far from the station where a large number of vans and waggons were shunted on to sidingssome empty others loadedwaiting to be made up into trains and forwarded to their several destinations    chapter eleven  sharp practicecontinued  mr sharp had several peculiarities which at first sight might have puzzled a stranger  he was peculiar in his choice of routes by which to reach a given spot appearing frequently to prefer devious difficult and unfrequented paths to straight and easy roads  in the time of his visits to various places too he was peculiarly irregular and seemed rather to enjoy taking people by surprise  on the present occasion his chief peculiarity appeared to be a desire to approach the station by a roundabout road  in carrying out his plans he went round the corner of a house from which point of view he observed a goods train standing near a goodsshed with an engine attached  in order to reach it he had the choice of two routes  one of these was through a little wicketgate near to which a nightwatchman was stationedfor the shades of evening were by that time descending on the scene the other was through a back yard round by a narrow lane and over a paling which it required more than an average measure of strength and agility to leap  mr sharp chose the latter route  what were palings and narrow lanes and insecure footing in deepening gloom to him  why he rejoiced in such conditions  he didnt like easy work he abhorred a bed of rosesnot that he had ever tried one although it is probable that he had often enjoyed a couch of grass straw or nettles  rugged circumstances were his glory  it was as needful for him to encounter suchin his winnowing processesas it is for the harrow to encounter stones in preparing the cultivated field  moving quietly but swiftly round by the route before mentioned mr sharp came suddenly on the nightwatchman  goodevening jim  evenin sir  keep your eyes open tonight jim  we must find out who it is that has taken such a fancy to apples of late  i will sir ill keep a sharp lookout  it was jims duty to watch that locality of the line where large quantities of goods of all descriptions were unavoidably left to wait for a few hours on sidings  such watchmen are numerous on all lines and very necessary as well as valuable men most of them arefellows who hold the idea of going to rest at regular hours in quiet contempt men who sleep at any time of the night or day that chances to be most convenient and who think no more of a handtohand scuffle with a big thief or a burglar than they do of eating supper  nevertheless like every other class of men in this wicked world there are black sheep amongst them too  is that train going up to the station just now jim asked mr sharp pointing to the engine whose gentle simmering told of latent energy ready for immediate use  i believe so sir  ill go up with her  goodnight  mr sharp crossed the line and going towards the engine found that the driver and fireman were not upon it  he knew however that they could not be far offprobably looking after something connected with their trainand that they would be back immediately he climbed up to the footplate and sat down on the rail  he there became reflective and recalled with some degree of amusement as well as satisfaction some of the more recent incidents of his vocation  he smiled as he remembered how not very far from where he sat he had on a cloudy evening got into a horsebox and boring a hole in it with a gimlet applied his eye theretohis satellite david blunt doing the same in another end of the same horsebox and how having thus obtained a clear view of a truck in which several casks of wine were placed he beheld one of the servants on the line in company with one of his friends who was not a servant on the line coolly bore a hole in one of the wine casks and insert a straw and by that means obtain a prolonged and evidently satisfactory draughtwhich accounted at once for the fact that wine had been leaking in that locality for some time past and that the said servant had been seen more than once in a condition that was deemed suspicious  mr sharp also reflected complacentlyand he had time to reflect for the driver and fireman were rather long of comingon another case in which the thieves were so wary that for a long time he could make nothing of them although their depredations were confined to a train that passed along the line at a certain hour but at last were caught in consequence of his hitting on a plan of having a van specially prepared for himself  he smiled againalmost laughed when he thought of this vanhow it was regularly locked and labelled on a quiet siding how a plank was loosened in the bottom of it by which means he got into it and was then shunted out and attached to the train so that neither guard nor driver nor fireman had any idea of what was inside how he thereafter bored several small gimlet holes in the various sides of the van and kept a sharp lookout from station to station as they went along how at last he came to the particular placenot a station but a place where a short pause was madewhere the wary thieves were how he saw themtwo stout fellowsapproach in the gloom of evening and begin their wicked work of cutting tarpaulings and abstracting goods how he thereupon lifted his plank and dropped out on the line and how he powerfully astonished them by laying his hands on their collars and taking them both in the very act  at last mr sharps entertaining reflections were interrupted by the approach of the driver of the engine who carried a topcoat over his left arm  as he drew near and observed who stood upon his engine the man gave an involuntary and scarcely perceptible start  there must have been something peculiarly savage and ungenerous in the breast of mr sharp one would have thought to induce him to suspect a man whose character was blameless  but he did suspect that man on the faith of that almost imperceptible touch of discomposure and his suspicion did not dissipate although the man came boldly and respectfully forward  hoho thought mr sharp there is more chaff here to be winnowed than i had bargained for  his only remark however was  goodevening i suppose you start for the station in a few minutes  yes sir said the man moving towards the rear of the tender  youd better get up at once then said mr sharp descending quicklywhat have you got there my good man  my topcoat sir said the driver with a confused look  ah let us seeeh whats all this  a salmon a brace of grouse and a pair of rabbits  well you seem to have provided a good supper for tonight  there dont appear to be very stringent gamelaws where you come from  the man was so taken aback that he could not reply  as the fireman came out of the neighbouring goodsshed at that moment mr sharp ordered the driver to mount to his place and then waiting beside the engine received the fireman with an amiable goodnight  this man also had a topcoat over his arm betrayed the same uneasiness on observing mr sharp went though precisely the same examination and was found to have made an identically similar provision for his supper  almost immediately after him the guard issued from the shed also burdened with a topcoat  mr sharp muttered something about birds of a feather and was about to advance to meet the guard when that individuals eyes fell on him  he turned back at once not in a hurry but quietly as though he had forgotten something  the superintendent sprang through the open door but was too late  the guard had managed to drop his booty  thereupon mr sharp returned to the engine ordered the steam to be turned on and the driver drove himself and his friends to the station and to condign punishment  having disposed of this little incidental case mr sharpafter hearing and commenting upon several matters related to him by the members of his corps and having ordered david blunt to await him in the office as he had a job for him that nightreturned towards the locality which he had so recently quitted  in doing this he took advantage of another goods train from which he dropped at a certain holeandcorner spot while it was slowly passing the goodsshed before mentioned  from this spot he took an observation and saw the pipe of jim the nightwatchman glowing in the dark distance like a star of the first magnitude  ha thought mr sharp smoking  youll have to clear your eyes of smoke if you hope to catch thieves tonight my fine fellow but i shall try to render you some able assistance  so thinking he moved quietly about among the vans and trucks stooping and climbing as occasion required and doing it all so noiselessly that had the night permitted him to be visible at all he might have been mistaken for a stout shadow or a ghost  he went about somewhat like a retriever snuffing the air for game  at last he reached a truck not very far from the place where jim paced slowly to and fro watching no doubt for thieves  little did he think how near he was to a thief at that moment  the truck beside which mr sharp stood sent forth a delicious odour of american apples  the superintendent of police smelt them  worse than thathe undid a corner of the thick covering of the track raised it and smelt againhe put in a hand  evidently his powers of resistance to temptation were small for both hands went inhe stooped his head and then slowly but surely his whole body went in under the cover and disappeared  infatuated superintendent  while he lay there gorging himself no doubt with the dainty fruit honest jim paced slowly to and fro until a very dark and quiet hour of the night having arrived he deemed it time to act put out his pipe and moved with stealthy tread towards the appletruck  there were no thieves about as far as he could see  he was placed there for the express purpose of catching thieves  ridiculous waste of time and energyhe would make a thief he would become one he would detect and catch himself repay himself with apples for his trouble and enjoy himself consumedly  noble idea no sooner thought than carried into effect  he drew out a large claspknife which opened and locked with a click and cut a tremendous slash about two feet long in the cover of the truckpassing in so doing within an inch of the demoralised superintendents nose thieves you see are not particular unless indeed we may regard them as particularly indifferent to the injuries they inflict on their fellowmenbut what did we say their fellowmena railway is not a fellowman  surely jims sin in robbing a railway must be regarded as a venial one  honest men do that every day and appear to think nothing of it  nobody appears to think anything of it  a railway would seem to be the one great unpardonable outlaw of the land which does good to nobody and is deemed fair game by everybody who can catch itnapping but it is not easily caught napping  neither was mr superintendent sharp  jims hand came through the hole in the covering and entered some sort of receptacle which must have been broken open by somebody for the hand was quickly withdrawn with three apples in it  again it entered mr sharp might have kissed it easily but he was a man of considerable selfrestraintat least when others were concerned  he thought it advisable that there should be some of the stolen goods found in jims pockets  he did not touch the hand therefore while it was drawn back with other three apples in it  you see it was a large hand and could hold three at a time  a third time it entered and grasped more of the forbidden fruit  theres luck in odd numbers thought mr sharp as he seized the wrist with both of his iron hands and held it fast  the appalling yell which jim uttered was due more to superstitious dread than physical fear for on discovering that the voice which accompanied the grip was that of mr sharp he struggled powerfully to get free after the first violent effort was over mr sharp suddenly slid one hand along jims arm caught him by the collar and launching himself through the hole which had been cut so conveniently large plunged into jims bosom and crushed him to the earth  this was quite sufficient for jim who got up meekly when permitted and pleaded for mercy  mr sharp told him that mercy was a commodity in which he did not deal that it was the special perquisite of judges from whom he might steal it if they would not give or sell it to him and bidding him come along quietly led him to the station and locked him up for the night  not satisfied with what he had already accomplished mr sharp then returned to his office where he found the faithful blunt awaiting him to whom he related briefly what he had done  now said he in conclusion if we can only manage to clear up that case of the beercask we shall have done a good stroke of business today  have you found out anything in regard to it  the case to which mr sharp referred was that of a cask of beer which had been stolen from the line at a station not three miles distant from clatterby  yes sir said david blunt with a satisfied smile i have found out enough to lead to the detection of the thief  indeed who dye think it is  one of the men at the station sir  there have been two about it but the other is a stranger  you see sir continued blunt with an earnest look and in a business tone of voice when you sent me down to investigate the case i went drect to the stationmaster there and heard all he had to say about itwhich wasnt muchthen off i goes to where the truck was standin from which the cask had bin taken and pottered about there for some time  at last i tried on the red indian dodge followed up tracks and signs till at last i came upon a mark as if somethin had bin rolled along the bank and soon traced it to a gap broken through a hedge into a field  i followed it up in the field and in a short time came on the cask itself  of course i made a careful examination of the locality and found very distinct footprints particularly one of em on a piece of clay as sharp as if it had been struck in wax  while thus engaged i found a shoe  ha exclaimed mr sharp  and here it is said blunt taking the shoe from under his chair and laying it on the table  the superintendent took it up examined it and then replaced it on the table with a nod saying proceed  well sir of course i looked well for the other shoe but didnt find it so i came away with what i had got takin care to place a lump of a stone over the footprint in the clay so as to guard but not touch itfor it wasnt the print of this shoe sir though somewhat like it  ha exclaimed mr sharp again  after revolving the matter in his mind for some minutes and consulting with his satellite mr sharp resolved to go down at once to the place and watch the beercask  it is not very late yet he said and these thirsty boys will be sure to want a drop of beer to their supper tonight  what makes you so sure that bill jones is the thief  because answered blunt i observed that he was the only man at the station that had on a pair of new shoes  well come along said sharp smiling grimly we shall find out before long  they soon reached the scene of the robbery and were able to examine the place by the light of the moon which had just managed to pierce the thick veil of clouds that had covered it during the earlier part of that night  then they retired to a shady cavern or hole or hollow at the foot of the embankment near to the gap in the hedge and there they prepared to pass the night with a heap of mingled clods and stones for their couch and an overhanging bank of nettles for their canopy  it was a long weary watch that began  there these patient men sat hour after hour gazing at the moon and stars till they almost fell asleep and then entering into animated though softly uttered conversation until they roused themselves up  it was strange converse too about struggles and fights with criminals and the detection of crime  but it was not all on such subjects  no they forsook the professional path occasionally and strayed as pleasantly as other men do into the flowery lanes of social lifetalking of friends and wives and children and home with as much pathos and tenderness as if their errand that night had been to succour some comrade in distress instead of to watch like wolves and pounce on unawares and half throttle if need be and bear off to punishment an erring fellowmortal  but no fellowmortal came that night to be thus pounced on throttled and borne off  when it became obvious that there was no use in remaining longer mr sharp and his satellite returned to the office and the former bade the latter go home for the night  the satellite thus set free went home and set immediatelyin his bed the luminary himself postponed his setting for a time put the thiefs shoe in his pocket and went straight to the residence of bill jones which he reached shortly after the grey dawn had appeared  here he found bill in bed but being peremptory in his demand for admission bill arose and let him in  you look rather pale this morning bill  bin at work late sir said bill uneasily observing that the superintendent was casting an earnest glance all round his room  jones was a bachelor so there wasnt much of any kind to look at in the room  youve been treating yourself to a new pair of shoes i see jones what have you done with the old ones  itheyre wornout siri  yes i seeah here is one of them said mr sharp drawing an old shoe out of a corner you dont require to look for the other ive got it here he added drawing its fellow from his pocket  jones stood aghast  look here jones said mr sharp gazing sternly into the culprits face you neednt trouble yourself to deny the theft  i havent yet looked at the sole of this shoe but ill engage to tell how many tackets are in it  we have discovered a little lump of clay down near the station with a perfect impression of a sole having fifteen tackets thereinthree being wanting on the right side two on the left and one at the toenow let us see he said turning it up am i not a good prophet eh  bill gave in at once  he not only made a clean breast of it but also gave information that led to the capture of his accomplice before that days sun went down and before mr sharp allowed himself to go to bed  thus did our superintendent winnow the chaff from the wheat continually  now dear reader do not say from all this it would appear that railway servants must be a bad lot of men  it would be a thousand pities to fail into such an error when we are labouring to prove to you the very reverse namely that the bad ones being continually and well looked after none but the good are left  our aim necessarily involves that we should dilate much on evil so that the evil unavoidably bulks large in your eyes but if we were capable of laying before you all the good that is done felt and said by the thousands of our truehearted menoftheline the evil that is mingled with them would shrink into comparative insignificance  the truth is that in writing these details we desire to reassure ourself as well as to comfort you o timid railway traveller by asserting and illustrating the unquestionable fact that if our dangers on the line are numerous and great our safeguards at all points are far more numerous and much greater    chapter twelve  loos garden  the plans of nurses not less than those of mice and men are apt to get into disorder  mrs durby having packed up the diamond ring in the careful manner which we have described in a previous chapter essayed to get ready for her important journey to london on pawning purposes intent but she found that there were so many little preparations to make both in regard to her own toilette and to the arrangements of mrs tipps establishment in prospect of its being left without its first mate for a time that a considerable period elapsed before she got her anchor tripped and herself ready to set sail with the first fair wind worthy mrs durby we may observe was fond of quoting the late captains phraseology  she was an affectionate creature and liked to recall his memory in this somewhat peculiar fashion  in anticipation of this journey netta went one evening in company with emma lee to pay mrs john marrot a friendly visit ostensibly for the purpose of inquiring after the health of baby marrot who having recently fallen downstairs swallowed a brass button and eaten an unknown quantity of shoeblacking had been somewhat ailing  the real object of the visit however was to ask mrs marrot to beg of her husband to take a special interest in mrs durby on her journey as that excellent nurse had made up her mind to go by the train which he drove feeling assured that if safety by rail was attainable at all it must be by having a friend at courta good and true man at the helm so to speak  but la miss said mrs marrot sitting on the bed and patting the baby whose ruling passion mischief could not be disguised even in distress seeing that it gleamed from his glassy eyes and issued in intermittent yells from his fevered throat if your nurse is of a narvish temperment shed better not go with my john cause he usually drives the flyin dutchman  indeed said netta with a puzzled smile and pray what is the flyin dutchman  a yell and a glare from baby interrupted the reply  at the same instant the 745 pm express flew past with a roar which was intensified by the whistle into a shriek as it neared the station  the house trembled as usual  netta not unnaturally shuddered  dont be alarmed miss its only the express  do expresses often pass your cottage in that way asked netta with a touch of pity  bless you yes miss theyre always passin day and night continooly but we dont think nothink of it  weve got used to it now  does it not disturb you at night asked emma lee in some surprise  no miss it dontnot in the least  no doubt it sometimes do influence our dreams if i may say so  as my son bob sayshes a humorous boy is my bob misshe says says he the trains cant awaken us but they do awaken noo trains of ideas especially wen they stops right opposite the winder an blows off steam or whistles like mad for five minutes at a time  i sometimes think that bob is right an thats wy baby have took to yellin an mischief with such a igh and  they do say that a man is knowd by the company he keeps and im sure its no wonder that baby should screech an smash as he do considerin the example set im day an night by them ingines  here another yell from baby gave as it were assent to these opinions  but as i was sayin continued mrs marrot the flyin dutchman is the name that my usbands train goes by cause it is the fastest train in the kingdomso they say  it goes at the rate of over sixty miles an hour an aint just quite the train for people as is narvishthough my usband do say it aint more dangerous than other trainsnot smuch so indeed wich i believe myself for there aint nothink appened to my john all the eight years he have drove it  is sixty miles an hour very much faster than the rate of ordinary trains asked emma  wy yes miss  ornary trains they run between twenty and forty miles an hour though sometimes in goin down inclines they git up to fifty but my usband averages sixty miles an hour an on some parts o the line e gits up the speed to sixtyfive an siventy  for my own part im quite hignorant of these things  to my mind all the ingines seem to go bangin an rushin an yellin about pretty much in the same furious way but ive often eard my usband explain it all an he knows all about it miss just as if it wor a b c  having discussed such matters a little longer and entered with genuine sympathy into the physical and mental condition of baby netta finally arranged that her old nurse should go by the flying dutchman seeing that she would be unable to distinguish the difference of speed between one train and another while her mind would be at rest if she knew herself to be under the care of a man in whom she could trust  well miss i dessay it wont much matter said mrs marrot endeavouring to soothe the baby in whom the button or the blacking appeared to be creating dire havoc but of course my usband cant attend to er isself not bein allowed to attend to nothink but is ingine  but hell put er in charge of the guard who is a very andsome man and uncommon polite to ladies  stay ill speak to willum garvie about it now said mrs marrot rising hes in the garding beind  pray dont call him in said netta rising quickly we will go down to him  i should like much to see your garden  youll find my loo there too said mrs marrot with a motherly smile as she opened the door to let her visitors out  youll excuse me not goin hout  i dursnt leave that baby for a minute  hed be over the there he  the sentence was cut short by a yell followed by a heavy bump and the door shut with a bang which sent emma and her friend round the corner of the house in a highly amused frame of mind  john marrots garden was a small oneso small that the breakvan of his own flyin dutchman could have contained it easilybut it was not too small to present a luxuriance fertility and brilliance of colour that was absolutely magnificent  surrounded as that garden was by ballast from the embankment broken wheels and rail bricks and stones and other miscellaneous refuse and debris of the line it could only be compared to an oasis in the desert or a bright gem on a rugged warriors breast  this garden owed its origin to lucy marrots love for flowers and it owed much of its magnificence to will garvies love for lucy for that amiable fireman spent much of his small wage in purchasing seed and other things for the improvement of that garden and spent the very few hours of his life not claimed by the inexorable iron horse in assisting to cultivate the same  we use the word assisting advisedly because loo would not hear of his taking this sort of work out of her hands  she was far too fond of it to permit that but she had no objection whatever to his assistance there never was so will and loo thought anything like the love which these two bore to each other  extremes meet undoubtedly  their love was so intensely matter of fact and earnest that it rose high above the region of romance in which lower region so many of our race do delight to coo and sigh  there was no nonsense about it  will garvie who was naturally boldno wonder considering his meteorlike style of life saw all the flowers in the garden as well as any other man and admired them more than most men but he said gravely that he wouldnt give the end of a cracked boilertube for the whole garden if she were not in the midst of it  at which loo laughed heartily and blushed with pleasure and made no other reply  it was quite delightful to observe the earnestness with which these two devoted themselves to the training of honeysuckle and jessamine over a trelliswork porch in that preposterously small garden in which there was such a wealth of sweet peas and roses and marigolds and mignonette and scarlet geraniums and delicatelycoloured heliotropes that it seemed as though they were making love in the midst of a glowing furnace  gertie was there too like a small female cupid nestling among the flowers  a miniature paradise whispered emma with twinkling eyes as they approached the unconscious pair  yes with adam and eve training the flowers responded netta quite earnestly  adam making love in the fustian costume of the fireman of the flying dutchman was an idea which must have struck emma in some fashion for she found it difficult to command her features when introduced to the inhabitants of that little eden by her friend  i have called to tell mrs marrot said netta that my old nurse mrs durby is going to london soon and that i wished your father to take a sort of charge of her more for the sake of making her feel at ease than anything else  im quite sure he will be delighted to do that said loo wont he will  why yes replied the fireman your father is not the man to see a woman in distress and stand by  hell give her in charge of the guard for you see maam hes not allowed to leave his engine  will addressed the latter part of his remarks to netta  that is just what mrs marrot said and that will do equally well would you like to travel on the railway gertie said netta observing that the child was gazing up in her face with large earnest eyes  no answered gertie with decision  no why not  because it takes father too often away and once it nearly killed him said gertie  ah that was the time that my own dear mother received such a shock i suppose  no maam said will garvie gertie is thinkin of another time when jack marrot was drivin an excursion trainnot three years gone by and he ran into a lot of empty trucks that had broke loose from a train in advance  they turned the engine off the rails and it ran down an embankment into a ploughed field where it turned right over on the top of jack  fortunately he fell between the funnel and the steamdome which was the means of savin his life but he got a bad shake and was off duty some six or eight weeks  the fireman escaped without a scratch and as the coupling of the leading carriage broke the train didnt leave the metals and no serious damage was done to any one else i think our gertie continued will laying his big strong hand gently on the childs head seems to have taken an illwill to railways since then  im not surprised to hear it observed emma lee as she bent down and kissed gerties forehead  i have once been in a railway accident myself and i share your dislike but i fear that we couldnt get on well without them now so you and i must be content to tolerate them gertie  i spose so was gerties quiet response delivered much to the amusement of her audience with the gravity and the air of a grown woman  well goodevening gertie goodevening said netta turning to garvie then i may tell my nurse that the enginedriver of the express will take care of her  yes maam you may for the matter o that the fireman of the express will keep an eye on her too said the gallant william touching his cap as the two friends left that bright oasis in the desert and returned to eden villa    chapter thirteen  treats of railway literature sleepy porters crowded platforms foolish passengers dark plotters lively shawls and other matters  john marrot was remarkably fond of his iron horse  no dragoon or hussar that we ever read of paid half so much attention to his charger  he not only rubbed it down and fed and watered it at stated intervals but when not otherwise engaged or when awaiting the signal to start a train he was sure to be found with a piece of waste rubbing off a speck of dust here or a drop of superfluous oil there or giving an extra polish to the bright brasses or a finishing touch to a handle or lever in quite a tender way  it was evidently a labour of love  on the day which mrs durby had fixed for her journey to london john and his fireman went to the shed as usual one hour before the time of starting being required to do so by the rules and regulations of the company for the purpose of overhauling the iron horse  and by the way a wonderful and suggestive volume was this book of rules and regulations for the guidance of the officers and servants of the grand national trunk railway  it was a printed volume of above two hundred pages containing minute directions in regard to every department and every detail of the service  it was printed for private circulation but we venture to say that if the public saw it their respect for railway servants and railway difficulties and management would be greatly increased the more so that one of the first rules enjoined was that each servant should be held responsible for having a knowledge of all the rulesthose relating to other departments as well as to his own  and it may not be out of place certainly it will not be uninteresting to mention here that one of the rules rendered prominent by large black capitals enjoined that the public safety must be the first and chief care of every officer and servant of the company  we have reason to believe that all the railways in the kingdom give this rule equal prominence in spiritprobably also in type  in this little volume it was likewise interesting to note that civility to the public was strictly enjoined and sure we are that every railway traveller will agree with us in the opinion that railway agents guards and porters all in short with whom the public come in contact obey this rule heartily in the spirit and in the letter  the particular rules in the book which affected our enginedriver were uncommonly stringent and very properly so seeing that the lives of so many persons depended on the constancy of his coolness courage and vigilance  john marrot like all the enginedrivers on the line was a picked man  in virtue of his superior character and abilities he received wages to the extent of 2 pounds 10 shillings per week  among other things he was enjoined by his rules and regulations very strictly to give a loud whistle before starting to start his train slowly and without a jerk and to take his orders to start only from the guard also to approach stations or stopping places cautiously and with the train well under control and to be guided in the matter of shutting off steam by such considerations as the number of vehicles in the train and the state of the weather and rails so as to avoid violent application of the brakes  moreover he was bound to do his best to keep to his exact time and to account for any loss thereof by entering the cause of delay on his reportticket  he was also earnestly enjoined to use every effort which might conduce to the safety of the public and was authorised to refuse to proceed with any carriage or waggon which from hot axles or otherwise was in his opinion unfit to run  these are but a few specimens culled from a multitude of rules bearing on the minutest details of his duty as to driving shunting signalling junction and level crossing etcetera with all of which he had to become not merely acquainted but so intimately familiar that his mind could grasp them collectively relatively or individually at any moment so as to act instantaneously yet coolly while going like a giant bombshell through the airwith human lives in the balance to add weight to his responsibilities  if any man in the world needed a cool clear head and a quick steady hand with ample nightly as well as sabbath rest that man was john marrot the enginedriver  when we think of the constant pressure of responsibility that lay on him and the numbers in the kingdom of the class to which he belonged it seems to us almost a standing miracle that railways are so safe and accidents so very rare  while our enginedriver was harnessing his iron steed another of the railway servants having eaten his dinner felt himself rather sleepy and resolved to have a short nap  it was our friend sam natly the porter who came to this unwise as well as unfair resolution  yet although we are bound to condemn sam we are entitled to palliate his offence and constrained to pity him for his period of duty during the past week had been fifteen hours a day  shameful exclaims some philanthropist  true but who is to take home the shame  not the officers of the company who cannot do more than their best with the materials laid to their hands not the directors who cannot create profits beyond the capacity of their linealthough justice requires us to admit that they might reduce expenses by squabbling less with other companies and ceasing unfair because ruinous as well as ungenerous competition clearly the bulk of the shame lies with the shareholders who encourage opposition for the sake of increasing their own dividends at the expense of their neighbours and who insist on economy in directions which render the line inefficientto the endangering of their own lives as well as those of the public  economy in the matter of railway servantsin other words their reduction in numbersnecessitates increase of working hours which beyond a certain point implies inefficiency and danger  but the general public are not free from a modicum of this shame and have to thank themselves if they are maimed and killed because they descend on railways for compensation with a ruthless hand shame to government here for allowing it and still further impoverish their already overtaxed coffers  compensation for injury is just but compensation as it is and has been claimed and awarded is ridiculously unfair as well as outrageously unwise  fortunately sam natlys wicked resolve to indulge in undutiful slumber did not result in evil on this occasion although it did result in something rather surprising  it might have been far otherwise had sam been a pointsman  in order to enjoy fully the halfhour which he meant to snatch from duty sam entered a firstclass carriage which stood on a siding and creeping under a seat laid himself out at full length pillowing his head on his arm  tired men dont require featherbeds  he was sound asleep in two minutes  it so happened that threequarters of an hour afterwards an extra firstclass carriage was wanted to add to the train which john marrot was to horse on its arrival at clatterby  the carriage in which sam lay was selected for the purpose drawn out and attached to the train  tired men are not easily awakened  sam knew nothing of this change in his sleeping apartment  meanwhile clatterby station became alive with travellers  the train drew up to the platform  some passengers got out others got in  the engine which brought it there being in need of rest coal and water moved off to the shed  john marrot with his lieutenant garvie moved to the front on his iron horse looking as calm and sedate in his conscious power as his horse looked heavy and unyielding in its stolidity  never did two creatures more thoroughly belie themselves by their looks  the latent power of the iron horse could have shot it forth like an arrow from a bow or have blown the whole station to atoms  the smouldering fires in johns manly breast could have raised him from a begrimed somewhat sluggish driver to a brilliant hero  some of the characters who have already been introduced at clatterby station were there on this occasion also  mr sharp was there looking meditative as usual and sauntering as though he had nothing particular to do  our tall superlative fop with the sleepy eyes and long whiskers was also there with his friend of the checked trousers  mr sharp felt a strong desire to pommel these fops because he had found them very difficult to deal with in regard to compensation the fop with the checked trousers having claimed and finally obtained an unreasonably large sum for the trifling injury done to his eye on the occasion of the accident at langrye station  mr sharp could not however gratify his desire  on the contrary when the checked trousers remarked in passing that it was vewy disagweeable weather he felt constrained to admit civilly enough that it was  the two fops had a friend with them who was not a fop but a plain practicallooking man with a forbidding countenance and a large tall powerful frame  these three retired a little apart from the bustle of the station and whispered together in earnest tones  their names were the reverse of romantic for the fop with the checked trousers was addressed as smith he with the long whiskers as jenkins and the large man as thomson  are you sure he is to go by this train asked thomson somewhat gruffly  quite sure  there can be no mistake about it replied jenkins from whose speech strange to say the lisp and drawl had suddenly disappeared  and how are you sure of knowing him if as you say you have never seen him asked thomson  by the bag of course answered smith whose drawl had also disappeared unaccountably we have got a minute description of the moneybag which he has had made peculiarly commonplace and shabby on purpose  it is black leather but very strong with an unusually thick flat handle  hes very late observed thomson moving uneasily and glancing at the clock as the moment of departure drew near  mr sharp observed the consulting party and sauntered idly towards them but they were about as sharp as himself in practice if not in name  the lisps and drawls returned as if by magic and the turf became the subject of interest about which they were consulting  just then a shriek was heard to issue from a female throat and a stout elderly woman was observed in the act of dashing wildly across the line in the midst of moving engines trucks and vans  even in these unwonted circumstances no one who knew her could have mistaken mrs durbys ponderous person for a moment  she had come upon the station at the wrong side and in defiance of all printed regulations to the contrarynone of which she could read being shortsightedshe had made a bold venture to gain her desired position by the most direct route  this involved crossing a part of the line where there were several sidings and branch lines on which a good deal of pushing of trucks and carriages to and frothat is shuntingwas going on  like a reckless warrior who by a bold and sudden push sometimes gains singlehanded the centre of an enemys position before he is discovered and assailed on every side straight forward mrs durby ran into the very midst of a brisk traffic before any one discovered her  suddenly a passengertrain came up with the usual caution in such circumstances nevertheless at a smart rattling pace for usual caution does not take into account or provide for the apparition of stout elderly females on the line  the driver of the passenger engine saw her shut off steam shouted applied the brakes and whistled furiously  we have already hinted that the weather was not fine  mrs durbys umbrella being up hid the approaching train  as for screaming steamwhistles the worthy woman had come to regard intermittent whistling as a normal condition of railways which like the crying of cross babies meant little or nothing and had only to be endured  she paid no attention to the alarm  in despair the driver reversed his engine fire flew from the wheels and the engine was brought to a stand but not until the buffers were within three feet of the nurses shoulder  at that moment she became aware of her danger uttered a shriek as we have said that would have done credit to the whistle of a small engine and bending her head with her umbrella before her rushed frantically away on another line of rails  she did not observe poor soul that a goods train was coming straight down that line towards herpartly because her mental vision was turned in terror to the rear and partly because the umbrella obscured all in advance  in vain the driver of the goods engine repeated the warnings and actions of the passenger engine  his had more speed on and was heavier besides mrs durby charged it at the rate of full five miles an hour with the umbrella steadily in front and a brown paper parcel swinging wildly on her arm as if her sole desire on earth was to meet that goods engine in single combat and beat out its brains at the first blow  certain it is that mrs durbys career would have been cut short then and there if tall joe turner the guard had not been standing at the tail of his own train and observed her danger  in the twinkling of an eye he dropped his slow dignified air leaped like a panther in front of the goods engine caught mrs durby with both handsany howand hurled her and himself off the linenot a moment too soon for the buffer of the engine touched his shoulder as they fell together to the ground  a lusty cheer was given by those on the platform who witnessed this bold rescue and more than one sympathetic hand grasped the massive fist of joe turner as he assisted mrs durby to a carriage  why exclaimed will garvie hurrying forward at that moment its mrs durby the woman we promised to take care of  youll look after her joe  all right said the guard as will hurried back to his engine this way maam  got your ticket  nno gasped the poor nurse leaning heavily on her protectors arm  here dick cried joe hailing a porter run to the bookingoffice and get her a ticket for london firstclass shes got a bad shake poor thing  no doubt the company will stand the difference if not well make it up amongst us  hereupon a benevolent old gentleman drew out his purse and insisted on paying the whole of the fare himself a point which no one seemed inclined to dispute and mrs durby was carefully placed by joe in a carriage by herself  there were two gentlemenalso known to the readerwho arrived just in time to witness this incident the one was captain lee the other edwin gurwood  they both carried bags and rugs and were evidently going by that train  the captain who happened to have a bad cold at the time was muffled up to the eyes in a white worsted comforter and had a fur travellingcap pulled well down on his forehead so that little of him save the point of his nose was visible  the moment that the two fops caught sight of captain lee they whispered to thomson  thats our man  sure demanded thomson  quite replied smith  thats about the size and make of the man as described to me  of course they could not tell what sort of travelling gear he would appear in but theres no mistaking the bagold stout leather with flat handlestrap  all right said thomson but whos the young fellow with him  dont know replied smith yet i think ive seen his face before stay jenkins wasnt he in the accident at langrye station  perhaps he was but its of no consequence to us  it will be of consequence to us if he goes with the old gentleman retorted smith for hes a stout fellow and wouldnt be easy to manage  ill manage him no fear said thomson looking at the unconscious edwin with a dark sinister smile  what if they get into a carriage thats already nearly full suggested the dubious smith  they wont do that replied jenkins with a laugh  it seems to be against the laws of human nature to do that  as long as there are empty carriages in a train so long will men and women pass every carriage that has a soul in it until they find an empty one for themselves  we have nothing to do but follow them and when they have pitched on a carriage get in after them and fill it up so we shall have it all to ourselves  come along then its time to stop talking and to act said thomson testily as he moved towards the carriages  that even the wisest of men in his own conceit may make mistakes now and then is a fact which was beautifully illustrated on this occasion we may here let the reader into the secret of jenkins smith and thomson  they were men who lived by their wits  they had ascertained that a partner of a certain house that dealt in jewellery meant to return to london by that particular train with a quantity of valuables that were worth running some risk for  on the journey there was one stoppage quite close to london  the run immediately before that was a clear one of seventyfive miles without a halt at full express speed which would afford them ample opportunity for their purpose while the slowing of the train on approaching the stopping place would give them opportunity and time to leap out and make off with their booty  they had been told that their intended victim was a stout resolute man but that would avail nothing against numbers  having obtained all requisite information they had proceeded thus far with their villainous design apparently with success  but at this point a hitch occurred though they knew it not  they had not taken sufficiently into account the fact that black leather bags may be both stout and peculiar and in some degree similar without being identical hence smith and jenkins in their selfconfidence had settled as we have seen that captain lee was their man whereas their man was comfortably seated in another carriage and by his side the coveted bag which was similar in some points to that of the captain but different in size and in several small details  following the wrong scent therefore with wonted pertinacity the three men sauntered behind captain lee and edwin who true to the laws with which jenkins had credited human nature passed one carriage after another until they found an empty one  here is one gurwood said the captain  he was about to step into it when he observed mrs durby sitting in the next compartment  hallo nurse he exclaimed getting in and sitting down opposite to her why surely it wasnt you was it that had such a narrow escape  indeed it was capting lee replied mrs durby in a half whimper for albeit a woman of strong character she was not proof against such rough treatment as she had experienced that day  not hurt i trust asked the captain sympathetically  oh dear no sir only shook a bit  are you alone asked edwin seating himself beside his friend  yes sir but la sir i dont think nothink of travellin alone  im used to it sir  as she said this the guards voice was heard desiring passengers to take their seats and the three men who had grouped themselves close round the door thus diverging one or two passengers into the next compartment entered and sat down  at the same moment mr sharps earnest countenance appeared at the window  he made a few remarks to captain lee and edwin gurwood and took occasion to regard the three adventurers with much attention  they evidently understood him for they received his glances with bland smiles  it was quite touching to note mr sharps anxiety to lay hold of these men  he chanced to know nothing about them save in connexion with the langrye accident but his long experience in business had given him a delicate power of perception in judging of character which was not often at fault  he as it were smelt the presence of fair game although he could not manage to lay immediate hold of it just as that celebrated giant did who once upon a time went about his castle giving utterance to wellknown words  fee fo fa fum i smell the smell of an englishman  joe he whispered as the guard came up to lock the door just keep an eye on these three fellows will you  id lay my life on it that theyre up to mischief today  joe looked knowing and nodded  show your tickets please he said touching his cap to his director and edwin  the tickets were producedall right  mrs durby in getting out hers although of course having got it for her joe did not require to see it dropped her precious brown paper parcel  picking it up again hastily she pressed it to her bosom with such evident anxiety that men much less sharpwitted than our trio would have been led to suspect that it contained something valuable  but they aimed at higher booty just then and apparently did not notice the incident  a rapid banging of doors had now set ina sure precursor of the starting whistle  before it was quite completed the inevitable late passenger appeared in the distance  this time it was a lady middleaged and stout and short of wind but with an iron will as was clearly evinced by the energy with which she raced along the platform carrying a large bundle of shawls in one arm and a travellingbag in the other which she waved continuously as she shouted stop stop stop the traiiiin  im coming  the guard with the whistle already halfway to his lips paused and glanced at his watch  there was a fraction of a moment left  he stepped to a carriage and threw open a door  make haste maam make haste please was said in urgent though respectful tones  the late passenger plunged inshe might as far as appearances went be said to have taken a header into the carriageand the door was shut  the guards whistle sounded  the enginedrivers whistle gave prompt reply and next instant the train moved  no one could conceive of such a thing as a train starting when john marrot drove  as the carriages glided by mr sharp cast a passing glance on the late passenger  he observed that her bundle of shawls moved of its own accord and for one whole minute after the train had left he stood motionless meditating on that curious phenomenon  he had often heard of tableturning but never until now had he seen inanimate matter move of its own accord  can we feel surprised that he was both astonished and perplexed  proceeding to the bookingoffice he held a brief conversation with the clerks there then he sauntered into the telegraphoffice and delivered a message after which he left the station with a quiet smile on his sedate countenance    chapter fourteen  which is too full of varied matter to be briefly described  meanwhile let us fly through space with greater than railway speed and overtake the flying dutchman  it has got up full speed by this time  about one mile a minutesixty miles an hour  sometimes it goes a little faster sometimes a little slower according to the nature of the ground for a railway is by no means a levelway the ascents and descents being occasionally very steep  those who travel in the carriages form but a faint conception of the pace  to realise it to the full you must stand on the engine with john marrot and will garvie  houses fields trees cattle human beings go by in wild confusionthey appear only to vanish  wind is not felt in the carriages  on the lightning you are in a gale  it reminds one of a storm at sea  the noise too is terrific  we once had the good fortune to ride on the engine of the flying dutchman and on that occasion had resolved to converse with the driver and tried it as well might we have tried to converse amid the rattling of ten thousand tin kettles  john marrot put his mouth to our ear and roared  we heard him faintly  we tried to shout to him he shook his head put his hand to his ear and his ear to our mouth  doesitnotinjureyourhearing  nosirnotatall  itsworstonourlegs  we subsided into silence and wonderment  we had also resolved to take notes and tried it  egyptian hieroglyphics are not more comprehensible than the notes we took  we made a discovery however near the end of the journeynamely that by bending the knees and keeping so writing became much more possibleor much less impossible  we learnt this from john who had to fill up in pencil a sort of statement or reportticket on the engine  it was interesting and curious to note the fact that of the sentences thus written one word was pencilled in the grounds of the earl of edderline the next opposite the mansion of lord soberly the third in the midst of langly moor the fourth while crashing through the village of efferby and a full stop was added at the mouth of the great ghostly tunnel think of that ye teachers of penmanship in twelve lessons and hide your diminished heads  john marrots engine of which we have said much and of which we mean to say still more was not only a stupendous but a complex creation its body consisted of above 5400 pieces all of which were almost as delicately fashioned and put together with as much care as watchwork it was a confirmed teetotaller too  the morning draught which john had given it before starting to enable it to run its seventyseven miles was 800 gallons of cold water  he also gave it a good feed to begin with and laid in for its sustenance on the trip one ton of coals its power to act vigorously may be gathered from the fact that one morning some years before john had got the fire up with unwonted rapidity and no sooner had the minimum of steam necessary to move it been created than it quietly advanced and passed out of its shed through a brick wall fourteen inches thick with as much ease as it would have gone through a sheet of brown paper  this being its power when starting at what we may regard as a quiet walk some conception may be formed of its capacity when flying down an incline at sixtyfive miles an hour with a heavy train of carriages at its back  in such circumstances it would go through an ordinary house train and all as a riflebullet would go through a cheese  it was an eightwheeled engine and the drivingwheels were eight feet in diameter  the cylinder was eighteen inches with a piston of two feet stroke and the total weight of engine and tender was fiftythree tons  the cost of this iron horse with its tender was about 3000 pounds  having fairly started john took his stand opposite his circular window in the protecting screen or weatherboard and kept a sharp lookout ahead  will garvie kept an eye chiefly on the rear to note that all was well in that direction  and much cause was there for caution  to rush through space at such a rate even on a straight line and in clear weather was trying enough but when it is remembered that the day was wet and that their course lay through sundry deep cuttings and tunnels and round several curves where it was not possible to foresee obstruction the necessity for caution will be more apparent  all went well however as usual  after clearing the first thirtysix miles john marrot consulted his watch and observed to will that they had done it in thirtyeight and a half minutes  he then put on a spurt and went for some time at a higher rate of speed  observing that something at the head of the engine required looking after will garvie went out along the side of it and while doing this piece of work his hair and jacket were blown straight back by the breeze which the engine had created for itself  he resembled in fact a sailor going out to work on the sails in a stiff breeze  this artificial breeze sweeping round the sides of the screen caused an eddy which sent up a cloud of coaldust but neither john nor his mate appeared to care for this  their eyes were evidently coalproof  presently they approached a canal over which they rushed and for one moment glanced down on the antipodal mode of locomotiona boat going three miles an hour with its steersman half asleep and smoking at the helm  next moment they were passing under a bridge the next over a town and then rushed through a station and it was interesting to note as they did so that the people on the platform shrank back and looked halfterrified although they were in no danger whatever while those in the trainwho might at any moment have been hurled into eternity looked calm and serene evidently untroubled by thoughts of danger so difficult is it for man to realise his true condition in such circumstances  just beyond the station a dog was observed to have strayed on the line and ran barking before the engine  it was overtaken and passed in a few seconds and will looked over the side but saw nothing of it  as no yell was heard it is probable that the poor thing escaped  soon after that two navvies were observed walking coolly and slowly on the line in front of the engine  john frowned and laid his hand on the whistle but before it could sound the reckless men had heard the train looked round with horrified faces sprang like jumpingjacks off the line right and left and were gone  soon after this on approaching the distant signal of one of the stations they observed that the arms were extended indicating that the line was blockedthat is that another train being in advance they must check speed or perhaps stop  this was a species of insult to the flying dutchman whose way ought to have been kept perfectly clear for even a check of speed would inevitably cause the loss of several minutes  with an indignant grumble john marrot cut off steam but immediately the signals were lowered and he was allowed to go on again in a few minutes another signal checked him  theyve let a train on before us growled john sternly and praps we may be checked all the way to londonbut some one shall hear of this an have to account for it  john was wrong to some extent  while he yet spoke the signal to go on was given and a few minutes later the flying dutchman flashed past the obstructing train which had been shunted on to a siding and from its windows hundreds of passengers were gazing at the express which passed them like a meteorperhaps they were congratulating themselves as well they might for but for the block system their danger would have been tremendous almost equal to that of a man endeavouring to run away from a cannonshot  this may be somewhat better understood when we explain that the flying dutchman could not have been stopped in a shorter space than one mile and a half  at length the iron horse came suddenly on an obstruction which filled its driver with deep anxiety and alarm  daily had john driven that train but never before had he met with a similar danger  at a level crossing less than a mile in advance of him he observed a horse and a loaded cart standing right across the line  either the horse was a runaway or the driver had left it for a little and it had strayed whatever the cause of its being there johns alert mind saw at once that a collision was inevitable  he shut off steam and was about to whistle for the guard to apply the brakes while will garvie who also saw the danger was already turning on the brakes of the tender  john reflected that it would be impossible to come to a stand within the space that lay between him and the cart and that a partial concussion would be almost certain to throw his engine off the rails  less than a minute remained to him  let her go mate he shouted quickly  will garvie obeyed at once  john put on full steam the flying dutchman leaped forward with increased velocity  then followed a slight shock and next moment the cart and horse were smashed to atomsall but annihilated  it was a great risk that had been run but of two evils john marrot had chosen the less and came off in triumph with only a slight damage to his buffers  let us now quit the engine for a little and retracing our steps in regard to time visit some of the carriages behind it  when the late passenger recovered her breath and equanimity and found herself fairly on her journey she unfolded her bundle of shawls and disclosed a fat glossy lapdog which seemed to enjoy its return to fresh air and daylight and acknowledged with sundry wags of its tail and blinks of its eyes the complimentary assurance that it was the dearest sweetest pittiest ittle darling that ever was born and that it wouldnt be allowed to pay a nasty fare to a mean railway company that let all kinds of ugly parrots and cats and babies travel free  a timid little lady the only other occupant of the carriage ventured to suggest that the dog travelling free was against the rules of the company  i am quite aware of that said the late passenger somewhat sharply but if people choose to make unjust and oppressive rules i dont mean to submit to them  just think of a parrot a horrid shrieking creature that every one acknowledges to be a nuisance being allowed to travel free or a baby which is enough to drive one distracted when it squalls as it always does in a railway carriage while my sweet little pet that annoys nobody must be paid for forsooth  it does indeed seem unreasonable responded the timid little old lady but dont you think that the company has a perfect right to make whatever rules it pleases and that we are bound to obey them when we make use of their line  no i dont said the late passenger tartly  the timid little lady thought it advisable to change the subject and did so by remarking that the dog was a very pretty creature  upon which the late passenger thawed at once admitted that it was a very pretty creature and asserted in addition that it was a perfect darling  their conversation became miscellaneous and general after this point and not worth reporting therefore we shall get out at the window and pass along the footboards to the carriage occupied by mrs durby and her friends  immediately after the train had started as before described captain lee entered into an animated conversation with the nurse as to the health of the tipps family  edwin who was much interested in them listened and put in a word now and then but neither he nor the captain after the first glance paid any attention to the other occupants of the carnage  meanwhile thomson jenkins and company spent a short time in taking a quiet observation of the state of affairs  the former had placed himself opposite to edwin and eyed him over critically as a wrestler might eye his opponent jenkins had seated himself opposite the captain who had been apportioned to him in the coming conflict and smith who although a stout enough fellow was the smallest of the three kept his eye on the coveted bag and held himself in readiness to act as might be advisable  the scoundrels were not long in taking action  as soon as they were quite clear of the suburbs of clatterby jenkins suddenly hit captain lee a tremendous blow on the head which was meant to fell him at once but the captains head was harder than he had expected it to be he instantly grappled with jenkins  edwins amazement did not prevent his prompt action but at the moment he sprang to the rescue he received a blow from thomson who leaped on him and seized him by the throat with a vicelike gripe  at the same moment smith also sprang upon him  thomson soon found that he had miscalculated young gurwoods strength strong though his grasp was edwins was stronger  almost as quick as thought he threw his left arm round thomsons waist grasped his hair with his right hand and almost broke his back  there is no question that he would have overcome him in a few seconds if smith had not hampered him  as it was he disengaged his right arm for a moment and hitting a familiar and ofttried blow straight out from the shoulder planted his knuckles just above the bridge of smiths nose  he fell as if he had been shot but the momentary relief thus afforded to thomson enabled that scoundrel to get into a better position for continuing the struggle  meanwhile jenkins although bravely and stoutly opposed by the veteran lee quickly rendered his adversary insensible and at once sprang upon edwin and turned the scale in favour of his comrade who at the moment was struggling in the youths grasp with savage though unavailing ferocity  at the same time smith who had only been stunned recovered and seizing edwin by the legs endeavoured to throw him down so that it went hard with our young hero after that despite his activity strength and courage  during this scene which was enacted in a very few minutes poor mrs durby sat drawn up into the remotest corner of the carriage her face transfixed with horror and a terrific yell bursting occasionally from her white lips  but neither the sound of her cries nor the noise of the deadly struggle could overtop the clatter of the express train  those in the next compartment did indeed hear a little of it but they were powerless to render assistance and there was at that time no means of communicating with the guard or driver  poor edwin thought of captain lee who lay bleeding on the floor and of emma and the power of thought was so potential that in his great wrath he almost lifted the three men in the air but they clung to him like leeches and it is certain that they would have finally overcome him had he not in one of his frantic struggles thrust his foot below one of the seats and kicked the still slumbering sam natly on the nose  that overwrought but erring porter immediately awoke to the consciousness of being oppressed with a sense of guilt and of being in a very strange and awkward position  quickly perceiving however by the wild motion of the feet and an occasional scream from mrs durby that something serious was going on he peeped out saw at a glance how matters stood got to his feet in a moment and dealt jenkins such a blow on the back of the head that he dropped like a stone  to deal smith two similar blows with like result was the work of two seconds thus freed edwin rose like a giant crushed thomson down into a seat and twisted his neckcloth until his eyes began to glaze and his lips to turn blue  sam natly was a man of cool selfpossession  seeing that edwin was more than a match for his adversary he left him and proceeded to attend to the captain who showed symptoms of revival but happening to glance again at edwin and observing the condition of thomson sam turned and put his hand on the youths arm  i think sir he said quietly it would be as well to leave enough of him to be hanged  besides it might be raither awkward sir to do jack ketchs dooty without the benefit of judge jury witnesses or clergy  edwin released his hold at once and thomson raised himself in the seat clenching his teeth and fists as he did so  he was one of those savage creatures who when roused appear to go mad and become utterly regardless of consequences  while sam was engaged in e temporising handcuffs for jenkins and smith out of a necktie and a pockethandkerchief thomson sat perfectly still but breathed very hard  he was only resting a little to recover strength for in a moment without a sound or warning of any kind he hit edwin with all his force on the temple  fortunately the youth saw the coming blow in time to partially give way to it and in another moment the struggle was renewed but terminated almost as quickly for edwin gave thomson a blow that stunned him and kept him quiet for the next quarter of an hour  during this period edwin examined captain lees hurts which turned out to be less severe than might have been expected  he also assisted sam to secure thomsons wrists with a handkerchief and then devoted some time to soothing the agitated spirits of poor mrs durby whose luckless shins had not escaped quite scatheless during the melee  oh sir sobbed mrs durby glancing with horror at the dishevelled and bloodstained prisoners i always thought railways was bad things but i never no i never imagined they was as bad as this  but my good woman said edwin unable to restrain a smile railways are not all nor always as bad as this  we very seldom hear of such a villainous deed as has been attempted today thanks to the energy and efficiency of their police establishments  quite true gurward quite true said captain lee glancing sternly at the prisoners and stanching a cut in his forehead with a handkerchief as he spoke our police arrangements are improving daily as scoundrels shall find to their cost  jenkins and smith did not raise their eyes and thomson continued to frown steadily out at the window without moving a muscle  im sure i dont know nothink about your plice an whats more i dont care said mrs durby all that i know is that railways is dreadful things and if i was the queen which im not id have em all put down by acts of parlingment so i would  but never never never as long as im able to manidge my ownah  mrs durby terminated here with one of her own appalling shrieks for it was at this precise moment that john marrot happened as already described to have occasion to knock a cart and horse to atoms  the shock as we have said was very slight nevertheless it was sufficient to overturn the poor nurses nervous system which had already been wrought up to a high pitch of tension  thats somethin gone sir said sam touching his cap to captain lee  what is it edwin inquired the captain as the youth let down the window and looked out  i can see nothing said edwin except that the guard and fireman are both looking back as if they wanted to see something on the line  we are beginning to slow however being not far from the station now  about a mile and threequarters from the station in the suburbs of london where the tickets were to be collected john marrot stopped the pulse of his iron horse for so terrific was his speed that he was able to run the greater part of that distance by means of the momentum already acquired  by degrees the mighty engine began to slow  trees and houses instead of rushing madly past began to run hastily by and then to glide behind at a rate that was more in keeping with the dignity of their nature  from sixty miles an hour the train passed by a rapid transition to ordinary express speed then to ordinary speed then to twenty miles an hour  then thomson felt that his opportunity had come he suddenly wrenched his wrists from their fastening leaped head foremost out of the window fell on the embankment in a heap and rolled to the bottom where he lay extended on his back as if dead  thus much mrs durby saw in one horrified glance and then fainted dead away in which condition she remained to the great anxiety and distress of captain lee until the flying dutchman after doing seventyeight miles in one hour and a half glided as softly up to the platform of the station in the great metropolis as if it were a modest young train which had yet to win its spurs instead of being a tried veteran which had done its best for many years past to annihilate space and time  but after all it resembled all other tried veterans in this respect  generally speaking enginedrivers are littlefar too littlethought of after a journey is over  mankind is not prone to be wise or discriminating in giving credit to whom credit is due  we remember waiters after having eaten a good dinner but who in any sense of the word remembers the cook  so in like manner we think of railway porters and guards at the end of our journeys and talk of their civility mayhap but who thinks or talks of the driver and fireman as they lean on the rails of their iron horse wet and weary perchance smoke and dust and soot begrimed for certainand calmly watch the departure of the multitudes whom they have by the exercise of consummate coolness skill and courage brought through dangers and hairbreadth escapes that they neither knew nor dreamed of  on this particular occasion however the tables were turned for once the gentlemen in the train hurried to the guard to ask what had caused the slight shock which they had felt  joe turner had been called aside for a moment by a clerk so they went direct to john marrot himself who modestly related what had happened in a half apologetic tone for he did not feel quite sure that he had done the best in the circumstances  his admiring audience had no doubt on the point however  youre a brick john exclaimed an enthusiastic commercial traveller  thats true said another  if we had more men like him there would be fewer accidents  lets give him something whispered a third  the suggestion was eagerly acted on  a subscription was made on the spot and in three minutes the sum of about ten pounds was thrust into johns huge dirty hand by the enthusiastic commercial traveller  but john firmly refused to take it  whats to be done with it then demanded the traveller i cant keep it you know and im not going to sit down here and spend halfanhour in returning the money  if you dont take it john i must fling it under the engine or into the furnace  well said the driver after a moments consideration while he closed his hand on the money and thrust it into his breeches pocket ill take it  it will help to replace the cart we smashed if i can find the owner  while this was going on near the engine the robbers were being removed from their carriage to receive the due reward of their deeds  three tall and strongboned men had been on the platform for some time awaiting the arrival of the flying dutchman  swift though john marrots iron horse was a swifter messenger had passed on the line before him  the electric sparkand a fast volatile freeandeasy yet faithful spark it ishad been commissioned to do a little service that day  halfanhour after the train had left clatterby a detective wholly unconnected with our friend sharp had called and sent a message to london to have thomson jenkins and smith apprehended in consequence of their connexion with a case of fraud which had been traced to them  the three tall strongboned men were there in virtue of this telegram  but accustomed though these men were to surprising incidents they had scarcely expected to find that the three culprits had added another to their many crimes and that one of them had leaped out of the train and out of their clutchesin all probability out of the world altogether  two of the strong men went off immediately in search of him or his remains while the other put proper manacles on jenkins and smith and carried them off in a cab  meanwhile joe turner saw that all the other passengers were got carefully out of the train  he was particularly polite in his attentions however to the late passenger  you have forgot maam he said politely to give up your dogticket  dogticket exclaimed the lady blushing what do you mean  i have no dogticket  not for the little poodle dog maam that you carry under your shawl  the lady blushed still deeper as she admitted that she had no ticket for the dog but said that she was quite willing to pay for it  this having been done her curiosity got the better of her shame at having been caught and she asked  how did you know i had a dog with me guard  ah maam replied joe with a smile weve got a remarkably sharpsighted police force on our line besides the telegraph  we find the telegraph very useful i assure you at times  the gentlemen who were removed in handcuffs a few minutes ago were also stopped in their little game by the telegraph maam  the guard turned away to attend to some one else and the late passenger blushing a still deeper scarlet to find that she was classed with criminals hurried away to reflect it is to be hoped on the fact that dishonesty has no variety in characteronly in degree  when the guard left the late passenger he found that his assistance was required to get mrs durby and her belongings out of the railway carriage and into a cab  the poor nurse was in a pitiable state of mind  a railway journey had always been to her a thing of horror  the reader may therefore form some conception of what it was to her to have been thus suddenly called away from quiet suburban life to undertake not only a railway journey but to be shut up with a gang of wouldbe murderers and encounter a sort of accident in addition  by the time she had reached london she had become quite incapable of connected thought  even the precious parcel which at first had been an object of the deepest solicitude was forgotten and although she had hugged it to her breast not two minutes before she suffered it to drop under the seat as she was led from the train to the cab  drive to the clarendon said captain lee as he and gurwood followed the nurse into the cab we will take care of her he added to edwin till she is better able to take care of herself  mrs durby gave vent to a hysterical sob of gratitude  arrived at the clarendon they alighted the captain paid the fare and the cab was dismissed  just at that moment mrs durby became a temporary maniac  she shrieked oh my parcel and rushed towards the door  the captain and waiter restrained her  its in the cab she yelled with a fervour there was no resisting  edwin comprehending the case dashed down the steps and followed the cab but he might as well have followed the proverbial needle in the haystack  hundreds of cabs carts busses and waggons were passing the clarendon  he assaulted and stopped four wrong cabs endured a deal of chaff and finally returned to the hotel discomfited  thus suddenly was mrs durby bereft of her treasure and thrown into abject despair  while in this condition she partially unbosomed herself to captain lee and contrary to strict orders revealed all she knew about the embarrassments of mrs tipps carefully concealing however the nature of the contents of her lost parcel and the real object of her journey to london  one more paragraph in regard to this eventful trip of the flying dutchman ere we have done with the subject  having finished his journey john marrot took his iron steed to the stable  usually his days work terminated at clatterby but owing to the horse being in need of extra rest he had to stop in london that night  and no wonder that the lightning was sometimes fatigued for even an ordinary express engine on the grand national trunk railway was wont to run over 270 miles of ground in a day at the rate of about fortyfive miles an hour and with a dead weight of 120 tons more or less at her tail  this she did regularly with two sheddays or days of rest in the week for cleansing and slight repairs  such an engine was considered to do good service if it ran 250 days in the year but the engine of the flying dutchman was more highly favoured than other enginesprobably on the ground of the principle taught by the proverb it is the pace that kills  its regular run was 1544 miles in the day and assuredly it stood in need of repose and refreshment quite as much as ordinary horses do  its joints had become relaxed with severe labour its bolts had been loosened its rubbing surfaces despite the oil poured so liberally on them by will garvie had become heated  some of them unequally expanded strained and twisted its gratebars and firebox had become choked with clinkers and its tubes charged with coke  john therefore ran it into the huge shed or stable prepared for the reception of twentyfour iron horses and handed it over to a set of cleaners or grooms  these immediately set to work they cleaned out its firebox scraped its gratebars tightened all its bolts and rivets greased the moving parts and thoroughly cleansed it outside and in thus washed cooled down and purified it was left to repose for five or six hours preparatory to a renewal of its giant energies on the following day  although we have somewhat exalted our pet locomotive of the flying dutchman justice requires us to state that goods engines are more gigantic and powerful though they are not required to run so fast these engines are the heavy drayhorses of the line express engines being the racers  the latter can carry a light load of some seventy or ninety tons on a good roadway at the rate of fifty miles an hour or upwards  goods engines of the most powerful class on the other hand run at a much slower pace but they drag with ease a load of from 300 to 350 tons with which they can ascend steep gradients  but whether light or heavy strong or weak all of them are subject to the same laws  though powerfully they are delicately framed and like man himself appear to be incapable of perfect action without obtaining at the least one day of rest in the week    chapter fifteen  treats of mrs durbys lost parcel in particular and of lostluggage in general  we need scarcely say that edwin gurwood took a good deal of trouble to find poor mrs durbys lost parcel  had he known what its contents were he might perhaps have done more  as she positively asserted that she had carried it into the cab with her and had not left it in the train immediate application was not made at the station for it but edwin drove her in a cab to scotland yard and there introduced her to the police officials whose duty it is to take charge of articles left in cabs  here she was asked to describe the appearance of her parcel which she did by saying that it was a roundish one in brown paper fastened with a piece of string and having the name of durby written on it in pencil without any address  not feeling quite sure however of the fidelity of the nurses memory edwin then went to the station and made inquiries there but on application to the lostluggage office no such parcel had been deposited there  the reader may perhaps be surprised at this as it is wellknown that every train is searched by the porters on its arrival at a terminus and all forgotten articles are conveyed at once to the lostluggage office  in the ordinary course of things mrs durbys parcel would have been found and restored to her on application but it happened that a careless porter searched the flying dutchman that day and had failed to observe the parcel which lay in a dark corner under the seat  when the carriage therefore was shunted the parcel was left to repose in it all night as well as all next day which happened to be sunday  the parcel had a longish excursion on its own account after that  the carriage in which it lay happened to be a through one and belonged to another company to whose line it was accordingly forwarded on the following monday  it reached a remote station in the west of england that night and there the parcel was discovered  it lay all night there and next day was forwarded to the lostluggage office of that line here it was examined the various pieces of paper were unrolled one by one and the doubledup slipper was discovered this was examined and the little parcel found the name of durby having been noted and commented on the covering of notepaper was removed and the matchbox revealed from the inside of which was produced the pillbox which when opened disclosed to the astonished gaze of the officials an antique gold ring set with diamonds  as the name mrs durby written in pencil did not furnish a clue to the owner the ring was given into the charge of the custodier of the lostluggage office and a description of it with a note of all particulars regarding it was forwarded to the clearinghouse in london  the lostluggage office we may remark in passing was a wonderful placea place in which a moralist might find much material for mental mastication  here on an extensive series of shelves were deposited in large quantities the evidences of mans defective memory the sad proofs of human fallibility  there were caps and comforters and travellingbags in great abundance  there were shawls and rugs and umbrellas and parasols and sticks and hatboxes in such numbers as to suggest the idea that hundreds of travellers smitten with irresistible feelings of gratitude had left these articles as a trifling testimony of respect to the railway company  there were carpetbags here not only in large numbers but in great variety of form and size smellingbottles pockethandkerchiefs flasks pocketbooks guncases portmanteaux books cigar cases etcetera enough to have stocked a gigantic curiosity shop and there were several articles which one could not account for having been forgotten on any other supposition than that the owners were travelling maniacs  one gentleman had left behind him a pair of leathern huntingbreeches a soldier had forgotten his knapsack a cripple his crutches a scotchman his bagpipes but the most amazing case of all was a church door  we do not jest reader  it is a fact that such an article was forgotten or left or lost on a railway and more amazing still it was never claimed but after having been advertised and having lain in the lost goods office the appointed time it was sold by auction with other things  many of the articles were powerfully suggestive of definite ideas  one could not look upon those delicate kid gloves without thinking of the young bride whose agitated soul was incapable of extending a thought to such trifles  that mrs gamplike umbrella raised to mental vision as if by magic the despair of the stout elderly female who arriving unexpectedly and all unprepared at her journeys end sought to collect her scattered thoughts and belongings and launch herself out on the platform in the firm belief that a minutes delay would insure her being carried to unknown regions far beyond her destination and it was impossible to look at that fur travellingcap with earpieces cocked knowingly on a sable muff without thinking of the bland baldheaded old gentleman who had worn it during a night journey and had pulled it in all ways about his head and over his eyes and had crushed it into the cushions of his carriage in a vain endeavour to sleep and had let it fall off and temporarily lost it and trod upon it and unintentionally sat upon it and had finally in the great hurry of waking suddenly on arrival and in the intense joy of meeting with his blooming girls flung it off seized his hat and bag and rug left the carriage in a whirlwind of greeting forgot it altogether and so lost it for ever  nay not lost we hear some one saying he would surely call at the lostluggage office on discovering his loss and regain his property  probably he might but certainly he would only act like many hundreds of travellers if he were to leave his property there and never call for it at all  true much that finds its way to the lostluggage office is reclaimed and restored but it is a fact that the quantity never reclaimed is so large on almost any railway that it forms sufficient to warrant an annual sale by auction which realises some hundreds of pounds  one years sale of lostluggage on the grand national trunk railway amounted to 500 pounds and this was not more than an average years sale  every possible effort is of course made to restore lostluggage before such a sale takes place  in the first place everything bearing a name and address is returned at once to the owner but of course there are multitudes of small articles which have neither name nor address  such of these as are locked or tied up are suffered to remain for a short time in an office where they may be readily reclaimed but if not claimed soon they are opened and if addresses are found inside are sent to their owners  in the event of no addresses being found they are retained for a year then advertised for sale by public auction and the proceeds go to reduce that large sumperhaps 16000 poundss or more which the company has to pay annually as compensation for lost and damaged goods  on one railway where the lostluggage was allowed to lie a considerable time before being examined a singular case occurred  a hatbox was opened and found to contain bank of england notes to the amount of 65 pounds with two letters which led to its being restored to its owner after having lain for more than a year  the owner had been so positive that he had left the hatbox at a hotel that he had made no inquiry for it at the railway office  a salecatalogue of left and unclaimed property on one of our chief railways which now lies before us presents some curious lots  here are some of them 70 walkingsticks 30 silk umbrellas and there are eleven similar lots besides innumerable parasols50 muffs and boasa crate containing 140 billycocks and hats24 lookingglasses160 packets of cloth buttons15 fryingpans and 18 ploughshares3 butter machines2 gasmeters 2 shovels and a pair of spectaclesa box of sanitary powder and a 15horse power horizontal steamengine  how some of these things especially the last could come to be lost at all is a mystery which we have been quite unable to fathom  of these lots the catalogue contains 404 and the sale was to occupy two days  after having failed to obtain any information as to the missing brown paper parcel mrs durby felt so overwhelmed with distress and shame that she took the whole matter into serious consideration and resolving to forego her visit to her brother returned straight to clatterby where in a burst of tears she related her misadventures to netta  it need scarcely be said that netta did not blame her old and faithful nurse  her disposition was of that mild sympathetic nature which induces onewhen an accident occurs such as the breaking of a valuable piece of chinato hasten to excuse rather than to abuse the unhappy breaker who in nine cases out of ten is far more severely punished by his or her own conscience than the sin deserves  instead therefore of blaming the nurse netta soothed her said that it did not matter much that the ring was valuable to her only as a gift from her father that no doubt some other means of paying their debts would soon be devised that it would have been an absolute miracle if nurse had retained her selfpossession in the terrible circumstances in which she had been placed and in fact tried so earnestly and touchingly to comfort her that she unintentionally heaped coals of intensest fire on the poor womans head and caused mrs durby not only to blame herself more than ever but to throw her arms round nettas neck and all but fall down on her knees and worship her  thereafter the subject was dismissed and in a short time almost forgotten    chapter sixteen  describes engineering difficulties a perplexing case and a harmonious meeting  captain lees object in visiting london was twofold  he went there primarily to attend the halfyearly general meeting of the grand national trunk railway and secondarily to accompany his friend edwin gurwood to the railway clearinghouse in which establishment he had been fortunate enough to secure for him a situation  the various circumstances which contributed to the bringing about of an intimacy between captain lee and young gurwood are partly known to the reader  it was natural that the captain should feel some sort of regard for one who had twice shown himself so ready to spring to his assistance in the hour of danger but that which weighed still more strongly with the old sailorwho had been a strict disciplinarian and loved a zealous manwas the energy with which edwin threw himself into the work of the department of the railway in which he had first been placed  perhaps if the captain had known the motives and the hopes which actuated the youth he might have regarded him with very different feelings  we know notand it matters little now  as a clerk in the engineers office edwin had in a few weeks evinced so much talent and aptitude for the work as to fill his patrons heart with delight  he possessed that valuable quality which induces a man in scripture languageto look not only on his own things but on the things of others  he was not satisfied with doing his own work thoroughly but became so inquisitive as to the work of his companions in the office that he acquired in a short time as much knowledge as some of these companions had acquired in several years  the engineers department of a railway is one which involves some of the most important operations connected with the line  but indeed the same may be said of all the departmentspassenger goods locomotive and police each of which is independent yet connected  they are separate wheels as it were which work harmoniously together in one grand system and the gentlemen at the head of these departments must be men of experience of acknowledged talent and power each supreme in his own department but all subject to the general manager  the engineerinchief who was edwin gurwoods superior had charge of the entire railway which was something over one thousand miles in extent  this vast line was divided into four divisionsnamely the northern southern western and eastern each division being under the superintendence of a resident engineer who was of course subject to the engineerinchief  each division was about 250 miles long and was subdivided into districts varying from thirty to seventy miles  these were under the charge of inspectors whose duty it was to travel constantly over their lengthsalmost dailypartly on foot and partly by train to see that the line was kept in perfect working order  the travelling inspectors had under them a large body of surfacemen or platelayers men whose duty it was to perform the actual work of keeping the line in order  they worked in squads of four or fiveeach squad having a foreman or gaffer who was held responsible for the particular small portion of the line that he and his squad had to attend to  the average number of surfacemen was about two to the mileso that the entire staff of these men on the line numbered over two thousand  their business was to go over the entire line twice a day drive tight the wooden keys which held the rails in their chairs lift and relay broken or wornout rails and chairs raise or depress sleepers wherever these required alteration so as to make the line level and generally to keep in thorough repair the permanent way again each of the four divisions had an inspector of signals and an inspector of buildings the former being responsible for the perfect working order of all signals and the latter who had a few masons joiners slaters blacksmiths and others under him having charge of all the stations sheds and other buildings on the line  every month each division engineer sent in to the head office a statement of material used and of work done also a requisition for material required for future use  from all this it can easily be understood that edwin had a fair opportunity of finding scope for his talents and he had indeed already begun to attract notice as an able energetic fellow when captain lee as we have said procured for him an appointment in the clearinghouse on the occasion of the change being made he invited his young friend to spend a few days at his residence in clatterby and thereafter as we have seen they travelled together to london  it need scarcely be said that edwin did not neglect this golden opportunity to try to win the heart of emma  whether he had succeeded or not he could not tell but he unquestionably received a strong additional impulse in his good resolvesto achieve for himself a position and a wife  gurwood said captain lee after mrs durby had taken her departure i want you to aid me in a little difficulty i have about our mutual friend mrs tipps  she is ridiculously determined not to accept of assistance from me and i find from that excellent nurse that they are actually up to the lips in povertyin fact on the point of going down i think from what she said or rather from what she didnt say but hinted that her errand to london had something to do with their poverty but i cant make it out  now i have made up my mind to help them whether they will or no and the question i wish to lay before you ishow is the thing to be done  come you have had some experience of engineering and ought to be able to cope with difficulties  true replied edwin with a smile but to bend a womans will surpasses any mans powers of engineering  come sir said the captain that is a most ungallant speech from one so young  you deserve to die an old bachelor  however i ask you not to exercise your skill in bending a womans will but in bridging over this difficultythis chat moss to speak professionally  could you not procure for my friend joseph tipps a more lucrative appointment said edwin eagerly as the idea flashed upon him  the captain shook his head  wont do sir i have thought of that but in the first place i have not such an appointment to give him at present in the second place if i had he could not draw his salary in advance and money is wanted immediately and in the third place he would not if he had it be able to spare enough out of any ordinary clerks salary because the debts due by mrs tipps amount to fifty poundsso mrs durby said  it is indeed perplexing said edwin  would it not be a good plan to send them a cheque anonymously  again the captain shook his head  wouldnt do  the old lady would guess who sent it at once  come i will leave it to you to devise a plan  never could form a plan all my life and have no time just now as im going off to the meeting in ten minutes  i constitute you my agent in this matter gurwood  you know all the circumstances of the case and also about my bet of five hundred pounds with the late captain tipps  your fee if you succeed shall be my unending gratitude  there i give you carteblanche to do as you pleaseonly see that you dont fail  saying this the captain put on his hat and went out leaving edwin much amused and not a little perplexed  he was not the man however to let difficulties stand in his way unassailed  he gave the subject halfanhours consideration after which he formed a plan and immediately went out to put it into execution  meanwhile captain lee went to the head offices of the grand national trunk railway and entered the large room where the directors and shareholders of the company were already assembled in considerable numbers to hold a halfyearly general meeting  it was quite a treat to see the cordial way in which the captain was received by such of his brother directors as sat near him and when he had wiped his bald head and put on his spectacles and calmly looked round the hall his bland visage appeared to act the part of a reflector for wherever his eyes were turned there sunshine appeared to glow  in fact several of the highly sympathetic people presentof whom there are always a few in every mixed meetingunconsciously smiled and nodded as his eye passed over their locality even although they were personal strangers to him  very various are the feelings which actuate the directors and shareholders of different railways at these halfyearly gatherings doubtless some directors go to the place of meeting with the feelings of men who go to execution and the shareholders go with the feelings of executioners if not worse while other directors and shareholders unquestionably go to hold something like a feast of reason and a flow of soul  the halfyearly meeting we write of was imbued with the latter spirit wisdom and conscientious care had steered the ship and swayed the councils of the grand national trunk railway so that things were in what the captain called a highly flourishing condition  one consequence was that the directors wore no defensive armour and the shareholders came to the ground without offensive weapons  sir cummit strong having taken the chair the secretary read the advertisement convening the meeting  the chairman who was a tall broadbrowed and largemouthed man just such an one as might be expected to become a railway king then rose and after making a few preliminary observations in reference to the report which was assumed to have been read moved that the said report and statement of accounts be received and adopted  hear hear exclaimed a big vulgar man with an oily fat face and a strong voice who was a confirmed toady  i am quite sure the chairman continued that i have the sympathy of all in this meeting when i say that the halfyear which has just come to a close has been one of almost unmixed success  hear hear from the toady  and continued the chairman with pointed emphasis and a glance at the toady which was meant to indicate that he had put in his oar too soon but which the toady construed into a look of gratitudeand of very great satisfaction to those whom you have appointed to the conducting of your affairs  hear hear  captain lee who sat immediately behind the toady and felt his fingers and toes tingling lost a good deal of what followed in consequence of falling into a speculative reverie as to what might be the legal consequences if he were to put his own hat on the toadys head and crush it down over his eyes and mouth  gentlemen continued the chairman there are three points on which we have reason to congratulate ourselves today namely the safety the efficiency and the economy with which our railway has been worked  as regards the first i find that ten millions of journeys have been performed on our line during the halfyear with hardly a detention with very few late trains at high speeds and with only one accident which was a comparatively slight one and was unattended with loss of life or serious damage to any one  hear hear from the toady  at this point a wag in the distance got up and suggested in a very weak voice that if the toady would say hear hear less frequently perhaps they would hear much bettera suggestion which was received with a burst of laughter and a round of applause  it effectually quelled the toady and rendered him innocuous for a considerable time  now resumed the chairman some people appear to think that it is an easy thing to work a railway in safety but i can assure you that such is not the case  intelligence care foresight and the strictest discipline are necessary to secure this result and remember we have not the advantage of anything so powerful as military discipline to help us  we have nothing to appeal to save the hopes and fears of our staff and we feel it to be our great difficulty as it is our principal duty to be most careful in the selection of the thousands of men who in their various positions and vocations have to be employed in the conduct of your enterprise  i know well continued sir cummit strong how men shudder when statistics are mentioned in their ears  nevertheless i shall venture to give you a few statistics that will i am quite sure prove interestingall the more so that the figures which i quote apply to several other railwaysand therefore will serve to give those of you who may chance to be unlearned on railway matters some idea of the vast influence which railways have on our land  we run on this railway i use round numbers about 700 trains a day in addition to which we have spare engines and empty trains which perhaps ought to be added to the number given  now just consider for a moment the operations which have to be performed daily in the ordinary working and running of your passenger traffic  these 700 trains stop about 5000 times in the twentyfour hours and of course they start the same number of times  the empty trains and engines have also to stop and start  we have on the line upwards of 1000 signals including the telegraphic signals and auxiliaries  those signals have to be raised and lowered 10000 times in the twentyfour hours  there are on our line 1700 pairs of points which have to be opened and shut to be cleaned oiled and attended to above 5000 times in the day  in addition to all this there are the operations of shunting carriageexamining greasing and other things in connexion with trains which involve operations amounting to nearly 6000 in number  so that apart from repairs to the line and to vehiclesthere are above 30000 individual operations which have to be performed every twentyfour hours in the conduct of this enormous passenger traffic  all this information i have obtained from our able and excellent passengersuperintendent than whom there is not a more important officer in the companys service unless indeed here the chairman turned with a smile and a slight bow to the gentlemen who sat on his right hand i may except the general manager and secretary  well now gentlemen i put it to you is it surprising that the 6000 men who have to perform these 30000 operations in the dayamounting to the vast total of ten millions of operations in the yearis it surprising i say that these 6000 men should now and then fall into some error of judgment or make some mistake or even be guilty of some negligence  is it not on the contrary most surprising that accidents are not far more numerous and does it not seem almost miraculous that where duties are so severe the demands made by the public so great speed punctuality numberless trains by day and nightthere should be only one accident to report this halfyear while last halfyear there were no accidents at all  and does it not seem hard that the public should insist that we shall be absolutely infallible and when the slightest mistake occurs should haul us into court and punish us with demands for compensation for accidents which no human ingenuity or foresight could prevent  before leaving this subject allow me to direct your attention to the fogs which occurred this halfyear  there were thirty days in which during a part if not the whole of the twentyfour hours we had out our fogsignal men that is to say an additional staff of 300 men each with his flag and detonating signals placed within sight or within sound of one another to assist the ordinary signalmen in the safe conduct of the traffic  during these fogs the omnibuses had to be withdrawn from the roads the steamers had to be moored on the river and the traffic on the streets was almost at a standstill nevertheless we carried through the fog in and out of london above one million six hundred thousand passengers without accident  the hear hear which burst from the audience at this point might have satisfied even the toady himself  and yet continued the chairman with emphasis if a single mishap had occurred owing to the mistake of any of our halfblinded men we should probably have been let in for compensation to the extent perhaps of 20000 pounds  is this fair  if it be so then one may be tempted to ask why does not the same sauce suit shipowners many of whom are notorious for sending to sea unseaworthy craft and who consign above one thousand human beings to an untimely grave every year without being punished in any way or being asked for a farthing of compensation  i have already said so much on this point gentlemen that i shall make but a few remarks on the other two subjects  well then as to efficiency  our carrying ten millions of passengers in safety and comfort is one proof of thatand i may remark in passing that our receipts for the conveyance of these ten millions amounts to nearly half a million of money  another proof of our efficiency lies in the fact that all the compensation we have had to pay for loss or detention of luggage has been only 100 pounds  then as to goods  for merchandise carried we have received about 150000 pounds and the total compensation for the halfyear amounts to only about 660 pounds  surely i may say with truth that such facts speak to the regularity and efficiency of your service  if the public only knew the anxiety and care with which its interests are looked after both by night and by day by our excellent passenger and goodsmanagers they would perhaps present each of these gentlemen with a testimonial piece of plate and would for evermore lay aside that wicked and ungrateful idea that railway companies are fair game to be plundered by every one who receives or fancies he has received the slightest possible amount of damage to limb or property  railway companies are not perfect any more than other companies  there are certain faults it may be and weak points which all of us deplore and which are being remedied as fast as experience and the progress of human knowledge will admit but i hold gentlemen that the management of railway companies is above the average management of many other companies  we have much more workmore dangerous workto do than other companies and we do it with much less proportional loss to life limb and property  hear hear burst from the toady in spite of his recent rebuke but as it was drowned in a round of hearty applause no one was the wiser or the worse of his note of approval  when i think continued the chairman of the condition this country was in before the days of railwayswhich probably most of those present rememberthe ingratitude of the public seems to me utterly unaccountable  i can only understand it on the supposition that they have somehow obtained false notions as to the great value of railways and the great blessing they are to the community  why our goodsmanager informs me that there is a certain noble lord whom of course i may not name in public who has a farm at a considerable distance out of town  he has a fancy that the milk and cream produced on his own farm is better than metropolitan milk and creamlaughter  he therefore resolves to have fresh milk and cream sent in from his farm every morning and asks us to carry it for him we agree but he further insists that the milk and cream shall be delivered at his residence punctually at nine am  to this we also agree because the thing can be done yet it is sharp practice for it is only by the train arriving at its time punctually to a minute and by our horse and van being in readiness to start the instant it is loaded that the thing can be accomplished  now gentlemen it is owing to the extreme care and vigorous superintendence of our goodsi had almost said our goodmanager that that noble lord has never missed his milk or cream one morning during the last six months  and the same punctuality attends the milkdelivery of brown jones and robinson for railways as a rule are no respecters of persons  should not this i ask infuse a little of the milk of human kindness into the public heart in reference to railways  then consider other advantages  in days not long gone by a few coaches carried a few hundreds of the more daring among our population over the land at a high cost and at the truly awful rate of ten miles an hour  in some cases the breakneck speed of twelve was attained  most people preferred to remain at home rather than encounter the fatigues risks and expense of travelling  what are the facts now  above three hundred millions of separate journeys are undertaken by rail in the united kingdom in one year  our sportsmen can breakfast in london on the 11th of august sup the same night in scotland and be out on the moors on the morning of the 12th  on any afternoon any lady in england may be charmed with sir walter scotts lady of the lake and if so minded she may be a lady on the veritable lake itself before next evening  our navvies now travel for next to nothing in luxurious ease at thirty miles an hour and our very beggars scorn to walk when they can travel at one penny a mile  but all this is nothing compared with our enormous increase of goods traffic throughout the kingdom  i have not time nor is this the place to enlarge on such a subject but a pretty good commentary on it exists in the simple fact that on your line alone which is not as you know the largest of the railways of this land the receipts for goods minerals and livestock carried amounted to 500000 pounds in the last halfyear as you will see from the report  there is one point to which i would now direct your attentionnamely the great facilities which we give to residential and seasonticket holders  i think it a wise and just course to afford the public such facilities because it tends to produce a permanent source of traffic by tempting men who would otherwise be content to live within walking or bus distance of their offices to go down into the country and build villas there and if you extend that sort of arrangement largely you cause villages at last to grow into towns and towns to spread out with population and with manufactures  i regard our course of action in regard to seasontickets therefore as a sowing of the seed of permanent and enduring income  the receipts from this source alone i am happy to say amounts to 84000 pounds  captain lees spirit had at the bare mention of seasontickets gone careering down the line to clatterby in the beautiful suburbs of which he had the most charming little villa imaginable but he was abruptly recalled by a hear hear from the toady who was gradually becoming himself again and a round of applause from the audience in which having an amiable tendency to follow suit he joined  after this the chairman expatiated at some length on the economical working of the line and on various other subjects of great importance to the shareholders but of little interest to the general reader we will therefore pass them all by and terminate our report of this meeting with the chairmans concluding remark which was that out of the free revenue after deduction of the dividends payable on guaranteed and preference stocks and other fixed charges the directors recommended the payment of a dividend on the ordinary stock of six and a half per cent  it need scarcely be said that this latter statement was received with hearty applause and with an irrepressible hear hear from the toady which was not only tolerated by the meeting but echoed by the wag in the distance who though his words that day had been few had done the shareholders good service nevertheless inasmuch as he had quelled to some extent the propensities of a selfsufficient bore  lest the reader should regard us as a statistical bore we shall bring this chapter to a close    chapter seventeen  gertie is mysteriously cared forsam natly dines under difficulties in connexion with the block system  one day not long after the halfyearly meeting described in the last chapter mrs marrotbeing at the time engaged with the babyreceived a visit from an elderly gentleman who introduced himself as a lawyer and said that he had been sent by a client to make a proposal to her  of course he said with a bland smile i do not refer to a matrimonial proposal  mrs marrot felt and looked surprised but waited for more in silence  to come to the point at once continued the elderly gentleman my client who is rather eccentric has taken a great fancy it seems to your little daughter gertrudegertie he calls herand is desirous of giving her a good education if you have no objection  mrs marrot being under the impression that this would involve gerties being taken away from her and being put to a boardingschool at once looked her objections so plainly that her visitor hastened to explain that his client did not wish gertie to quit her parents house but merely to go for a few hours each day to the residence of a teacher in the neighbourhooda governesswhom he should provide  this altered the case so much that mrs marrot expressed herself quite ready to allow gertie to undergo that amount of education and hoped it would do her good though for her part she did not believe in education herself seeing that she had got on in life perfectly well without it  she also expressed some curiosity to know who was so good as to take such an interest in her child  that my good woman i cannot tell for two reasons first because my client has enjoined me to give no information whatever about him and secondly because i do not myself know his name his business with me having been transacted through a young friend of mine who is also a friend of his  all i can say is that his intentions towards your child are purely philanthropic and the teacher whom he shall select will not be appointed unless you approve  that teacher i may tell you is miss tipps  what  miss netta teach my gertie exclaimed mrs marrot in great surprisenever  my good woman said the lawyer with a perplexed look what is your objection to miss tipps  objection  ive no objection to miss netta but she will have some objection to me and gertie  i thought said the lawyer that miss tipps had already taught your child to some extent gratuitously  so she has god bless her but that was in the sundayschool where she teaches a number of poor peoples children for the sake of our dear lordbut that is a very different thing from giving ornary schoolin to my gertie  that may be rejoined the lawyer but you are aware that miss tipps already teaches in order to increase her mothers small income and she will probably be glad to get another pupil  we mean to pay her well for the service and i suppose that if she has no objection you will have none  cernly not replied mrs marrot with much emphasis  whenever mrs marrot said anything with unusual emphasis baby marrot entertained the unalterable conviction that he was being scolded no sooner therefore did he observe the wellknown look and hear the familiar tones than he opened wide his mouth and howled with injured feeling  at the same moment a train rushed past like an average earthquake and in the midst of this the man of law rose and saying that he would communicate with mrs marrot soon took his leave  next evening mrs tipps was seated at tea with netta planning with anxious care how to make the two ends meet but apparently without much success  it is dreadful netta said mrs tipps i was never before brought to this condition  it is very dreadful responded netta but that renders it all the more imperative that we should take some decided step towards the payment of our debts  yes the liquidation of our debts said mrs tipps nodding slowly that was the term your dear father was wont to use  you know mamma at the worst we can sell our furnitureor part of itand pay them off and then with a system of rigid economy  a postmans knock cut short the sentence and in a few seconds mrs durbycareworn and subduedpresented a letter to her mistress and retired  mymy dear exclaimed mrs tipps ththis is positively miraculous here is a cheque for fifty pounds andbut read for yourself  netta seized the letter and read it aloud  it ran thus  clarendon hotel london  dear madamthere is a little girl living in your neighbourhood in whose father i have a deep interest  i am particularly anxious to give this child gertrude marrot by name a good plain education understanding that your daughter has had considerable experience in teaching the young and is or has been engaged in tuition i venture to propose that she should undertake the training of this child who will attend at your daughters residence for that purpose at any hours you may deem most suitable  in the belief that your daughter will have no objection to accept of this trust i enclose a cheque for 50 pounds the first years salaryin advance  i am dear madam your very obedient servant  samuel tough  although the above can scarcely be considered a brilliant achievement of edwin gurwood it nevertheless accomplished its purpose for the letter was in all respects so very unlike captain lee that neither mrs tipps nor her daughter suspected him for an instant  on the contrary they took it in good faith  netta wrote a reply by return of post agreeing to the proposal and on the day following began her pleasant task to the inexpressible delight of gertie who would joyfully on any terms whatever have been nettas slavenot to mention pupil  a considerable time after this happy arrangement had been made mrs durby in a moment of confidential weakness related to little gertie the circumstances attending the loss of the diamond ring  gertie on returning home communicated the matter to loo and gave it as her opinion that it was a pity such a valuable ring had been lost  couldnt father find out about it somehow she asked with a hopeful lookhopeful because she believed her father capable of doing anything he chose to set his mind to  perhaps he could but he wont be home tonight replied loo thoughtfully  i think sam natly could tell us how to find it  suppose i go and ask him said gertie  loo laughed and said she thought sam couldnt help them much  the child was however a resolute little thing and having taken up the idea determined to go and see sam forthwith as he was on duty not far from john marrots cottage  sam had recently been advanced from the position of a porter to the responsible office of a signalman  the great sin he had committed in going to sleep in a firstclass carriage when unable to keep his eyes open had been forgiven partly because it was his first offence partly because of the good and opportune service he had rendered on the day of the attempted robbery and partly on account of his being one of the steadiest and most intelligent men on the line  sams wife under the care of mrs tipps and mrs durby had made a marvellous recovery and sams gratitude knew no bounds  mrs tipps happened to refer to him one day when conversing with captain lee and the latter was much pleased to discover that the man in whom mrs tipps felt so much interest was the same man who had come to his help in the hour of his extremity  he therefore made inquiry about him of the stationmaster at clatterby that gentleman said that sam was a firstrate man a stout hardworking modest fellow besides being remarkably intelligent and clearheaded and cool especially in the midst of danger as had been exemplified more than once in cases of accident at the station in addition to which sam was a confirmed abstainer from strong drink  all these facts were remembered and when the block system of signalling was introduced on that part of the line sam was made a signalman  the scene of his new labours was an elevated box at the side of the line not far from gerties home  as this box was rather curious we shall describe it  it was a huge square sentrybox with three of its sides composed of windows these commanded a view of the line in all directions  on the fourth side of the box hung a timepiece and a framed copy of signal regulations  there was a diminutive stove in one corner and a chest in another  in front of the box facing the clock were two telegraphic instruments and a row of eight or ten long iron levers which very much resembled a row of muskets in a rack  these levers were formidable instruments in aspect and in fact for they not only cost sam a pretty strong effort to move them but they moved points and signals on the correct and prompt movements of which depended the safety of the line and the lives of human beings  just before little gertie reached the station sam happened to be engaged in attempting to take his dinner  we use the word attempting advisedly because our signalman had not the ghost of a chance to sit down as ordinary mortals do and take his dinner with any degree of certainty  he took it as it were disjointedly in the midst of alarms that the reader may understand why we must observe that the block system of signalling which had recently been introduced on part of the line necessitated constant attention and a series of acts which gave the signalman no rest during certain periods of his watch for more than two minutes at a time if so long  the block system is the method of protecting trains by blocking the line that is forbidding the advance of trains until the line is clear thus securing an interval of space between trains instead of the older and more common method of an interval of time  the chief objection to the latter system is this that one accident is apt to cause another  suppose a train despatched from a station an interval of say quarter of an hour allowed and then another sent off  if the first train should break down there is some chance of the second train overtaking and running into it  with the block system this is impossible  for instance a train starts from any station say a and has to run past stations b and c  the instant it starts the signalman at a rings a telegraph bell to attract bs attention at the same time he indicates on another telegraphic instrument train on line locks his instruments in that position and puts up the stop signal or blocks the line  b replies acknowledging the signal and telegraphs to c to be ready  the moment the train passes bs station he telegraphs to c train on line and blocks that part of the line with the semaphore stop as a had done he also telegraphs back to a line clear whereupon a lets a second train on if one is ready  very soon c sends line clear to b whereupon b is prepared to let on that second train when it comes up and so on ad infinitum  the signals right and left are invariably repeated so that there is no chance of mistake though the failure of the telegraph instruments because if any of these should fail the want of a reply would at once induce a telegram through the speaking instrument with which each station is furnished and which is similar to the telegraph instruments used at most railway stations and the line would remain blocked until a satisfactory answer set it free  the working of the semaphore signals which are familiar to most people as tall posts with projecting moveable arms is accomplished by the mechanical action of the levers before mentioned  there are two distant signals and one home signal to be worked by each man besides these there are levers for working the various points around the station which lead to sidings and when these levers are in action ie placed for the shunting of a goods train they selflock the levers that block the line so that while this operation of shunting which just means shoving a train to one side out of the way is going on the signalman could not make the mistake of letting a train pass the distant signalthe thing is rendered impossible  from this it will be seen that the signalman has entire control of the line and if we consider that shunting of waggons carriages and trains is a pretty constant and lively operation at some stations we can easily conceive that the office of signalman can only be filled by a very able and trustworthy man  as we have said just before gerties arrival sam natly chanced to be attempting to dine  the telegraph needles pointed to line clear on both sides of him  dinner consisted of a sort of irish stew cooked in a little square iron pan that fitted into the small stove  being a placid goodhumoured man not easily thrown off his balance either mentally or physically sam smiled slightly to himself as he put the first bit of meat into his mouth  he thought of his wife wished that she was there to assist in the eating of it and shut his lips on the savoury morsel  a piece of potato was arrested by the sharp telegraph bellone beatof warning  the potato followed the meat as he was in the act of rising  sam touched his telegraphic bell in reply to his signalfriend on the right and train on line was marked by a telegraphic needle pointing to these words  as the train was yet a great way off at least as to distance he sat down again and disposed of bit number two  number three followed and he had made some approach to engulfing number four when a shrill whistle struck his ear  up he sprang glanced at the timepiece wiped his mouth and went to the levers  he touched his bella single note of warning to his signalfriend on the left and received a reply one beat meaning ready  the train appeared came up like a rocket and went past like a thunderbolt  when sam saw its red taillight and thus knew that all the train was therethat none of the tail carriages or trucks had broken loose and been left behindhe gave a mighty pull to one of the levers which turned up the arms of his distant signal and thus blocked the line to all other trains  the needle was now pegged down or fixed at train on line so that there could be no mistake about it and no trusting to memory  having accomplished this he went to a large book which lay open on a desk in a corner glanced at the timepiece recorded the passage of the traina passenger one and once more sat down to dinner  the distance between his station and the next to the left was somewhat greater than that on the right so that at least three mouthfuls in succession of the irish stew were disposed of before the wicked little bell summoned him again  he rose as before with alacrity rung his bell in reply and unstopped his needle  the friend on his left at once pointed it to line clear whereupon sam again went to his levers and lowered the obstructing arms on his right  having thus a clear line on right and left he sat down for the third time to dinner with a clear head and a clear conscience  but he was interrupted sooner than before indeed he had barely got one mouthful deposited when he was rung up by the friend on his right with two beats of the bell to pass a heavy goods train which with something like the impatience of stout people in crossing dangerous roads was anxious to get on and out of the way as fast as possible for it knew that a limited mail was tearing after it at a fearfully unlimited pace  sam knew this tooindeed he knew and was bound to know every train that had to pass that station up and down during his period of duty  he therefore replied sat down had a bite or two and sprang up when the whistle of the train was audible  there was longer delay this time for the goods train had to stop and be shunted at this station  moreover another goods train that had quietly but impatiently been biding its time in a siding thought it would try to take advantage of this opportunity and gave an impatient whistle  sam opened one of his sliding windows and looked out  couldnt you let me shunt over a truck tother side now sam asked its driver remonstratively  sam glanced at his timepiece with an earnest thoughtful look and said  well yes but look sharp  he had already pulled the lever of the home signal and now with two mighty pulls blocked both up and down lines with the distant signals at the same time he pulled other levers and shifted the points so as to let the plethoric goods train just arrived and the goods train in waiting perform their respective evolutions  it required nearly all sams strength to pull over several of those levers because besides being somewhat heavy to work even at their best several of them had got slightly out of orderwanted oiling perhaps  it was quite evident to the meanest capacity that there was room for improvement in this department of the grand national trunk railway  in performing this last operation sam locked all the semaphores and so rendered his part of the line absolutely impregnable  there was so much vigorous action and whistling here and such puffing and backing and pushing on the part of the engines that a superficial observer might have supposed there was a great deal of movement and confusion to no purpose but we need scarcely say that such was not the case  several trucks of goods were dropped by both trains to be carried on by other trains and several trucks that had been left by other trains were taken up and thus in a few minutes a part of the enormous traffic of the line was assorted  sam had judged his time well  he had got a good piece of work advanced and both trains well out of the way just before the bell again intimated the approach of the limited mail  he replied set the line free booked the passage of the goods train and sat down once more to dinner just as the door of his box opened and the pretty face of gertie peeped in  we are not sure that such a visit would be permitted in these days of stringent rules at that time they may not have been very particular as to visitors or perhaps gertie being one of themselves as it were was privileged  be this as it may there she was with a laughing face  may i come in sam  may a cherub from the skies come inyes replied sam rising and lifting gertie in his strong arms until he could print a kiss on her forehead without stooping  all well at home gertie  very well thank you  we expect father home to tea  i know that said sam sitting down at his small table and attempting dinner once again  how do you know that asked gertie in surprise  cause ive got to pass him up wi the express in halfanhour replied sam with his mouth full and of course he dont prefer takin tea on the lightenin with his mate bill garvie wen hes got a chance o takin it wi his wife and a little angel like you  i wish youd not talk nonsense sam remonstrated gertie with a serious look  that aint nonsense said sam stoutly  yes it is said gertie you know angels are good  well and aint you good demanded the signalman filling his mouth with a potato  mother says i am and i feel as if i was replied gertie with much simplicity but you know angels are very very good and of course im not near so good as them  you are said sam with an obstinate snap at a piece of meat youre better than any of em  you only want wings to be complete  gertie laughed and then remarked that sam dined late to which sam replied that he did that he preferred it and that he didnt see why gentlefolk should have that sort of fun all to themselves  whats that exclaimed gertie as sam dropped his knife and fork rang his electric bell and laid hold of a lever  the limited mail my dear said sam as the train rushed by  oh how it shakes the house  i wonder it dont fall exclaimed the child  its made to be well shaken like a bottle o bad physic replied sam as he went through the various processes already described before sitting down to finish his oftinterrupted meal  do you always take your dinner in that uncomfortable way asked gertie sitting down on the chest and looking earnestly into the manly countenance of her friend  mostly said sam at last finishing off with a draught of pure water and smacking his lips  sometimes its all i can do to get it eatenother times im not so hard pressed but its never got over without interruption more or less  are breakfast and tea as bad  not quite replied sam with a laugh about breakfast time the traffic aint quite so fast and furious and i takes tea at home  how long are you here at a time asked the inquisitive gertie  twelve hours my dear and no time allowed for meals  surely you must be very tired  sometimes but they talk of shortening the hours soon  theres a want of signalmen just now thats how it is  but what good fortune has sent you here this evenin gertie  i want to ask you about a ring sam  a ring  what you aint goin to get married already are you  gertie replied by bursting into a hearty fit of laughter when she had sufficiently recovered her gravity she revealed her troubles to the sympathising signalman  well it is a perplexin business  what was the old woman doin wi such a ring tied up in such a queer way  i dont know said gertie  well it aint no business of mine but we must try to git hold of it somehow  ill be off dooty at six and your dadll be passin in a few minutes  after im free ill go up to the shed and have a palaver with im  there he is  as he spoke the bell was rung by his signalfriend on the left replied to in the usual way and in a few minutes the chimney of the lightning was seen over the top of the embankment that hid a bend of the upline from view  put your head out here at this window and be ready to wave your hand gertie said sam placing the child  the flying dutchman came on in its wonted wild fashion and for a few seconds gertie saw her fathers bronzed and stern face as he looked straight ahead with his hand on the regulator  john marrot cast one professional glance up and gave a professional wave of his right hand to the signalman  at that instant his whole visage lighted up as if a beam of sunshine had suffused it and his white teeth uncovered by a smile gleamed as he flew past and looked back  gertie waved frantically with her kerchief which flew from her hand and for some distance followed the train  in another moment the flying dutchman was a speck in the distanceits terrific crash suddenly reduced by distance to a low rumble  evenin jack said sam as his successor or comrade on the nightshift entered the box come along now gertie  well go and see your father  hell be up at the station in no time and wont take long to run back to the shed  so saying sam natly assisted gertie down the long iron ladder by which his nest was reached and walked with her to the engineshed which they soon reached  they had not waited long before john marrots iron horse came panting slowly into its accustomed stable  as there were at least twelve iron horses there in all stages of beingputtobedism and some like naughty boys were blowing off their steam with absolutely appalling noise it was next to impossible for gertie and sam to make known their difficulty to john  they therefore waited until he had seen his satellites in proper attendance upon his charger and then left the shed along with him  when the case was made known to john he at once said why didnt they apply to the clearin house i wonder  ah why not said sam  nurse doesnt know about that place i think suggested gertie  very likely not but if shed only gone an seen any one as knowd anything about the line shed have found it out  however the parcels pretty sure to be somewhere so ill set some inquiries afoot wen i goes up to town tomorrow  goodnight sam  goodnight john answered the signalman as he turned off in the direction of his own dwelling while the enginedriver and his little daughter pursued the footpath that led to their cottage  sam natlys residence was a very small one for houserent was high in that neighbourhood  there were only two rooms in it but these two bore evidence of being tended by a thrifty housewife and truly when sams delicate but partially recovered wife met him at the door that night and gave him a hearty kiss of welcome no one with an atom of good taste could have avoided admitting that she was a remarkably pretty as well as thrifty little woman  youre late tonight sam said little mrs natly  yes ive had to go to the shed to see john marrot about a diamond ring  a diamond ring exclaimed his wife  yes a diamond ring  hereupon sam related all he knew about the matter and you may be sure the subject was quite sufficient to furnish ground for a very lively and speculative conversation during the preparation and consumption of as nice a little hot supper as any hardworked signalman could desire  youre tired sam said his little wife anxiously  well i am a bit  its no wonder for its a pretty hard job to work them levers for twelve hours at a stretch without an interval even for meals but im gittin used to itlike the eels to bein skinned  its a great shame of the company cried mrs natly with indignation  come come cried sam no treason  it aint such a shame as it looks  you see the company have just bin introducin a noo system of signallin an they hant got enough of men who understand the thing to work it dye see so of course weve got to work double tides as the jacktars say  if they continue to keep us at it like that ill say its a shame too but we must give em time to git things into workin order  besides theyre hardup just now  theres a deal o money throwd away by companies fightin an opposin one another cuttin their own throats i calls itand theyre awful hard used by the public in the way o compensation too  its nothin short o plunder and robbery  if the public would claim moderately and juries would judge fairly an directors would fight less shareholders would git higher dividends the public would be better served and railway servants would be less worked and better paid  i dont care two straws sam said little mrs natly with great firmness not two straws for their fightins an joories and davydensall i know is that theyve no right whatever to kill my usband and its a great shame  with this noble sentiment the earnest little woman concluded the evenings conversation and allowed her wearied partner to retire to rest    chapter eighteen  a soiree wildly interrupted and followed up by surprising revelations  one afternoon captain lee and emma called on mrs tipps and found her engaged in earnest conversation with netta  the captain who was always in a boilingover condition and never felt quite happy except when in the act of planning or carrying out some scheme for the increase of general happiness soon discovered that netta was discussing the details of a little treat which she meant to give to the boys and girls of a sundayschool which she and her mother superintended  with all his penetration he did not however find out that the matter which called most for consideration was the financial part of the schemein other words how to accomplish the end desired with extremely limited means he solved the question for them however by asserting that he intended to give all the scholars of all the sundayschools in the neighbourhood a treat and of course meant to include nettas school among the rest unless of course she possessed so much exclusive pride as to refuse to join him  there was no resisting captain lee  as well might a redskin attempt to stop niagara  when once he had made up his mind to go in for something no mortal power could stop him  he might indeed be turned another object of interest worthy of pursuit and judiciously put before him might perhaps induce him to abandon a previous scheme but once his steam was up as john marrot used to say you could not get him to blow it off into the air  he was unlike the iron horse in that respect although somewhat like him in the rigour of his action accordingly the thing was fixed  invitations were sent out to all the schools and to all who took an interest in them and the place fixed on was a field at the back of mrs tippss villa  the day came and with it the children in their best array  the weather was all that could be wisheda bright sun and a clear skyso that the huge tent provided in case of rain was found to be only required to shade the provisions from the sun  besides the children there were the teachersmany of them little more than children as to years but with a happy earnestness of countenance and manner which told of another element in their breasts that evidently deepened and intensified their joy  there were several visitors and friends of captain lee and mrs tipps  emma was there of course the busiest of the busy in making arrangements for the feast which consisted chiefly of fruit buns and milk  netta and she managed that department together  of course little gertie was there and her sister loo from which we may conclude that will garvie was there in spirit not only because that would have been natural but because he had expressly told loo the day before that he meant to be present in that attenuated condition  bodily poor fellow he was on the footplate of the lightning which is as much as to say that he was everywhere by turns and nowhere long  mrs marrot was there too and baby with nanny stocks as his guardian  miss stockss chief employment during the evening appeared to be to forget herself in the excess of her delight and run babys head against all sorts of things and persons  perhaps it was as well she did so because it tended to repress his energy  she acted the part of regulator and safetyvalve to that small human engine by controlling his actions and permitting him goodnaturedly to let off much of his superfluous steam on herself  indeed she was a species of strong buffer in this respect receiving and neutralising many a severe blow from his irrepressible feet and fists  bob marrot was also there with his bosom friend tomtit dorkin whose sole occupation in life up to that time had been to put screws on nuts this must have been nuts to him as the yankees have it because being a diligent little fellow he managed to screw himself through life at the clatterby works to the tune of twelve shillings a week  joseph tipps having got leave of absence for an evening was also theremodest amiable active and selfabnegating  so was mrs natly who in consideration of her delicate health was taken great care of and very much made of by mrs tipps and her family conspicuously by mrs durby who had become very fond of her since the night she nursed her  indeed there is little doubt that mrs durby and the bottle of wine were the turningpoint of mrs natlys illness and that but for them poor sam would have been a widower by that time  mr able the director was also there bland and beaming with a brother director who was anything but bland or beaming being possessed of a grave massive strongly marked and stern countenance but nevertheless owning a similar spirit and a heart which beat high with philanthropic desires and designsthough few who came in contact with him except his intimate friends would believe it  there were also present an elderly clergyman and a young curateboth good earnest men but each very different in many respects from the other  the elder clergyman had a genial hearty countenance and manner and he dressed very much like other gentlemen  the young curate might have breakfasted on his poker to judge from the stiffness of his back and appeared to be afraid of suffering from cold in the knees and chest to judge from the length of his surtout and the height of his plain buttonless vest  when all were assembled on the green and the viands spread the elder clergyman gave out a hymn and the curate who had a capital voice led off but he was speedily drowned by the gush of song that rose from the childrens lips  it was a lively hymn and they evidently rejoiced to sing it  then the elder clergyman made the children a short speech  it was amazingly brief insomuch that it quite took the little ones by surpriseso short was it indeed and so much to the point that we will venture to set it down here  dear children he said in a loud voice that silenced every chattering tongue we have met here to enjoy ourselves  there is but one of your sunday lessons which i will remind you of today  it is thiswhether ye eat or drink or whatsoever ye do do all to the glory of god before beginning then let us ask gods blessing  thereupon he asked a blessing which was also so brief that but for the allprevailing name of jesus with which he closed it some of those who heard him would scarce have deemed it a prayer at all  yet this elderly clergyman was not always brief  he was not brief for instance in his private prayers for himself his friends and his flock  brevity did not mark his proceedings when engaged in preparing for the sabbath services  he was not brief when in his study he pleaded with some awakened but unbelieving soul to cast itself unreservedly on the finished work of our saviour  he was a man who carried his tact and commonsense into his religious duties who hated formalism regarding it as one of the great stumblingblocks in the progress of christianity and who endeavoured at all times to suit his words and actions to the circumstances of the occasion  the children regarded him with a degree of affection that was all but irrepressible and which induced them at his earnest request to sit still for a considerable time while his young brother gave them a short address  he was almost emphatic on the word short but the young curate did not appear to take the hint or to understand the meaning of that word either in regard to discourses or surtouts  he asserted himself in his surtouts and vests without of course having a shadow of reason for so doing save that some other young curates asserted themselves in the same way and he asserted himself then and there in a tone of voice called sermonising to which foolish young men are sometimes addicted and which by the way being a false and therefore irreligious tone is another great stumblingblock in the way of christianity  and curiously enough this young curate was really an earnest though mistaken and intensely bigoted young man  we call him bigoted not because he held his own opinions but because he held by his little formalities with as much apparent fervour as he held by the grand doctrines of his religion although for the latter he had the authority of the word while for the former he had merely the authority of man  his discourse was a good one and if delivered in a natural voice and at a suitable time might have made a good impression  as it was it produced pity and regret in his elder brother exasperation in captain lee profound melancholy in joseph tipps great admiration in miss stocks and the baby and unutterable ennui in the children fortunately for the success of the day in the middle of it he took occasion to make some reference with allegorical intentions to the lower animals and pointed to a pig which lay basking in the sunshine at no great distance an unconcerned spectator of the scene  a rather obtuse fatfaced boy was suddenly smitten with the belief that this was intended as a joke and dutifully clapped his hands  the effect was electricalan irresistible cheer and clapping of hands ensued  it was of no use to attempt to check it  the more this was tried the more did the children seem to think they were invited to a continuance of their ovation to the young curate who finally retired amid the hearty though unexpressed congratulations of the company  by good fortune the arrival of several more friends diverted attention from this incident and immediately after captain lee set the children to engage in various games among which the favourite was blindmansbuff  one of the new arrivals was edwin gurwood who had come he said to introduce a gentlemandr nobleto mrs tipps  oh the hypocrite thought mrs tipps he has come to see emma lee and he knows it  of course he knew it and he knew that mrs tipps knew it and he knew that mrs tipps knew that he knew it yet neither he nor mrs tipps showed the slightest symptom of all that knowledge  the latter bowed to dr noble and was expressing her happiness in making his acquaintance when a rush of laughing children almost overturned her and hurled dr noble aside  they were immediately separated in the crowd and strange to say edwin at once found himself standing beside emma lee who by some curious coincidence had just parted from netta so that they found themselves comparatively alone  what they said to each other in these circumstances it does not become us to divulge  while all parties were enjoying themselves to the full including the young curate whose discomfiture was softened by the kind attentions of mrs tipps and her daughter an incident occurred which filled them with surprise and consternation  dr noble was standing at the time near the large tent looking at the games and nanny stocks was not far from him choking the baby with alternate sweetmeats and kisses to the horror of joseph tipps who fully expected to witness a case of croup or some such infantine disease in a few minutes when suddenly a tall man with torn clothes dishevelled hair and bloodshot eyes sprang forward and confronted dr noble  ha he exclaimed with a wild laugh have i found you at last mine enemy  dr noble looked at him with much surprise but did not reply  he appeared to be paralysed  i have sought you continued the man trembling with illsuppressed passion over land and sea and now ive found you  youve got the casketyou know you have you took it from my wife the night she died you shall give it up now or you die  he spluttered rather than spoke the last words between his teeth as he made a spring at the doctor  edwin gurwood had seen the man approach and at once to his amazement recognising the features of thomson his old opponent in the train he ran towards him but was not near enough to prevent his first wild attack  fortunately for dr noble this was thwarted by no less a personage than joseph tipps who seeing what was intended sprang promptly forward and seizing the man by the legs adroitly threw him down  with a yell that sent a chill of horror to all the young hearts round the madman for such he plainly was leaped up but before he could renew his attack he was in the powerful grasp of his old enemy edwin gurwood  a terrific struggle ensued for both men as we have said before were unusually powerful but on this occasion madness more than counterbalanced edwins superior strength  for some time they wrestled so fiercely that none of the other gentlemen could interfere with effect  they dashed down the large tent and went crashing through the debris of the feast until at length thomson made a sudden twist freed himself from edwins grasp leaving a shred of his coat in his hands and flying across the field leaped at a single bound the wall that encompassed it  he was closely followed by edwin and by a constable of the district who happened to arrive upon the scene but the fugitive left them far behind and was soon out of sight  this incident put an end to the evenings enjoyment but as the greater part of it had already passed delightfully before thomson came on the ground to mar the sport the children returned home much pleased with themselves and everybody else despite the concluding scene  meanwhile mrs tipps invited her friends who had assembled there to take tea in eden villa and here dr noble was eagerly questioned as to his knowledge of his late assailant but he either could not or would not throw light on the subject  some of the guests left early and some late but to mrs tippss surprise the doctor remained till the last of them had said goodnight after which to her still greater surprise he drew his chair close to the table and looking at her and netta with much earnestness said  probably you are surprised ladies that i a stranger have remained so long tonight  the truth is i had come here to have some conversation on private and very important matters but finding you so lively and i must add so pleasantly engaged i deemed it expedient to defer my conversation until you should be more at leisure  he paused as if to collect his thoughts and the ladies glanced at each other uneasily and in some surprise but made no reply  in truth remembering the scene they had just witnessed they began to suspect that another style of madman had thought fit to pay them a visit  he resumed however with every appearance of sanity  how the madman who assaulted me this evening found me out i know not i was not aware until this day that he had been tracking me but judging from what he said and from what i know about him i now see that he must have been doing so for some years  here is the explanation and let me add it intimately concerns yourselves  mrs tipps and netta became more interested as dr noble proceeded  you must know he said that when in india some years ago i made several coasting voyages with a certain seacaptain as surgeon of his ship at periods when my health required recruiting  i received from that gentleman every attention and kindness that the heart of a good man could suggest  on one of these voyages we had a native prince on board he was voyaging like myself for the benefit of his health but his case was a bad one  he grew rapidly worse and before the end of the voyage he died  during his illness the captain nursed him as if he had been his own child all the more tenderly that he thought him to be one of those unfortunate princes who owing to political changes had been ruined and had lost all his wealth along with his station  it was quite touching i assure you madam to listen to the earnest tones of that captains voice as he read passages from the word of god to the dying prince and sought to convince him that jesus christ who became poor for our sakes could bestow spiritual wealth that neither the world nor life nor death could take away  the prince spoke very little but he listened most intently  just before he died he sent a sailor lad who attended on him for the captain and taking a small box from beneath his pillow gave it to him saying brieflyhere take it you have been my best friend i shall need it no more  after he was dead the box was opened and found to contain a most superb set of diamondsa necklace brooch earrings bracelets and a ring besides a quantity of gold pieces the whole being worth several thousands of pounds  as the prince had often said that all his kindred were dead the captain had no conscientious scruples in retaining the gift  he locked it away in his cabin  when the voyage was finishedat calcuttathe men were paid off  the captain then bethought him of placing his treasure in some place of security in the city  he went to his chest and took out the boxit was lighthe opened it hastilythe contents were gone  nothing was left to him of that splendid gift save the ring which he had placed on his finger soon after receiving it and had worn ever since  from some circumstances that recurred to our memories we both suspected the young man who had been in attendance on the prince but although we caused the most diligent search to be made we failed to find him  my friend and i parted soon after  i was sent up to the hills and never saw or heard of him again  several years after that i happened to be residing in calcutta and was called one night to see the wife of an englishman who was thought to be dying  i found her very illnear her end  she seemed to be anxious to communicate something to me but appeared to be afraid of her husband i thought on looking at him attentively that i had seen him before and said so  he seemed to be annoyed and denied ever having met with me  i treated the matter lightly but took occasion to send him out for some physic and while he was away encouraged the woman to unburden her mind  she was not slow to do so  oh sir she said i want to communicate a secret but dared not while my husband was by  long ago before i knew him my husband stole a box of diamonds from a captain tipps  my husband exclaimed the widow  you shall hear said dr noble  i often heard him tell the story and boast of it continued the sick woman quietly and i resolved to obtain possession of the box and have it returned if possible to the rightful owner  so i carried out my purposeno matter howand led him to suppose that the treasure had been stolen but i have often fancied he did not believe me  this captain tipps was a friend of yours sir i know it because my husband has told me  he remembers you although you dont remember him  i wish you to return the box to captain tipps sir if he is yet alive  it lies here she drew me close to her and whispered in my ear the exact spot under a tree where the jewels were hid  youll be sure to remember the place she asked anxiously  remember what place demanded her husband sternly as he returned with the medicine  no answer was given  the woman fell back on hearing his voice but although she lived for nearly an hour never spoke again  the man turned on me and asked again what place she had been speaking of  i said that it was idle to repeat what might prove to be only the ravings of a dying woman  he seized a bludgeon and raising it in a threatening manner said i know you dr noble you shall tell me what i want to know else you shall not quit this room alive  i know you too thomson said i drawing a small sword from a stick which i always carried  if you proceed to violence it remains to be seen who shall quit this room alive  i opened the door and walked quietly out leaving him glaring like a tiger after me  going to the place described i found the diamonds and from that day to this i have not ceased to try to discover my old friend but have not yet succeeded  knowing that he might be dead i have made inquiry of every one possessing your name mrs tipps in the hope of discovering his widow or children and although your name is an uncommon one madam you would be surprised if you knew how many i have ferreted out in the course of years  unfortunately my friend never mentioned his family or the place of his residence in england so i have had no clue to guide me save one  i have even found two widows of the name of tipps besides yourself and one of these said that her husband was a sailor captain but her description of him was not that of my friend  the other said her husband had been a lawyer so of course he could not be the man of whom i was in search  but sir said mrs tipps in some perplexity if you are to depend on description i fear that you will never attain your end for every one knows that descriptions given of the same person by different people never quite agree  that is true madam and the description given to me this evening of your late husband is a case in point for although it agrees in many thingsin most thingsthere is some discrepancy  did your husband never give you the slightest hint about a set of diamonds that he had once lost  never but i can account for that by the fact that he never alluded to anything that had at any time given him pain or displeasure if he could avoid it  there is but the one clue then that i spoke of namely the ring that belonged to the set of diamonds  did your husband ever possess  the ring exclaimed mrs tipps and netta in the same breath  yes he had a diamond ring  they stopped abruptly and looked at each other in distress for they remembered that the ring had been lost  pray what sort of ring is it  describe it to me said dr noble  netta carefully described it and as she did so the visitors countenance brightened  thats it thats it exactly that must be it for i remember it well and it corresponds in all respects withmy dear ladies let me see the ring without delay  alas sir said mrs tipps sadly the ring is lost  a look of blank dismay clouded poor dr nobles visage as he heard these words but he quickly questioned the ladies as to the loss and became more hopeful on bearing the details  come he said at last as he rose to take leave things dont look quite so bad as they did at first  from all i have heard i am convinced that my friends widow and daughter are before mea sight of the ring would put the question beyond all doubt  we must therefore set to work at once and bend all our energies to the one great point of recovering the lost ring    chapter nineteen  a runaway locomotive  being as we have had occasion to remark before a communicative and confiding little woman netta tipps told the secret of the ring in strict confidence to her old nurse  mrs durby in a weak moment as on a former occasion related the history of it to gertie who of course told loo  she naturally mentioned it to her lover will garvie and he conveyed the information to john marrot  thus far but no further the thing went for john felt that there might be danger in spreading the matter and laid a strict injunction on all who knew of it to keep silence for a time  while at the station the day following just after having brought in the flying dutchman he was accosted by the superintendent of police who chanced to be lounging there with apparently nothing to do  never was there a man who was more frequently called on to belie his true character  it was a part of mr sharps duty to look lazy at times and even stupid so as to throw suspicious men off their guard  a fine day john he said lounging up to the engine where john was leaning on the rail contemplating the departure of the passengers whose lives had been in his hands for the last hour and a half while will garvie was oiling some of the joints of the iron horse  john admitted that it was a fine day and asked what was the noos  nothing particular doing just now said mr sharp  youve heard i suppose of the mad fellow who caused such a confusion among miss tippss sundayschool children last night  oh yes i heard o that  and did you hear that he turns out to be the man who jumped out of your train on the day of the attempted robbery  yes ive heard o that too  they havent got him yet i believe  no not yet but i think we shall have him soon said mr sharp with a knowing glance ive heard rumours that lead me to think it would not be very surprising if we were to see him hanging about this station today or tomorrow  ive got a sort of decoyduck to attract him continued mr sharp chuckling in the shape of a retired east india doctor who agrees to hang about on the condition that we keep a sharp eye on him and guard him well from any sudden attack  you dont mean that said the enginedriver in an earnest undertone  instead of replying the superintendent suddenly left him and sauntered leisurely along the platform with his eyes cast down and softly humming a popular air  the act was so brusque and unlike mr sharps naturally polite character that john knew at once as he said that something was up and looked earnestly along the platform where he saw thomson himself walking smartly about as if in search of some one  he carried a heavyheaded stick in his hand and looked excited but not much more so than an anxious or late passenger might be  mr sharp went straight towards the madmanstill sauntering with his head down however and john marrot could see that another man whom he knew to be a detective was walking round by the side of the platform with the evident intention of taking him in rear  the moment thomson set eyes on the superintendent he recognised him and apparently divined his object in approaching for he started clenched his teeth and grasped his stick  mr sharp instantly abandoned all attempt at concealment and ran straight at him  thomson probably deeming discretion the better part of valour turned and fled  he almost ran into the arms of the detective who now made sure of him but he doubled like a hare and sprang off the platform on to the rails  here one or two of the men who were engaged in washing or otherwise looking after empty carriages seeing what was going on at once sought to intercept the madman but he evaded two or three knocked down another and finding himself alongside of a detached engine which stood there with steam up ready to be coupled to its train he leaped upon it felled the driver who was outside the rail oiling some of the machinery seized the handle of the regulator and turned on full steam  the drivingwheels revolved at first with such tremendous rapidity that they failed to bite and merely slipped on the rails  thomson was engineer enough to understand why and at once cut off part of the steam  next moment he shot out of the station and again letting on full steam rushed along the line like an arrow  it chanced that the passengersuperintendent was on the platform at the time  that gentleman had everything connected with the traffic by heart  he saw that the points had been so set as to turn the runaway engine on to the down line and in his minds eye saw a monster excursion train which had started just a few minutes before labouring slowly forward which the light engine would soon overtake  a collision in a few minutes would be certain  in peculiar circumstances men are bound to break through all rules and regulations and act in a peculiar way  without a moments hesitation he ran to john marrot and said in an earnest hurried voice  give chase john cross over to the upline but dont go too far  all right sir said john laying his hand on the regulator  even while the superintendent was speaking will garvies swift mind had appreciated the idea  he had leaped down and uncoupled the lightning from its train  john touched the whistle let on steam and off they went crossed to the upline which was the wrong line of rails for any engine to run in that direction and away he went at forty fifty seventy miles an hour  john knew well that he was flying towards a passengertrain which was running towards him at probably thirtyfive or forty miles an hour  he was aware of its whereabouts at that time for he consulted his watch and had the timetable by heart  a collision with it would involve the accumulated momentum of more than a hundred miles an hour  the time was short but it was sufficient he therefore urged will to coal the furnace until it glowed with fervent heat and opened the steam valve to the uttermost  never since john marrot had driven it had the lightning so nearly resembled its namesake  the pace was increased to seventyfive and eighty miles an hour  it was awful  objects flew past with flashing speed  the clatter of the engine was deafening  a stern chase is proverbially a long one but in this case at such a speed it was short  in less than fifteen minutes john came in view of the fugitivealso going at full speed but not being so powerful an engine and not being properly managed as to the fire it did not go so fast its pace might have been forty or fortyfive miles an hour  will shouted john in the ear of his stalwart fireman youll have to be sharp about it  it wont do lad to jump into the arms of a madman with a fireshovel in his hand  wen i takes a shot at im with a lump of coal thens yer chancego in an win ladand whateverye do keep cool  will did not open his compressed lips but nodded his head in reply  youll have to do it all alone bill i cant leave the engine shouted john  he looked anxiously into his mates face and felt relieved to observe a little smile curl slightly the corners of his mouth  another moment and the lightning was up with the tender of the runaway and john cut off steam for a brief space to equalise the speed  thomson at that instant observed for the first time that he was pursued  he looked back with a horrible glare and then uttering a fierce cheer or yell tugged at the steam handle to increase the speed but it was open to the utmost  he attempted to heap coals on the fire but being inexpert failed to increase the heat  another second and they were abreast john marrot opened the whistle and let it blow continuously for he was by that time drawing fearfully near to the train that he knew was approaching  seeing that escape was impossible thomson would have thrown the engine off the rails if that had been possible but as it was not he brandished the fireshovel and stood at the opening between the engine and tender with an expression of fiendish rage on his countenance that words cannot describe  now bill look out said john  will stood like a tiger ready to spring  john beside him with a huge mass of coal in one hand concealed behind his back  there was a space of little more than two feet between the engines  to leap that in the face of a madman seemed impossible  suddenly john marrot hurled the mass of coal with all his might  his aim was to hit thomson on the head but it struck low hitting him on the chest and driving him down on the footplate  at the same instant will garvie bounded across and shut off the steam in an instant  he turned then to the brakewheel but before he could apply it thomson had risen and grappled with him  still as the two strong men swayed to and fro in a deadly conflict wills hand that chanced at the moment to be nearest the brakewheel was seen ever and anon to give it a slight turn  thus much john marrot observed when he saw a puff of white steam on the horizon far ahead of him  to reverse the engine and turn full steam on was the work of two seconds  fire flew in showers from the wheels and the engine trembled with the violent friction nevertheless it still ran on for a considerable way and the approaching train was within a comparatively short distance of him before he had got the lightning to run backwards  it was not until he had got up speed to nigh forty miles an hour that he felt safe looked back with a grim smile and breathed freely  of course the driver of the passengertrain seeing an engine on the wrong line ahead had also reversed at full speed and thus prevented a collision which would inevitably have been very disastrous  john now ran back to the crossing and getting once more on the down line again reversed his engine and ran cautiously back in the direction of the runaway locomotive  he soon came in sight of it reversed again and went at such a pace as allowed it to overtake him gradually he saw that the steam was still cut off and that it had advanced that length in consequence of being on an incline but was somewhat alarmed to receive no signal from his mate  the moment the buffers of the lightning touched those of the other engines tender he applied the brakes and brought both engines to a stand  then leaping off he ran to see how it had fared with will garvie  the scene that met his eyes was a very ghastly one  on the floorplate lay the two men insensible and covered with blood and coaldust  each grasped the other by the throat but will had gained an advantage from having no neckcloth on while his own strong hand was twisted into that of his adversary so firmly that the madmans eyes were almost starting out of their sockets  john marrot at once cut the kerchief with his claspknife and then feeling that there was urgent need for haste left them lying there ran back to his own engine coupled it to the other turned on full steam and in a short space of time ran into clatterby station  here the men were at once removed to the waitingroom and a doctorwho chanced to be dr noblewas called in  it was found that although much bruised and cut as well as exhausted by their conflict neither will nor thomson were seriously injured  after a few restoratives had been applied the former was conveyed home in a cab while the latter under the charge of mr sharp and one of his men was carried off and safely lodged in an asylum    chapter twenty  a nest harried  having thus seen one criminal disposed of mr sharp returned to his office to take measures for the arrest of a few more of the same class  since we last met with our superintendent he had not led an idle life by any means  a brief reference to some of his recent doings will be an appropriate introduction to the little entertainment which he had provided for himself and his men on that particular evening  one day he had been informed that wine and spirits had been disappearing unaccountably at a particular station  he visited the place with one of his men spent the night under a tarpaulin in a goodsshed and found that one of the platelayers was in the habit of drawing off spirits with a syphon  the guilty man was handed over to justice and honest men who had felt uneasy lest they should be suspected were relieved  on another occasion he was sent to investigate a claim made by a man who was in the accident at langrye station  this man who was an auctioneer had not been hurt at allonly a little skin taken off his nosebut our fop with the check trousers advised him to make a job of it and said that he himself and his friend had intended to make a claim only they had another and more important game in hand which rendered it advisable for them to keep quiet  this was just before the attack made on mr lee in the train between clatterby and london  the auctioneer had not thought of such a way of raising money but jumped readily at the idea went to glasgow and dundee where he consulted doctorsshowed them his broken nose coughed harshly in their ears complained of nervous affections pains in the back loins and head and pricking his gums slightly spit blood for their edification spoke of internal injuries and shook his head lugubriously  doctors unlike lawyers are not constantly on the watch for impostors  the mans peeled and swelled nose was an obvious fact his other ailments might or might not be serious so they prescribed condoled with him charged him nothing and dismissed him with a hope of speedy cure  thereafter the auctioneer went down the clyde to recruit his injured health and did a little in the way of business just to keep up his spirits poor fellow  after that he visited aberdeen for similar purposes and then sent in a claim of 150 pounds damages against the grand national trunk railway  mr sharps first proceeding was to visit the doctors to whom the auctioneer had applied then he visited the various wateringplaces whither the man had gone to recruit and ascertained every particular regarding his proceedings  finally he went to the north of scotland to see the interesting invalid himself  he saw and heard him first in an auctionroom where he went through a hard days work even for a healthy man then he visited him in his hotel and found him the picture of ruddy health drinking whisky punch  on stating that he was an agent of the railway company and had called to have some conversation regarding his claim some of the auctioneers ruddy colour fled but being a bold man he assumed a candid air and willingly answered all questions admitted that he was better but said that he had lost much time had for a long period been unable to attend to his professional duties and still suffered much from internal injuries  mr sharp expressed sympathy with him said that the case as he put it was indeed a hard one and begged of him to put his statement of it down on paper  the auctioneer complied and thought mr sharp a rather benignant railway official  when he had signed his name to the paper his visitor took it up and said now mr blank this is all lies from beginning to end  i have traced your history step by step down to the present time visited all the places you have been to conversed with the waiters of the hotels where you put up have heard you today go through as good a days work as any strong man could desire to do and have seen you finish up with a stiff glass of whisky toddy which i am very sorry to have interrupted  now sir this is very like an effort to obtain money under false pretences and if you dont know what that leads to you are in a very fair way to find out  the company which i have the honour to represent however is generous  we know that you were in the langrye accident for i saw you there and in consideration of the injury to your nerves and the damage to your proboscis we are willing to give you a fivepound note as a sort of stickingplaster at once to your nose and your feelings  if you accept that good if not you shall take the consequences of this  the superintendent here held up the written statement playfully and placed it in his pocketbook  the auctioneer was a wise if not an honest man  he thankfully accepted the five pounds and invited mr sharp to join him in a tumbler which however the superintendent politely declined  but this was a small matter compared with another case which mr sharp had just been engaged investigating  it was as follows  one afternoon a slight accident occurred on the line by which several passengers received trifling injuries  at the time only two people made claim for compensation one for a few shillings the other for a few pounds  these cases were at once investigated and settled and it was thought that there the matter ended  six months afterwards however the company received a letter from the solicitors of a gentleman whose hat it was said had been driven down on the bridge of his nose and had abraded the skin the slight wound had turned into an ulcer which ultimately assumed the form of permanent cancer  in consequence of this the gentleman had consulted one doctor in paris and another in rome and had been obliged to undergo an operationfor all of which he claimed compensation to the extent of 5000 pounds  the company being quite unable to tell whether this gentleman was in the accident referred to or not an investigation was set on foot in which mr sharp bore his part at great expense official persons were sent to paris and to rome to see the doctors said to have been consulted and in the endnearly two years after the accidentthe company was found liable for the 5000 pounds  while we are on this subject of compensation it may not be uninteresting to relate a few curious cases which will give some idea of the manner in which railway companies are squeezed for damages sometimes unjustly and too often fraudulently  on one occasion a man who said he had been in an accident on one of our large railways claimed 1000 pounds  in this case the company was fortunately able to prove a conspiracy to defraud and thus escaped but in many instances the companies are defeated in fraudulent claims and there is no redress  the feelings of the juries who try the cases are worked on patients are brought into court exhibiting every symptom of hopeless malady but these same patients not unfrequently possess quite miraculous powers of swift recovery from what had been styled incurable damage  one man received 6000 pounds on the supposition that he had been permanently disabled and within a short period he was attending to his business as well as ever  a youth with a salary of 60 pounds a year claimed and got 1200 pounds on the ground of incurable injuryin other words he was pensioned for life to the extent of 60 pounds a yearand a year afterwards it was ascertained that he was dancing at balls and had joined his father in business as if there was nothing the matter with him  a barmaid who it was said received injuries to the spine of a permanent character was paid a sum of 1000 pounds aswe were about to writecompensation but consolation would be the more appropriate term seeing that she had little or nothing to be compensated for as she was found capable of dancing at the licensed victuallers ball soon after the accident and eventually she married  to oblige railways to compensate for loss of time or property or health to a limited extent seems reasonable but to compel them to pension off people who have suffered little or nothing with snug little annuities of 50 pounds or 60 pounds does really seem to be a little too hard at least so it appears to be in the eyes of one who happens to have no interest whatever in railways save that general interest in their immense value to the land and their inestimable comforts in the matter of locomotion  the whole subject of compensation stands at present on a false footing for the comfort of those who wish well to railways and love justice we may add in conclusion that proposals as to modifications have already been mooted and brought before government so that in all probability ere long impostors will receive a snubbing and shareholders will receive increased dividends  but let us return to mr sharp  having as we have said gone to his office he found his faithful servant blunt there  why blunt he said sitting down at the table and tearing open a few letters that awaited him what a goodlooking porter you make  so my wife says sir replied blunt with a perfectly grave face but with a twinkle in his eye  she must be a discriminating woman blunt  well what news have you tonight  you seemed to think you had found out the thieves at gorton station the last time we met  so i have sir and there are more implicated than we had expected the place is a perfect nest of them  not an uncommon state of things observed mr sharp for it is wellknown that one black sheep spoils a flock  we must weed them all out blunt and get our garden into as tidy a condition as possible it is beginning to do us credit already but that gorton station has remained too long in a bad state we must harrow it up a little  well lets hear what you have found out  they never suspected you i suppose  never had the least suspicion replied blunt with a slight approach to a smile  ive lived with em now for a considerable time and the general opinion of em about me is that im a decent enough fellow but too slow and stupid to be trusted so they have not up to this time thought me worthy of being made a confidant  however that didnt matter much cause i managed to get round one o their wives at last and she let out the whole affairin strict confidence of course and as a dead secret  in fact i have just come from a long and interesting conversation with her  she told me that all the men at the station with one or two exceptions were engaged in it and showed me two of the missing bales of cloththe cloth you remember sir of which there was such a large quantity stolen four weeks ago and for which the company has had to pay  i find that the chief signalman davis is as bad as the rest  it was his wife that gave me the information in a moment of overconfidence  indeed exclaimed sharp in some surprise and what of sam natly and garvie  theyre both of em innocent sir said blunt  i did suspect em at one time but i have seen and heard enough to convince me that they have no hand in the business  natly has been goin about the station a good deal of late because the wife of one of the men is a friend of his wife and used to go up to nurse her sometimes when she was ill  as to garvie of course he knows as well as everybody else that some of the men there must be thieves else goods would not disappear from that station as they do but his frequent visits there are for the purpose of reclaiming davis who it seems is an old playmate of his  reclaiming davis exclaimed sharp  yes an its my opinion that itll take a cleverer fellow than him to reclaim davis for hes one of the worst of the lot but garvie is real earnest  i chanced to get behind a hedge one day when they were together and overheard em talkin about these robberies and other matters and you would have thought sir that the fireman was a regular divine  he could quote scripture quite in a stunnin way sir an did seem badly cut up when his friend told him that it was of no use talkin for it was too late for him to mend  has garvie then been aware all this time that davis is one of the thieves and kept it secret asked sharp  no sir replied blunt  davis denied that he had any hand in the robberies when garvie asked him  it was about drink that he was pleadin with him so hard  you know we have suspected him of that too of late but from what i heard he must be a regular toper  garvie was tryin to persuade him to become a total abstainer  says he to him you know davis that whatever may be true as to the general question of abstaining from strong drink your only chance of bein delivered lies in total abstinence because the thing has become a disease  i know and believe that christianity would save you from the power of drink but depend upon it that it would do so in the way of inducin you of your own free will to touch not taste not handle not that which you will perish by the using  seems to me as if there was something in that sir said blunt inquiringly  sharp nodded assent  then garvie does not suspect him of being connected with the robberies he asked  no replied blunt but hes a deep file is davis and could throw a sharper man than garvie off the scent  after a little further conversation on the subject mr sharp dismissed the pretended porter to his station and called upon the superintendent of the police force of clatterby from whom he received an addition to his force of men  that night he led his men to gorton station and when he thought a suitable hour had arrived he caused them to surround the block of buildings in which the men of the station resided  then placing blunt and two or three men in front of daviss house he went up to the door alone and knocked  mrs davis opened it  she gave the least possible start on observing by the light of her lobby lamp who her visitor wasfor she knew him well mr sharp took note of the start  goodevening mrs davis he said  goodevening sir this is an unexpected pleasure mr sharp  most of my visits are unexpected mrs davis but it is only my friends who count them a pleasure  is your husband within  he is sir pray walk this way im sure he will be delighted to see you  can you stay to supper with us we are just going to have it  no thank you mrs davis im out on duty tonight said sharp entering the parlour where davis was engaged in reading the newspaper goodevening mr davis  davis rose with a start  mr sharp took note of that also  goodevening mr sharp he said sit down sir sit down  thank you i cant sit down  im on duty just now  the fact is mr davis that i am come to make a search among your men for we have obtained reliable information as to who are the thieves at this station as no doubt some of the men are honest and might feel hurt at having their houses searched i have thought that the best way to prevent any unpleasant feeling is to begin at the top of the free and go downwards  they cant say that i have made fish of one and flesh of another if i begin as a mere matter of form mr davis with yourself  oh certainlycertainly mr sharp by all means replied davis  he spoke with an air of candour but it was quite evident that he was ill at ease  calling in one of his men mr sharp began a rigorous search of the house forthwith  mr davis suggested that he would go out and see that the men were in their residences but mr sharp said that there was no occasion for that and that he would be obliged by his remaining and assisting in the search of his own house  every hole and corner of the groundfloor was examined without any discovery being made  mrs davis observing that her visitors were particular in collecting every shred of cloth that came in their way suddenly asked if it was cloth they were in search of  mr sharp thought the question and the tone in which it was put told of a guilty conscience but he replied that he was in search of many thingscloth included  immediately after and while they were busy with a dark closet mrs davis slipped quietly out of the room  mr sharp was stooping at the time with his back towards her but the two back buttons of his coat must have been eyes for he observed the movement and at once followed her having previously ordered mr davis to move a heavy chest of drawers in order to keep him employed  taking off his shoes he went upstairs rapidly and seeing an open door peeped in  there he saw a sight that would have surprised any man except a superintendent of police  mrs davis was engaged in throwing bales of cloth over the window with the energy of a coalheaver and the haste of one whose house is on fire  the poor woman was not robust yet the easy way in which she handled those bales was quite marvellous  being a cool and patient man sharp allowed her to toss over five bales before interrupting her  when she was moving across the room with the sixth and last he entered  she stopped turned pale and dropped the bale of cloth  you seem to be very busy tonight mrs davis he observed inquiringly can i assist you  oh mr sharp exclaimed mrs davis covering her face with her hands  she could say no more  mr sharp took her gently by the arm and led her downstairs  they reached the room below just in time to see blunt enter holding the ejected bales with both arms to his bosom  blunt had happened to take his stand just underneath the window of mrs daviss bedroom and when that energetic woman tossed the bales out she pitched them straight into blunts willing arms  the accommodating man waited until he had received all that appeared likely to be delivered to him and then with a quiet chuckle bore them as we have seen into daviss parlour  this is a bad business davis said sharp as he slipped a pair of manacles on his prisoner  davis made no reply  he was very pale but looked defiant  mrs davis sat down on a chair and sobbed  leaving them in charge of blunt mr sharp then paid a visit to all the men of the place and ere long succeeded in capturing all who had been engaged in the recent robberies with the various proofs of their guiltin the shape of cloth loaves of sugar fruit boxes of tea etcetera in their apartments  it had cost mr sharp and his men many weary hours of waiting and investigation but their perseverance was at length well rewarded for the nest was thoroughly harried the men were dismissed and variously punished and that portion of the grand national trunk railway was for the time most effectually purified    chapter twenty one  the diamond ring and the railway clearinghouse  let us turn now for a brief space to edwin gurwood  he is seated before a desk in one of the rooms of that large building in seymour street euston square london where a perfect army of clerksabout a thousandclear up many of the mysteries and overcome a number of the difficulties incident to the railway traffic of the kingdom  at the particular time we write of edwin was frowning very hard at a businessbook and thinking of emma lee  the cause of his frown no doubt was owing to the conflict between duty and inclination that happened to rage in his bosom just then  his time belonged to the railways of the united kingdom to emma belonged his heart  the latter was absent without leave and the mind thus basely forsaken became distracted and refused to make good use of time  that day edwin met with a coincidence he made what he believed to be a discovery and almost at the same moment received an inquiry as to the subject of that discovery  while endeavouring without much success to fix his attention on a case of lostluggage which it was his duty to investigate and frowning as we have said at the businessbook his eye was suddenly arrested by the name of durby  durby he muttered  surely that name is familiar  durby why yes thats the name of tippss old nurse  reading on he found that the name of durby was connected with a diamond ring  well now that is strange he muttered to himself  at the first glance i thought that this must be the brown paper parcel that i made inquiry about at the station of the grand national trunk railway long ago but the diamond ring puts that out of the question  no nurse in her senses would travel with a diamond ring tied up in a brown paper parcel the size of her head  we may remind the reader here that when the brown paper parcel was found and carried to the lostluggage office of one of our western railways a note of its valuable contents was sent to the clearinghouse in london  this was recorded in a book  as all inquiries after lost property wheresoever made throughout the kingdom are also forwarded to the clearinghouse it follows that the notes of losses and notes of inquiries meet and thus the lost and the losers are brought together and reunited with a facility that would be impracticable without such a central agency  in the case of our diamond ring however no proper inquiry had been made consequently there was only the loss recorded on the books of the clearinghouse  while edwin was pondering this matter a note was put into his hands by a junior clerk  it contained an inquiry after a diamond ring which had been wrapped up in a large brown paper parcel with the name durby written on it in pencil and was lost many months before between clatterby and london  the note further set forth that the ring was the property of mrs tipps of eden villa and enclosed from that lady a minute description of the ring  it was signed james noble md  wonderful exclaimed edwin  the most singular coincidence i ever experienced  having thus delivered himself he took the necessary steps to have the ring sent to london and obtained leave being an intimate friend of the tipps family to run down by train and deliver it  while he is away on this errand we will take the opportunity of mounting his stool and jotting down a few particulars about the clearinghouse which are worth knowing for that establishment is not only an invaluable means of effecting such happy reunions of the lost and the losers as we have referred to but is in many other ways one of the most important institutions in the kingdom  the railway clearinghouse is so named we presume because it clears up railway accounts that would but for its intervention become inextricably confused and because it enables all the different lines in the country to interchange facilities for throughbooking traffic and clears up their respective accounts in reference to the same  something of the use and value of the clearinghouse may be shown at a glance by explaining that before the great schemes of amalgamation which have now been carried out each railway company booked passengers and goods only as far as its own rails went and at this point fresh tickets had to be taken out and carriages changed with all the disagreeable accompaniments and delays of shifting luggage etcetera before throughbooking was introduced a traveller between london and inverness was compelled to renew his ticket and change luggage four times between darlington and cardiff six times  in some journeys no fewer than nine or ten changes were necessary  this as traffic increased of course became intolerable and it is quite certain that the present extent of passenger and goods traffic could never have been attained if the old system had continued  it was felt to be absolutely necessary that not only passengers but carriages and goods must be passed over as many lines as possible at straight through to their destinations with no needless delays and without breaking bulk  but how was this to be accomplished  there were difficulties in the way of throughbooking which do not appear at first sight  when for instance a traveller goes from london to edinburgh by the east coast route he passes over three different railways of unequal length or mileage  the great northern furnishes his ticket and gives him station accommodation besides providing his carriage while the northeastern and north british permit him to run over their lines and the latter also furnishes station accommodation and collects his ticket  to ascertain precisely how much of that travellers fare is due to each company involves a careful and nice calculation  besides this the whole fare is paid to the great northern and it would be unjust to expect that that company should be saddled with the trouble of making the calculation and the expense of remitting its share to each of the other companies  so too with goodsone company furnishing the waggon and tarpaulin besides undertaking the trouble of loading and furnishing stationaccommodation and the use of its line while it may be several other companies give the use of their lines only and that to a variable extent  in addition to all this the company providing its carriages or waggons is entitled to demurrage for every day beyond a certain time that these are detained by the companies to which they do not belong  now if all this be unavoidable even in the case of a single fare or a small parcel it must be selfevident that in lines where the interchange of throughtraffic is great and constant it would have been all but impossible for the railway companies to manage their business and the system would have given rise to endless disputes  in order to settle accounts of this description it was soon seen to be absolutely necessary that some sort of arrangement must be come to and accordingly the idea of a central office was conceived and a system established without delay which for minute detail and comprehensive grasp is unrivalled by any other institution  at first only a few of the railway companies united in establishing the clearinghouse in 1842 but by degrees as its immense value became known other companies joined and it now embraces all the leading companies in the kingdom it is said to be not inferior to the war office colonial office and admiralty in regard to the amount of work it gets through in a year its accounts amount to some twelve millions sterling yet they always must and do balance to a fraction of a farthing  there must never be a surplus and never a deficiency in its funds for it can make no profits being simply a thoroughly honest and disinterested and perfectly correct gobetween which adjusts the mutual obligations of railways in a quick and economical manner  its accounts are balanced every month and every pound shilling and penny can be accounted for it annually receives and dispenses a revenue greater than that of many european kingdoms  in 1847 its gross receipts were only 793701 pounds in 1868 they had risen to above eleven millions  each line connected with the clearinghouse has a representative on the committee to look after its interests and bears its proportion of the expenses of the establishment  before showing the manner in which the work is performed for the railway companies it may be well to premise that one great good which the clearinghouse system does to the public is to enable them to travel everywhere with as much facility as if there were only one railway and one company in the kingdom  to avoid going too much into detail we may say briefly that in regard to goods statements of throughtraffic despatched are sent daily from thousands of stations to the clearinghouse also separate statements of throughtraffic received  these are compared  of those that are found to agree each company is debited or credited as the case may be with the proportion due to or by it  where discrepancies occur correspondence ensues until the thing is cleared up and then the distribution to the accounts of the several companies takes place  as discrepancies are numerous and constant correspondence is necessarily great  so minutely correct and particular are they at the clearinghouse that a shilling is sometimes divided between four companies  even a penny is deemed worthy of being debited to one company and credited to another  as it is with goods so is it with passengers  throughtickets are sent from all the stations to the clearinghouse where they are examined and compared with the returns of the tickets issued and then sent back to their respective companies  as these tickets amount to many thousands a day some idea may be formed of the amount of labour bestowed on the examination of them  the proportions of each ticket due to each company are then credited and statements of the same made out and forwarded to the several companies daily  from the two sets of returns forwarded to the clearinghouse statements of the debit and credit balances are made out weekly  parcels are treated much in the same way as the goods  mileage is a branch of the service which requires a separate staff of men  there are hundreds of thousands of waggons loaded and empty constantly running to and fro day and night on various lines to which they do not belong  each individual waggon must be traced and accounted for to the clearinghouse from its start to its arrival and back again and not only waggons but even the individual tarpaulins that cover them are watched and noted in this way in order that the various companies over whose lines they pass may get their due and that the companies owning them may get their demurrage if they be improperly detained on the way  for this purpose at every point where separate railways join there are stationed men in the pay of the clearinghouse whose duty it is to take the numbers of all passenger carriages and goods waggons and tarpaulins and make a daily statement of the same to the clearinghouse  as daily returns of all foreign carriages arriving and departing from all clearinghouse stations are forwarded to the same office they are thus in a position to check the traffic detect discrepancies and finally make the proper entries as to mileage and demurrage in the accounts of the respective companies  frequently the charge of onetenth of a penny per mile for a tarpaulin is divided among several companies in various proportions  for a waggon or carriage from edinburgh to london mileage and demurrage accounts are sent out by the clearinghouse to four companies  formerly before demurrage was introduced carriages were frequently detained on lines to which they did not belong for weeks and even months until sometimes they were lost sight of altogether  once a month the balances are struck and the various railways instead of having to pay enormous sums to each other obtain settlement by means of comparatively small balances  for example the london and northwestern railway sends its through passengers over the caledonian line  the mileage charged for its foreign carriages is three farthings per mile  small though that sum is it amounts at the end of a month perhaps to 5000 pounds  this little bill is sent to the clearinghouse by the caledonian against the london and northwestern  but during the same period the latter company has been running up a somewhat similar bill against the former company both accounts are sent in to the clearinghouse  they amount together to perhaps some fifteen or twenty thousand pounds yet when one is set off against the other a ten or twenty pound note may be all that is required to change hands in order to balance the accounts  the total mileage of lines under the jurisdiction of the clearinghouse and over which it exercises complete surveillance on every train that passes up or down night or day as far as regulating the various interests of the companies is concerned amounts to more than 14000 the times at the conclusion of a very interesting article on this subject saysour whole railway system would be as nothing without the clearinghouse which affords another illustration of the great truth that the british railway public is the best served railway public in the world and on the whole the least grateful  we hope and incline to believe that in the latter remark the great thunderer is wrong and that it is only a small narrowminded and ignorant section of the public which is ungrateful  disputed claims between railways are referred to the arbitration of the committee of the clearinghouse from whose decision there is no appeal  the trouble taken in connexion with the lostluggage department is very great written communications being sent to almost innumerable stations on various lines of rails for every inquiry that is made to the house after lostluggage  it is a striking commentary at once on the vast extent of traffic in the kingdom and the great value in one important direction of this establishment the fact that in one year the number of articles accounted for to the clearinghouse by stations as left by passengers either on the platforms or in carriages amounted to 156769 trunks bags and parcels and of these nearly ninetyfive in every hundred were restored through the clearinghouse to their owners  it is probable that the property thus restored would amount to half a million of money  this reminds us that we left edwin gurwood on his way to restore mrs tipps her lost ring and that therefore it is our duty to resume the thread of our story with of course a humble apology to the patient reader for having again given way to our irresistible tendency to digress    chapter twenty two  mrs tipps goes on a journey and meets a gentleman who with much assurance comments freely on insurance  on a particular holiday it was advertised that a great excursion train would start from the clatterby station at a certain hour  at the appointed time the long line of carriages was pushed up to the platform by our friend john marrot who was appointed that day to drive the train  bill remarked john to his mate itll be a biggish train  theres an uncommon lot o people on the platform  theyre pretty thick replied will garvie wiping his countenance with a piece of waste which while it removed the perspiration left behind a good deal of oil and streaked his nose with coaldust  but will was not particular  the excursionists were indeed unusually numerous  it chanced to be a fine day and the platform was densely crowded with human beings many of whom moved when movement was possible in groups showing that there were various sections that had a common aim and interest and meant to keep together as much as possible  there were men there who had evidently made up their minds to a thoroughly enjoyable day and women whose aspect was careworn but cheerful to whom a holiday was probably a memorable event in the year  of young people there was of course a considerable sprinkling and amongst the crowd could be seen a number of individuals whose amused expression of countenance and general aspect bespoke them ordinary travellers who meant to avail themselves of a cheap train  all classes and conditions of men women and children were hustling each other in a state of great excitement but the preponderating class was that which is familiarly though not very respectfully styled the masses  mrs marrot was there toomuch against her willand little gertie  a sister of the former who lived about twenty miles from clatterby had a short time before made her husband a present of a fine fat pugilistic boy and mrs m felt constrained to pay her a visit  john was on the lookout for his wife and child so was will garvie the former waved a piece of cottonwaste to her when she arrived she caught sight of him and gave him a cheerful nod in reply and an unexpressed blessing on his weatherbeaten face arose in her heart as garvie pushed through the crowd and conducted her and gertie to a carriage  timid little mrs tipps was also there  it is probable that no power on earth save that of physical force could have induced mrs tipps to enter an excursion train for which above all other sorts of trains she entertained a species of solemn horror  but the excitement consequent on the unexpected recovery of the diamond ring and the still more unexpected accession of wealth consequent thereon had induced her to smother her dislike to railways for a time and avail herself of their services in order to run down to a town about twenty miles off for the purpose of telling the good news to netta who chanced to be on a short visit to a friend there at the time  when mrs tipps reached the station her ignorance of railway matters and the confused mental state which was her normal condition prevented her from observing that the train was an excursion one  she therefore took out a firstclass ticket and also an insurance ticket for 500 pounds for which latter she paid sixpence  her ignorance and perturbation also prevented her from observing that this rate of insurance was considerably higher than she was accustomed to pay owing to the fact of the train being an excursion one  if she had been going by an ordinary train she could have insured 1000 pounds firstclass for 3 pence half that sum secondclass for 2 pence and 200 pounds thirdclass for the ridiculously small sum of one penny  good mrs tipps held the opinion so firmly that accident was the usual and all but inevitable accompaniment of railway travelling that she invariably insured her life when compelled to undertake a journey  it was of no avail that her son joseph pointed out to her that accidents were in reality few and far between and that they bore an excessively small proportion to the numbers of journeys undertaken annually mrs tipps was not to be moved  in regard to that subject she had to use one of her late husbands phrases nailed her colours to the mast and could not haul them down even though she would  she therefore when about to undertake a journey invariably took out an insurance ticket as we have saidand this solely with a views to nettas future benefit  we would not have it supposed that we object here to the principle of insuring against accident  on the contrary we consider that principle to be a wise one and in some cases one that becomes almost a duty  when mrs tipps discovered that mrs marrot and gertie were going by the same train she was so much delighted at the unlookedfor companionship that she at once entered the thirdclass where they sat and began to make herself comfortable beside them but presently recollecting that she had a firstclass ticket she started up and insisted on mrs marrot and gertie going firstclass along with her saying that she would pay the difference  mrs marrot remonstrated but mrs tipps strong in her natural liberality of spirit which had been rather wildly set free by her recent good fortune would not be denied  you must come with me mrs marrot she said  im so frightened in railways you have no idea what a relief it is to me to have any one near me whom i know  i will change your tickets let me have them quick we have no time to losetherenow wait till i return  oh  i forgot your insurance tickets  wy bless you maam we never insures  you never insure exclaimed mrs tipps in amazement and it only costs you threepence for one thousand pounds  well i dont know nothink as to that said mrs marrot  before she could finish the sentence mrs tipps was gone  she returned in breathless haste beckoned mrs marrot and gertie to follow her and was finally hurried with them into a firstclass carriage just as the train began to move  their only other companion in the carriage was a stout little old gentleman with a bright complexion speaking eyes and a countenance in which benevolence appeared to struggle with enthusiasm for the mastery he was obviously one of those men who delight in conversation and he quickly took an opportunity of engaging in it  observing that mrs tipps presented an insurance ticket to each of her companions he said  i am glad to see madam that you are so prudent as to insure the lives of your friends  i always insure my own life replied mrs tipps with a little smile and feel it incumbent on me at least to advise my friends to do the same  quite right quite right madam replied the enthusiastic little man applying his handkerchief to his bald pate with such energy that it shone like a billiard ball quite right madam  i only wish that the public at large were equally alive to the great value of insurance against accident  wy maam its a duty a positive duty here he addressed himself to mrs marrot to insure ones life against accident  oh la sir is it said mrs marrot quite earnestly  yes it is  why look herethis is your child  he laid his hand gently on gerties head  yes sir she is  well my good woman suppose that you are a widow and are killed mrs marrot looked as if she would rather not suppose anything of the sort what i ask what becomes of your childleft a beggar an absolute beggar  he looked quite triumphantly at mrs tipps and her companions and waited a few seconds as if to allow the idea to exert its full force on them  but sir observed mrs marrot meekly supposin that there do be an accident she shivered a little that ticket wont prevent me bein killed you know  no maam no but it will prevent your sweet daughter from being left a beggarthat is on the supposition that you are a widow  wich i aint sir im happy to say remarked mrs marrot but sir supposin we was both of us killed  she paused abruptly as if she had committed a sin in merely giving utterance to the idea  why then your other children would get the 500 poundsor your heirs whoever they may be  its a splendid system that of insurance against accident  just look at me now  he spread out his hands and displayed himself looking from one to the other as if he were holding up to admiration something rare and beautiful  just look at me  im off on a tour of three months through england scotland and ireland not for my health madam as you may seebut for scientific purposes well what do i do  i go to the railway passengers assurance companys office 64 cornhill london i like to be particular you see as becomes one who professes to be an amateur student of the exact sciences and i take out what they call a short term policy of insurance against accidents of all kinds for a thousand pounds1000 pounds observefor which i pay the paltry sum of 30 shillings1 pound 10 shillings  well what then  away i go leaving behind me with perfect indifference a wife and two little boys  remarkable little boys madam i assure you  perfect marvels of health and intelligence both of emtwo little boys madam which have not been equalled since cain and abel were born  every one says so with the exception of a few of the cynical and jaundiced among men and women and pray why am i so indifferent  just because they are provided for they have a moderately good income secured to them as it is and the 1000 pounds which i have insured on my life will render it a competence in the event of my being killed  it will add 50 pounds a year to their income which happens to be the turningpoint of comfort  and what of myself  why with a perfectly easy conscience i may go and do what i please  if i get drowned in loch katrinewhat matter  if i break my neck in the gap of dunloewhat matter  if i get lost and frozen on the steeps of ben nevis or goatfellwhat matter  if i am crushed to death in a railway accident or get entangled in machinery and am torn to atomsstill i say what matter 1000 pounds must at once be paid down to my widow and children and all because of the pitiful sum of 30 shillings  but suppose continued the enthusiastic man deepening his tone as he became more earnest suppose that i am not killed but only severely injured and mangled so as to be utterly unfit to attend to my worldly affairswhat then  mrs tipps shuddered to think of what then  why continued the enthusiastic gentleman i shall in that case be allowed from the company 6 pounds a week until recovered or in the event of my sinking under my injuries within three months after the accident the whole sum of 1000 pounds will be paid to my family  mrs tipps smiled and nodded her head approvingly but mrs marrot still looked dubious  but sir she said supposin you dont get either hurt or killed  why then replied the elderly gentleman im all right of course and only 50 shillings out of pocket which you must admit is but a trifling addition to the expenses of a three months tour  besides have i not had three months of an easy mind and of utter regardlessness as to my life and limbs  have not my wife and boys had three months of easy minds and indifference to my life and limbs also  is not all that cheaply purchased at 30 shillings while the sum itself i have the satisfaction of knowing goes to increase the funds of that excellent company which enables you and me and thousands of others to become so easyminded and reckless and which at the same time pays its fortunate shareholders a handsome dividend  really sir said mrs tipps laughing you talk so enthusiastically of this insurance company that i almost suspect you to be a director of it  madam replied the elderly gentleman with some severity if i were a director of it which i grieve to say i am not i should only be doing my simple duty to it and to you in thus urging it on your attention but i am altogether uninterested in it except as a philanthropist  i see and feel that it does good to myself and to my fellowmen therefore i wish my fellowmen to appreciate it more highly than they do for it not only insures against accident by railway but against all kinds of accidents while its arrangements are made to suit the convenience of the public in every possible way  why madam he continued kindling up again and polishing his head violently only think for the small sum of 4 pounds paid annually it insures that you shall have paid to your family if you chance to be killed the sum of 1000 pounds or if not killed 6 pounds a week while you are totally laid up and 1 pound 10 shillings a week while you are only partially disabled  and yet would you believe it many persons who see the value of this and begin the wise course of insurance go on for only a few years and then foolishly give it updisappointed i presume that no accident has happened to them  see here is one of their pamphlets  he pulled a paper out of his pocket energetically and put on a pair of gold spectacles through which he looked when consulting the pamphlet and over which he glanced when observing the effect of what he read on mrs tipps  what do i findeh hayeshere it isa cornish auctioneer pushed back a window shutterthese are the very words madamwhat more he did to that shutter or what it did to him is not told but he must have come by some damage because he received 55 pounds  a london clerk got his eye injured by a hairpin in his daughters hairhow suggestive that is madam what a picture it calls up of a wearied toilworn man fondling his child of an eveningpressing his cheek to her fair head and what a commentary it is he became very stern here on the use of such barbarous implements as hairpins  i am not punning madam i am much too serious to pun i should have used the word savage instead of barbarous  now what was the result  this company gave that clerk compensation to the extent of 26 pounds  again a medical practitioner fell through the floor of a room  it must have been a bad as it certainly was a strange fallprobably he was heavy and the floor decayedat all events that fall procured him 120 pounds  a cardiff agent was bathing his feetwhy we are not told but imagination is not slow to comprehend the reason when the severity of our climate is taken into account he broke the footpana much less comprehensible thingand the breaking of that footpan did him damage for which he was compensated with 52 pounds 16 shillings  again a merchant of birkenhead was paid 20 pounds for playing with his children  dear me sir exclaimed mrs marrot in surprise surely  of course my good woman said the elderly gentleman you are to understand that he came by some damage while doing so but i give you the exact words of the pamphlet  it were desirable that a little more information had been given just to gratify our curiosity  now these that i have read are under the head of accidents at home  under other heads we find a farmer suffocated by the falling in of a sandpit for which his representatives received 1000 pounds  another thousand is paid to the heirs of a poor dyer who fell into a vat of boiling liquor while in regard to smaller matters a warehouseman whose finger caught in the cogwheel of a crane received 30 pounds  and again here is 1000 pounds to a gentleman killed in a railway accident and 100 pounds to a poor woman  the latter had insured for a single trip in an excursion train at a charge of twopence while the former had a policy of insurance extending over a considerable period for which he probably paid twenty or thirty shillings  these are but samples madam of the good service rendered to sorrowing humanity by this assurance company which you must observe makes no pretensions to philanthropic aims but is based simply on business principles  and i find that the total amount of compensation paid in this manner daring one year by this company amounts to about 72000 pounds  as mrs marrot yawned at this point and mrs tipps appeared somewhat mystified the enthusiastic gentleman smiled put away his pamphlet and wisely changed the subject  he commented on the extreme beauty of the weather and how fortunate this state of things was for the people who went to the country for a days enjoyment  thus pleasantly he whiled away the time and ingratiated himself with gertie until they arrived at the station where mrs tipps and mrs marrot had to get out and where many of the excursionists got out along with them  while the former went their several ways arranging to meet in the evening and return together by the same train the latter scattered themselves over the neighbouring common and green fields and sitting down under the hedgerows among the wildflowers picnicked in the sunshine or wandered about the lanes enjoying the song of birds and scent of flowers and wishing perchance that their lot had been cast among the green pastures of the country rather than amid the din and smoke and turmoil of the town    chapter twenty three  details a terrible accident  in due time that holiday came to a close and the excursionists returned to the station where their train awaited them  among the rest came mrs tipps and mrs marrot but they did not arrive together and therefore much to their annoyance failed to get into the same carriage  the weather which up to that time had kept fine began to lower and just as the train started a smart thundershower fell but being under cover the holidaymakers heeded it not  upon the whole they were an orderly band of excursionists  some of the separate groups were teetotallers and only one or two showed symptoms of having sought to increase their hilarity by the use of stimulants  when the shower began john marrot and his mate put on their pilotcloth coats for the screen that formed their only protection from the weather was a thin flat one without roof or sides forming only a partial protection from wind and rain  night had begun to descend before the train left the station and as the lowering clouds overspread the sky the gloom rapidly increased until it became quite dark  we are going to have a bad night of it observed john marrot as his mate examined the watergauge  looks like it was garvies curt reply  the clatter of the engine and howling of the wind which had by that time risen to a gale rendered conversation difficult the two men therefore confined themselves to the few occasional words that were requisite for the proper discharge of their duties  it was not a night on which the thoughts of an enginedriver were likely to wander much to drive an excursion train in a dark night through a populous country over a line which was crowded with traffic while the rain beat violently on the little round windows in the screen obscuring them and rendering it difficult to keep a good lookout was extremely anxious work which claimed the closest and most undivided attention nevertheless the thoughts of john marrot did wander a little that night to the carriage behind him in which were his wife and child but this wandering of thought caused him to redouble rather than to relax his vigilance and caution  will garvie consulted the watergauge for a moment and then opened the iron door of the furnace in order to throw in more coal  the effect would have stirred the heart of rembrandt  the instantaneous blinding glare of the intense fire shot through the surrounding darkness lighting up the two men and the tender as if all were made of redhot metal flooding the smoke and steamclouds overhead with round masses and curling lines of more subdued light and sending sharp gleams through the murky atmosphere into dark space beyond where the ghostly landscape appeared to rush wildly by  now it chanced that at the part of the line they had reached a mineral train which preceded them had been thrown off the rails by a bale of goods which had fallen from a previous goods train  carelessness on the part of those who had loaded the truck from which the bale had fallen led to this accident  the driver and fireman of the mineral train were rather severely hurt and the guard was much shaken as well as excited so that they neglected to take the proper precaution of sending back one of their number to stop the train that followed them  this would have been a matter of little consequence had the line been worked on the block system because in that case the dangersignal would have been kept up and would have prevented the excursion train from entering on that portion of the line until it was signalled clear but the block system had been only partially introduced on the line  a sufficient interval of time had been allowed after the mineral train had passed the last station and then as we have seen the excursion train was permitted to proceed  thus it came to pass that at a part of the line where there was a slight curve and a deep cutting john marrot looking anxiously through his circular window saw the red taillight of the mineral train  instantly he cried clap on the brakes bill  almost at the same moment he reversed the engine and opened the whistle to alarm the guard who applied his brakes in violent haste  but it was too late  the speed could not be checked in time  the rails were slippery owing to rain  almost at full speed they dashed into the mineral train with a noise like thunder  the result was appalling  the engine was smashed and twisted in a manner that is quite indescribable and the tender was turned completely over while the driver and fireman were shot as if from a cannons mouth high into the air  the first two carriages of the passengertrain and the last van of the mineral were completely wrecked and over these the remaining carriages of the passengertrain were piled until they reached an incredible height  the guards van was raised high in the air with its ends resting on a thirdclass carriage which at one end was completely smashed in by the van  at the time of the concussionjust after the terrible crashthere was a brief strange unearthly silence  all was still for a few seconds and passengers who were uninjured gazed at each other in mute and horrified amazement  but death in that moment had passed upon many while others were fearfully mangled  the silence was almost immediately broken by the cries and groans of the wounded  some had been forcibly thrown out of the carriages others had their legs and arms broken and some were jammed into fixed positions from which death alone relieved them  the scenes that followed were heartrending  those who were uninjured or only slightly hurt lent willing aid to extricate their less fortunate fellowtravellers but the howling of the wind the deluging rain and the darkness of the night retarded their efforts and in many cases rendered them unavailing  john marrot who as we have said was shot high into the air fell by good fortune into a large bush  he was stunned at first but otherwise uninjured  on regaining consciousness the first thoughts that flashed across him were his wife and child  rising in haste he made his way towards the engine which was conspicuous not only by its own fire but by reason of several other fires which had been kindled in various places to throw light on the scene  in the wreck and confusion it was difficult to find out the carriage in which mrs marrot had travelled and the people about were too much excited to give very coherent answers to questions  john therefore made his way to a knot of people who appeared to be tearing up the debris at a particular spot  he found joe turner the guard there with his head bandaged and his face covered with blood  ive bin lookin for ee everywhere john said joe  shes there he added pointing to a mass of broken timbers which belonged to a carriage on the top of which the guards van had been thrown crushing it almost flat  john did not require to ask the meaning of his words  the guards look was sufficiently significant  he said not a word but the deadly pallor of his countenance showed how much he felt  springing at once on the broken carriage and seizing an axe from the hand of a man who appeared exhausted by his efforts he began to cut through the planking so as to get at the interior  at intervals a halfstifled voice was heard crying piteously for john  keep up heart lass said john in his deep strong voice  ill get thee out before longgod helping me  those who stood by lent their best aid but anxious though they were about the fate of those who lay buried beneath that pile of rubbish they could not help casting an occasional look of wonder amounting almost to awe on the tall form of the enginedriver as he cut through and tore up the planks and beams with a power that seemed little short of miraculous  presently he stopped and listened intently for a moment while the perspiration rolled in big drops from his brow  dost hear me mary he asked in a deeply anxious tone  if any reply were uttered it was drowned by the howling of the wind and the noise of the workmen  again he repeated the question in an agonising cry  his wife did not reply but gerties sweet little voice was heard saying faintly  i think mother is dead  oh take us out dear father take us out quick  again john marrot bowed himself to the task and exerting his colossal strength to the utmost continued to tear up and cast aside the broken planks and beams  the people around him now thoroughly aroused to the importance of haste worked with all their might and ere long they reached the floor of the carriage where they found mother and child jammed into a corner and arched over by a huge mass of broken timber  it was this mass that saved them for the rest of the carriage had been literally crushed into splinters  close beside them was discovered the headless trunk of a young man and the dead body of a girl who had been his companion that day  gertie was the first taken out  her tender little frame seemed to have yielded to the pressure and thus escaped for excepting a scratch or two she was uninjured  john marrot did not pause to indulge in any expression of feeling  he sternly handed her to the bystanders and went on powerfully but carefully removing the broken timbers and planks until he succeeded in releasing his wife  then he raised her in his arms staggered with her to the neighbouring bank and laid her down  poor mrs marrot was crushed and bruised terribly  her clothes were torn and her face was so covered with blood and dust as to be quite unrecognisable at first  john said not a word but went down on his knees and began carefully to wipe away the blood from her features in which act he was assisted by the drenching rain  sad though his case was there was no one left to help him  the cries of the unfortunate sufferers still unextricated drew every one else away the moment the poor woman had been released  ere long the whole scene of the catastrophe was brilliantly illuminated by the numerous fires which were kindled out of the debris to serve as torches to those who laboured might and main for the deliverance of the injured  troops of people from the surrounding district quickly made their appearance on the scene and while some of these lent effective aid in the work of rescue others brought blankets water and spirits to cover and comfort those who stood so much in need of help as the wounded were got out and laid upon the banks of the line several surgeons busied themselves in examining and binding their wounds and the spot bore some resemblance to a battlefield after the tide of war had passed over it  seventeen dead and one hundred and fifty injured already lay upon the wet ground while many of the living who went about with blanched solemn faces yet with earnest helpful energy were bruised and cut badly enough to have warranted their retiring from the spot and having their own cases considered meanwhile a telegram had been sent to clatterby and in a short time a special train arrived with several of the chief men of the line and a gang of a hundred surfacemen to clear away the wreck and remove the dead and injured  many of those unhurt had made singularly narrow escapes  one man was seated in a thirdclass carriage when the concussion took place  the side of the carriage fell out and he slid down on the rails just as the other carriages and vans piled up on the place he had left killing or wounding all his fellowtravellers  beneath the rubbish next the tender a mother and child were buried and several others  all were dead save the mother and child when the men began to dig them out and before they succeeded in their labours the mother had died also but the child survived  in another carriage or rather under it a lad was seen lying with a womans head crushed down on his breast and an infant beside her  they had to saw the carriage asunder before these could be extricated  the woman died almost immediately on being released but the lad and infant were uninjured  elsewhere a young girl who had attracted attention by the sweet expression of her face had been strangled and her face rendered perfectly black  in another case the surfacemen attempted to extricate a woman by sawing the broken carriage under which she lay but the more they sawed the more did the splinters appear to cling round her and when at last they got her out she was dead while another passenger in the same carnage escaped without a scratch  we would not prolong a painful description which may perhaps be thought too long alreadyyet within certain limits it is right that men should know what their fellows suffer  after all the passengers had been removed to the special trainthe dead into vans and horseboxes and the living into carriagesthe surfacemen set to work to clear the line  poor mrs tipps was among the rescued and along with the others was sent on to the clatterby station by the special train  while the people were being placed in this train john marrot observed edwin gurwood in the crowd  he chanced to be at clatterby when the telegram of the accident arrived and ran down in the special train to render assistance  im glad to see you sir he said in a low earnest voice  my mate bill garvie must be badly hurt for hes nowhere to be found  he must be under the wreck somewheres  i wouldnt leave the spot till i found him in ornary circumstances but my mary  he stopped abruptly  i hope mrs marrot is not hurt said edwin anxiously  john could not reply at first  he shook his head and pointed to a carriage near at hand  shes there sir with gertie  gertie exclaimed edwin  ay poor thing gertie is all right thank the good lord for that but  again he stopped then with an effort continued  i couldnt quit them you know till ive got em safe home  but my mind will be easy mr gurwood if youll look after bill  we was both throwd a good way from the ingine but i couldnt rightly say where youll not refuse  my dear marrot said edwin interrupting him and grasping his hand you may rely on me  i shall not leave the ground until he is found and cared for  thank ee sir thank ee said john in something of his wonted hearty tone as he returned edwins squeeze of the hand and hastened to the train which was just ready to start  edwin went at once to the spot where the surfacemen were toiling at the wreck in the fitful light of the fires which flared wildly in the storm and as they had by that time gathered intense heat bid defiance to the rain  there were several passengers who had just been extricated lying on the ground some motionless as if dead others talking incoherently  these he looked at in passing but garvie was not among them  leaving them under the care of the surgeons who did all that was possible in the circumstances for their relief he ran and joined the surfacemen in removing the broken timbers of a carriage from beneath which groans were heard  with some difficulty a woman was extricated and laid tenderly on the bank  just then edwin observed a guard with whom he was acquainted and asked him if the fireman had yet been found  not yet sir i believe said the man  they say that he and the driver were flung to one side of the line  edwin went towards the engine and judging the probable direction and distance to which a man might be thrown in such an accident went to a certain spot and sought carefully around it in all directions  for some time he sought in vain and was on the point of giving up in despair when he observed a cap lying on the ground  going up to it he saw the form of a man halfconcealed by a mass of rubbish  he stooped and raising the head a little tried to make out the features but the light of the fires did not penetrate to the spot  he laid him gently down again and was about to hasten away for assistance when the man groaned and said faintly is that you jack  no my poor fellow said edwin stooping down  are you badly hurt i am just going to fetch help to  mr gurwood said the man interrupting you dont seem to know me im garvie the fireman  where am i  surely there is something wrong with my left arm  oh  i remember now  is jack safe  and the missis and gertie  are they  dont exert yourself interrupted edwin as will attempted to rise you must keep quiet until i fetch a doctor  perhaps youre not much hurt but it is well to be careful  will you promise me to be still  all right sir said will promptly  edwin hastened for assistance and in a short time the fireman was carried to a place of comparative shelter and his wounds examined  almost immediately after the examination edwin knelt at his side and signed to those around him to retire  garvie he said in a low kind voice im sorry to tell you that the doctors say you must lose your left arm  will looked intently in edwins face  is there no chance of savin it he asked earnestly it might never be much to speak of sir but id rather run some risk than lose it  edwin shook his head  no he said sadly they tell me amputation must be immediate else your life may be sacrificed  i said i would like to break it to you but it is necessary my poor fellow that you should make up your mind at once  gods will be done said will in a low voice im ready sir  the circumstances did not admit of delay  in a few minutes the firemans left arm was amputated above the elbow the stump dressed and himself laid in as sheltered a position as possible to await the return of the train that was to convey the dead and wounded more recently extricated to clatterby  when that train arrived at the station it was touching to witness the pale anxious faces that crowded the platform as the doors were opened and the dead and sufferers carried out and to hear the cries of agony when the dead were recognised and the cries of grief strangely almost unnaturally mingled with joy when some who were supposed to have been killed were carried out alive  some were seen almost fondling the dead with a mixture of tender love and abject despair  others bent over them with a strange stare of apparent insensibility or looked round on the pitying bystanders inquiringly as if they would say surely surely this cannot be true  the sensibilities of some were stunned so that they moved calmly about and gave directions in a quiet solemn voice as if the great agony of grief were long past though it was painfully evident that it had not yet begun because the truth had not yet been realised  among those who were calm and collected though heartstricken and deadly pale was loo marrot  she had been sent to the station by her father to await the arrival of the train with orders to bring will garvie home  when will was carried out and laid on the platform alive an irresistible gush of feeling overpowered her  she did not give way to noisy demonstration as too many did but knelt hastily down raised his head on her knee and kissed his face passionately  bless you my darling said will in a low thrilling voice in which intense feeling struggled with the desire to make light of his misfortune god has sent a cordial that the doctors havent got to give  o william exclaimed loo removing the hair from his foreheadbut loo could say no more  tell me darling said garvie in an anxious tone is father safe and mother and gertie  father is safe thank god replied loo with a choking voice and gertie also but mother  she is not dead exclaimed the fireman  no not dead but very very much hurt  the doctors fear she may not survive it will  no more was said for at that moment four porters came up with a stretcher and placed garvie gently upon it  loo covered him with her shawl a piece of tarpaulin was thrown over all and thus he was slowly borne away to john marrots home    chapter twenty four  results of the accident  years passed awayas years inevitably mustand many important changes took place in the circumstances and the management of the grand national trunk railway but the results of that terrible accident did not quickly pass away  as we have said it cost will garvie an arm and nearly cost mrs marrot her life  we have much pleasure however in recording that it did not make the full charge in this matter  a small a very small modicum of life was left in that estimable woman and on the strength of that with her wonted vigour of character and invincibility of purpose she set to work to draw out as it were a new lease of life  she succeeded to admiration so much so in fact that but for one or two scars on her countenance no one could have known that she had come by an accident at all  bob marrot was wont to say of her in after years that if it had bin his mother who had lost an arm instead of will garvie he was convinced that her firmness amountin amost to obstinacy of purpose would have enabled her to grow on a noo arm as good as the old un if not better  we need scarcely add that bob was an irreverent scamp  poor will garvie his was a sad loss yet strange to say he rejoiced over it  wy you see he used to say to bob marrotbob and he being great and confidential friendsyou see bob if it hadnt bin for that accident i never would have bin laid up and brought so lowso very nigh to the graveand i would never have knowd what it was to be nursed by your sister too and so my eyes might have never bin opened to half her goodness an tenderness dye see  no bob i dont grudge havin had my eyes opened by the loss of an arm it was done cheap at the price  of course i know loo pretty well by this time for a few years of married life is apt to clear a good deal of dust out of ones eyes but i do assure you bob that i never could have knowd her properly but for that accident which was the luckiest thing that ever happened to me an then dont ee see im just as able to work these there points with one arm as with two  to which bob would replyyoure a queer fish bill howsever every mans got a right to his own opinions  will garvie was a pointsman now  on recovering from his prolonged illness during which he had been supported out of the provident fund of the railwayto which he and all the other men on the line contributed he was put to light work at first at the station of clatterby  by degrees his strength returned and he displayed so much intelligence and such calmness of nerve and coolness of courage that he was made a pointsman at the station and had a sentrybox sort of erection with windows all round it apportioned to his daily use  there he was continually employed in shifting the points for the shunting of trains none of which dared to move despite their mighty power and impatience until will garvie gave them leave  to john marrot the accident although not severe at first had proved more damaging in the longrun  no bones had been broken or limbs lost but john had received a shake so bad that he did not resume his duties with the same vigour as heretofore  he continued to stick to his post however for several years and before giving it up had the pleasure of training his son bob in the situation which garvie had been obliged to resign  bobs heart you see had been all along set on driving the lightning he therefore gladly left the works when old enoughand when the opportunity offeredto fill the preliminary post of fireman  during this period edwin gurwood rose to a responsible and sufficiently lucrative situation in the clearinghouse  at the same time he employed much of his leisure in cultivating the art of painting of which he was passionately fond  at first he painted for pleasure but he soon found on exhibiting one or two of his works that picturedealers were willing to purchase from him  he therefore began to paint for profit and succeeded so well that he began to save and lay by money with a view to that wife with the nutbrown hair and the large lustrous eyes who haunted his dreams by night and became his guidingstar by day  seeing him thus wholly immersed in the acquisition of money and not knowing his motive his faithful little friend joe tipps one day amazed and halfoffended him by reminding him that he had a soul to be cared for as well as a body  the arrow was tenderly shot and with a trembling hand but joe prayed that it might be sent home and it was from that date edwin could not rest  he reviewed his life  he reflected that everything he possessed or hoped for came to him or was to come from god yet as far as he could make out he saw no evidence of the existence of religion in himself save in the one fact that he went regularly to church on sundays  he resolved to turn over a new leaf  triedand failed  he was perplexed for he had tried honestly  tipps he said one day you are the only man i ever could make a confidant of  to say truth im not given to being very communicative as to personal matters at any time but i must tell you that the remark you made about my soul the other day has stuck to me and i have tried to lead a christian life but without much success  perhaps said tipps timidly it is because you have not yet become a christian  my dear fellow exclaimed edwin is not leading a christian life becoming a christian  dont you think said tipps in an apologetic tone that leading a christian life is rather the result of having become a christian  it seems to me that you have been taking the plan of putting yourself and your doings first and our saviour last  we need not prolong a conversation referring to the old old story which ran very much in the usual groove  suffice it to say that edwin at last carefully consulted the bible as to the plan of redemption and in believing found that rest of spirit which he had failed to work out thenceforward he had a higher motive for labouring at his daily toil yet the old motive did not lose but rather gained in power by the changewhereby he realised the truth that godliness is profitable for the life that now is as well as that which is to come  at last the painting became so successful that edwin resolved to trust to it alonesaid goodbye to the clearinghouse with regretfor he left many a pleasant companion and several intimate friends behind him and went to clatterby in the suburbs of which he took and furnished a small villa  then it was that he came to the conclusion that the time had arrived to make a pointed appeal to the nutbrown hair and lustrous eyes  he went off and called at captain lees house accordingly  the captain was outmiss lee was at home  edwin entered the house but he left all his native courage and selfpossession on the doorstep outside  being ushered into the drawingroom he found emma reading  from that momentto his own surprise and according to his own statementhe became an ass  the metamorphosis was complete  ovid had he been alive would have rejoiced in it  he blushed more than a poor boy caught in his first grievous offence  the very straightforwardness of his character helped to make him worse  he felt in all its importance the momentous character of the step he was about to take and he felt in all its strength the love with which his heart was full and the inestimable value of the prize at which he aimed  no wonder that he was overwhelmed  the reader will observe that we have not attempted to dilate in this book on the value of that prize  emma like many other good people is only incidental to our subject  we have been obliged to leave her to the readers imagination  after all what better could we have done imagination is more powerful in this matter than description  neither one nor other could we felt approach the reality therefore imagination was best  emma he said sitting down on the sofa beside her and seizing her hand in both of his  mr gurwood she exclaimed in some alarm  beginning from the mere force of habit some halfdelirious reference to the weather edwin suddenly stopped passed his fingers wildly through his hair and again said with deep earnestnessemma  emma looked down blushed and said nothing  emma he said again my good angel my guidingstarby night and by dayfor years i have  at that moment captain lee entered the room  edwin leaped up and stood erect  emma buried her face in the sofa cushions  edwinmr gurwood exclaimed captain lee  this was the beginning of a conversation which terminated eventually in the transference of the nutbrown hair and lustrous eyes to the artists villa in clatterby  as there was a good garden round the villa and the wife with nutbrown hair was uncommonly fond of flowers edwin looked out for a gardener  it was at this identical time that john marrot resolved to resign his situation as enginedriver on the grand national trunk railway  edwin knowing that he had imbibed a considerable amount of knowledge of gardening from loo at once offered to employ him as his gardener john gladly closed with the offer and thus it came about that he and his wife removed to the villa and left their old railwayridden cottage in possession of will and looor to be more correct mr and mrs garvie and all the young garvies  but what of timid mrs tipps  the great accident did little for her beyond shaking her nervous system and confirming her in the belief that railways were unutterably detestable that she was not quite sure whether or not they were sinful that come what might she never would enter one again and that she felt convinced she had been born a hundred years too late in which latter opinion most of her friends agreed with her although they were glad considering her loveable disposition that the mistake had occurred  netta did not take quite such an extreme view and joseph laughed at and quizzed them both in an amiable sort of fashion on their views  among all the sufferers by that accident few suffered so severelywith the exception of course of those who lost their livesas the grand national trunk railway itself  in the course of the trials that followed it was clearly shown that the company had run the train much more with the view of gratifying the public than of enriching their coffers from the fact that the utmost possible sum which they could hope to draw by it was 17 pounds for which sum they had carried 600 passengers upwards of twenty miles  the accident took place in consequence of circumstances over which the company had no control and the results werethat twenty persons were killed and about two hundred wounded that one hundred and sixty claims were made for compensation one hundred and forty of which being deemed exorbitant or fraudulent were defended in court and that eventually the company had to pay from seventy to eighty thousand pounds out of which the highest sum paid to one individual was 6750 pounds  the risks that are thus run by railway companies will be seen to be excessive especially when it is considered that excursion trains afford but slight remuneration while many of them convey enormous numbers of passengers  on the occasion of the first excursion from oxford to london in 1851 fiftytwo of the broadgauge carriages of the great western were employed and the excursionists numbered upwards of three thousand five hundreda very town on wheels  truly the risks of railway companies are great and their punishments severe    chapter twenty five  the last  a certain christmasday approached  on the morning of the day preceding will garvielooking as broad and sturdy as ever a perfect man but for the empty sleevestood at his post near his sentrybox his duties that day were severe  at that season of the year there is a great increase of traffic on all railways and you may be sure that the grand national trunk railway had its full share  on ordinary occasions about three hundred trains passed will garvies box out and in during the twelve hours but that day there had been nearly double the number of passengers and a considerable increase in the number of trains that conveyed them while goods trains had also increased greatly in bulk and in numbers  garvies box abutted on a bridge and stood in the very midst of a labyrinth of intricate crossing lines over which trains and pilotengines were constantly rushing and hissing backing and whistling viciously and in the midst of which will moved at the continual risk of his life as cool as a cucumber so bob garvie expressed it and as safe as the bank  although thus situated in the midst of smoke noise dust iron and steam will garvie managed to indulge his love for flowers  he had a garden on the linebetween the very rails  it was not large to be sure only about six feet by twobut it was large enough for his limited desires  the garden was in a wooden trough in front of his sentrybox  it contained mignonette roses and heartsease among other things and every time that will passed out of or into his box in performing the duties connected with the station he took a look at the flowers and thought of loo and the innumerable boys girls and babies at home  we need not say that this garden was beautifully kept whatever will did he did wellprobably because he tended well the garden of his own soul  while he was standing outside his box during one of the brief intervals between trains an extremely beautiful girl came on the platform and called across the rails to him  hallo  gertiewhat brings you here he asked with a look of glad surprise  to see you replied gertie with a smile that was nothing short of bewitching  how i wish you were a flower that i might plant you in my garden said the gallant william as he crossed the rails and reached up to shake gerties hand  what a greedy man you are said gertie  isnt loo enough for you  quite enough replied will i might almost say more than enough at times but come lass this aint the place for a palaver  you came to speak with me as well as to see me no doubt  yes will i came with a message from mrs tipps  you know that the railway men are going to present father with a testimonial tonight well mrs tipps thinks that her drawingroom wont be large enough so she sent me to ask you to let the men know that it is to be presented in the schoolroom where the volunteer rifle band is to perform and make a sort of concert of it  indeed said will  yes and mrs tipps says that captain lee is going to give them what she calls a cold collation and brother bob calls a blowout  you dont say so exclaimed will  yes i do wont it be delightful said gertie  splendid replied will ill be sure to be up in good time  but i say gertie is young dorkin to be there  gertie blushed but was spared the necessity of a reply in consequence of a deafening whistle which called will garvie to his points  next moment a passengertrain intervened and cut her off from further communication  according to promise will was at the schoolroom in good time that evening with some thirty or forty of his comrades  loo was there too blooming and matronly with a troop of boys and girls who seemed to constitute themselves a bodyguard round john marrot and his wife who were both ignorant at that time of the honour that was about to be done them  john was as grave sturdy and amiable as ever the only alteration in his appearance being the increased number of silver locks that mingled with his black hair  time had done little to mrs marrot beyond increasing her bulk and the rosiness of her countenance  it would be tedious to comment on all our old friends who assembled in the schoolroom on that memorable occasion  we can only mention the names of captain lee alias samuel tough and mr abel and mrs tipps and dr noble and mr sharp and david blunt and joe turner and mrs durby with all of whom time seemed to have dealt as leniently as with john marrot and his wife  sam natly was also there with his invalid wife restored to robust health and supported on either side by a blooming boy and girl  and edwin gurwood was there with his wife and son and three daughters and so was joseph tipps looking as if the world prospered with him as indeed was the case  and of course netta tipps was there and the young curate who by the way was much stouter and not nearly so stiff as when we first met him  he was particularly attentive to netta and called her my dear in a cool freeandeasy way that would not have been tolerated for a moment but for the fact that they had been married for the last three months  bob marrot was there alsoas strapping a young blade as one could wish to see with a modest yet fearless look in his eye that was quite in keeping with his occupation as driver of the flying dutchman  there was there also a tall slim goodlooking youth who seemed to be on very intimate terms with bob marrot  he was wellknown as one of the most rising men at the clatterby works who bade fair to become an overseer ere long  bob called him tomtit but the men of the line styled him mister dorkin  he had brought with him an extremely wrinkled driedup old woman who appeared to have suffered much and to have been dragged out of the lowest depths of poverty  to judge from appearances she had been placed in a position of great comfort  such was in truth the case and the fine young fellow who had dragged her out and up was that same mister dorkin who may be said to have been all but stoneblind that evening because from first to last he saw but one individual there and that individual was gertie  he was almost deaf too because he heard only one voiceand that voice was gerties  and nanny stocks was there with the baby but not the baby marrot that babynow a stout wellgrown ladwas seated beside his mother paying her all sorts of delicate attentions such as picking up her handkerchief when she dropped it pushing her bonnet on her head when in her agitation it fell back on her neck and beating her firmly on the back when she choked as she frequently did that evening from sheer delight  no doubt in this last operation he felt that he was paying off old scores for many a severe beating on the back had mrs marrot given him in the stormy days of his babyhood  the baby of whom nanny stocks was now the guardian was baby gurwood and a strong resemblance it bore to the old baby in the matters of health strength fatness and selfwill  miss stocks was one of those human evergreens which years appear to make no impression on at all  from her shoelatchet to her topmost hairpin she was unalterably the same as she had been in days gone by  she treated the new baby too as she had treated the oldchoked it with sweetmeats and kisses and acted the part of buffer to its feet and fists  it would take a volume to give the full details of all that was said and done and played and sung on that christmaseve  we can only touch on these things  the brass band of the volunteers surpassed itself  the songsvolunteered or called forwere as good as songs usually are on festive occasions a few of them being firstrate especially one which was sung by a huge enginedriver with shoulders about a yard broad and a beard like the inverted shako of a guardsman  it ran thus  song of the enginedriver    ohdown by the river and close by the lake   we skim like the swallow and cut though the brake   over the mountain and round by the lea   though the black tunnel and down to the sea   clatter and bang by the wild riven shore   we mingle our shriek with the oceans roar   we strain and we struggle we rush and we fly   were a terrible pair my steed and i    choruswhistle and puff the whole day round   over the hills and underground   rattling fast and rattling free   oh a life on the line is the life for me    with our hearts ablazing in every chink   with coals for food and water to drink   we plunge up the mountain and traverse the moor   and startle the grouse in our daily tour   we yell at the deer in their lonely glen   shoot past the village and circle the ben   we flash through the city on viaducts high   as straight as an arrow my steed and i    choruswhistle and puff etcetera    the norseman of old when quaffing his mead   delighted to boast of his ocean steed   the british tar in his foaming beer   drinks to his ship as his mistress dear   the warhorse good is the troopers theme   but what are all these to the horse of steam   such a riotous rollicking roadster is he   ohthe iron horse is the steed for me    choruswhistle and puff etcetera  the collation also or according to bob marrot the blowout was superb  joseph tipps declared it to be eminently satisfactory and the men of the line evidently held the same opinion if we may judge from the fact that they consumed it all and left not a scrap behind  the speeches also were excellent  of course the great one of the evening was the best being delivered by mr abel who not unnaturally made a remarkably able oration  when that gentleman rose with a beautiful silver model of a locomotive in his hand which he had been deputed by the men of the line to present as a mark of their regard admiration and esteem to john marrot he took the worthy exenginedriver very much by surprise and caused mrs marrot to be seized with such a fit of choking that the baby not the new one but the old found it as hard work to beat her out of it as she had formerly found it to beat him out of a fit of wickedness when she had been restored mr abel launched off into a glowing oration in the course of which he referred to john marrots long services to his faithful and unwearied attention to his arduous duties and to the numerous instances wherein he had shown personal courage and daring amounting almost to heroism in saving the lives of comrades in danger and in preventing accidents on the line by coolness and presence of mind  in conclusion said mr abel winding up let me remark that the gift which is now presented might have been of a more useful character but could not have been more appropriate because the wish of those who desire to testify their regard for you this evening mr marrot is not to give you an intrinsically valuable or useful present but to present you with a characteristic ornament which may grace your dwelling while you live and descend after you are gone to your childrens children here he glanced at loo and her troop to bear witness to them that you nobly did your duty in driving that great iron horse whereof this little silver pony is a model and a memorial  to perform ones duty well in this life is the highest ambition that any man can have in regard to temporal things  nelson our greatest naval hero aimed at it and on the glorious day of trafalgar signalled that england expected every man to do it  wellington our greatest soldier made duty his guidingstar  the effectual and earnest performance of duty stamps with a nobility which is not confined to great mena nobility which kings can neither give nor take awaya nobility which is very very difficult to attain unto but which is open alike to the prince and the peasant and must be wrought hard for and wonor lost with shamefor as the poet happily puts it    honour and shame from no condition rise   act well your partthere all the honour lies  for myself i can only say that john marrot has won this nobility and i couple his name with a sentiment with which all here i doubt not will heartily sympathiseprosperity to the men of the line and success to the iron horse  reader we can do no better than echo that sentiment and wish you a kind farewell  the end
