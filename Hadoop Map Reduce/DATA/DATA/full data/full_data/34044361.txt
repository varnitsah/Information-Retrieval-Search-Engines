34044361	washington square  by henry james     chapter i    during a portion of the first half of the present century and more particularly during the latter part of it there flourished and practised in the city of new york a physician who enjoyed perhaps an exceptional share of the consideration which in the united states has always been bestowed upon distinguished members of the medical profession  this profession in america has constantly been held in honour and more successfully than elsewhere has put forward a claim to the epithet of liberal  in a country in which to play a social part you must either earn your income or make believe that you earn it the healing art has appeared in a high degree to combine two recognised sources of credit  it belongs to the realm of the practical which in the united states is a great recommendation and it is touched by the light of sciencea merit appreciated in a community in which the love of knowledge has not always been accompanied by leisure and opportunity  it was an element in dr slopers reputation that his learning and his skill were very evenly balanced he was what you might call a scholarly doctor and yet there was nothing abstract in his remedieshe always ordered you to take something  though he was felt to be extremely thorough he was not uncomfortably theoretic and if he sometimes explained matters rather more minutely than might seem of use to the patient he never went so far like some practitioners one has heard of as to trust to the explanation alone but always left behind him an inscrutable prescription  there were some doctors that left the prescription without offering any explanation at all and he did not belong to that class either which was after all the most vulgar  it will be seen that i am describing a clever man and this is really the reason why dr sloper had become a local celebrity  at the time at which we are chiefly concerned with him he was some fifty years of age and his popularity was at its height  he was very witty and he passed in the best society of new york for a man of the worldwhich indeed he was in a very sufficient degree  i hasten to add to anticipate possible misconception that he was not the least of a charlatan  he was a thoroughly honest manhonest in a degree of which he had perhaps lacked the opportunity to give the complete measure and putting aside the great goodnature of the circle in which he practised which was rather fond of boasting that it possessed the brightest doctor in the country he daily justified his claim to the talents attributed to him by the popular voice  he was an observer even a philosopher and to be bright was so natural to him and as the popular voice said came so easily that he never aimed at mere effect and had none of the little tricks and pretensions of secondrate reputations  it must be confessed that fortune had favoured him and that he had found the path to prosperity very soft to his tread  he had married at the age of twentyseven for love a very charming girl miss catherine harrington of new york who in addition to her charms had brought him a solid dowry  mrs sloper was amiable graceful accomplished elegant and in 1820 she had been one of the pretty girls of the small but promising capital which clustered about the battery and overlooked the bay and of which the uppermost boundary was indicated by the grassy waysides of canal street  even at the age of twenty seven austin sloper had made his mark sufficiently to mitigate the anomaly of his having been chosen among a dozen suitors by a young woman of high fashion who had ten thousand dollars of income and the most charming eyes in the island of manhattan  these eyes and some of their accompaniments were for about five years a source of extreme satisfaction to the young physician who was both a devoted and a very happy husband  the fact of his having married a rich woman made no difference in the line he had traced for himself and he cultivated his profession with as definite a purpose as if he still had no other resources than his fraction of the modest patrimony which on his fathers death he had shared with his brothers and sisters  this purpose had not been preponderantly to make money it had been rather to learn something and to do something  to learn something interesting and to do something usefulthis was roughly speaking the programme he had sketched and of which the accident of his wife having an income appeared to him in no degree to modify the validity  he was fond of his practice and of exercising a skill of which he was agreeably conscious and it was so patent a truth that if he were not a doctor there was nothing else he could be that a doctor he persisted in being in the best possible conditions  of course his easy domestic situation saved him a good deal of drudgery and his wifes affiliation to the best people brought him a good many of those patients whose symptoms are if not more interesting in themselves than those of the lower orders at least more consistently displayed  he desired experience and in the course of twenty years he got a great deal  it must be added that it came to him in some forms which whatever might have been their intrinsic value made it the reverse of welcome  his first child a little boy of extraordinary promise as the doctor who was not addicted to easy enthusiasms firmly believed died at three years of age in spite of everything that the mothers tenderness and the fathers science could invent to save him  two years later mrs sloper gave birth to a second infantan infant of a sex which rendered the poor child to the doctors sense an inadequate substitute for his lamented first born of whom he had promised himself to make an admirable man  the little girl was a disappointment but this was not the worst  a week after her birth the young mother who as the phrase is had been doing well suddenly betrayed alarming symptoms and before another week had elapsed austin sloper was a widower  for a man whose trade was to keep people alive he had certainly done poorly in his own family and a bright doctor who within three years loses his wife and his little boy should perhaps be prepared to see either his skill or his affection impugned  our friend however escaped criticism  that is he escaped all criticism but his own which was much the most competent and most formidable  he walked under the weight of this very private censure for the rest of his days and bore for ever the scars of a castigation to which the strongest hand he knew had treated him on the night that followed his wifes death  the world which as i have said appreciated him pitied him too much to be ironical his misfortune made him more interesting and even helped him to be the fashion  it was observed that even medical families cannot escape the more insidious forms of disease and that after all dr sloper had lost other patients beside the two i have mentioned which constituted an honourable precedent  his little girl remained to him and though she was not what he had desired he proposed to himself to make the best of her he had on hand a stock of unexpended authority by which the child in its early years profited largely  she had been named as a matter of course after her poor mother and even in her most diminutive babyhood the doctor never called her anything but catherine  she grew up a very robust and healthy child and her father as he looked at her often said to himself that such as she was he at least need have no fear of losing her  i say such as she was because to tell the truthbut this is a truth of which i will defer the telling    chapter ii    when the child was about ten years old he invited his sister mrs penniman to come and stay with him  the miss slopers had been but two in number and both of them had married early in life  the younger mrs almond by name was the wife of a prosperous merchant and the mother of a blooming family  she bloomed herself indeed and was a comely comfortable reasonable woman and a favourite with her clever brother who in the matter of women even when they were nearly related to him was a man of distinct preferences  he preferred mrs almond to his sister lavinia who had married a poor clergyman of a sickly constitution and a flowery style of eloquence and then at the age of thirtythree had been left a widow without children without fortunewith nothing but the memory of mr pennimans flowers of speech a certain vague aroma of which hovered about her own conversation  nevertheless he had offered her a home under his own roof which lavinia accepted with the alacrity of a woman who had spent the ten years of her married life in the town of poughkeepsie  the doctor had not proposed to mrs penniman to come and live with him indefinitely he had suggested that she should make an asylum of his house while she looked about for unfurnished lodgings  it is uncertain whether mrs penniman ever instituted a search for unfurnished lodgings but it is beyond dispute that she never found them  she settled herself with her brother and never went away and when catherine was twenty years old her aunt lavinia was still one of the most striking features of her immediate entourage  mrs pennimans own account of the matter was that she had remained to take charge of her nieces education  she had given this account at least to every one but the doctor who never asked for explanations which he could entertain himself any day with inventing  mrs penniman moreover though she had a good deal of a certain sort of artificial assurance shrank for indefinable reasons from presenting herself to her brother as a fountain of instruction  she had not a high sense of humour but she had enough to prevent her from making this mistake and her brother on his side had enough to excuse her in her situation for laying him under contribution during a considerable part of a lifetime  he therefore assented tacitly to the proposition which mrs penniman had tacitly laid down that it was of importance that the poor motherless girl should have a brilliant woman near her  his assent could only be tacit for he had never been dazzled by his sisters intellectual lustre  save when he fell in love with catherine harrington he had never been dazzled indeed by any feminine characteristics whatever and though he was to a certain extent what is called a ladies doctor his private opinion of the more complicated sex was not exalted  he regarded its complications as more curious than edifying and he had an idea of the beauty of reason which was on the whole meagrely gratified by what he observed in his female patients  his wife had been a reasonable woman but she was a bright exception among several things that he was sure of this was perhaps the principal  such a conviction of course did little either to mitigate or to abbreviate his widowhood and it set a limit to his recognition at the best of catherines possibilities and of mrs pennimans ministrations  he nevertheless at the end of six months accepted his sisters permanent presence as an accomplished fact and as catherine grew older perceived that there were in effect good reasons why she should have a companion of her own imperfect sex  he was extremely polite to lavinia scrupulously formally polite and she had never seen him in anger but once in her life when he lost his temper in a theological discussion with her late husband  with her he never discussed theology nor indeed discussed anything he contented himself with making known very distinctly in the form of a lucid ultimatum his wishes with regard to catherine  once when the girl was about twelve years old he had said to her  try and make a clever woman of her lavinia i should like her to be a clever woman  mrs penniman at this looked thoughtful a moment  my dear austin she then inquired do you think it is better to be clever than to be good  good for what asked the doctor  you are good for nothing unless you are clever  from this assertion mrs penniman saw no reason to dissent she possibly reflected that her own great use in the world was owing to her aptitude for many things  of course i wish catherine to be good the doctor said next day but she wont be any the less virtuous for not being a fool  i am not afraid of her being wicked she will never have the salt of malice in her character  she is as good as good bread as the french say but six years hence i dont want to have to compare her to good bread and butter  are you afraid she will turn insipid  my dear brother it is i who supply the butter so you neednt fear said mrs penniman who had taken in hand the childs accomplishments overlooking her at the piano where catherine displayed a certain talent and going with her to the dancingclass where it must be confessed that she made but a modest figure  mrs penniman was a tall thin fair rather faded woman with a perfectly amiable disposition a high standard of gentility a taste for light literature and a certain foolish indirectness and obliquity of character  she was romantic she was sentimental she had a passion for little secrets and mysteriesa very innocent passion for her secrets had hitherto always been as unpractical as addled eggs  she was not absolutely veracious but this defect was of no great consequence for she had never had anything to conceal she would have liked to have a lover and to correspond with him under an assumed name in letters left at a shop i am bound to say that her imagination never carried the intimacy farther than this mrs penniman had never had a lover but her brother who was very shrewd understood her turn of mind  when catherine is about seventeen he said to himself lavinia will try and persuade her that some young man with a moustache is in love with her  it will be quite untrue no young man with a moustache or without will ever be in love with catherine  but lavinia will take it up and talk to her about it perhaps even if her taste for clandestine operations doesnt prevail with her she will talk to me about it  catherine wont see it and wont believe it fortunately for her peace of mind poor catherine isnt romantic  she was a healthy wellgrown child without a trace of her mothers beauty  she was not ugly she had simply a plain dull gentle countenance  the most that had ever been said for her was that she had a nice face and though she was an heiress no one had ever thought of regarding her as a belle  her fathers opinion of her moral purity was abundantly justified she was excellently imperturbably good affectionate docile obedient and much addicted to speaking the truth  in her younger years she was a good deal of a romp and though it is an awkward confession to make about ones heroine i must add that she was something of a glutton  she never that i know of stole raisins out of the pantry but she devoted her pocketmoney to the purchase of creamcakes  as regards this however a critical attitude would be inconsistent with a candid reference to the early annals of any biographer  catherine was decidedly not clever she was not quick with her book nor indeed with anything else  she was not abnormally deficient and she mustered learning enough to acquit herself respectably in conversation with her contemporaries among whom it must be avowed however that she occupied a secondary place  it is well known that in new york it is possible for a young girl to occupy a primary one catherine who was extremely modest had no desire to shine and on most social occasions as they are called you would have found her lurking in the background  she was extremely fond of her father and very much afraid of him she thought him the cleverest and handsomest and most celebrated of men  the poor girl found her account so completely in the exercise of her affections that the little tremor of fear that mixed itself with her filial passion gave the thing an extra relish rather than blunted its edge  her deepest desire was to please him and her conception of happiness was to know that she had succeeded in pleasing him  she had never succeeded beyond a certain point  though on the whole he was very kind to her she was perfectly aware of this and to go beyond the point in question seemed to her really something to live for  what she could not know of course was that she disappointed him though on three or four occasions the doctor had been almost frank about it  she grew up peacefully and prosperously but at the age of eighteen mrs penniman had not made a clever woman of her  dr sloper would have liked to be proud of his daughter but there was nothing to be proud of in poor catherine  there was nothing of course to be ashamed of but this was not enough for the doctor who was a proud man and would have enjoyed being able to think of his daughter as an unusual girl there would have been a fitness in her being pretty and graceful intelligent and distinguished for her mother had been the most charming woman of her little day and as regards her father of course he knew his own value  he had moments of irritation at having produced a commonplace child and he even went so far at times as to take a certain satisfaction in the thought that his wife had not lived to find her out  he was naturally slow in making this discovery himself and it was not till catherine had become a young lady grown that he regarded the matter as settled  he gave her the benefit of a great many doubts he was in no haste to conclude  mrs penniman frequently assured him that his daughter had a delightful nature but he knew how to interpret this assurance  it meant to his sense that catherine was not wise enough to discover that her aunt was a goosea limitation of mind that could not fail to be agreeable to mrs penniman  both she and her brother however exaggerated the young girls limitations for catherine though she was very fond of her aunt and conscious of the gratitude she owed her regarded her without a particle of that gentle dread which gave its stamp to her admiration of her father  to her mind there was nothing of the infinite about mrs penniman catherine saw her all at once as it were and was not dazzled by the apparition whereas her fathers great faculties seemed as they stretched away to lose themselves in a sort of luminous vagueness which indicated not that they stopped but that catherines own mind ceased to follow them  it must not be supposed that dr sloper visited his disappointment upon the poor girl or ever let her suspect that she had played him a trick  on the contrary for fear of being unjust to her he did his duty with exemplary zeal and recognised that she was a faithful and affectionate child  besides he was a philosopher he smoked a good many cigars over his disappointment and in the fulness of time he got used to it  he satisfied himself that he had expected nothing though indeed with a certain oddity of reasoning  i expect nothing he said to himself so that if she gives me a surprise it will be all clear again  if she doesnt it will be no loss  this was about the time catherine had reached her eighteenth year so that it will be seen her father had not been precipitate  at this time she seemed not only incapable of giving surprises it was almost a question whether she could have received oneshe was so quiet and irresponsive  people who expressed themselves roughly called her stolid  but she was irresponsive because she was shy uncomfortably painfully shy  this was not always understood and she sometimes produced an impression of insensibility  in reality she was the softest creature in the world    chapter iii    as a child she had promised to be tall but when she was sixteen she ceased to grow and her stature like most other points in her composition was not unusual  she was strong however and properly made and fortunately her health was excellent  it has been noted that the doctor was a philosopher but i would not have answered for his philosophy if the poor girl had proved a sickly and suffering person  her appearance of health constituted her principal claim to beauty and her clear fresh complexion in which white and red were very equally distributed was indeed an excellent thing to see her eye was small and quiet her features were rather thick her tresses brown and smooth  a dull plain girl she was called by rigorous criticsa quiet ladylike girl by those of the more imaginative sort but by neither class was she very elaborately discussed  when it had been duly impressed upon her that she was a young ladyit was a good while before she could believe itshe suddenly developed a lively taste for dress  a lively taste is quite the expression to use  i feel as if i ought to write it very small her judgement in this matter was by no means infallible it was liable to confusions and embarrassments  her great indulgence of it was really the desire of a rather inarticulate nature to manifest itself she sought to be eloquent in her garments and to make up for her diffidence of speech by a fine frankness of costume  but if she expressed herself in her clothes it is certain that people were not to blame for not thinking her a witty person  it must be added that though she had the expectation of a fortunedr sloper for a long time had been making twenty thousand dollars a year by his profession and laying aside the half of itthe amount of money at her disposal was not greater than the allowance made to many poorer girls  in those days in new york there were still a few altarfires flickering in the temple of republican simplicity and dr sloper would have been glad to see his daughter present herself with a classic grace as a priestess of this mild faith  it made him fairly grimace in private to think that a child of his should be both ugly and overdressed  for himself he was fond of the good things of life and he made a considerable use of them but he had a dread of vulgarity and even a theory that it was increasing in the society that surrounded him  moreover the standard of luxury in the united states thirty years ago was carried by no means so high as at present and catherines clever father took the oldfashioned view of the education of young persons  he had no particular theory on the subject it had scarcely as yet become a necessity of selfdefence to have a collection of theories  it simply appeared to him proper and reasonable that a wellbred young woman should not carry half her fortune on her back  catherines back was a broad one and would have carried a good deal but to the weight of the paternal displeasure she never ventured to expose it and our heroine was twenty years old before she treated herself for evening wear to a red satin gown trimmed with gold fringe though this was an article which for many years she had coveted in secret  it made her look when she sported it like a woman of thirty but oddly enough in spite of her taste for fine clothes she had not a grain of coquetry and her anxiety when she put them on was as to whether they and not she would look well  it is a point on which history has not been explicit but the assumption is warrantable it was in the royal raiment just mentioned that she presented herself at a little entertainment given by her aunt mrs almond  the girl was at this time in her twentyfirst year and mrs almonds party was the beginning of something very important  some three or four years before this dr sloper had moved his household gods up town as they say in new york  he had been living ever since his marriage in an edifice of red brick with granite copings and an enormous fanlight over the door standing in a street within five minutes walk of the city hall which saw its best days from the social point of view about 1820  after this the tide of fashion began to set steadily northward as indeed in new york thanks to the narrow channel in which it flows it is obliged to do and the great hum of traffic rolled farther to the right and left of broadway  by the time the doctor changed his residence the murmur of trade had become a mighty uproar which was music in the ears of all good citizens interested in the commercial development as they delighted to call it of their fortunate isle  dr slopers interest in this phenomenon was only indirectthough seeing that as the years went on half his patients came to be overworked men of business it might have been more immediateand when most of his neighbours dwellings also ornamented with granite copings and large fanlights had been converted into offices warehouses and shipping agencies and otherwise applied to the base uses of commerce he determined to look out for a quieter home  the ideal of quiet and of genteel retirement in 1835 was found in washington square where the doctor built himself a handsome modern widefronted house with a big balcony before the drawingroom windows and a flight of marble steps ascending to a portal which was also faced with white marble this structure and many of its neighbours which it exactly resembled were supposed forty years ago to embody the last results of architectural science and they remain to this day very solid and honourable dwellings  in front of them was the square containing a considerable quantity of inexpensive vegetation enclosed by a wooden paling which increased its rural and accessible appearance and round the corner was the more august precinct of the fifth avenue taking its origin at this point with a spacious and confident air which already marked it for high destinies  i know not whether it is owing to the tenderness of early associations but this portion of new york appears to many persons the most delectable  it has a kind of established repose which is not of frequent occurrence in other quarters of the long shrill city it has a riper richer more honourable look than any of the upper ramifications of the great longitudinal thoroughfarethe look of having had something of a social history  it was here as you might have been informed on good authority that you had come into a world which appeared to offer a variety of sources of interest it was here that your grandmother lived in venerable solitude and dispensed a hospitality which commended itself alike to the infant imagination and the infant palate it was here that you took your first walks abroad following the nurserymaid with unequal step and sniffing up the strange odour of the ailantustrees which at that time formed the principal umbrage of the square and diffused an aroma that you were not yet critical enough to dislike as it deserved it was here finally that your first school kept by a broadbosomed broadbased old lady with a ferule who was always having tea in a blue cup with a saucer that didnt match enlarged the circle both of your observations and your sensations  it was here at any rate that my heroine spent many years of her life which is my excuse for this topographical parenthesis  mrs almond lived much farther up town in an embryonic street with a high numbera region where the extension of the city began to assume a theoretic air where poplars grew beside the pavement when there was one and mingled their shade with the steep roofs of desultory dutch houses and where pigs and chickens disported themselves in the gutter  these elements of rural picturesqueness have now wholly departed from new york street scenery but they were to be found within the memory of middleaged persons in quarters which now would blush to be reminded of them  catherine had a great many cousins and with her aunt almonds children who ended by being nine in number she lived on terms of considerable intimacy  when she was younger they had been rather afraid of her she was believed as the phrase is to be highly educated and a person who lived in the intimacy of their aunt penniman had something of reflected grandeur mrs penniman among the little almonds was an object of more admiration than sympathy  her manners were strange and formidable and her mourning robesshe dressed in black for twenty years after her husbands death and then suddenly appeared one morning with pink roses in her capwere complicated in odd unexpected places with buckles bugles and pins which discouraged familiarity  she took children too hard both for good and for evil and had an oppressive air of expecting subtle things of them so that going to see her was a good deal like being taken to church and made to sit in a front pew  it was discovered after a while however that aunt penniman was but an accident in catherines existence and not a part of its essence and that when the girl came to spend a saturday with her cousins she was available for followmymaster and even for leapfrog  on this basis an understanding was easily arrived at and for several years catherine fraternised with her young kinsmen  i say young kinsmen because seven of the little almonds were boys and catherine had a preference for those games which are most conveniently played in trousers  by degrees however the little almonds trousers began to lengthen and the wearers to disperse and settle themselves in life  the elder children were older than catherine and the boys were sent to college or placed in counting rooms  of the girls one married very punctually and the other as punctually became engaged  it was to celebrate this latter event that mrs almond gave the little party i have mentioned  her daughter was to marry a stout young stockbroker a boy of twenty it was thought a very good thing    chapter iv    mrs penniman with more buckles and bangles than ever came of course to the entertainment accompanied by her niece the doctor too had promised to look in later in the evening  there was to be a good deal of dancing and before it had gone very far marian almond came up to catherine in company with a tall young man  she introduced the young man as a person who had a great desire to make our heroines acquaintance and as a cousin of arthur townsend her own intended  marian almond was a pretty little person of seventeen with a very small figure and a very big sash to the elegance of whose manners matrimony had nothing to add  she already had all the airs of a hostess receiving the company shaking her fan saying that with so many people to attend to she should have no time to dance  she made a long speech about mr townsends cousin to whom she administered a tap with her fan before turning away to other cares  catherine had not understood all that she said her attention was given to enjoying marians ease of manner and flow of ideas and to looking at the young man who was remarkably handsome  she had succeeded however as she often failed to do when people were presented to her in catching his name which appeared to be the same as that of marians little stockbroker  catherine was always agitated by an introduction it seemed a difficult moment and she wondered that some peopleher new acquaintance at this moment for instance should mind it so little  she wondered what she ought to say and what would be the consequences of her saying nothing  the consequences at present were very agreeable  mr townsend leaving her no time for embarrassment began to talk with an easy smile as if he had known her for a year  what a delightful party  what a charming house  what an interesting family  what a pretty girl your cousin is  these observations in themselves of no great profundity mr townsend seemed to offer for what they were worth and as a contribution to an acquaintance  he looked straight into catherines eyes  she answered nothing she only listened and looked at him and he as if he expected no particular reply went on to say many other things in the same comfortable and natural manner  catherine though she felt tonguetied was conscious of no embarrassment it seemed proper that he should talk and that she should simply look at him  what made it natural was that he was so handsome or rather as she phrased it to herself so beautiful  the music had been silent for a while but it suddenly began again and then he asked her with a deeper intenser smile if she would do him the honour of dancing with him  even to this inquiry she gave no audible assent she simply let him put his arm round her waistas she did so it occurred to her more vividly than it had ever done before that this was a singular place for a gentlemans arm to beand in a moment he was guiding her round the room in the harmonious rotation of the polka when they paused she felt that she was red and then for some moments she stopped looking at him  she fanned herself and looked at the flowers that were painted on her fan  he asked her if she would begin again and she hesitated to answer still looking at the flowers  does it make you dizzy he asked in a tone of great kindness  then catherine looked up at him he was certainly beautiful and not at all red  yes she said she hardly knew why for dancing had never made her dizzy  ah well in that case said mr townsend we will sit still and talk  i will find a good place to sit  he found a good placea charming place a little sofa that seemed meant only for two persons  the rooms by this time were very full the dancers increased in number and people stood close in front of them turning their backs so that catherine and her companion seemed secluded and unobserved  we will talk the young man had said but he still did all the talking  catherine leaned back in her place with her eyes fixed upon him smiling and thinking him very clever he had features like young men in pictures catherine had never seen such featuresso delicate so chiselled and finishedamong the young new yorkers whom she passed in the streets and met at parties he was tall and slim but he looked extremely strong  catherine thought he looked like a statue  but a statue would not talk like that and above all would not have eyes of so rare a colour  he had never been at mrs almonds before he felt very much like a stranger and it was very kind of catherine to take pity on him  he was arthur townsends cousinnot very near several times removed and arthur had brought him to present him to the family  in fact he was a great stranger in new york  it was his native place but he had not been there for many years  he had been knocking about the world and living in faraway lands he had only come back a month or two before  new york was very pleasant only he felt lonely  you see people forget you he said smiling at catherine with his delightful gaze while he leaned forward obliquely turning towards her with his elbows on his knees  it seemed to catherine that no one who had once seen him would ever forget him but though she made this reflexion she kept it to herself almost as you would keep something precious  they sat there for some time  he was very amusing  he asked her about the people that were near them he tried to guess who some of them were and he made the most laughable mistakes  he criticised them very freely in a positive offhand way  catherine had never heard any oneespecially any young mantalk just like that  it was the way a young man might talk in a novel or better still in a play on the stage close before the footlights looking at the audience and with every one looking at him so that you wondered at his presence of mind  and yet mr townsend was not like an actor he seemed so sincere so natural  this was very interesting but in the midst of it marian almond came pushing through the crowd with a little ironical cry when she found these young people still together which made every one turn round and cost catherine a conscious blush  marian broke up their talk and told mr townsend whom she treated as if she were already married and he had become her cousinto run away to her mother who had been wishing for the last halfhour to introduce him to mr almond  we shall meet again he said to catherine as he left her and catherine thought it a very original speech  her cousin took her by the arm and made her walk about  i neednt ask you what you think of morris the young girl exclaimed  is that his name  i dont ask you what you think of his name but what you think of himself said marian  oh nothing particular catherine answered dissembling for the first time in her life  i have half a mind to tell him that cried marian  it will do him good  hes so terribly conceited  conceited said catherine staring  so arthur says and arthur knows about him  oh dont tell him catherine murmured imploringly  dont tell him hes conceited  i have told him so a dozen times  at this profession of audacity catherine looked down at her little companion in amazement  she supposed it was because marian was going to be married that she took so much on herself but she wondered too whether when she herself should become engaged such exploits would be expected of her  half an hour later she saw her aunt penniman sitting in the embrasure of a window with her head a little on one side and her gold eye glass raised to her eyes which were wandering about the room  in front of her was a gentleman bending forward a little with his back turned to catherine  she knew his back immediately though she had never seen it for when he had left her at marians instigation he had retreated in the best order without turning round  morris townsendthe name had already become very familiar to her as if some one had been repeating it in her ear for the last halfhour morris townsend was giving his impressions of the company to her aunt as he had done to herself he was saying clever things and mrs penniman was smiling as if she approved of them  as soon as catherine had perceived this she moved away she would not have liked him to turn round and see her  but it gave her pleasurethe whole thing  that he should talk with mrs penniman with whom she lived and whom she saw and talked with every daythat seemed to keep him near her and to make him even easier to contemplate than if she herself had been the object of his civilities and that aunt lavinia should like him should not be shocked or startled by what he said this also appeared to the girl a personal gain for aunt lavinias standard was extremely high planted as it was over the grave of her late husband in which as she had convinced every one the very genius of conversation was buried  one of the almond boys as catherine called him invited our heroine to dance a quadrille and for a quarter of an hour her feet at least were occupied  this time she was not dizzy her head was very clear  just when the dance was over she found herself in the crowd face to face with her father dr sloper had usually a little smile never a very big one and with his little smile playing in his clear eyes and on his neatlyshaved lips he looked at his daughters crimson gown  is it possible that this magnificent person is my child he said  you would have surprised him if you had told him so but it is a literal fact that he almost never addressed his daughter save in the ironical form  whenever he addressed her he gave her pleasure but she had to cut her pleasure out of the piece as it were  there were portions left over light remnants and snippets of irony which she never knew what to do with which seemed too delicate for her own use and yet catherine lamenting the limitations of her understanding felt that they were too valuable to waste and had a belief that if they passed over her head they yet contributed to the general sum of human wisdom  i am not magnificent she said mildly wishing that she had put on another dress  you are sumptuous opulent expensive her father rejoined  you look as if you had eighty thousand a year  well so long as i havent said catherine illogically  her conception of her prospective wealth was as yet very indefinite  so long as you havent you shouldnt look as if you had  have you enjoyed your party  catherine hesitated a moment and then looking away i am rather tired she murmured  i have said that this entertainment was the beginning of something important for catherine  for the second time in her life she made an indirect answer and the beginning of a period of dissimulation is certainly a significant date  catherine was not so easily tired as that  nevertheless in the carriage as they drove home she was as quiet as if fatigue had been her portion  dr slopers manner of addressing his sister lavinia had a good deal of resemblance to the tone he had adopted towards catherine  who was the young man that was making love to you he presently asked  oh my good brother murmured mrs penniman in deprecation  he seemed uncommonly tender  whenever i looked at you for half an hour he had the most devoted air  the devotion was not to me said mrs penniman  it was to catherine he talked to me of her  catherine had been listening with all her ears  oh aunt penniman she exclaimed faintly  he is very handsome he is very clever he expressed himself with a great deala great deal of felicity her aunt went on  he is in love with this regal creature then the doctor inquired humorously  oh father cried the girl still more faintly devoutly thankful the carriage was dark  i dont know that but he admired her dress  catherine did not say to herself in the dark my dress only mrs pennimans announcement struck her by its richness not by its meagreness  you see said her father he thinks you have eighty thousand a year  i dont believe he thinks of that said mrs penniman he is too refined  he must be tremendously refined not to think of that  well he is catherine exclaimed before she knew it  i thought you had gone to sleep her father answered  the hour has come he added to himself  lavinia is going to get up a romance for catherine  its a shame to play such tricks on the girl what is the gentlemans name he went on aloud  i didnt catch it and i didnt like to ask him  he asked to be introduced to me said mrs penniman with a certain grandeur but you know how indistinctly jefferson speaks  jefferson was mr almond  catherine dear what was the gentlemans name  for a minute if it had not been for the rumbling of the carriage you might have heard a pin drop  i dont know aunt lavinia said catherine very softly  and with all his irony her father believed her    chapter v    he learned what he had asked some three or four days later after morris townsend with his cousin had called in washington square mrs penniman did not tell her brother on the drive home that she had intimated to this agreeable young man whose name she did not know that with her niece she should be very glad to see him but she was greatly pleased and even a little flattered when late on a sunday afternoon the two gentlemen made their appearance  his coming with arthur townsend made it more natural and easy the latter young man was on the point of becoming connected with the family and mrs penniman had remarked to catherine that as he was going to marry marian it would be polite in him to call  these events came to pass late in the autumn and catherine and her aunt had been sitting together in the closing dusk by the firelight in the high back parlour  arthur townsend fell to catherines portion while his companion placed himself on the sofa beside mrs penniman  catherine had hitherto not been a harsh critic she was easy to pleaseshe liked to talk with young men  but marians betrothed this evening made her feel vaguely fastidious he sat looking at the fire and rubbing his knees with his hands  as for catherine she scarcely even pretended to keep up the conversation her attention had fixed itself on the other side of the room she was listening to what went on between the other mr townsend and her aunt  every now and then he looked over at catherine herself and smiled as if to show that what he said was for her benefit too  catherine would have liked to change her place to go and sit near them where she might see and hear him better  but she was afraid of seeming boldof looking eager and besides it would not have been polite to marians little suitor  she wondered why the other gentleman had picked out her aunthow he came to have so much to say to mrs penniman to whom usually young men were not especially devoted  she was not at all jealous of aunt lavinia but she was a little envious and above all she wondered for morris townsend was an object on which she found that her imagination could exercise itself indefinitely  his cousin had been describing a house that he had taken in view of his union with marian and the domestic conveniences he meant to introduce into it how marian wanted a larger one and mrs almond recommended a smaller one and how he himself was convinced that he had got the neatest house in new york  it doesnt matter he said its only for three or four years  at the end of three or four years well move  thats the way to live in new yorkto move every three or four years  then you always get the last thing  its because the citys growing so quickyouve got to keep up with it  its going straight up townthats where new yorks going  if i wasnt afraid marian would be lonely id go up thereright up to the topand wait for it  only have to wait ten yearstheyd all come up after you  but marian says she wants some neighboursshe doesnt want to be a pioneer  she says that if shes got to be the first settler she had better go out to minnesota  i guess well move up little by little when we get tired of one street well go higher  so you see well always have a new house its a great advantage to have a new house you get all the latest improvements  they invent everything all over again about every five years and its a great thing to keep up with the new things  i always try and keep up with the new things of every kind  dont you think thats a good motto for a young coupleto keep going higher thats the name of that piece of poetrywhat do they call it excelsior  catherine bestowed on her junior visitor only just enough attention to feel that this was not the way mr morris townsend had talked the other night or that he was talking now to her fortunate aunt  but suddenly his aspiring kinsman became more interesting  he seemed to have become conscious that she was affected by his companions presence and he thought it proper to explain it  my cousin asked me to bring him or i shouldnt have taken the liberty  he seemed to want very much to come you know hes awfully sociable  i told him i wanted to ask you first but he said mrs penniman had invited him  he isnt particular what he says when he wants to come somewhere  but mrs penniman seems to think its all right  we are very glad to see him said catherine  and she wished to talk more about him but she hardly knew what to say  i never saw him before she went on presently  arthur townsend stared  why he told me he talked with you for over half an hour the other night  i mean before the other night  that was the first time  oh he has been away from new yorkhe has been all round the world he doesnt know many people here but hes very sociable and he wants to know every one  every one said catherine  well i mean all the good ones  all the pretty young ladieslike mrs penniman and arthur townsend gave a private laugh  my aunt likes him very much said catherine  most people like himhes so brilliant  hes more like a foreigner catherine suggested  well i never knew a foreigner said young townsend in a tone which seemed to indicate that his ignorance had been optional  neither have i catherine confessed with more humility  they say they are generally brilliant she added vaguely  well the people of this city are clever enough for me  i know some of them that think they are too clever for me but they aint  i suppose you cant be too clever said catherine still with humility  i dont know  i know some people that call my cousin too clever  catherine listened to this statement with extreme interest and a feeling that if morris townsend had a fault it would naturally be that one  but she did not commit herself and in a moment she asked now that he has come back will he stay here always  ah said arthur if he can get something to do  something to do  some place or other some business  hasnt he got any said catherine who had never heard of a young manof the upper classin this situation  no hes looking round  but he cant find anything  i am very sorry catherine permitted herself to observe  oh he doesnt mind said young townsend  he takes it easyhe isnt in a hurry  he is very particular  catherine thought he naturally would be and gave herself up for some moments to the contemplation of this idea in several of its bearings  wont his father take him into his businesshis office she at last inquired  he hasnt got any fatherhe has only got a sister  your sister cant help you much  it seemed to catherine that if she were his sister she would disprove this axiom  is sheis she pleasant she asked in a moment  i dont knowi believe shes very respectable said young townsend  and then he looked across to his cousin and began to laugh  look here we are talking about you he added  morris townsend paused in his conversation with mrs penniman and stared with a little smile  then he got up as if he were going  as far as you are concerned i cant return the compliment he said to catherines companion  but as regards miss sloper its another affair  catherine thought this little speech wonderfully well turned but she was embarrassed by it and she also got up  morris townsend stood looking at her and smiling he put out his hand for farewell  he was going without having said anything to her but even on these terms she was glad to have seen him  i will tell her what you have saidwhen you go said mrs penniman with an insinuating laugh  catherine blushed for she felt almost as if they were making sport of her  what in the world could this beautiful young man have said he looked at her still in spite of her blush but very kindly and respectfully  i have had no talk with you he said and that was what i came for  but it will be a good reason for coming another time a little pretextif i am obliged to give one  i am not afraid of what your aunt will say when i go  with this the two young men took their departure after which catherine with her blush still lingering directed a serious and interrogative eye to mrs penniman  she was incapable of elaborate artifice and she resorted to no jocular deviceto no affectation of the belief that she had been malignedto learn what she desired  what did you say you would tell me she asked  mrs penniman came up to her smiling and nodding a little looked at her all over and gave a twist to the knot of ribbon in her neck its a great secret my dear child but he is coming acourting  catherine was serious still  is that what he told you  he didnt say so exactly  but he left me to guess it  im a good guesser  do you mean acourting me  not me certainly miss though i must say he is a hundred times more polite to a person who has no longer extreme youth to recommend her than most of the young men  he is thinking of some one else and mrs penniman gave her niece a delicate little kiss  you must be very gracious to him  catherine staredshe was bewildered  i dont understand you she said he doesnt know me  oh yes he does more than you think  i have told him all about you  oh aunt penniman murmured catherine as if this had been a breach of trust  he is a perfect strangerwe dont know him  there was infinite modesty in the poor girls we  aunt penniman however took no account of it she spoke even with a touch of acrimony  my dear catherine you know very well that you admire him  oh aunt penniman catherine could only murmur again  it might very well be that she admired himthough this did not seem to her a thing to talk about  but that this brilliant strangerthis sudden apparition who had barely heard the sound of her voicetook that sort of interest in her that was expressed by the romantic phrase of which mrs penniman had just made use  this could only be a figment of the restless brain of aunt lavinia whom every one knew to be a woman of powerful imagination    chapter vi    mrs penniman even took for granted at times that other people had as much imagination as herself so that when half an hour later her brother came in she addressed him quite on this principle  he has just been here austin its such a pity you missed him  whom in the world have i missed asked the doctor  mr morris townsend he has made us such a delightful visit  and who in the world is mr morris townsend  aunt penniman means the gentlemanthe gentleman whose name i couldnt remember said catherine  the gentleman at elizabeths party who was so struck with catherine mrs penniman added  oh his name is morris townsend is it  and did he come here to propose to you  oh father murmured the girl for all answer turning away to the window where the dusk had deepened to darkness  i hope he wont do that without your permission said mrs penniman very graciously  after all my dear he seems to have yours her brother answered  lavinia simpered as if this might not be quite enough and catherine with her forehead touching the windowpanes listened to this exchange of epigrams as reservedly as if they had not each been a pinprick in her own destiny  the next time he comes the doctor added you had better call me he might like to see me  morris townsend came again some five days afterwards but dr sloper was not called as he was absent from home at the time  catherine was with her aunt when the young mans name was brought in and mrs penniman effacing herself and protesting made a great point of her nieces going into the drawingroom alone  this time its for youfor you only she said  before when he talked to me it was only preliminaryit was to gain my confidence literally my dear i should not have the courage to show myself to day  and this was perfectly true  mrs penniman was not a brave woman and morris townsend had struck her as a young man of great force of character and of remarkable powers of satire a keen resolute brilliant nature with which one must exercise a great deal of tact she said to herself that he was imperious and she liked the word and the idea  she was not the least jealous of her niece and she had been perfectly happy with mr penniman but in the bottom of her heart she permitted herself the observation  thats the sort of husband i should have had  he was certainly much more imperious she ended by calling it imperialthan mr penniman  so catherine saw mr townsend alone and her aunt did not come in even at the end of the visit  the visit was a long one he sat therein the front parlour in the biggest armchairfor more than an hour  he seemed more at home this timemore familiar lounging a little in the chair slapping a cushion that was near him with his stick and looking round the room a good deal and at the objects it contained as well as at catherine whom however he also contemplated freely  there was a smile of respectful devotion in his handsome eyes which seemed to catherine almost solemnly beautiful it made her think of a young knight in a poem  his talk however was not particularly knightly it was light and easy and friendly it took a practical turn and he asked a number of questions about herselfwhat were her tastesif she liked this and thatwhat were her habits  he said to her with his charming smile tell me about yourself give me a little sketch  catherine had very little to tell and she had no talent for sketching but before he went she had confided to him that she had a secret passion for the theatre which had been but scantily gratified and a taste for operatic musicthat of bellini and donizetti in especial it must be remembered in extenuation of this primitive young woman that she held these opinions in an age of general darknesswhich she rarely had an occasion to hear except on the handorgan  she confessed that she was not particularly fond of literature  morris townsend agreed with her that books were tiresome things only as he said you had to read a good many before you found it out  he had been to places that people had written books about and they were not a bit like the descriptions  to see for yourselfthat was the great thing he always tried to see for himself  he had seen all the principal actorshe had been to all the best theatres in london and paris but the actors were always like the authorsthey always exaggerated he liked everything to be natural  suddenly he stopped looking at catherine with his smile  thats what i like you for you are so natural  excuse me he added you see i am natural myself  and before she had time to think whether she excused him or not which afterwards at leisure she became conscious that she didhe began to talk about music and to say that it was his greatest pleasure in life  he had heard all the great singers in paris and londonpasta and rubini and lablacheand when you had done that you could say that you knew what singing was  i sing a little myself he said some day i will show you  not today but some other time  and then he got up to go he had omitted by accident to say that he would sing to her if she would play to him  he thought of this after he got into the street but he might have spared his compunction for catherine had not noticed the lapse  she was thinking only that some other time had a delightful sound it seemed to spread itself over the future  this was all the more reason however though she was ashamed and uncomfortable why she should tell her father that mr morris townsend had called again  she announced the fact abruptly almost violently as soon as the doctor came into the house and having done soit was her dutyshe took measures to leave the room  but she could not leave it fast enough her father stopped her just as she reached the door  well my dear did he propose to you today the doctor asked  this was just what she had been afraid he would say and yet she had no answer ready  of course she would have liked to take it as a jokeas her father must have meant it and yet she would have liked also in denying it to be a little positive a little sharp so that he would perhaps not ask the question again  she didnt like itit made her unhappy  but catherine could never be sharp and for a moment she only stood with her hand on the doorknob looking at her satiric parent and giving a little laugh  decidedly said the doctor to himself my daughter is not brilliant  but he had no sooner made this reflexion than catherine found something she had decided on the whole to take the thing as a joke  perhaps he will do it the next time she exclaimed with a repetition of her laugh  and she quickly got out of the room  the doctor stood staring he wondered whether his daughter were serious  catherine went straight to her own room and by the time she reached it she bethought herself that there was something else something bettershe might have said  she almost wished now that her father would ask his question again so that she might reply oh yes mr morris townsend proposed to me and i refused him  the doctor however began to put his questions elsewhere it naturally having occurred to him that he ought to inform himself properly about this handsome young man who had formed the habit of running in and out of his house  he addressed himself to the younger of his sisters mrs almondnot going to her for the purpose there was no such hurry as thatbut having made a note of the matter for the first opportunity  the doctor was never eager never impatient nor nervous but he made notes of everything and he regularly consulted his notes  among them the information he obtained from mrs almond about morris townsend took its place  lavinia has already been to ask me she said  lavinia is most excited i dont understand it  its not after all lavinia that the young man is supposed to have designs upon  she is very peculiar  ah my dear the doctor replied she has not lived with me these twelve years without my finding it out  she has got such an artificial mind said mrs almond who always enjoyed an opportunity to discuss lavinias peculiarities with her brother  she didnt want me to tell you that she had asked me about mr townsend but i told her i would  she always wants to conceal everything  and yet at moments no one blurts things out with such crudity  she is like a revolving lighthouse pitch darkness alternating with a dazzling brilliancy  but what did you tell her the doctor asked  what i tell you that i know very little of him  lavinia must have been disappointed at that said the doctor she would prefer him to have been guilty of some romantic crime however we must make the best of people  they tell me our gentleman is the cousin of the little boy to whom you are about to entrust the future of your little girl  arthur is not a little boy he is a very old man you and i will never be so old  he is a distant relation of lavinias protege  the name is the same but i am given to understand that there are townsends and townsends  so arthurs mother tells me she talked about branchesyounger branches elder branches inferior branchesas if it were a royal house  arthur it appears is of the reigning line but poor lavinias young man is not  beyond this arthurs mother knows very little about him she has only a vague story that he has been wild  but i know his sister a little and she is a very nice woman  her name is mrs montgomery she is a widow with a little property and five children  she lives in the second avenue  what does mrs montgomery say about him  that he has talents by which he might distinguish himself  only he is lazy eh  she doesnt say so  thats family pride said the doctor  what is his profession  he hasnt got any he is looking for something  i believe he was once in the navy  once  what is his age  i suppose he is upwards of thirty  he must have gone into the navy very young  i think arthur told me that he inherited a small propertywhich was perhaps the cause of his leaving the navyand that he spent it all in a few years  he travelled all over the world lived abroad amused himself  i believe it was a kind of system a theory he had  he has lately come back to america with the intention as he tells arthur of beginning life in earnest  is he in earnest about catherine then  i dont see why you should be incredulous said mrs almond  it seems to me that you have never done catherine justice  you must remember that she has the prospect of thirty thousand a year  the doctor looked at his sister a moment and then with the slightest touch of bitterness  you at least appreciate her he said  mrs almond blushed  i dont mean that is her only merit i simply mean that it is a great one  a great many young men think so and you appear to me never to have been properly aware of that  you have always had a little way of alluding to her as an unmarriageable girl  my allusions are as kind as yours elizabeth said the doctor frankly  how many suitors has catherine had with all her expectationshow much attention has she ever received  catherine is not unmarriageable but she is absolutely unattractive  what other reason is there for lavinia being so charmed with the idea that there is a lover in the house  there has never been one before and lavinia with her sensitive sympathetic nature is not used to the idea  it affects her imagination  i must do the young men of new york the justice to say that they strike me as very disinterested they prefer pretty girlslively girlsgirls like your own catherine is neither pretty nor lively  catherine does very well she has a style of her ownwhich is more than my poor marian has who has no style at all said mrs almond the reason catherine has received so little attention is that she seems to all the young men to be older than themselves  she is so large and she dressesso richly  they are rather afraid of her i think she looks as if she had been married already and you know they dont like married women  and if our young men appear disinterested the doctors wiser sister went on it is because they marry as a general thing so young before twentyfive at the age of innocence and sincerity before the age of calculation  if they only waited a little catherine would fare better  as a calculation  thank you very much said the doctor  wait till some intelligent man of forty comes along and he will be delighted with catherine mrs almond continued  mr townsend is not old enough then his motives may be pure  it is very possible that his motives are pure i should be very sorry to take the contrary for granted  lavinia is sure of it and as he is a very prepossessing youth you might give him the benefit of the doubt  dr sloper reflected a moment  what are his present means of subsistence  i have no idea  he lives as i say with his sister  a widow with five children  do you mean he lives upon her  mrs almond got up and with a certain impatience  had you not better ask mrs montgomery herself she inquired  perhaps i may come to that said the doctor  did you say the second avenue  he made a note of the second avenue    chapter vii    he was however by no means so much in earnest as this might seem to indicate and indeed he was more than anything else amused with the whole situation  he was not in the least in a state of tension or of vigilance with regard to catherines prospects he was even on his guard against the ridicule that might attach itself to the spectacle of a house thrown into agitation by its daughter and heiress receiving attentions unprecedented in its annals  more than this he went so far as to promise himself some entertainment from the little dramaif drama it wasof which mrs penniman desired to represent the ingenious mr townsend as the hero  he had no intention as yet of regulating the denouement  he was perfectly willing as elizabeth had suggested to give the young man the benefit of every doubt there was no great danger in it for catherine at the age of twenty two was after all a rather mature blossom such as could be plucked from the stem only by a vigorous jerk  the fact that morris townsend was poorwas not of necessity against him the doctor had never made up his mind that his daughter should marry a rich man the fortune she would inherit struck him as a very sufficient provision for two reasonable persons and if a penniless swain who could give a good account of himself should enter the lists he should be judged quite upon his personal merits  there were other things besides  the doctor thought it very vulgar to be precipitate in accusing people of mercenary motives inasmuch as his door had as yet not been in the least besieged by fortunehunters and lastly he was very curious to see whether catherine might really be loved for her moral worth  he smiled as he reflected that poor mr townsend had been only twice to the house and he said to mrs penniman that the next time he should come she must ask him to dinner  he came very soon again and mrs penniman had of course great pleasure in executing this mission  morris townsend accepted her invitation with equal good grace and the dinner took place a few days later  the doctor had said to himself justly enough that they must not have the young man alone this would partake too much of the nature of encouragement  so two or three other persons were invited but morris townsend though he was by no means the ostensible was the real occasion of the feast  there is every reason to suppose that he desired to make a good impression and if he fell short of this result it was not for want of a good deal of intelligent effort  the doctor talked to him very little during dinner but he observed him attentively and after the ladies had gone out he pushed him the wine and asked him several questions  morris was not a young man who needed to be pressed and he found quite enough encouragement in the superior quality of the claret  the doctors wine was admirable and it may be communicated to the reader that while he sipped it morris reflected that a cellarfull of good liquorthere was evidently a cellarfull herewould be a most attractive idiosyncrasy in a fatherinlaw  the doctor was struck with his appreciative guest he saw that he was not a commonplace young man he has ability said catherines father decided ability he has a very good head if he chooses to use it  and he is uncommonly well turned out quite the sort of figure that pleases the ladies  but i dont think i like him  the doctor however kept his reflexions to himself and talked to his visitors about foreign lands concerning which morris offered him more information than he was ready as he mentally phrased it to swallow  dr sloper had travelled but little and he took the liberty of not believing everything this anecdotical idler narrated  he prided himself on being something of a physiognomist and while the young man chatting with easy assurance puffed his cigar and filled his glass again the doctor sat with his eyes quietly fixed on his bright expressive face  he has the assurance of the devil himself said morriss host i dont think i ever saw such assurance  and his powers of invention are most remarkable  he is very knowing they were not so knowing as that in my time  and a good head did i say  i should think so after a bottle of madeira and a bottle and a half of claret  after dinner morris townsend went and stood before catherine who was standing before the fire in her red satin gown  he doesnt like mehe doesnt like me at all said the young man  who doesnt like you asked catherine  your father extraordinary man  i dont see how you know said catherine blushing  i feel i am very quick to feel  perhaps you are mistaken  ah well you ask him and you will see  i would rather not ask him if there is any danger of his saying what you think  morris looked at her with an air of mock melancholy  it wouldnt give you any pleasure to contradict him  i never contradict him said catherine  will you hear me abused without opening your lips in my defence  my father wont abuse you  he doesnt know you enough  morris townsend gave a loud laugh and catherine began to blush again  i shall never mention you she said to take refuge from her confusion  that is very well but it is not quite what i should have liked you to say  i should have liked you to say  if my father doesnt think well of you what does it matter  ah but it would matter i couldnt say that the girl exclaimed  he looked at her for a moment smiling a little and the doctor if he had been watching him just then would have seen a gleam of fine impatience in the sociable softness of his eye  but there was no impatience in his rejoindernone at least save what was expressed in a little appealing sigh  ah well then i must not give up the hope of bringing him round  he expressed it more frankly to mrs penniman later in the evening but before that he sang two or three songs at catherines timid request not that he flattered himself that this would help to bring her father round  he had a sweet light tenor voice and when he had finished every one made some exclamationevery one that is save catherine who remained intensely silent  mrs penniman declared that his manner of singing was most artistic and dr sloper said it was very takingvery taking indeed speaking loudly and distinctly but with a certain dryness  he doesnt like mehe doesnt like me at all said morris townsend addressing the aunt in the same manner as he had done the niece  he thinks im all wrong  unlike her niece mrs penniman asked for no explanation  she only smiled very sweetly as if she understood everything and unlike catherine too she made no attempt to contradict him  pray what does it matter she murmured softly  ah you say the right thing said morris greatly to the gratification of mrs penniman who prided herself on always saying the right thing  the doctor the next time he saw his sister elizabeth let her know that he had made the acquaintance of lavinias protege  physically he said hes uncommonly well set up  as an anatomist it is really a pleasure to me to see such a beautiful structure although if people were all like him i suppose there would be very little need for doctors  dont you see anything in people but their bones mrs almond rejoined  what do you think of him as a father  as a father  thank heaven i am not his father  no but you are catherines  lavinia tells me she is in love  she must get over it  he is not a gentleman  ah take care  remember that he is a branch of the townsends  he is not what i call a gentleman  he has not the soul of one  he is extremely insinuating but its a vulgar nature  i saw through it in a minute  he is altogether too familiari hate familiarity  he is a plausible coxcomb  ah well said mrs almond if you make up your mind so easily its a great advantage  i dont make up my mind easily  what i tell you is the result of thirty years of observation and in order to be able to form that judgement in a single evening i have had to spend a lifetime in study  very possibly you are right  but the thing is for catherine to see it  i will present her with a pair of spectacles said the doctor    chapter viii    if it were true that she was in love she was certainly very quiet about it but the doctor was of course prepared to admit that her quietness might mean volumes  she had told morris townsend that she would not mention him to her father and she saw no reason to retract this vow of discretion  it was no more than decently civil of course that after having dined in washington square morris should call there again and it was no more than natural that having been kindly received on this occasion he should continue to present himself  he had had plenty of leisure on his hands and thirty years ago in new york a young man of leisure had reason to be thankful for aids to selfoblivion  catherine said nothing to her father about these visits though they had rapidly become the most important the most absorbing thing in her life  the girl was very happy  she knew not as yet what would come of it but the present had suddenly grown rich and solemn  if she had been told she was in love she would have been a good deal surprised for she had an idea that love was an eager and exacting passion and her own heart was filled in these days with the impulse of selfeffacement and sacrifice  whenever morris townsend had left the house her imagination projected itself with all its strength into the idea of his soon coming back but if she had been told at such a moment that he would not return for a year or even that he would never return she would not have complained nor rebelled but would have humbly accepted the decree and sought for consolation in thinking over the times she had already seen him the words he had spoken the sound of his voice of his tread the expression of his face  love demands certain things as a right but catherine had no sense of her rights she had only a consciousness of immense and unexpected favours  her very gratitude for these things had hushed itself for it seemed to her that there would be something of impudence in making a festival of her secret  her father suspected morris townsends visits and noted her reserve  she seemed to beg pardon for it she looked at him constantly in silence as if she meant to say that she said nothing because she was afraid of irritating him  but the poor girls dumb eloquence irritated him more than anything else would have done and he caught himself murmuring more than once that it was a grievous pity his only child was a simpleton  his murmurs however were inaudible and for a while he said nothing to any one he would have liked to know exactly how often young townsend came but he had determined to ask no questions of the girl herselfto say nothing more to her that would show that he watched her  the doctor had a great idea of being largely just  he wished to leave his daughter her liberty and interfere only when the danger should be proved  it was not in his manner to obtain information by indirect methods and it never even occurred to him to question the servants as for lavinia he hated to talk to her about the matter she annoyed him with her mock romanticism  but he had to come to this  mrs pennimans convictions as regards the relations of her niece and the clever young visitor who saved appearances by coming ostensibly for both the ladiesmrs pennimans convictions had passed into a riper and richer phase  there was to be no crudity in mrs pennimans treatment of the situation she had become as uncommunicative as catherine herself  she was tasting of the sweets of concealment she had taken up the line of mystery  she would be enchanted to be able to prove to herself that she is persecuted said the doctor and when at last he questioned her he was sure she would contrive to extract from his words a pretext for this belief  be so good as to let me know what is going on in the house he said to her in a tone which under the circumstances he himself deemed genial  going on austin mrs penniman exclaimed  why i am sure i dont know  i believe that last night the old grey cat had kittens  at her age said the doctor  the idea is startlingalmost shocking  be so good as to see that they are all drowned  but what else has happened  ah the dear little kittens cried mrs penniman  i wouldnt have them drowned for the world  her brother puffed his cigar a few moments in silence  your sympathy with kittens lavinia he presently resumed arises from a feline element in your own character  cats are very graceful and very clean said mrs penniman smiling  and very stealthy  you are the embodiment both of grace and of neatness but you are wanting in frankness  you certainly are not dear brother  i dont pretend to be graceful though i try to be neat  why havent you let me know that mr morris townsend is coming to the house four times a week  mrs penniman lifted her eyebrows  four times a week  five times if you prefer it  i am away all day and i see nothing but when such things happen you should let me know  mrs penniman with her eyebrows still raised reflected intently dear austin she said at last i am incapable of betraying a confidence  i would rather suffer anything  never fear you shall not suffer  to whose confidence is it you allude  has catherine made you take a vow of eternal secrecy  by no means  catherine has not told me as much as she might  she has not been very trustful  it is the young man then who has made you his confidante  allow me to say that it is extremely indiscreet of you to form secret alliances with young men  you dont know where they may lead you  i dont know what you mean by an alliance said mrs penniman  i take a great interest in mr townsend i wont conceal that  but thats all  under the circumstances that is quite enough  what is the source of your interest in mr townsend  why said mrs penniman musing and then breaking into her smile that he is so interesting  the doctor felt that he had need of his patience  and what makes him interestinghis good looks  his misfortunes austin  ah he has had misfortunes  that of course is always interesting are you at liberty to mention a few of mr townsends  i dont know that he would like it said mrs penniman  he has told me a great deal about himselfhe has told me in fact his whole history  but i dont think i ought to repeat those things  he would tell them to you i am sure if he thought you would listen to him kindly  with kindness you may do anything with him  the doctor gave a laugh  i shall request him very kindly then to leave catherine alone  ah said mrs penniman shaking her forefinger at her brother with her little finger turned out catherine had probably said something to him kinder than that  said that she loved him  do you mean that  mrs penniman fixed her eyes on the floor  as i tell you austin she doesnt confide in me  you have an opinion i suppose all the same  it is that i ask you for though i dont conceal from you that i shall not regard it as conclusive  mrs pennimans gaze continued to rest on the carpet but at last she lifted it and then her brother thought it very expressive  i think catherine is very happy that is all i can say  townsend is trying to marry heris that what you mean  he is greatly interested in her  he finds her such an attractive girl  catherine has a lovely nature austin said mrs penniman and mr townsend has had the intelligence to discover that  with a little help from you i suppose  my dear lavinia cried the doctor you are an admirable aunt  so mr townsend says observed lavinia smiling  do you think he is sincere asked her brother  in saying that  no thats of course  but in his admiration for catherine  deeply sincere  he has said to me the most appreciative the most charming things about her  he would say them to you if he were sure you would listen to himgently  i doubt whether i can undertake it  he appears to require a great deal of gentleness  he is a sympathetic sensitive nature said mrs penniman  her brother puffed his cigar again in silence  these delicate qualities have survived his vicissitudes eh  all this while you havent told me about his misfortunes  it is a long story said mrs penniman and i regard it as a sacred trust  but i suppose there is no objection to my saying that he has been wildhe frankly confesses that  but he has paid for it  thats what has impoverished him eh  i dont mean simply in money  he is very much alone in the world  do you mean that he has behaved so badly that his friends have given him up  he has had false friends who have deceived and betrayed him  he seems to have some good ones too  he has a devoted sister and halfadozen nephews and nieces  mrs penniman was silent a minute  the nephews and nieces are children and the sister is not a very attractive person  i hope he doesnt abuse her to you said the doctor for i am told he lives upon her  lives upon her  lives with her and does nothing for himself it is about the same thing  he is looking for a positionmost earnestly said mrs penniman he hopes every day to find one  precisely  he is looking for it hereover there in the front parlour  the position of husband of a weakminded woman with a large fortune would suit him to perfection  mrs penniman was truly amiable but she now gave signs of temper she rose with much animation and stood for a moment looking at her brother  my dear austin she remarked if you regard catherine as a weakminded woman you are particularly mistaken  and with this she moved majestically away    chapter ix    it was a regular custom with the family in washington square to go and spend sunday evening at mrs almonds  on the sunday after the conversation i have just narrated this custom was not intermitted and on this occasion towards the middle of the evening dr sloper found reason to withdraw to the library with his brotherinlaw to talk over a matter of business  he was absent some twenty minutes and when he came back into the circle which was enlivened by the presence of several friends of the family he saw that morris townsend had come in and had lost as little time as possible in seating himself on a small sofa beside catherine  in the large room where several different groups had been formed and the hum of voices and of laughter was loud these two young persons might confabulate as the doctor phrased it to himself without attracting attention  he saw in a moment however that his daughter was painfully conscious of his own observation  she sat motionless with her eyes bent down staring at her open fan deeply flushed shrinking together as if to minimise the indiscretion of which she confessed herself guilty  the doctor almost pitied her  poor catherine was not defiant she had no genius for bravado and as she felt that her father viewed her companions attentions with an unsympathising eye there was nothing but discomfort for her in the accident of seeming to challenge him the doctor felt indeed so sorry for her that he turned away to spare her the sense of being watched and he was so intelligent a man that in his thoughts he rendered a sort of poetic justice to her situation  it must be deucedly pleasant for a plain inanimate girl like that to have a beautiful young fellow come and sit down beside her and whisper to her that he is her slaveif that is what this one whispers  no wonder she likes it and that she thinks me a cruel tyrant which of course she does though she is afraidshe hasnt the animation necessaryto admit it to herself  poor old catherine mused the doctor i verily believe she is capable of defending me when townsend abuses me  and the force of this reflexion for the moment was such in making him feel the natural opposition between his point of view and that of an infatuated child that he said to himself that he was perhaps after all taking things too hard and crying out before he was hurt he must not condemn morris townsend unheard  he had a great aversion to taking things too hard he thought that half the discomfort and many of the disappointments of life come from it and for an instant he asked himself whether possibly he did not appear ridiculous to this intelligent young man whose private perception of incongruities he suspected of being keen  at the end of a quarter of an hour catherine had got rid of him and townsend was now standing before the fireplace in conversation with mrs almond  we will try him again said the doctor  and he crossed the room and joined his sister and her companion making her a sign that she should leave the young man to him  she presently did so while morris looked at him smiling without a sign of evasiveness in his affable eye  hes amazingly conceited thought the doctor and then he said aloud  i am told you are looking out for a position  oh a position is more than i should presume to call it morris townsend answered  that sounds so fine  i should like some quiet worksomething to turn an honest penny  what sort of thing should you prefer  do you mean what am i fit for  very little i am afraid  i have nothing but my good right arm as they say in the melodramas  you are too modest said the doctor  in addition to your good right arm you have your subtle brain  i know nothing of you but what i see but i see by your physiognomy that you are extremely intelligent  ah townsend murmured i dont know what to answer when you say that  you advise me then not to despair  and he looked at his interlocutor as if the question might have a double meaning  the doctor caught the look and weighed it a moment before he replied  i should be very sorry to admit that a robust and welldisposed young man need ever despair  if he doesnt succeed in one thing he can try another  only i should add he should choose his line with discretion  ah yes with discretion morris townsend repeated sympathetically well i have been indiscreet formerly but i think i have got over it  i am very steady now  and he stood a moment looking down at his remarkably neat shoes  then at last were you kindly intending to propose something for my advantage he inquired looking up and smiling  damn his impudence the doctor exclaimed privately  but in a moment he reflected that he himself had after all touched first upon this delicate point and that his words might have been construed as an offer of assistance  i have no particular proposal to make he presently said but it occurred to me to let you know that i have you in my mind  sometimes one hears of opportunities for instanceshould you object to leaving new yorkto going to a distance  i am afraid i shouldnt be able to manage that  i must seek my fortune here or nowhere  you see added morris townsend i have tiesi have responsibilities here  i have a sister a widow from whom i have been separated for a long time and to whom i am almost everything  i shouldnt like to say to her that i must leave her she rather depends upon me you see  ah thats very proper family feeling is very proper said dr sloper  i often think there is not enough of it in our city  i think i have heard of your sister  it is possible but i rather doubt it she lives so very quietly  as quietly you mean the doctor went on with a short laugh as a lady may do who has several young children  ah my little nephews and niecesthats the very point  i am helping to bring them up said morris townsend  i am a kind of amateur tutor i give them lessons  thats very proper as i say but it is hardly a career  it wont make my fortune the young man confessed  you must not be too much bent on a fortune said the doctor  but i assure you i will keep you in mind i wont lose sight of you  if my situation becomes desperate i shall perhaps take the liberty of reminding you morris rejoined raising his voice a little with a brighter smile as his interlocutor turned away  before he left the house the doctor had a few words with mrs almond  i should like to see his sister he said  what do you call her mrs montgomery  i should like to have a little talk with her  i will try and manage it mrs almond responded  i will take the first opportunity of inviting her and you shall come and meet her unless indeed mrs almond added she first takes it into her head to be sick and to send for you  ah no not that she must have trouble enough without that  but it would have its advantages for then i should see the children  i should like very much to see the children  you are very thorough  do you want to catechise them about their uncle  precisely  their uncle tells me he has charge of their education that he saves their mother the expense of schoolbills  i should like to ask them a few questions in the commoner branches  he certainly has not the cut of a schoolmaster mrs almond said to herself a short time afterwards as she saw morris townsend in a corner bending over her niece who was seated  and there was indeed nothing in the young mans discourse at this moment that savoured of the pedagogue  will you meet me somewhere tomorrow or next day he said in a low tone to catherine  meet you she asked lifting her frightened eyes  i have something particular to say to youvery particular  cant you come to the house  cant you say it there  townsend shook his head gloomily  i cant enter your doors again  oh mr townsend murmured catherine  she trembled as she wondered what had happened whether her father had forbidden it  i cant in selfrespect said the young man  your father has insulted me  insulted you  he has taunted me with my poverty  oh you are mistakenyou misunderstood him  catherine spoke with energy getting up from her chair  perhaps i am too proudtoo sensitive  but would you have me otherwise he asked tenderly  where my father is concerned you must not be sure  he is full of goodness said catherine  he laughed at me for having no position  i took it quietly but only because he belongs to you  i dont know said catherine i dont know what he thinks  i am sure he means to be kind  you must not be too proud  i will be proud only of you morris answered  will you meet me in the square in the afternoon  a great blush on catherines part had been the answer to the declaration i have just quoted  she turned away heedless of his question  will you meet me he repeated  it is very quiet there no one need see ustoward dusk  it is you who are unkind it is you who laugh when you say such things as that  my dear girl the young man murmured  you know how little there is in me to be proud of  i am ugly and stupid  morris greeted this remark with an ardent murmur in which she recognised nothing articulate but an assurance that she was his own dearest  but she went on  i am not eveni am not even  and she paused a moment  you are not what  i am not even brave  ah then if you are afraid what shall we do  she hesitated a while then at lastyou must come to the house she said i am not afraid of that  i would rather it were in the square the young man urged  you know how empty it is often  no one will see us  i dont care who sees us  but leave me now  he left her resignedly he had got what he wanted  fortunately he was ignorant that half an hour later going home with her father and feeling him near the poor girl in spite of her sudden declaration of courage began to tremble again  her father said nothing but she had an idea his eyes were fixed upon her in the darkness  mrs penniman also was silent morris townsend had told her that her niece preferred unromantically an interview in a chintzcovered parlour to a sentimental tryst beside a fountain sheeted with dead leaves and she was lost in wonderment at the oddityalmost the perversity of the choice    chapter x    catherine received the young man the next day on the ground she had chosenamid the chaste upholstery of a new york drawingroom furnished in the fashion of fifty years ago  morris had swallowed his pride and made the effort necessary to cross the threshold of her too derisive parentan act of magnanimity which could not fail to render him doubly interesting  we must settle somethingwe must take a line he declared passing his hand through his hair and giving a glance at the long narrow mirror which adorned the space between the two windows and which had at its base a little gilded bracket covered by a thin slab of white marble supporting in its turn a backgammon board folded together in the shape of two volumes two shining folios inscribed in letters of greenish gilt history of england  if morris had been pleased to describe the master of the house as a heartless scoffer it is because he thought him too much on his guard and this was the easiest way to express his own dissatisfactiona dissatisfaction which he had made a point of concealing from the doctor  it will probably seem to the reader however that the doctors vigilance was by no means excessive and that these two young people had an open field  their intimacy was now considerable and it may appear that for a shrinking and retiring person our heroine had been liberal of her favours  the young man within a few days had made her listen to things for which she had not supposed that she was prepared having a lively foreboding of difficulties he proceeded to gain as much ground as possible in the present  he remembered that fortune favours the brave and even if he had forgotten it mrs penniman would have remembered it for him  mrs penniman delighted of all things in a drama and she flattered herself that a drama would now be enacted  combining as she did the zeal of the prompter with the impatience of the spectator she had long since done her utmost to pull up the curtain  she too expected to figure in the performance to be the confidante the chorus to speak the epilogue  it may even be said that there were times when she lost sight altogether of the modest heroine of the play in the contemplation of certain great passages which would naturally occur between the hero and herself  what morris had told catherine at last was simply that he loved her or rather adored her  virtually he had made known as much already his visits had been a series of eloquent intimations of it  but now he had affirmed it in lovers vows and as a memorable sign of it he had passed his arm round the girls waist and taken a kiss  this happy certitude had come sooner than catherine expected and she had regarded it very naturally as a priceless treasure  it may even be doubted whether she had ever definitely expected to possess it she had not been waiting for it and she had never said to herself that at a given moment it must come  as i have tried to explain she was not eager and exacting she took what was given her from day to day and if the delightful custom of her lovers visits which yielded her a happiness in which confidence and timidity were strangely blended had suddenly come to an end she would not only not have spoken of herself as one of the forsaken but she would not have thought of herself as one of the disappointed  after morris had kissed her the last time he was with her as a ripe assurance of his devotion she begged him to go away to leave her alone to let her think  morris went away taking another kiss first  but catherines meditations had lacked a certain coherence  she felt his kisses on her lips and on her cheeks for a long time afterwards the sensation was rather an obstacle than an aid to reflexion  she would have liked to see her situation all clearly before her to make up her mind what she should do if as she feared her father should tell her that he disapproved of morris townsend  but all that she could see with any vividness was that it was terribly strange that anyone should disapprove of him that there must in that case be some mistake some mystery which in a little while would be set at rest  she put off deciding and choosing before the vision of a conflict with her father she dropped her eyes and sat motionless holding her breath and waiting it made her heart beat it was intensely painful  when morris kissed her and said these thingsthat also made her heart beat but this was worse and it frightened her  nevertheless today when the young man spoke of settling something taking a line she felt that it was the truth and she answered very simply and without hesitating  we must do our duty she said we must speak to my father  i will do it tonight you must do it tomorrow  it is very good of you to do it first morris answered  the young manthe happy lovergenerally does that  but just as you please  it pleased catherine to think that she should be brave for his sake and in her satisfaction she even gave a little smile  women have more tact she said they ought to do it first  they are more conciliating they can persuade better  you will need all your powers of persuasion  but after all morris added you are irresistible  please dont speak that wayand promise me this  tomorrow when you talk with father you will be very gentle and respectful  as much so as possible morris promised  it wont be much use but i shall try  i certainly would rather have you easily than have to fight for you  dont talk about fighting we shall not fight  ah we must be prepared morris rejoined you especially because for you it must come hardest  do you know the first thing your father will say to you  no morris please tell me  he will tell you i am mercenary  mercenary  its a big word but it means a low thing  it means that i am after your money  oh murmured catherine softly  the exclamation was so deprecating and touching that morris indulged in another little demonstration of affection  but he will be sure to say it he added  it will be easy to be prepared for that catherine said  i shall simply say that he is mistakenthat other men may be that way but that you are not  you must make a great point of that for it will be his own great point  catherine looked at her lover a minute and then she said i shall persuade him  but i am glad we shall be rich she added  morris turned away looking into the crown of his hat  no its a misfortune he said at last  it is from that our difficulty will come  well if it is the worst misfortune we are not so unhappy  many people would not think it so bad  i will persuade him and after that we shall be very glad we have money  morris townsend listened to this robust logic in silence  i will leave my defence to you its a charge that a man has to stoop to defend himself from  catherine on her side was silent for a while she was looking at him while he looked with a good deal of fixedness out of the window morris she said abruptly are you very sure you love me  he turned round and in a moment he was bending over her  my own dearest can you doubt it  i have only known it five days she said but now it seems to me as if i could never do without it  you will never be called upon to try  and he gave a little tender reassuring laugh  then in a moment he added there is something you must tell me too  she had closed her eyes after the last word she uttered and kept them closed and at this she nodded her head without opening them  you must tell me he went on that if your father is dead against me if he absolutely forbids our marriage you will still be faithful  catherine opened her eyes gazing at him and she could give no better promise than what he read there  you will cleave to me said morris  you know you are your own mistressyou are of age  ah morris she murmured for all answer  or rather not for all for she put her hand into his own  he kept it a while and presently he kissed her again  this is all that need be recorded of their conversation but mrs penniman if she had been present would probably have admitted that it was as well it had not taken place beside the fountain in washington square    chapter xi    catherine listened for her father when he came in that evening and she heard him go to his study  she sat quiet though her heart was beating fast for nearly half an hour then she went and knocked at his doora ceremony without which she never crossed the threshold of this apartment  on entering it now she found him in his chair beside the fire entertaining himself with a cigar and the evening paper  i have something to say to you she began very gently and she sat down in the first place that offered  i shall be very happy to hear it my dear said her father  he waitedwaited looking at her while she stared in a long silence at the fire  he was curious and impatient for he was sure she was going to speak of morris townsend but he let her take her own time for he was determined to be very mild  i am engaged to be married catherine announced at last still staring at the fire  the doctor was startled the accomplished fact was more than he had expected  but he betrayed no surprise  you do right to tell me he simply said  and who is the happy mortal whom you have honoured with your choice  mr morris townsend  and as she pronounced her lovers name catherine looked at him  what she saw was her fathers still grey eye and his clearcut definite smile  she contemplated these objects for a moment and then she looked back at the fire it was much warmer  when was this arrangement made the doctor asked  this afternoontwo hours ago  was mr townsend here  yes father in the front parlour  she was very glad that she was not obliged to tell him that the ceremony of their betrothal had taken place out there under the bare ailantustrees  is it serious said the doctor  very serious father  her father was silent a moment  mr townsend ought to have told me  he means to tell you tomorrow  after i know all about it from you  he ought to have told me before  does he think i didnt carebecause i left you so much liberty  oh no said catherine he knew you would care  and we have been so much obliged to you forfor the liberty  the doctor gave a short laugh  you might have made a better use of it catherine  please dont say that father the girl urged softly fixing her dull and gentle eyes upon him  he puffed his cigar awhile meditatively  you have gone very fast he said at last  yes catherine answered simply i think we have  her father glanced at her an instant removing his eyes from the fire  i dont wonder mr townsend likes you  you are so simple and so good  i dont know why it isbut he does like me  i am sure of that  and are you very fond of mr townsend  i like him very much of courseor i shouldnt consent to marry him  but you have known him a very short time my dear  oh said catherine with some eagerness it doesnt take long to like a personwhen once you begin  you must have begun very quickly  was it the first time you saw himthat night at your aunts party  i dont know father the girl answered  i cant tell you about that  of course thats your own affair  you will have observed that i have acted on that principle  i have not interfered i have left you your liberty i have remembered that you are no longer a little girl that you have arrived at years of discretion  i feel very oldand very wise said catherine smiling faintly  i am afraid that before long you will feel older and wiser yet  i dont like your engagement  ah catherine exclaimed softly getting up from her chair  no my dear  i am sorry to give you pain but i dont like it  you should have consulted me before you settled it  i have been too easy with you and i feel as if you had taken advantage of my indulgence most decidedly you should have spoken to me first  catherine hesitated a moment and thenit was because i was afraid you wouldnt like it she confessed  ah there it is  you had a bad conscience  no i have not a bad conscience father the girl cried out with considerable energy  please dont accuse me of anything so dreadful  these words in fact represented to her imagination something very terrible indeed something base and cruel which she associated with malefactors and prisoners  it was because i was afraidafraid she went on  if you were afraid it was because you had been foolish  i was afraid you didnt like mr townsend  you were quite right  i dont like him  dear father you dont know him said catherine in a voice so timidly argumentative that it might have touched him  very true i dont know him intimately  but i know him enough  i have my impression of him  you dont know him either  she stood before the fire with her hands lightly clasped in front of her and her father leaning back in his chair and looking up at her made this remark with a placidity that might have been irritating  i doubt however whether catherine was irritated though she broke into a vehement protest  i dont know him she cried  why i know himbetter than i have ever known any one  you know a part of himwhat he has chosen to show you  but you dont know the rest  the rest  what is the rest  whatever it may be  there is sure to be plenty of it  i know what you mean said catherine remembering how morris had forewarned her  you mean that he is mercenary  her father looked up at her still with his cold quiet reasonable eye  if i meant it my dear i should say it  but there is an error i wish particularly to avoidthat of rendering mr townsend more interesting to you by saying hard things about him  i wont think them hard if they are true said catherine  if you dont you will be a remarkably sensible young woman  they will be your reasons at any rate and you will want me to hear your reasons  the doctor smiled a little  very true  you have a perfect right to ask for them  and he puffed his cigar a few moments  very well then without accusing mr townsend of being in love only with your fortuneand with the fortune that you justly expecti will say that there is every reason to suppose that these good things have entered into his calculation more largely than a tender solicitude for your happiness strictly requires  there is of course nothing impossible in an intelligent young man entertaining a disinterested affection for you  you are an honest amiable girl and an intelligent young man might easily find it out  but the principal thing that we know about this young manwho is indeed very intelligentleads us to suppose that however much he may value your personal merits he values your money more  the principal thing we know about him is that he has led a life of dissipation and has spent a fortune of his own in doing so  that is enough for me my dear  i wish you to marry a young man with other antecedentsa young man who could give positive guarantees  if morris townsend has spent his own fortune in amusing himself there is every reason to believe that he would spend yours  the doctor delivered himself of these remarks slowly deliberately with occasional pauses and prolongations of accent which made no great allowance for poor catherines suspense as to his conclusion she sat down at last with her head bent and her eyes still fixed upon him and strangely enoughi hardly know how to tell iteven while she felt that what he said went so terribly against her she admired his neatness and nobleness of expression  there was something hopeless and oppressive in having to argue with her father but she too on her side must try to be clear  he was so quiet he was not at all angry and she too must be quiet  but her very effort to be quiet made her tremble  that is not the principal thing we know about him she said and there was a touch of her tremor in her voice  there are other thingsmany other things  he has very high abilitieshe wants so much to do something  he is kind and generous and true said poor catherine who had not suspected hitherto the resources of her eloquence  and his fortunehis fortune that he spentwas very small  all the more reason he shouldnt have spent it cried the doctor getting up with a laugh  then as catherine who had also risen to her feet again stood there in her rather angular earnestness wishing so much and expressing so little he drew her towards him and kissed her  you wont think me cruel he said holding her a moment  this question was not reassuring it seemed to catherine on the contrary to suggest possibilities which made her feel sick  but she answered coherently enoughno dear father because if you knew how i feeland you must know you know everythingyou would be so kind so gentle  yes i think i know how you feel the doctor said  i will be very kindbe sure of that  and i will see mr townsend tomorrow meanwhile and for the present be so good as to mention to no one that you are engaged    chapter xii    on the morrow in the afternoon he stayed at home awaiting mr townsends calla proceeding by which it appeared to him justly perhaps for he was a very busy man that he paid catherines suitor great honour and gave both these young people so much the less to complain of  morris presented himself with a countenance sufficiently serenehe appeared to have forgotten the insult for which he had solicited catherines sympathy two evenings before and dr sloper lost no time in letting him know that he had been prepared for his visit  catherine told me yesterday what has been going on between you he said  you must allow me to say that it would have been becoming of you to give me notice of your intentions before they had gone so far  i should have done so morris answered if you had not had so much the appearance of leaving your daughter at liberty  she seems to me quite her own mistress  literally she is  but she has not emancipated herself morally quite so far i trust as to choose a husband without consulting me i have left her at liberty but i have not been in the least indifferent  the truth is that your little affair has come to a head with a rapidity that surprises me  it was only the other day that catherine made your acquaintance  it was not long ago certainly said morris with great gravity i admit that we have not been slow toto arrive at an understanding  but that was very natural from the moment we were sure of ourselvesand of each other  my interest in miss sloper began the first time i saw her  did it not by chance precede your first meeting the doctor asked  morris looked at him an instant  i certainly had already heard that she was a charming girl  a charming girlthats what you think her  assuredly  otherwise i should not be sitting here  the doctor meditated a moment  my dear young man he said at last you must be very susceptible  as catherines father i have i trust a just and tender appreciation of her many good qualities but i dont mind telling you that i have never thought of her as a charming girl and never expected any one else to do so  morris townsend received this statement with a smile that was not wholly devoid of deference  i dont know what i might think of her if i were her father  i cant put myself in that place  i speak from my own point of view  you speak very well said the doctor but that is not all that is necessary  i told catherine yesterday that i disapproved of her engagement  she let me know as much and i was very sorry to hear it  i am greatly disappointed  and morris sat in silence awhile looking at the floor  did you really expect i would say i was delighted and throw my daughter into your arms  oh no i had an idea you didnt like me  what gave you the idea  the fact that i am poor  that has a harsh sound said the doctor but it is about the truthspeaking of you strictly as a soninlaw  your absence of means of a profession of visible resources or prospects places you in a category from which it would be imprudent for me to select a husband for my daughter who is a weak young woman with a large fortune  in any other capacity i am perfectly prepared to like you as a soninlaw i abominate you  morris townsend listened respectfully  i dont think miss sloper is a weak woman he presently said  of course you must defend herits the least you can do  but i have known my child twenty years and you have known her six weeks even if she were not weak however you would still be a penniless man  ah yes that is my weakness  and therefore you mean i am mercenaryi only want your daughters money  i dont say that  i am not obliged to say it and to say it save under stress of compulsion would be very bad taste  i say simply that you belong to the wrong category  but your daughter doesnt marry a category townsend urged with his handsome smile  she marries an individualan individual whom she is so good as to say she loves  an individual who offers so little in return  is it possible to offer more than the most tender affection and a lifelong devotion the young man demanded  it depends how we take it  it is possible to offer a few other things besides and not only is it possible but its usual  a lifelong devotion is measured after the fact and meanwhile it is customary in these cases to give a few material securities  what are yours  a very handsome face and figure and a very good manner they are excellent as far as they go but they dont go far enough  there is one thing you should add to them said morris the word of a gentleman  the word of a gentleman that you will always love catherine  you must be a very fine gentleman to be sure of that  the word of a gentleman that i am not mercenary that my affection for miss sloper is as pure and disinterested a sentiment as was ever lodged in a human breast  i care no more for her fortune than for the ashes in that grate  i take notei take note said the doctor  but having done so i turn to our category again  even with that solemn vow on your lips you take your place in it  there is nothing against you but an accident if you will but with my thirty years medical practice i have seen that accidents may have farreaching consequences  morris smoothed his hatit was already remarkably glossyand continued to display a selfcontrol which as the doctor was obliged to admit was extremely creditable to him  but his disappointment was evidently keen  is there nothing i can do to make you believe in me  if there were i should be sorry to suggest it fordont you see i dont want to believe in you said the doctor smiling  i would go and dig in the fields  that would be foolish  i will take the first work that offers tomorrow  do so by all meansbut for your own sake not for mine  i see you think i am an idler morris exclaimed a little too much in the tone of a man who has made a discovery  but he saw his error immediately and blushed  it doesnt matter what i think when once i have told you i dont think of you as a soninlaw  but morris persisted  you think i would squander her money  the doctor smiled  it doesnt matter as i say but i plead guilty to that  thats because i spent my own i suppose said morris  i frankly confess that  i have been wild  i have been foolish  i will tell you every crazy thing i ever did if you like  there were some great follies among the numberi have never concealed that  but i have sown my wild oats  isnt there some proverb about a reformed rake i was not a rake but i assure you i have reformed  it is better to have amused oneself for a while and have done with it  your daughter would never care for a milksop and i will take the liberty of saying that you would like one quite as little  besides between my money and hers there is a great difference  i spent my own it was because it was my own that i spent it  and i made no debts when it was gone i stopped  i dont owe a penny in the world  allow me to inquire what you are living on nowthough i admit the doctor added that the question on my part is inconsistent  i am living on the remnants of my property said morris townsend  thank you the doctor gravely replied  yes certainly morriss selfcontrol was laudable  even admitting i attach an undue importance to miss slopers fortune he went on would not that be in itself an assurance that i should take much care of it  that you should take too much care would be quite as bad as that you should take too little  catherine might suffer as much by your economy as by your extravagance  i think you are very unjust  the young man made this declaration decently civilly without violence  it is your privilege to think so and i surrender my reputation to you  i certainly dont flatter myself i gratify you  dont you care a little to gratify your daughter  do you enjoy the idea of making her miserable  i am perfectly resigned to her thinking me a tyrant for a twelvemonth  for a twelvemonth exclaimed morris with a laugh  for a lifetime then  she may as well be miserable in that way as in the other  here at last morris lost his temper  ah you are not polite sir he cried  you push me to ityou argue too much  i have a great deal at stake  well whatever it is said the doctor you have lost it  are you sure of that asked morris are you sure your daughter will give me up  i mean of course you have lost it as far as i am concerned  as for catherines giving you upno i am not sure of it  but as i shall strongly recommend it as i have a great fund of respect and affection in my daughters mind to draw upon and as she has the sentiment of duty developed in a very high degree i think it extremely possible  morris townsend began to smooth his hat again  i too have a fund of affection to draw upon he observed at last  the doctor at this point showed his own first symptoms of irritation do you mean to defy me  call it what you please sir  i mean not to give your daughter up  the doctor shook his head  i havent the least fear of your pining away your life  you are made to enjoy it  morris gave a laugh  your opposition to my marriage is all the more cruel then  do you intend to forbid your daughter to see me again  she is past the age at which people are forbidden and i am not a father in an oldfashioned novel  but i shall strongly urge her to break with you  i dont think she will said morris townsend  perhaps not  but i shall have done what i could  she has gone too far morris went on  to retreat  then let her stop where she is  too far to stop i mean  the doctor looked at him a moment morris had his hand on the door there is a great deal of impertinence in your saying it  i will say no more sir morris answered and making his bow he left the room    chapter xiii    it may be thought the doctor was too positive and mrs almond intimated as much  but as he said he had his impression it seemed to him sufficient and he had no wish to modify it  he had passed his life in estimating people it was part of the medical trade and in nineteen cases out of twenty he was right  perhaps mr townsend is the twentieth case mrs almond suggested  perhaps he is though he doesnt look to me at all like a twentieth case  but i will give him the benefit of the doubt and to make sure i will go and talk with mrs montgomery  she will almost certainly tell me i have done right but it is just possible that she will prove to me that i have made the greatest mistake of my life if she does i will beg mr townsends pardon  you neednt invite her to meet me as you kindly proposed i will write her a frank letter telling her how matters stand and asking leave to come and see her  i am afraid the frankness will be chiefly on your side  the poor little woman will stand up for her brother whatever he may be  whatever he may be  i doubt that  people are not always so fond of their brothers  ah said mrs almond when its a question of thirty thousand a year coming into a family  if she stands up for him on account of the money she will be a humbug  if she is a humbug i shall see it  if i see it i wont waste time with her  she is not a humbugshe is an exemplary woman  she will not wish to play her brother a trick simply because he is selfish  if she is worth talking to she will sooner play him a trick than that he should play catherine one  has she seen catherine by the waydoes she know her  not to my knowledge  mr townsend can have had no particular interest in bringing them together  if she is an exemplary woman no  but we shall see to what extent she answers your description  i shall be curious to hear her description of you said mrs almond with a laugh  and meanwhile how is catherine taking it  as she takes everythingas a matter of course  doesnt she make a noise  hasnt she made a scene  she is not scenic  i thought a lovelorn maiden was always scenic  a fantastic widow is more so  lavinia has made me a speech she thinks me very arbitrary  she has a talent for being in the wrong said mrs almond  but i am very sorry for catherine all the same  so am i  but she will get over it  you believe she will give him up  i count upon it  she has such an admiration for her father  oh we know all about that  but it only makes me pity her the more it makes her dilemma the more painful and the effort of choosing between you and her lover almost impossible  if she cant choose all the better  yes but he will stand there entreating her to choose and lavinia will pull on that side  i am glad she is not on my side she is capable of ruining an excellent cause  the day lavinia gets into your boat it capsizes but she had better be careful said the doctor  i will have no treason in my house  i suspect she will be careful for she is at bottom very much afraid of you  they are both afraid of meharmless as i am the doctor answered and it is on that that i buildon the salutary terror i inspire    chapter xiv    he wrote his frank letter to mrs montgomery who punctually answered it mentioning an hour at which he might present himself in the second avenue  she lived in a neat little house of red brick which had been freshly painted with the edges of the bricks very sharply marked out in white  it has now disappeared with its companions to make room for a row of structures more majestic  there were green shutters upon the windows without slats but pierced with little holes arranged in groups and before the house was a diminutive yard ornamented with a bush of mysterious character and surrounded by a low wooden paling painted in the same green as the shutters the place looked like a magnified babyhouse and might have been taken down from a shelf in a toyshop  dr sloper when he went to call said to himself as he glanced at the objects i have enumerated that mrs montgomery was evidently a thrifty and self respecting little personthe modest proportions of her dwelling seemed to indicate that she was of small staturewho took a virtuous satisfaction in keeping herself tidy and had resolved that since she might not be splendid she would at least be immaculate  she received him in a little parlour which was precisely the parlour he had expected  a small unspeckled bower ornamented with a desultory foliage of tissuepaper and with clusters of glass drops amid whichto carry out the analogythe temperature of the leafy season was maintained by means of a castiron stove emitting a dry blue flame and smelling strongly of varnish  the walls were embellished with engravings swathed in pink gauze and the tables ornamented with volumes of extracts from the poets usually bound in black cloth stamped with florid designs in jaundiced gilt  the doctor had time to take cognisance of these details for mrs montgomery whose conduct he pronounced under the circumstances inexcusable kept him waiting some ten minutes before she appeared  at last however she rustled in smoothing down a stiff poplin dress with a little frightened flush in a gracefullyrounded cheek  she was a small plump fair woman with a bright clear eye and an extraordinary air of neatness and briskness  but these qualities were evidently combined with an unaffected humility and the doctor gave her his esteem as soon as he had looked at her  a brave little person with lively perceptions and yet a disbelief in her own talent for social as distinguished from practical affairsthis was his rapid mental resume of mrs montgomery who as he saw was flattered by what she regarded as the honour of his visit  mrs montgomery in her little red house in the second avenue was a person for whom dr sloper was one of the great men one of the fine gentlemen of new york and while she fixed her agitated eyes upon him while she clasped her mittened hands together in her glossy poplin lap she had the appearance of saying to herself that he quite answered her idea of what a distinguished guest would naturally be she apologised for being late but he interrupted her  it doesnt matter he said for while i sat here i had time to think over what i wish to say to you and to make up my mind how to begin  oh do begin murmured mrs montgomery  it is not so easy said the doctor smiling  you will have gathered from my letter that i wish to ask you a few questions and you may not find it very comfortable to answer them  yes i have thought what i should say  it is not very easy  but you must understand my situationmy state of mind  your brother wishes to marry my daughter and i wish to find out what sort of a young man he is  a good way to do so seemed to be to come and ask you which i have proceeded to do  mrs montgomery evidently took the situation very seriously she was in a state of extreme moral concentration  she kept her pretty eyes which were illumined by a sort of brilliant modesty attached to his own countenance and evidently paid the most earnest attention to each of his words  her expression indicated that she thought his idea of coming to see her a very superior conception but that she was really afraid to have opinions on strange subjects  i am extremely glad to see you she said in a tone which seemed to admit at the same time that this had nothing to do with the question  the doctor took advantage of this admission  i didnt come to see you for your pleasure i came to make you say disagreeable things and you cant like that  what sort of a gentleman is your brother  mrs montgomerys illuminated gaze grew vague and began to wander she smiled a little and for some time made no answer so that the doctor at last became impatient  and her answer when it came was not satisfactory  it is difficult to talk about ones brother  not when one is fond of him and when one has plenty of good to say  yes even then when a good deal depends on it said mrs montgomery  nothing depends on it for you  i mean forfor and she hesitated  for your brother himself  i see  i mean for miss sloper said mrs montgomery  the doctor liked this it had the accent of sincerity  exactly thats the point if my poor girl should marry your brother everythingas regards her happinesswould depend on his being a good fellow  she is the best creature in the world and she could never do him a grain of injury he on the other hand if he should not be all that we desire might make her very miserable  that is why i want you to throw some light upon his character you know  of course you are not bound to do it my daughter whom you have never seen is nothing to you and i possibly am only an indiscreet and impertinent old man  it is perfectly open to you to tell me that my visit is in very bad taste and that i had better go about my business  but i dont think you will do this because i think we shall interest you my poor girl and i  i am sure that if you were to see catherine she would interest you very much  i dont mean because she is interesting in the usual sense of the word but because you would feel sorry for her  she is so soft so simpleminded she would be such an easy victim  a bad husband would have remarkable facilities for making her miserable for she would have neither the intelligence nor the resolution to get the better of him and yet she would have an exaggerated power of suffering  i see added the doctor with his most insinuating his most professional laugh you are already interested  i have been interested from the moment he told me he was engaged said mrs montgomery  ah he says thathe calls it an engagement  oh he has told me you didnt like it  did he tell you that i dont like him  yes he told me that too  i said i couldnt help it added mrs montgomery  of course you cant  but what you can do is to tell me i am right to give me an attestation as it were  and the doctor accompanied this remark with another professional smile  mrs montgomery however smiled not at all it was obvious that she could not take the humorous view of his appeal  that is a good deal to ask she said at last  there can be no doubt of that and i must in conscience remind you of the advantages a young man marrying my daughter would enjoy  she has an income of ten thousand dollars in her own right left her by her mother if she marries a husband i approve she will come into almost twice as much more at my death  mrs montgomery listened in great earnestness to this splendid financial statement she had never heard thousands of dollars so familiarly talked about  she flushed a little with excitement your daughter will be immensely rich she said softly  preciselythats the bother of it  and if morris should marry her hehe  and she hesitated timidly  he would be master of all that money  by no means  he would be master of the ten thousand a year that she has from her mother but i should leave every penny of my own fortune earned in the laborious exercise of my profession to public institutions  mrs montgomery dropped her eyes at this and sat for some time gazing at the straw matting which covered her floor  i suppose it seems to you said the doctor laughing that in so doing i should play your brother a very shabby trick  not at all  that is too much money to get possession of so easily by marrying  i dont think it would be right  its right to get all one can  but in this case your brother wouldnt be able  if catherine marries without my consent she doesnt get a penny from my own pocket  is that certain asked mrs montgomery looking up  as certain as that i sit here  even if she should pine away  even if she should pine to a shadow which isnt probable  does morris know this  i shall be most happy to inform him the doctor exclaimed  mrs montgomery resumed her meditations and her visitor who was prepared to give time to the affair asked himself whether in spite of her little conscientious air she was not playing into her brothers hands  at the same time he was half ashamed of the ordeal to which he had subjected her and was touched by the gentleness with which she bore it  if she were a humbug he said she would get angry unless she be very deep indeed  it is not probable that she is as deep as that  what makes you dislike morris so much she presently asked emerging from her reflexions  i dont dislike him in the least as a friend as a companion  he seems to me a charming fellow and i should think he would be excellent company  i dislike him exclusively as a soninlaw  if the only office of a soninlaw were to dine at the paternal table i should set a high value upon your brother  he dines capitally  but that is a small part of his function which in general is to be a protector and caretaker of my child who is singularly illadapted to take care of herself  it is there that he doesnt satisfy me  i confess i have nothing but my impression to go by but i am in the habit of trusting my impression  of course you are at liberty to contradict it flat  he strikes me as selfish and shallow  mrs montgomerys eyes expanded a little and the doctor fancied he saw the light of admiration in them  i wonder you have discovered he is selfish she exclaimed  do you think he hides it so well  very well indeed said mrs montgomery  and i think we are all rather selfish she added quickly  i think so too but i have seen people hide it better than he  you see i am helped by a habit i have of dividing people into classes into types  i may easily be mistaken about your brother as an individual but his type is written on his whole person  he is very goodlooking said mrs montgomery  the doctor eyed her a moment  you women are all the same  but the type to which your brother belongs was made to be the ruin of you and you were made to be its handmaids and victims  the sign of the type in question is the determinationsometimes terrible in its quiet intensityto accept nothing of life but its pleasures and to secure these pleasures chiefly by the aid of your complaisant sex young men of this class never do anything for themselves that they can get other people to do for them and it is the infatuation the devotion the superstition of others that keeps them going  these others in ninetynine cases out of a hundred are women  what our young friends chiefly insist upon is that some one else shall suffer for them and women do that sort of thing as you must know wonderfully well  the doctor paused a moment and then he added abruptly you have suffered immensely for your brother  this exclamation was abrupt as i say but it was also perfectly calculated  the doctor had been rather disappointed at not finding his compact and comfortable little hostess surrounded in a more visible degree by the ravages of morris townsends immorality but he had said to himself that this was not because the young man had spared her but because she had contrived to plaster up her wounds they were aching there behind the varnished stove the festooned engravings beneath her own neat little poplin bosom and if he could only touch the tender spot she would make a movement that would betray her  the words i have just quoted were an attempt to put his finger suddenly upon the place and they had some of the success that he looked for  the tears sprang for a moment to mrs montgomerys eyes and she indulged in a proud little jerk of the head  i dont know how you have found that out she exclaimed  by a philosophic trickby what they call induction  you know you have always your option of contradicting me  but kindly answer me a question  dont you give your brother money  i think you ought to answer that  yes i have given him money said mrs montgomery  and you have not had much to give him  she was silent a moment  if you ask me for a confession of poverty that is easily made  i am very poor  one would never suppose it from youryour charming house said the doctor  i learned from my sister that your income was moderate and your family numerous  i have five children mrs montgomery observed but i am happy to say i can bring them up decently  of course you canaccomplished and devoted as you are  but your brother has counted them over i suppose  counted them over  he knows there are five i mean  he tells me it is he that brings them up  mrs montgomery stared a moment and then quicklyoh yes he teaches them spanish  the doctor laughed out  that must take a great deal off your hands your brother also knows of course that you have very little money  i have often told him so mrs montgomery exclaimed more unreservedly than she had yet spoken  she was apparently taking some comfort in the doctors clairvoyancy  which means that you have often occasion to and that he often sponges on you  excuse the crudity of my language i simply express a fact  i dont ask you how much of your money he has had it is none of my business  i have ascertained what i suspectedwhat i wished  and the doctor got up gently smoothing his hat  your brother lives on you he said as he stood there  mrs montgomery quickly rose from her chair following her visitors movements with a look of fascination  but then with a certain inconsequencei have never complained of him she said  you neednt protestyou have not betrayed him  but i advise you not to give him any more money  dont you see it is in my interest that he should marry a rich person she asked  if as you say he lives on me i can only wish to get rid of him and to put obstacles in the way of his marrying is to increase my own difficulties  i wish very much you would come to me with your difficulties said the doctor  certainly if i throw him back on your hands the least i can do is to help you to bear the burden  if you will allow me to say so then i shall take the liberty of placing in your hands for the present a certain fund for your brothers support  mrs montgomery stared she evidently thought he was jesting but she presently saw that he was not and the complication of her feelings became painful  it seems to me that i ought to be very much offended with you she murmured  because i have offered you money  thats a superstition said the doctor  you must let me come and see you again and we will talk about these things  i suppose that some of your children are girls  i have two little girls said mrs montgomery  well when they grow up and begin to think of taking husbands you will see how anxious you will be about the moral character of these gentlemen  then you will understand this visit of mine  ah you are not to believe that morriss moral character is bad  the doctor looked at her a little with folded arms  there is something i should greatly likeas a moral satisfaction  i should like to hear you sayhe is abominably selfish  the words came out with the grave distinctness of his voice and they seemed for an instant to create to poor mrs montgomerys troubled vision a material image  she gazed at it an instant and then she turned away  you distress me sir she exclaimed  he is after all my brother and his talents his talents  on these last words her voice quavered and before he knew it she had burst into tears  his talents are firstrate said the doctor  we must find a proper field for them  and he assured her most respectfully of his regret at having so greatly discomposed her  its all for my poor catherine he went on  you must know her and you will see  mrs montgomery brushed away her tears and blushed at having shed them  i should like to know your daughter she answered and then in an instantdont let her marry him  dr sloper went away with the words gently humming in his ears dont let her marry him  they gave him the moral satisfaction of which he had just spoken and their value was the greater that they had evidently cost a pang to poor little mrs montgomerys family pride    chapter xv    he had been puzzled by the way that catherine carried herself her attitude at this sentimental crisis seemed to him unnaturally passive  she had not spoken to him again after that scene in the library the day before his interview with morris and a week had elapsed without making any change in her manner  there was nothing in it that appealed for pity and he was even a little disappointed at her not giving him an opportunity to make up for his harshness by some manifestation of liberality which should operate as a compensation  he thought a little of offering to take her for a tour in europe but he was determined to do this only in case she should seem mutely to reproach him  he had an idea that she would display a talent for mute reproaches and he was surprised at not finding himself exposed to these silent batteries  she said nothing either tacitly or explicitly and as she was never very talkative there was now no especial eloquence in her reserve  and poor catherine was not sulkya style of behaviour for which she had too little histrionic talent she was simply very patient  of course she was thinking over her situation and she was apparently doing so in a deliberate and unimpassioned manner with a view of making the best of it  she will do as i have bidden her said the doctor and he made the further reflexion that his daughter was not a woman of a great spirit  i know not whether he had hoped for a little more resistance for the sake of a little more entertainment but he said to himself as he had said before that though it might have its momentary alarms paternity was after all not an exciting vocation  catherine meanwhile had made a discovery of a very different sort it had become vivid to her that there was a great excitement in trying to be a good daughter  she had an entirely new feeling which may be described as a state of expectant suspense about her own actions  she watched herself as she would have watched another person and wondered what she would do  it was as if this other person who was both herself and not herself had suddenly sprung into being inspiring her with a natural curiosity as to the performance of untested functions  i am glad i have such a good daughter said her father kissing her after the lapse of several days  i am trying to be good she answered turning away with a conscience not altogether clear  if there is anything you would like to say to me you know you must not hesitate  you neednt feel obliged to be so quiet  i shouldnt care that mr townsend should be a frequent topic of conversation but whenever you have anything particular to say about him i shall be very glad to hear it  thank you said catherine i have nothing particular at present  he never asked her whether she had seen morris again because he was sure that if this had been the case she would tell him  she had in fact not seen him she had only written him a long letter  the letter at least was long for her and it may be added that it was long for morris it consisted of five pages in a remarkably neat and handsome hand  catherines handwriting was beautiful and she was even a little proud of it she was extremely fond of copying and possessed volumes of extracts which testified to this accomplishment volumes which she had exhibited one day to her lover when the bliss of feeling that she was important in his eyes was exceptionally keen she told morris in writing that her father had expressed the wish that she should not see him again and that she begged he would not come to the house until she should have made up her mind  morris replied with a passionate epistle in which he asked to what in heavens name she wished to make up her mind  had not her mind been made up two weeks before and could it be possible that she entertained the idea of throwing him off  did she mean to break down at the very beginning of their ordeal after all the promises of fidelity she had both given and extracted  and he gave an account of his own interview with her fatheran account not identical at all points with that offered in these pages  he was terribly violent morris wrote but you know my selfcontrol  i have need of it all when i remember that i have it in my power to break in upon your cruel captivity  catherine sent him in answer to this a note of three lines  i am in great trouble do not doubt of my affection but let me wait a little and think  the idea of a struggle with her father of setting up her will against his own was heavy on her soul and it kept her formally submissive as a great physical weight keeps us motionless  it never entered into her mind to throw her lover off but from the first she tried to assure herself that there would be a peaceful way out of their difficulty  the assurance was vague for it contained no element of positive conviction that her father would change his mind  she only had an idea that if she should be very good the situation would in some mysterious manner improve  to be good she must be patient respectful abstain from judging her father too harshly and from committing any act of open defiance  he was perhaps right after all to think as he did by which catherine meant not in the least that his judgement of morriss motives in seeking to marry her was perhaps a just one but that it was probably natural and proper that conscientious parents should be suspicious and even unjust  there were probably people in the world as bad as her father supposed morris to be and if there were the slightest chance of morris being one of these sinister persons the doctor was right in taking it into account  of course he could not know what she knew how the purest love and truth were seated in the young mans eyes but heaven in its time might appoint a way of bringing him to such knowledge  catherine expected a good deal of heaven and referred to the skies the initiative as the french say in dealing with her dilemma  she could not imagine herself imparting any kind of knowledge to her father there was something superior even in his injustice and absolute in his mistakes  but she could at least be good and if she were only good enough heaven would invent some way of reconciling all thingsthe dignity of her fathers errors and the sweetness of her own confidence the strict performance of her filial duties and the enjoyment of morris townsends affection  poor catherine would have been glad to regard mrs penniman as an illuminating agent a part which this lady herself indeed was but imperfectly prepared to play  mrs penniman took too much satisfaction in the sentimental shadows of this little drama to have for the moment any great interest in dissipating them  she wished the plot to thicken and the advice that she gave her niece tended in her own imagination to produce this result  it was rather incoherent counsel and from one day to another it contradicted itself but it was pervaded by an earnest desire that catherine should do something striking  you must act my dear in your situation the great thing is to act said mrs penniman who found her niece altogether beneath her opportunities  mrs pennimans real hope was that the girl would make a secret marriage at which she should officiate as brideswoman or duenna  she had a vision of this ceremony being performed in some subterranean chapel subterranean chapels in new york were not frequent but mrs pennimans imagination was not chilled by triflesand of the guilty coupleshe liked to think of poor catherine and her suitor as the guilty couplebeing shuffled away in a fastwhirling vehicle to some obscure lodging in the suburbs where she would pay them in a thick veil clandestine visits where they would endure a period of romantic privation and where ultimately after she should have been their earthly providence their intercessor their advocate and their medium of communication with the world they should be reconciled to her brother in an artistic tableau in which she herself should be somehow the central figure  she hesitated as yet to recommend this course to catherine but she attempted to draw an attractive picture of it to morris townsend  she was in daily communication with the young man whom she kept informed by letters of the state of affairs in washington square  as he had been banished as she said from the house she no longer saw him but she ended by writing to him that she longed for an interview  this interview could take place only on neutral ground and she bethought herself greatly before selecting a place of meeting  she had an inclination for greenwood cemetery but she gave it up as too distant she could not absent herself for so long as she said without exciting suspicion  then she thought of the battery but that was rather cold and windy besides ones being exposed to intrusion from the irish emigrants who at this point alight with large appetites in the new world and at last she fixed upon an oyster saloon in the seventh avenue kept by a negroan establishment of which she knew nothing save that she had noticed it in passing  she made an appointment with morris townsend to meet him there and she went to the tryst at dusk enveloped in an impenetrable veil  he kept her waiting for half an hourhe had almost the whole width of the city to traversebut she liked to wait it seemed to intensify the situation  she ordered a cup of tea which proved excessively bad and this gave her a sense that she was suffering in a romantic cause  when morris at last arrived they sat together for half an hour in the duskiest corner of a back shop and it is hardly too much to say that this was the happiest halfhour that mrs penniman had known for years  the situation was really thrilling and it scarcely seemed to her a false note when her companion asked for an oyster stew and proceeded to consume it before her eyes  morris indeed needed all the satisfaction that stewed oysters could give him for it may be intimated to the reader that he regarded mrs penniman in the light of a fifth wheel to his coach  he was in a state of irritation natural to a gentleman of fine parts who had been snubbed in a benevolent attempt to confer a distinction upon a young woman of inferior characteristics and the insinuating sympathy of this somewhat desiccated matron appeared to offer him no practical relief  he thought her a humbug and he judged of humbugs with a good deal of confidence  he had listened and made himself agreeable to her at first in order to get a footing in washington square and at present he needed all his selfcommand to be decently civil  it would have gratified him to tell her that she was a fantastic old woman and that he should like to put her into an omnibus and send her home  we know however that morris possessed the virtue of selfcontrol and he had moreover the constant habit of seeking to be agreeable so that although mrs pennimans demeanour only exasperated his already unquiet nerves he listened to her with a sombre deference in which she found much to admire    chapter xvi    they had of course immediately spoken of catherine  did she send me a message oror anything morris asked  he appeared to think that she might have sent him a trinket or a lock of her hair  mrs penniman was slightly embarrassed for she had not told her niece of her intended expedition  not exactly a message she said i didnt ask her for one because i was afraid toto excite her  i am afraid she is not very excitable  and morris gave a smile of some bitterness  she is better than that  she is steadfastshe is true  do you think she will hold fast then  to the death  oh i hope it wont come to that said morris  we must be prepared for the worst and that is what i wish to speak to you about  what do you call the worst  well said mrs penniman my brothers hard intellectual nature  oh the devil  he is impervious to pity mrs penniman added by way of explanation  do you mean that he wont come round  he will never be vanquished by argument  i have studied him  he will be vanquished only by the accomplished fact  the accomplished fact  he will come round afterwards said mrs penniman with extreme significance  he cares for nothing but facts he must be met by facts  well rejoined morris it is a fact that i wish to marry his daughter  i met him with that the other day but he was not at all vanquished  mrs penniman was silent a little and her smile beneath the shadow of her capacious bonnet on the edge of which her black veil was arranged curtainwise fixed itself upon morriss face with a still more tender brilliancy  marry catherine first and meet him afterwards she exclaimed  do you recommend that asked the young man frowning heavily  she was a little frightened but she went on with considerable boldness  that is the way i see it  a private marriagea private marriage  she repeated the phrase because she liked it  do you mean that i should carry catherine off  what do they call itelope with her  it is not a crime when you are driven to it said mrs penniman my husband as i have told you was a distinguished clergyman one of the most eloquent men of his day  he once married a young couple that had fled from the house of the young ladys father  he was so interested in their story  he had no hesitation and everything came out beautifully  the father was afterwards reconciled and thought everything of the young man  mr penniman married them in the evening about seven oclock  the church was so dark you could scarcely see and mr penniman was intensely agitated he was so sympathetic  i dont believe he could have done it again  unfortunately catherine and i have not mr penniman to marry us said morris  no but you have me rejoined mrs penniman expressively  i cant perform the ceremony but i can help you  i can watch  the womans an idiot thought morris but he was obliged to say something different  it was not however materially more civil was it in order to tell me this that you requested i would meet you here  mrs penniman had been conscious of a certain vagueness in her errand and of not being able to offer him any very tangible reward for his long walk  i thought perhaps you would like to see one who is so near to catherine she observed with considerable majesty and also she added that you would value an opportunity of sending her something  morris extended his empty hands with a melancholy smile  i am greatly obliged to you but i have nothing to send  havent you a word asked his companion with her suggestive smile coming back  morris frowned again  tell her to hold fast he said rather curtly  that is a good worda noble word  it will make her happy for many days  she is very touching very brave mrs penniman went on arranging her mantle and preparing to depart  while she was so engaged she had an inspiration  she found the phrase that she could boldly offer as a vindication of the step she had taken  if you marry catherine at all risks she said you will give my brother a proof of your being what he pretends to doubt  what he pretends to doubt  dont you know what that is mrs penniman asked almost playfully  it does not concern me to know said morris grandly  of course it makes you angry  i despise it morris declared  ah you know what it is then said mrs penniman shaking her finger at him  he pretends that you likeyou like the money  morris hesitated a moment and then as if he spoke advisedlyi do like the money  ah but notbut not as he means it  you dont like it more than catherine  he leaned his elbows on the table and buried his head in his hands you torture me he murmured  and indeed this was almost the effect of the poor ladys too importunate interest in his situation  but she insisted on making her point  if you marry her in spite of him he will take for granted that you expect nothing of him and are prepared to do without it  and so he will see that you are disinterested  morris raised his head a little following this argument and what shall i gain by that  why that he will see that he has been wrong in thinking that you wished to get his money  and seeing that i wish he would go to the deuce with it he will leave it to a hospital  is that what you mean asked morris  no i dont mean that though that would be very grand mrs penniman quickly added  i mean that having done you such an injustice he will think it his duty at the end to make some amends  morris shook his head though it must be confessed he was a little struck with this idea  do you think he is so sentimental  he is not sentimental said mrs penniman but to be perfectly fair to him i think he has in his own narrow way a certain sense of duty  there passed through morris townsends mind a rapid wonder as to what he might even under a remote contingency be indebted to from the action of this principle in dr slopers breast and the inquiry exhausted itself in his sense of the ludicrous  your brother has no duties to me he said presently and i none to him  ah but he has duties to catherine  yes but you see that on that principle catherine has duties to him as well  mrs penniman got up with a melancholy sigh as if she thought him very unimaginative  she has always performed them faithfully and now do you think she has no duties to you  mrs penniman always even in conversation italicised her personal pronouns  it would sound harsh to say so  i am so grateful for her love morris added  i will tell her you said that  and now remember that if you need me i am there  and mrs penniman who could think of nothing more to say nodded vaguely in the direction of washington square  morris looked some moments at the sanded floor of the shop he seemed to be disposed to linger a moment  at last looking up with a certain abruptness it is your belief that if she marries me he will cut her off he asked  mrs penniman stared a little and smiled  why i have explained to you what i think would happenthat in the end it would be the best thing to do  you mean that whatever she does in the long run she will get the money  it doesnt depend upon her but upon you  venture to appear as disinterested as you are said mrs penniman ingeniously  morris dropped his eyes on the sanded floor again pondering this and she pursued  mr penniman and i had nothing and we were very happy catherine moreover has her mothers fortune which at the time my sisterinlaw married was considered a very handsome one  oh dont speak of that said morris and indeed it was quite superfluous for he had contemplated the fact in all its lights  austin married a wife with moneywhy shouldnt you  ah but your brother was a doctor morris objected  well all young men cant be doctors  i should think it an extremely loathsome profession said morris with an air of intellectual independence  then in a moment he went on rather inconsequently do you suppose there is a will already made in catherines favour  i suppose soeven doctors must die and perhaps a little in mine mrs penniman frankly added  and you believe he would certainly change itas regards catherine  yes and then change it back again  ah but one cant depend on that said morris  do you want to depend on it mrs penniman asked  morris blushed a little  well i am certainly afraid of being the cause of an injury to catherine  ah you must not be afraid  be afraid of nothing and everything will go well  and then mrs penniman paid for her cup of tea and morris paid for his oyster stew and they went out together into the dimlylighted wilderness of the seventh avenue  the dusk had closed in completely and the street lamps were separated by wide intervals of a pavement in which cavities and fissures played a disproportionate part  an omnibus emblazoned with strange pictures went tumbling over the dislocated cobblestones  how will you go home morris asked following this vehicle with an interested eye  mrs penniman had taken his arm  she hesitated a moment  i think this manner would be pleasant she said and she continued to let him feel the value of his support  so he walked with her through the devious ways of the west side of the town and through the bustle of gathering nightfall in populous streets to the quiet precinct of washington square  they lingered a moment at the foot of dr slopers white marble steps above which a spotless white door adorned with a glittering silver plate seemed to figure for morris the closed portal of happiness and then mrs pennimans companion rested a melancholy eye upon a lighted window in the upper part of the house  that is my roommy dear little room mrs penniman remarked  morris started  then i neednt come walking round the square to gaze at it  thats as you please  but catherines is behind two noble windows on the second floor  i think you can see them from the other street  i dont want to see them maam  and morris turned his back to the house  i will tell her you have been here at any rate said mrs penniman pointing to the spot where they stood and i will give her your messagethat she is to hold fast  oh yes of course  you know i write her all that  it seems to say more when it is spoken  and remember if you need me that i am there and mrs penniman glanced at the third floor  on this they separated and morris left to himself stood looking at the house a moment after which he turned away and took a gloomy walk round the square on the opposite side close to the wooden fence  then he came back and paused for a minute in front of dr slopers dwelling  his eyes travelled over it they even rested on the ruddy windows of mrs pennimans apartment  he thought it a devilish comfortable house    chapter xvii    mrs penniman told catherine that eveningthe two ladies were sitting in the back parlourthat she had had an interview with morris townsend and on receiving this news the girl started with a sense of pain  she felt angry for the moment it was almost the first time she had ever felt angry  it seemed to her that her aunt was meddlesome and from this came a vague apprehension that she would spoil something  i dont see why you should have seen him  i dont think it was right catherine said  i was so sorry for himit seemed to me some one ought to see him  no one but i said catherine who felt as if she were making the most presumptuous speech of her life and yet at the same time had an instinct that she was right in doing so  but you wouldnt my dear aunt lavinia rejoined and i didnt know what might have become of him  i have not seen him because my father has forbidden it catherine said very simply  there was a simplicity in this indeed which fairly vexed mrs penniman  if your father forbade you to go to sleep i suppose you would keep awake she commented  catherine looked at her  i dont understand you  you seem to be very strange  well my dear you will understand me some day  and mrs penniman who was reading the evening paper which she perused daily from the first line to the last resumed her occupation  she wrapped herself in silence she was determined catherine should ask her for an account of her interview with morris  but catherine was silent for so long that she almost lost patience and she was on the point of remarking to her that she was very heartless when the girl at last spoke  what did he say she asked  he said he is ready to marry you any day in spite of everything  catherine made no answer to this and mrs penniman almost lost patience again owing to which she at last volunteered the information that morris looked very handsome but terribly haggard  did he seem sad asked her niece  he was dark under the eyes said mrs penniman  so different from when i first saw him though i am not sure that if i had seen him in this condition the first time i should not have been even more struck with him  there is something brilliant in his very misery  this was to catherines sense a vivid picture and though she disapproved she felt herself gazing at it  where did you see him she asked presently  inin the bowery at a confectioners said mrs penniman who had a general idea that she ought to dissemble a little  whereabouts is the place catherine inquired after another pause  do you wish to go there my dear said her aunt  oh no  and catherine got up from her seat and went to the fire where she stood looking a while at the glowing coals  why are you so dry catherine mrs penniman said at last  so dry  so coldso irresponsive  the girl turned very quickly  did he say that  mrs penniman hesitated a moment  i will tell you what he said  he said he feared only one thingthat you would be afraid  afraid of what  afraid of your father  catherine turned back to the fire again and then after a pause she saidi am afraid of my father  mrs penniman got quickly up from her chair and approached her niece do you mean to give him up then  catherine for some time never moved she kept her eyes on the coals at last she raised her head and looked at her aunt  why do you push me so she asked  i dont push you  when have i spoken to you before  it seems to me that you have spoken to me several times  i am afraid it is necessary then catherine said mrs penniman with a good deal of solemnity  i am afraid you dont feel the importance  she paused a little catherine was looking at her the importance of not disappointing that gallant young heart  and mrs penniman went back to her chair by the lamp and with a little jerk picked up the evening paper again  catherine stood there before the fire with her hands behind her looking at her aunt to whom it seemed that the girl had never had just this dark fixedness in her gaze  i dont think you understand or that you know me she said  if i dont it is not wonderful you trust me so little  catherine made no attempt to deny this charge and for some time more nothing was said  but mrs pennimans imagination was restless and the evening paper failed on this occasion to enchain it  if you succumb to the dread of your fathers wrath she said i dont know what will become of us  did he tell you to say these things to me  he told me to use my influence  you must be mistaken said catherine  he trusts me  i hope he may never repent of it  and mrs penniman gave a little sharp slap to her newspaper  she knew not what to make of her niece who had suddenly become stern and contradictious  this tendency on catherines part was presently even more apparent you had much better not make any more appointments with mr townsend she said  i dont think it is right  mrs penniman rose with considerable majesty  my poor child are you jealous of me she inquired  oh aunt lavinia murmured catherine blushing  i dont think it is your place to teach me what is right  on this point catherine made no concession  it cant be right to deceive  i certainly have not deceived you  yes but i promised my father  i have no doubt you promised your father  but i have promised him nothing  catherine had to admit this and she did so in silence  i dont believe mr townsend himself likes it she said at last  doesnt like meeting me  not in secret  it was not in secret the place was full of people  but it was a secret placeaway off in the bowery  mrs penniman flinched a little  gentlemen enjoy such things she remarked presently  i know what gentlemen like  my father wouldnt like it if he knew  pray do you propose to inform him mrs penniman inquired  no aunt lavinia  but please dont do it again  if i do it again you will inform him  is that what you mean  i do not share your dread of my brother i have always known how to defend my own position  but i shall certainly never again take any step on your behalf you are much too thankless  i knew you were not a spontaneous nature but i believed you were firm and i told your father that he would find you so  i am disappointedbut your father will not be  and with this mrs penniman offered her niece a brief goodnight and withdrew to her own apartment    chapter xviii    catherine sat alone by the parlour firesat there for more than an hour lost in her meditations  her aunt seemed to her aggressive and foolish and to see it so clearlyto judge mrs penniman so positivelymade her feel old and grave  she did not resent the imputation of weakness it made no impression on her for she had not the sense of weakness and she was not hurt at not being appreciated she had an immense respect for her father and she felt that to displease him would be a misdemeanour analogous to an act of profanity in a great temple but her purpose had slowly ripened and she believed that her prayers had purified it of its violence  the evening advanced and the lamp burned dim without her noticing it her eyes were fixed upon her terrible plan  she knew her father was in his studythat he had been there all the evening from time to time she expected to hear him move  she thought he would perhaps come as he sometimes came into the parlour  at last the clock struck eleven and the house was wrapped in silence the servants had gone to bed  catherine got up and went slowly to the door of the library where she waited a moment motionless  then she knocked and then she waited again  her father had answered her but she had not the courage to turn the latch  what she had said to her aunt was true enoughshe was afraid of him and in saying that she had no sense of weakness she meant that she was not afraid of herself  she heard him move within and he came and opened the door for her  what is the matter asked the doctor  you are standing there like a ghost  she went into the room but it was some time before she contrived to say what she had come to say  her father who was in his dressing gown and slippers had been busy at his writingtable and after looking at her for some moments and waiting for her to speak he went and seated himself at his papers again  his back was turned to hershe began to hear the scratching of his pen  she remained near the door with her heart thumping beneath her bodice and she was very glad that his back was turned for it seemed to her that she could more easily address herself to this portion of his person than to his face  at last she began watching it while she spoke  you told me that if i should have anything more to say about mr townsend you would be glad to listen to it  exactly my dear said the doctor not turning round but stopping his pen  catherine wished it would go on but she herself continued  i thought i would tell you that i have not seen him again but that i should like to do so  to bid him goodbye asked the doctor  the girl hesitated a moment  he is not going away  the doctor wheeled slowly round in his chair with a smile that seemed to accuse her of an epigram but extremes meet and catherine had not intended one  it is not to bid him goodbye then her father said  no father not that at least not for ever  i have not seen him again but i should like to see him catherine repeated  the doctor slowly rubbed his under lip with the feather of his quill  have you written to him  yes four times  you have not dismissed him then  once would have done that  no said catherine i have asked himasked him to wait  her father sat looking at her and she was afraid he was going to break out into wrath his eyes were so fine and cold  you are a dear faithful child he said at last  come here to your father  and he got up holding out his hands toward her  the words were a surprise and they gave her an exquisite joy  she went to him and he put his arm round her tenderly soothingly and then he kissed her  after this he said  do you wish to make me very happy  i should like tobut i am afraid i cant catherine answered  you can if you will  it all depends on your will  is it to give him up said catherine  yes it is to give him up  and he held her still with the same tenderness looking into her face and resting his eyes on her averted eyes  there was a long silence she wished he would release her  you are happier than i father she said at last  i have no doubt you are unhappy just now  but it is better to be unhappy for three months and get over it than for many years and never get over it  yes if that were so said catherine  it would be so i am sure of that  she answered nothing and he went on  have you no faith in my wisdom in my tenderness in my solicitude for your future  oh father murmured the girl  dont you suppose that i know something of men  their vices their follies their falsities  she detached herself and turned upon him  he is not vicioushe is not false  her father kept looking at her with his sharp pure eye  you make nothing of my judgement then  i cant believe that  i dont ask you to believe it but to take it on trust  catherine was far from saying to herself that this was an ingenious sophism but she met the appeal none the less squarely  what has he donewhat do you know  he has never done anythinghe is a selfish idler  oh father dont abuse him she exclaimed pleadingly  i dont mean to abuse him it would be a great mistake  you may do as you choose he added turning away  i may see him again  just as you choose  will you forgive me  by no means  it will only be for once  i dont know what you mean by once  you must either give him up or continue the acquaintance  i wish to explainto tell him to wait  to wait for what  till you know him bettertill you consent  dont tell him any such nonsense as that  i know him well enough and i shall never consent  but we can wait a long time said poor catherine in a tone which was meant to express the humblest conciliation but which had upon her fathers nerves the effect of an iteration not characterised by tact  the doctor answered however quietly enough  of course you can wait till i die if you like  catherine gave a cry of natural horror  your engagement will have one delightful effect upon you it will make you extremely impatient for that event  catherine stood staring and the doctor enjoyed the point he had made  it came to catherine with the forceor rather with the vague impressivenessof a logical axiom which it was not in her province to controvert and yet though it was a scientific truth she felt wholly unable to accept it  i would rather not marry if that were true she said  give me a proof of it then for it is beyond a question that by engaging yourself to morris townsend you simply wait for my death  she turned away feeling sick and faint and the doctor went on and if you wait for it with impatience judge if you please what his eagerness will be  catherine turned it overher fathers words had such an authority for her that her very thoughts were capable of obeying him  there was a dreadful ugliness in it which seemed to glare at her through the interposing medium of her own feebler reason  suddenly however she had an inspirationshe almost knew it to be an inspiration  if i dont marry before your death i will not after she said  to her father it must be admitted this seemed only another epigram and as obstinacy in unaccomplished minds does not usually select such a mode of expression he was the more surprised at this wanton play of a fixed idea  do you mean that for an impertinence he inquired an inquiry of which as he made it he quite perceived the grossness  an impertinence  oh father what terrible things you say  if you dont wait for my death you might as well marry immediately there is nothing else to wait for  for some time catherine made no answer but finally she said  i think morrislittle by littlemight persuade you  i shall never let him speak to me again  i dislike him too much  catherine gave a long low sigh she tried to stifle it for she had made up her mind that it was wrong to make a parade of her trouble and to endeavour to act upon her father by the meretricious aid of emotion  indeed she even thought it wrongin the sense of being inconsiderateto attempt to act upon his feelings at all her part was to effect some gentle gradual change in his intellectual perception of poor morriss character  but the means of effecting such a change were at present shrouded in mystery and she felt miserably helpless and hopeless  she had exhausted all arguments all replies  her father might have pitied her and in fact he did so but he was sure he was right  there is one thing you can tell mr townsend when you see him again he said  that if you marry without my consent i dont leave you a farthing of money  that will interest him more than anything else you can tell him  that would be very right catherine answered  i ought not in that case to have a farthing of your money  my dear child the doctor observed laughing your simplicity is touching  make that remark in that tone and with that expression of countenance to mr townsend and take a note of his answer  it wont be politeit will express irritation and i shall be glad of that as it will put me in the right unless indeedwhich is perfectly possibleyou should like him the better for being rude to you  he will never be rude to me said catherine gently  tell him what i say all the same  she looked at her father and her quiet eyes filled with tears  i think i will see him then she murmured in her timid voice  exactly as you choose  and he went to the door and opened it for her to go out  the movement gave her a terrible sense of his turning her off  it will be only once for the present she added lingering a moment  exactly as you choose he repeated standing there with his hand on the door  i have told you what i think  if you see him you will be an ungrateful cruel child you will have given your old father the greatest pain of his life  this was more than the poor girl could bear her tears overflowed and she moved towards her grimly consistent parent with a pitiful cry  her hands were raised in supplication but he sternly evaded this appeal  instead of letting her sob out her misery on his shoulder he simply took her by the arm and directed her course across the threshold closing the door gently but firmly behind her after he had done so he remained listening  for a long time there was no sound he knew that she was standing outside  he was sorry for her as i have said but he was so sure he was right  at last he heard her move away and then her footstep creaked faintly upon the stairs  the doctor took several turns round his study with his hands in his pockets and a thin sparkle possibly of irritation but partly also of something like humour in his eye  by jove he said to himself i believe she will sticki believe she will stick  and this idea of catherine sticking appeared to have a comical side and to offer a prospect of entertainment  he determined as he said to himself to see it out    chapter xix    it was for reasons connected with this determination that on the morrow he sought a few words of private conversation with mrs penniman  he sent for her to the library and he there informed her that he hoped very much that as regarded this affair of catherines she would mind her ps and qs  i dont know what you mean by such an expression said his sister you speak as if i were learning the alphabet  the alphabet of common sense is something you will never learn the doctor permitted himself to respond  have you called me here to insult me mrs penniman inquired  not at all  simply to advise you  you have taken up young townsend thats your own affair  i have nothing to do with your sentiments your fancies your affections your delusions but what i request of you is that you will keep these things to yourself  i have explained my views to catherine she understands them perfectly and anything that she does further in the way of encouraging mr townsends attentions will be in deliberate opposition to my wishes anything that you should do in the way of giving her aid and comfort will bepermit me the expressiondistinctly treasonable  you know high treason is a capital offence take care how you incur the penalty  mrs penniman threw back her head with a certain expansion of the eye which she occasionally practised  it seems to me that you talk like a great autocrat  i talk like my daughters father  not like your sisters brother cried lavinia  my dear lavinia said the doctor i sometimes wonder whether i am your brother  we are so extremely different  in spite of differences however we can at a pinch understand each other and that is the essential thing just now  walk straight with regard to mr townsend thats all i ask  it is highly probable you have been corresponding with him for the last three weeksperhaps even seeing him  i dont ask youyou neednt tell me  he had a moral conviction that she would contrive to tell a fib about the matter which it would disgust him to listen to  whatever you have done stop doing it  thats all i wish  dont you wish also by chance to murder our child mrs penniman inquired  on the contrary i wish to make her live and be happy  you will kill her she passed a dreadful night  she wont die of one dreadful night nor of a dozen  remember that i am a distinguished physician  mrs penniman hesitated a moment  then she risked her retort  your being a distinguished physician has not prevented you from already losing two members of your family  she had risked it but her brother gave her such a terribly incisive looka look so like a surgeons lancetthat she was frightened at her courage  and he answered her in words that corresponded to the look  it may not prevent me either from losing the society of still another  mrs penniman took herself off with whatever air of depreciated merit was at her command and repaired to catherines room where the poor girl was closeted  she knew all about her dreadful night for the two had met again the evening before after catherine left her father  mrs penniman was on the landing of the second floor when her niece came upstairs  it was not remarkable that a person of so much subtlety should have discovered that catherine had been shut up with the doctor  it was still less remarkable that she should have felt an extreme curiosity to learn the result of this interview and that this sentiment combined with her great amiability and generosity should have prompted her to regret the sharp words lately exchanged between her niece and herself  as the unhappy girl came into sight in the dusky corridor she made a lively demonstration of sympathy  catherines bursting heart was equally oblivious  she only knew that her aunt was taking her into her arms  mrs penniman drew her into catherines own room and the two women sat there together far into the small hours the younger one with her head on the others lap sobbing and sobbing at first in a soundless stifled manner and then at last perfectly still  it gratified mrs penniman to be able to feel conscientiously that this scene virtually removed the interdict which catherine had placed upon her further communion with morris townsend  she was not gratified however when in coming back to her nieces room before breakfast she found that catherine had risen and was preparing herself for this meal  you should not go to breakfast she said you are not well enough after your fearful night  yes i am very well and i am only afraid of being late  i cant understand you mrs penniman cried  you should stay in bed for three days  oh i could never do that said catherine to whom this idea presented no attractions  mrs penniman was in despair and she noted with extreme annoyance that the trace of the nights tears had completely vanished from catherines eyes  she had a most impracticable physique  what effect do you expect to have upon your father her aunt demanded if you come plumping down without a vestige of any sort of feeling as if nothing in the world had happened  he would not like me to lie in bed said catherine simply  all the more reason for your doing it  how else do you expect to move him  catherine thought a little  i dont know how but not in that way i wish to be just as usual  and she finished dressing and according to her aunts expression went plumping down into the paternal presence  she was really too modest for consistent pathos  and yet it was perfectly true that she had had a dreadful night even after mrs penniman left her she had had no sleep  she lay staring at the uncomforting gloom with her eyes and ears filled with the movement with which her father had turned her out of his room and of the words in which he had told her that she was a heartless daughter  her heart was breaking  she had heart enough for that at moments it seemed to her that she believed him and that to do what she was doing a girl must indeed be bad  she was bad but she couldnt help it  she would try to appear good even if her heart were perverted and from time to time she had a fancy that she might accomplish something by ingenious concessions to form though she should persist in caring for morris  catherines ingenuities were indefinite and we are not called upon to expose their hollowness the best of them perhaps showed itself in that freshness of aspect which was so discouraging to mrs penniman who was amazed at the absence of haggardness in a young woman who for a whole night had lain quivering beneath a fathers curse  poor catherine was conscious of her freshness it gave her a feeling about the future which rather added to the weight upon her mind  it seemed a proof that she was strong and solid and dense and would live to a great agelonger than might be generally convenient and this idea was depressing for it appeared to saddle her with a pretension the more just when the cultivation of any pretension was inconsistent with her doing right  she wrote that day to morris townsend requesting him to come and see her on the morrow using very few words and explaining nothing  she would explain everything face to face    chapter xx    on the morrow in the afternoon she heard his voice at the door and his step in the hall  she received him in the big bright front parlour and she instructed the servant that if any one should call she was particularly engaged  she was not afraid of her fathers coming in for at that hour he was always driving about town  when morris stood there before her the first thing that she was conscious of was that he was even more beautiful to look at than fond recollection had painted him the next was that he had pressed her in his arms  when she was free again it appeared to her that she had now indeed thrown herself into the gulf of defiance and even for an instant that she had been married to him  he told her that she had been very cruel and had made him very unhappy and catherine felt acutely the difficulty of her destiny which forced her to give pain in such opposite quarters  but she wished that instead of reproaches however tender he would give her help he was certainly wise enough and clever enough to invent some issue from their troubles  she expressed this belief and morris received the assurance as if he thought it natural but he interrogated at firstas was natural toorather than committed himself to marking out a course  you should not have made me wait so long he said  i dont know how i have been living every hour seemed like years  you should have decided sooner  decided catherine asked  decided whether you would keep me or give me up  oh morris she cried with a long tender murmur i never thought of giving you up  what then were you waiting for  the young man was ardently logical  i thought my father mightmight and she hesitated  might see how unhappy you were  oh no  but that he might look at it differently  and now you have sent for me to tell me that at last he does so  is that it  this hypothetical optimism gave the poor girl a pang  no morris she said solemnly he looks at it still in the same way  then why have you sent for me  because i wanted to see you cried catherine piteously  thats an excellent reason surely  but did you want to look at me only  have you nothing to tell me  his beautiful persuasive eyes were fixed upon her face and she wondered what answer would be noble enough to make to such a gaze as that  for a moment her own eyes took it in and theni did want to look at you she said gently  but after this speech most inconsistently she hid her face  morris watched her for a moment attentively  will you marry me to morrow he asked suddenly  tomorrow  next week then  any time within a month  isnt it better to wait said catherine  to wait for what  she hardly knew for what but this tremendous leap alarmed her till we have thought about it a little more  he shook his head sadly and reproachfully  i thought you had been thinking about it these three weeks  do you want to turn it over in your mind for five years  you have given me more than time enough my poor girl he added in a moment you are not sincere  catherine coloured from brow to chin and her eyes filled with tears oh how can you say that she murmured  why you must take me or leave me said morris very reasonably you cant please your father and me both you must choose between us  i have chosen you she said passionately  then marry me next week  she stood gazing at him  isnt there any other way  none that i know of for arriving at the same result  if there is i should be happy to hear of it  catherine could think of nothing of the kind and morriss luminosity seemed almost pitiless  the only thing she could think of was that her father might after all come round and she articulated with an awkward sense of her helplessness in doing so a wish that this miracle might happen  do you think it is in the least degree likely morris asked  it would be if he could only know you  he can know me if he will  what is to prevent it  his ideas his reasons said catherine  they are soso terribly strong  she trembled with the recollection of them yet  strong cried morris  i would rather you should think them weak  oh nothing about my father is weak said the girl  morris turned away walking to the window where he stood looking out  you are terribly afraid of him he remarked at last  she felt no impulse to deny it because she had no shame in it for if it was no honour to herself at least it was an honour to him  i suppose i must be she said simply  then you dont love menot as i love you  if you fear your father more than you love me then your love is not what i hoped it was  ah my friend she said going to him  do i fear anything he demanded turning round on her  for your sake what am i not ready to face  you are nobleyou are brave she answered stopping short at a distance that was almost respectful  small good it does me if you are so timid  i dont think that i amreally said catherine  i dont know what you mean by really  it is really enough to make us miserable  i should be strong enough to waitto wait a long time  and suppose after a long time your father should hate me worse than ever  he wouldnthe couldnt  he would be touched by my fidelity  is that what you mean  if he is so easily touched then why should you be afraid of him  this was much to the point and catherine was struck by it  i will try not to be she said  and she stood there submissively the image in advance of a dutiful and responsible wife  this image could not fail to recommend itself to morris townsend and he continued to give proof of the high estimation in which he held her it could only have been at the prompting of such a sentiment that he presently mentioned to her that the course recommended by mrs penniman was an immediate union regardless of consequences  yes aunt penniman would like that catherine said simplyand yet with a certain shrewdness  it must however have been in pure simplicity and from motives quite untouched by sarcasm that a few moments after she went on to say to morris that her father had given her a message for him  it was quite on her conscience to deliver this message and had the mission been ten times more painful she would have as scrupulously performed it  he told me to tell youto tell you very distinctly and directly from himself that if i marry without his consent i shall not inherit a penny of his fortune  he made a great point of this  he seemed to thinkhe seemed to think   morris flushed as any young man of spirit might have flushed at an imputation of baseness  what did he seem to think  that it would make a difference  it will make a differencein many things  we shall be by many thousands of dollars the poorer and that is a great difference  but it will make none in my affection  we shall not want the money said catherine for you know i have a good deal myself  yes my dear girl i know you have something  and he cant touch that  he would never said catherine  my mother left it to me  morris was silent a while  he was very positive about this was he he asked at last  he thought such a message would annoy me terribly and make me throw off the mask eh  i dont know what he thought said catherine wearily  please tell him that i care for his message as much as for that and morris snapped his fingers sonorously  i dont think i could tell him that  do you know you sometimes disappoint me said morris  i should think i might  i disappoint every onefather and aunt penniman  well it doesnt matter with me because i am fonder of you than they are  yes morris said the girl with her imaginationwhat there was of itswimming in this happy truth which seemed after all invidious to no one  is it your belief that he will stick to itstick to it for ever to this idea of disinheriting youthat your goodness and patience will never wear out his cruelty  the trouble is that if i marry you he will think i am not good  he will think that a proof  ah then he will never forgive you  this idea sharply expressed by morriss handsome lips renewed for a moment to the poor girls temporarily pacified conscience all its dreadful vividness  oh you must love me very much she cried  there is no doubt of that my dear her lover rejoined  you dont like that word disinherited he added in a moment  it isnt the money it is that he shouldthat he should feel so  i suppose it seems to you a kind of curse said morris  it must be very dismal  but dont you think he went on presently that if you were to try to be very clever and to set rightly about it you might in the end conjure it away  dont you think he continued further in a tone of sympathetic speculation that a really clever woman in your place might bring him round at last  dont you think  here suddenly morris was interrupted these ingenious inquiries had not reached catherines ears  the terrible word disinheritance with all its impressive moral reprobation was still ringing there seemed indeed to gather force as it lingered  the mortal chill of her situation struck more deeply into her childlike heart and she was overwhelmed by a feeling of loneliness and danger  but her refuge was there close to her and she put out her hands to grasp it  ah morris she said with a shudder i will marry you as soon as you please  and she surrendered herself leaning her head on his shoulder  my dear good girl he exclaimed looking down at his prize  and then he looked up again rather vaguely with parted lips and lifted eyebrows    chapter xxi    dr sloper very soon imparted his conviction to mrs almond in the same terms in which he had announced it to himself  shes going to stick by jove shes going to stick  do you mean that she is going to marry him mrs almond inquired  i dont know that but she is not going to break down  she is going to drag out the engagement in the hope of making me relent  and shall you not relent  shall a geometrical proposition relent  i am not so superficial  doesnt geometry treat of surfaces asked mrs almond who as we know was clever smiling  yes but it treats of them profoundly  catherine and her young man are my surfaces i have taken their measure  you speak as if it surprised you  it is immense there will be a great deal to observe  you are shockingly coldblooded said mrs almond  i need to be with all this hot blood about me  young townsend indeed is cool i must allow him that merit  i cant judge him mrs almond answered but i am not at all surprised at catherine  i confess i am a little she must have been so deucedly divided and bothered  say it amuses you outright  i dont see why it should be such a joke that your daughter adores you  it is the point where the adoration stops that i find it interesting to fix  it stops where the other sentiment begins  not at allthat would be simple enough  the two things are extremely mixed up and the mixture is extremely odd  it will produce some third element and thats what i am waiting to see  i wait with suspensewith positive excitement and that is a sort of emotion that i didnt suppose catherine would ever provide for me  i am really very much obliged to her  she will cling said mrs almond she will certainly cling  yes as i say she will stick  cling is prettier  thats what those very simple natures always do and nothing could be simpler than catherine  she doesnt take many impressions but when she takes one she keeps it  she is like a copper kettle that receives a dent you may polish up the kettle but you cant efface the mark  we must try and polish up catherine said the doctor  i will take her to europe  she wont forget him in europe  he will forget her then  mrs almond looked grave  should you really like that  extremely said the doctor  mrs penniman meanwhile lost little time in putting herself again in communication with morris townsend  she requested him to favour her with another interview but she did not on this occasion select an oyster saloon as the scene of their meeting  she proposed that he should join her at the door of a certain church after service on sunday afternoon and she was careful not to appoint the place of worship which she usually visited and where as she said the congregation would have spied upon her  she picked out a less elegant resort and on issuing from its portal at the hour she had fixed she saw the young man standing apart  she offered him no recognition till she had crossed the street and he had followed her to some distance  here with a smileexcuse my apparent want of cordiality she said  you know what to believe about that prudence before everything  and on his asking her in what direction they should walk where we shall be least observed she murmured  morris was not in high goodhumour and his response to this speech was not particularly gallant  i dont flatter myself we shall be much observed anywhere  then he turned recklessly toward the centre of the town  i hope you have come to tell me that he has knocked under he went on  i am afraid i am not altogether a harbinger of good and yet too i am to a certain extent a messenger of peace  i have been thinking a great deal mr townsend said mrs penniman  you think too much  i suppose i do but i cant help it my mind is so terribly active when i give myself i give myself  i pay the penalty in my headaches my famous headachesa perfect circlet of pain  but i carry it as a queen carries her crown  would you believe that i have one now  i wouldnt however have missed our rendezvous for anything  i have something very important to tell you  well lets have it said morris  i was perhaps a little headlong the other day in advising you to marry immediately  i have been thinking it over and now i see it just a little differently  you seem to have a great many different ways of seeing the same object  their number is infinite said mrs penniman in a tone which seemed to suggest that this convenient faculty was one of her brightest attributes  i recommend you to take one way and stick to it morris replied  ah but it isnt easy to choose  my imagination is never quiet never satisfied  it makes me a bad adviser perhaps but it makes me a capital friend  a capital friend who gives bad advice said morris  not intentionallyand who hurries off at every risk to make the most humble excuses  well what do you advise me now  to be very patient to watch and wait  and is that bad advice or good  that is not for me to say mrs penniman rejoined with some dignity  i only pretend its sincere  and will you come to me next week and recommend something different and equally sincere  i may come to you next week and tell you that i am in the streets  in the streets  i have had a terrible scene with my brother and he threatens if anything happens to turn me out of the house  you know i am a poor woman  morris had a speculative idea that she had a little property but he naturally did not press this  i should be very sorry to see you suffer martyrdom for me he said but you make your brother out a regular turk  mrs penniman hesitated a little  i certainly do not regard austin as a satisfactory christian  and am i to wait till he is converted  wait at any rate till he is less violent  bide your time mr townsend remember the prize is great  morris walked along some time in silence tapping the railings and gateposts very sharply with his stick  you certainly are devilish inconsistent he broke out at last  i have already got catherine to consent to a private marriage  mrs penniman was indeed inconsistent for at this news she gave a little jump of gratification  oh when and where she cried  and then she stopped short  morris was a little vague about this  that isnt fixed but she consents  its deuced awkward now to back out  mrs penniman as i say had stopped short and she stood there with her eyes fixed brilliantly on her companion  mr townsend she proceeded shall i tell you something catherine loves you so much that you may do anything  this declaration was slightly ambiguous and morris opened his eyes  i am happy to hear it  but what do you mean by anything  you may postponeyou may change about she wont think the worse of you  morris stood there still with his raised eyebrows then he said simply and rather drylyah  after this he remarked to mrs penniman that if she walked so slowly she would attract notice and he succeeded after a fashion in hurrying her back to the domicile of which her tenure had become so insecure    chapter xxii    he had slightly misrepresented the matter in saying that catherine had consented to take the great step  we left her just now declaring that she would burn her ships behind her but morris after having elicited this declaration had become conscious of good reasons for not taking it up  he avoided gracefully enough fixing a day though he left her under the impression that he had his eye on one catherine may have had her difficulties but those of her circumspect suitor are also worthy of consideration  the prize was certainly great but it was only to be won by striking the happy mean between precipitancy and caution  it would be all very well to take ones jump and trust to providence providence was more especially on the side of clever people and clever people were known by an indisposition to risk their bones  the ultimate reward of a union with a young woman who was both unattractive and impoverished ought to be connected with immediate disadvantages by some very palpable chain  between the fear of losing catherine and her possible fortune altogether and the fear of taking her too soon and finding this possible fortune as void of actuality as a collection of emptied bottles it was not comfortable for morris townsend to choose a fact that should be remembered by readers disposed to judge harshly of a young man who may have struck them as making but an indifferently successful use of fine natural parts  he had not forgotten that in any event catherine had her own ten thousand a year he had devoted an abundance of meditation to this circumstance  but with his fine parts he rated himself high and he had a perfectly definite appreciation of his value which seemed to him inadequately represented by the sum i have mentioned  at the same time he reminded himself that this sum was considerable that everything is relative and that if a modest income is less desirable than a large one the complete absence of revenue is nowhere accounted an advantage  these reflexions gave him plenty of occupation and made it necessary that he should trim his sail  dr slopers opposition was the unknown quantity in the problem he had to work out  the natural way to work it out was by marrying catherine but in mathematics there are many short cuts and morris was not without a hope that he should yet discover one  when catherine took him at his word and consented to renounce the attempt to mollify her father he drew back skilfully enough as i have said and kept the weddingday still an open question  her faith in his sincerity was so complete that she was incapable of suspecting that he was playing with her her trouble just now was of another kind  the poor girl had an admirable sense of honour and from the moment she had brought herself to the point of violating her fathers wish it seemed to her that she had no right to enjoy his protection  it was on her conscience that she ought to live under his roof only so long as she conformed to his wisdom  there was a great deal of glory in such a position but poor catherine felt that she had forfeited her claim to it  she had cast her lot with a young man against whom he had solemnly warned her and broken the contract under which he provided her with a happy home  she could not give up the young man so she must leave the home and the sooner the object of her preference offered her another the sooner her situation would lose its awkward twist  this was close reasoning but it was commingled with an infinite amount of merely instinctive penitence  catherines days at this time were dismal and the weight of some of her hours was almost more than she could bear  her father never looked at her never spoke to her  he knew perfectly what he was about and this was part of a plan  she looked at him as much as she dared for she was afraid of seeming to offer herself to his observation and she pitied him for the sorrow she had brought upon him  she held up her head and busied her hands and went about her daily occupations and when the state of things in washington square seemed intolerable she closed her eyes and indulged herself with an intellectual vision of the man for whose sake she had broken a sacred law  mrs penniman of the three persons in washington square had much the most of the manner that belongs to a great crisis  if catherine was quiet she was quietly quiet as i may say and her pathetic effects which there was no one to notice were entirely unstudied and unintended if the doctor was stiff and dry and absolutely indifferent to the presence of his companions it was so lightly neatly easily done that you would have had to know him well to discover that on the whole he rather enjoyed having to be so disagreeable  but mrs penniman was elaborately reserved and significantly silent there was a richer rustle in the very deliberate movements to which she confined herself and when she occasionally spoke in connexion with some very trivial event she had the air of meaning something deeper than what she said  between catherine and her father nothing had passed since the evening she went to speak to him in his study  she had something to say to himit seemed to her she ought to say it but she kept it back for fear of irritating him  he also had something to say to her but he was determined not to speak first he was interested as we know in seeing how if she were left to herself she would stick  at last she told him she had seen morris townsend again and that their relations remained quite the same  i think we shall marrybefore very long  and probably meanwhile i shall see him rather often about once a week not more  the doctor looked at her coldly from head to foot as if she had been a stranger  it was the first time his eyes had rested on her for a week which was fortunate if that was to be their expression  why not three times a day he asked  what prevents your meeting as often as you choose  she turned away a moment there were tears in her eyes  then she said it is better once a week  i dont see how it is better  it is as bad as it can be  if you flatter yourself that i care for little modifications of that sort you are very much mistaken  it is as wrong of you to see him once a week as it would be to see him all day long  not that it matters to me however  catherine tried to follow these words but they seemed to lead towards a vague horror from which she recoiled  i think we shall marry pretty soon she repeated at last  her father gave her his dreadful look again as if she were some one else  why do you tell me that  its no concern of mine  oh father she broke out dont you care even if you do feel so  not a button  once you marry its quite the same to me when or where or why you do it and if you think to compound for your folly by hoisting your flag in this way you may spare yourself the trouble  with this he turned away  but the next day he spoke to her of his own accord and his manner was somewhat changed  shall you be married within the next four or five months he asked  i dont know father said catherine  it is not very easy for us to make up our minds  put it off then for six months and in the meantime i will take you to europe  i should like you very much to go  it gave her such delight after his words of the day before to hear that he should like her to do something and that he still had in his heart any of the tenderness of preference that she gave a little exclamation of joy  but then she became conscious that morris was not included in this proposal and thatas regards really goingshe would greatly prefer to remain at home with him  but she blushed none the less more comfortably than she had done of late  it would be delightful to go to europe she remarked with a sense that the idea was not original and that her tone was not all it might be  very well then we will go  pack up your clothes  i had better tell mr townsend said catherine  her father fixed his cold eyes upon her  if you mean that you had better ask his leave all that remains to me is to hope he will give it  the girl was sharply touched by the pathetic ring of the words it was the most calculated the most dramatic little speech the doctor had ever uttered  she felt that it was a great thing for her under the circumstances to have this fine opportunity of showing him her respect and yet there was something else that she felt as well and that she presently expressed  i sometimes think that if i do what you dislike so much i ought not to stay with you  to stay with me  if i live with you i ought to obey you  if thats your theory its certainly mine said the doctor with a dry laugh  but if i dont obey you i ought not to live with youto enjoy your kindness and protection  this striking argument gave the doctor a sudden sense of having underestimated his daughter it seemed even more than worthy of a young woman who had revealed the quality of unaggressive obstinacy but it displeased himdispleased him deeply and he signified as much  that idea is in very bad taste he said  did you get it from mr townsend  oh no its my own said catherine eagerly  keep it to yourself then her father answered more than ever determined she should go to europe    chapter xxiii    if morris townsend was not to be included in this journey no more was mrs penniman who would have been thankful for an invitation but who to do her justice bore her disappointment in a perfectly ladylike manner  i should enjoy seeing the works of raphael and the ruinsthe ruins of the pantheon she said to mrs almond but on the other hand i shall not be sorry to be alone and at peace for the next few months in washington square  i want rest i have been through so much in the last four months  mrs almond thought it rather cruel that her brother should not take poor lavinia abroad but she easily understood that if the purpose of his expedition was to make catherine forget her lover it was not in his interest to give his daughter this young mans best friend as a companion  if lavinia had not been so foolish she might visit the ruins of the pantheon she said to herself and she continued to regret her sisters folly even though the latter assured her that she had often heard the relics in question most satisfactorily described by mr penniman  mrs penniman was perfectly aware that her brothers motive in undertaking a foreign tour was to lay a trap for catherines constancy and she imparted this conviction very frankly to her niece  he thinks it will make you forget morris she said she always called the young man morris now out of sight out of mind you know  he thinks that all the things you will see over there will drive him out of your thoughts  catherine looked greatly alarmed  if he thinks that i ought to tell him beforehand  mrs penniman shook her head  tell him afterwards my dear  after he has had all the trouble and the expense  thats the way to serve him  and she added in a softer key that it must be delightful to think of those who love us among the ruins of the pantheon  her fathers displeasure had cost the girl as we know a great deal of deepwelling sorrowsorrow of the purest and most generous kind without a touch of resentment or rancour but for the first time after he had dismissed with such contemptuous brevity her apology for being a charge upon him there was a spark of anger in her grief she had felt his contempt it had scorched her that speech about her bad taste made her ears burn for three days  during this period she was less considerate she had an ideaa rather vague one but it was agreeable to her sense of injurythat now she was absolved from penance and might do what she chose  she chose to write to morris townsend to meet her in the square and take her to walk about the town  if she were going to europe out of respect to her father she might at least give herself this satisfaction  she felt in every way at present more free and more resolute there was a force that urged her  now at last completely and unreservedly her passion possessed her  morris met her at last and they took a long walk  she told him immediately what had happenedthat her father wished to take her away  it would be for six months to europe she would do absolutely what morris should think best  she hoped inexpressibly that he would think it best she should stay at home  it was some time before he said what he thought  he asked as they walked along a great many questions  there was one that especially struck her it seemed so incongruous  should you like to see all those celebrated things over there  oh no morris said catherine quite deprecatingly  gracious heaven what a dull woman morris exclaimed to himself  he thinks i will forget you said catherine  that all these things will drive you out of my mind  well my dear perhaps they will  please dont say that catherine answered gently as they walked along  poor father will be disappointed  morris gave a little laugh  yes i verily believe that your poor father will be disappointed  but you will have seen europe he added humorously  what a takein  i dont care for seeing europe catherine said  you ought to care my dear  and it may mollify your father  catherine conscious of her obstinacy expected little of this and could not rid herself of the idea that in going abroad and yet remaining firm she should play her father a trick  dont you think it would be a kind of deception she asked  doesnt he want to deceive you cried morris  it will serve him right  i really think you had better go  and not be married for so long  be married when you come back  you can buy your wedding clothes in paris  and then morris with great kindness of tone explained his view of the matter  it would be a good thing that she should go it would put them completely in the right  it would show they were reasonable and willing to wait  once they were so sure of each other they could afford to waitwhat had they to fear  if there was a particle of chance that her father would be favourably affected by her going that ought to settle it for after all morris was very unwilling to be the cause of her being disinherited  it was not for himself it was for her and for her children  he was willing to wait for her it would be hard but he could do it  and over there among beautiful scenes and noble monuments perhaps the old gentleman would be softened such things were supposed to exert a humanising influence  he might be touched by her gentleness her patience her willingness to make any sacrifice but that one and if she should appeal to him some day in some celebrated spotin italy say in the evening in venice in a gondola by moonlightif she should be a little clever about it and touch the right chord perhaps he would fold her in his arms and tell her that he forgave her  catherine was immensely struck with this conception of the affair which seemed eminently worthy of her lovers brilliant intellect though she viewed it askance in so far as it depended upon her own powers of execution  the idea of being clever in a gondola by moonlight appeared to her to involve elements of which her grasp was not active  but it was settled between them that she should tell her father that she was ready to follow him obediently anywhere making the mental reservation that she loved morris townsend more than ever  she informed the doctor she was ready to embark and he made rapid arrangements for this event  catherine had many farewells to make but with only two of them are we actively concerned  mrs penniman took a discriminating view of her nieces journey it seemed to her very proper that mr townsends destined bride should wish to embellish her mind by a foreign tour  you leave him in good hands she said pressing her lips to catherines forehead  she was very fond of kissing peoples foreheads it was an involuntary expression of sympathy with the intellectual part  i shall see him often i shall feel like one of the vestals of old tending the sacred flame  you behave beautifully about not going with us catherine answered not presuming to examine this analogy  it is my pride that keeps me up said mrs penniman tapping the body of her dress which always gave forth a sort of metallic ring  catherines parting with her lover was short and few words were exchanged  shall i find you just the same when i come back she asked though the question was not the fruit of scepticism  the sameonly more so said morris smiling  it does not enter into our scheme to narrate in detail dr slopers proceedings in the eastern hemisphere  he made the grand tour of europe travelled in considerable splendour and as was to have been expected in a man of his high cultivation found so much in art and antiquity to interest him that he remained abroad not for six months but for twelve  mrs penniman in washington square accommodated herself to his absence  she enjoyed her uncontested dominion in the empty house and flattered herself that she made it more attractive to their friends than when her brother was at home to morris townsend at least it would have appeared that she made it singularly attractive  he was altogether her most frequent visitor and mrs penniman was very fond of asking him to tea  he had his chaira very easy one at the fireside in the back parlour when the great mahogany slidingdoors with silver knobs and hinges which divided this apartment from its more formal neighbour were closed and he used to smoke cigars in the doctors study where he often spent an hour in turning over the curious collections of its absent proprietor  he thought mrs penniman a goose as we know but he was no goose himself and as a young man of luxurious tastes and scanty resources he found the house a perfect castle of indolence  it became for him a club with a single member  mrs penniman saw much less of her sister than while the doctor was at home for mrs almond had felt moved to tell her that she disapproved of her relations with mr townsend  she had no business to be so friendly to a young man of whom their brother thought so meanly and mrs almond was surprised at her levity in foisting a most deplorable engagement upon catherine  deplorable cried lavinia  he will make her a lovely husband  i dont believe in lovely husbands said mrs almond i only believe in good ones  if he marries her and she comes into austins money they may get on  he will be an idle amiable selfish and doubtless tolerably goodnatured fellow  but if she doesnt get the money and he finds himself tied to her heaven have mercy on her  he will have none  he will hate her for his disappointment and take his revenge he will be pitiless and cruel  woe betide poor catherine  i recommend you to talk a little with his sister its a pity catherine cant marry her  mrs penniman had no appetite whatever for conversation with mrs montgomery whose acquaintance she made no trouble to cultivate and the effect of this alarming forecast of her nieces destiny was to make her think it indeed a thousand pities that mr townsends generous nature should be embittered  bright enjoyment was his natural element and how could he be comfortable if there should prove to be nothing to enjoy  it became a fixed idea with mrs penniman that he should yet enjoy her brothers fortune on which she had acuteness enough to perceive that her own claim was small  if he doesnt leave it to catherine it certainly wont be to leave it to me she said    chapter xxiv    the doctor during the first six months he was abroad never spoke to his daughter of their little difference partly on system and partly because he had a great many other things to think about  it was idle to attempt to ascertain the state of her affections without direct inquiry because if she had not had an expressive manner among the familiar influences of home she failed to gather animation from the mountains of switzerland or the monuments of italy  she was always her fathers docile and reasonable associategoing through their sightseeing in deferential silence never complaining of fatigue always ready to start at the hour he had appointed overnight making no foolish criticisms and indulging in no refinements of appreciation  she is about as intelligent as the bundle of shawls the doctor said her main superiority being that while the bundle of shawls sometimes got lost or tumbled out of the carriage catherine was always at her post and had a firm and ample seat  but her father had expected this and he was not constrained to set down her intellectual limitations as a tourist to sentimental depression she had completely divested herself of the characteristics of a victim and during the whole time that they were abroad she never uttered an audible sigh  he supposed she was in correspondence with morris townsend but he held his peace about it for he never saw the young mans letters and catherines own missives were always given to the courier to post  she heard from her lover with considerable regularity but his letters came enclosed in mrs pennimans so that whenever the doctor handed her a packet addressed in his sisters hand he was an involuntary instrument of the passion he condemned catherine made this reflexion and six months earlier she would have felt bound to give him warning but now she deemed herself absolved there was a sore spot in her heart that his own words had made when once she spoke to him as she thought honour prompted she would try and please him as far as she could but she would never speak that way again  she read her lovers letters in secret  one day at the end of the summer the two travellers found themselves in a lonely valley of the alps  they were crossing one of the passes and on the long ascent they had got out of the carriage and had wandered much in advance  after a while the doctor descried a footpath which leading through a transverse valley would bring them out as he justly supposed at a much higher point of the ascent they followed this devious way and finally lost the path the valley proved very wild and rough and their walk became rather a scramble they were good walkers however and they took their adventure easily from time to time they stopped that catherine might rest and then she sat upon a stone and looked about her at the hard featured rocks and the glowing sky  it was late in the afternoon in the last of august night was coming on and as they had reached a great elevation the air was cold and sharp  in the west there was a great suffusion of cold red light which made the sides of the little valley look only the more rugged and dusky  during one of their pauses her father left her and wandered away to some high place at a distance to get a view  he was out of sight she sat there alone in the stillness which was just touched by the vague murmur somewhere of a mountain brook  she thought of morris townsend and the place was so desolate and lonely that he seemed very far away  her father remained absent a long time she began to wonder what had become of him  but at last he reappeared coming towards her in the clear twilight and she got up to go on  he made no motion to proceed however but came close to her as if he had something to say  he stopped in front of her and stood looking at her with eyes that had kept the light of the flushing snowsummits on which they had just been fixed  then abruptly in a low tone he asked her an unexpected question  have you given him up  the question was unexpected but catherine was only superficially unprepared  no father she answered  he looked at her again for some moments without speaking  does he write to you he asked  yesabout twice a month  the doctor looked up and down the valley swinging his stick then he said to her in the same low tone  i am very angry  she wondered what he meantwhether he wished to frighten her  if he did the place was well chosen this hard melancholy dell abandoned by the summer light made her feel her loneliness  she looked around her and her heart grew cold for a moment her fear was great  but she could think of nothing to say save to murmur gently i am sorry  you try my patience her father went on and you ought to know what i am i am not a very good man  though i am very smooth externally at bottom i am very passionate and i assure you i can be very hard  she could not think why he told her these things  had he brought her there on purpose and was it part of a plan  what was the plan catherine asked herself  was it to startle her suddenly into a retractationto take an advantage of her by dread  dread of what the place was ugly and lonely but the place could do her no harm there was a kind of still intensity about her father which made him dangerous but catherine hardly went so far as to say to herself that it might be part of his plan to fasten his handthe neat fine supple hand of a distinguished physicianin her throat nevertheless she receded a step  i am sure you can be anything you please she said  and it was her simple belief  i am very angry he replied more sharply  why has it taken you so suddenly  it has not taken me suddenly  i have been raging inwardly for the last six months  but just now this seemed a good place to flare out its so quiet and we are alone  yes its very quiet said catherine vaguely looking about her wont you come back to the carriage  in a moment  do you mean that in all this time you have not yielded an inch  i would if i could father but i cant  the doctor looked round him too  should you like to be left in such a place as this to starve  what do you mean cried the girl  that will be your fatethats how he will leave you  he would not touch her but he had touched morris  the warmth came back to her heart  that is not true father she broke out and you ought not to say it  it is not right and its not true  he shook his head slowly  no its not right because you wont believe it  but it is true  come back to the carriage  he turned away and she followed him he went faster and was presently much in advance  but from time to time he stopped without turning round to let her keep up with him and she made her way forward with difficulty her heart beating with the excitement of having for the first time spoken to him in violence  by this time it had grown almost dark and she ended by losing sight of him  but she kept her course and after a little the valley making a sudden turn she gained the road where the carriage stood waiting  in it sat her father rigid and silent in silence too she took her place beside him  it seemed to her later in looking back upon all this that for days afterwards not a word had been exchanged between them  the scene had been a strange one but it had not permanently affected her feeling towards her father for it was natural after all that he should occasionally make a scene of some kind and he had let her alone for six months  the strangest part of it was that he had said he was not a good man catherine wondered a great deal what he had meant by that  the statement failed to appeal to her credence and it was not grateful to any resentment that she entertained  even in the utmost bitterness that she might feel it would give her no satisfaction to think him less complete  such a saying as that was a part of his great subtletymen so clever as he might say anything and mean anything  and as to his being hard that surely in a man was a virtue  he let her alone for six months moresix months during which she accommodated herself without a protest to the extension of their tour  but he spoke again at the end of this time it was at the very last the night before they embarked for new york in the hotel at liverpool  they had been dining together in a great dim musty sittingroom and then the cloth had been removed and the doctor walked slowly up and down  catherine at last took her candle to go to bed but her father motioned her to stay  what do you mean to do when you get home he asked while she stood there with her candle in her hand  do you mean about mr townsend  about mr townsend  we shall probably marry  the doctor took several turns again while she waited  do you hear from him as much as ever  yes twice a month said catherine promptly  and does he always talk about marriage  oh yes  that is he talks about other things too but he always says something about that  i am glad to hear he varies his subjects his letters might otherwise be monotonous  he writes beautifully said catherine who was very glad of a chance to say it  they always write beautifully  however in a given case that doesnt diminish the merit  so as soon as you arrive you are going off with him  this seemed a rather gross way of putting it and something that there was of dignity in catherine resented it  i cannot tell you till we arrive she said  thats reasonable enough her father answered  thats all i ask of youthat you do tell me that you give me definite notice  when a poor man is to lose his only child he likes to have an inkling of it beforehand  oh father you will not lose me catherine said spilling her candlewax  three days before will do he went on if you are in a position to be positive then  he ought to be very thankful to me do you know i have done a mighty good thing for him in taking you abroad your value is twice as great with all the knowledge and taste that you have acquired  a year ago you were perhaps a little limiteda little rustic but now you have seen everything and appreciated everything and you will be a most entertaining companion  we have fattened the sheep for him before he kills it catherine turned away and stood staring at the blank door  go to bed said her father and as we dont go aboard till noon you may sleep late we shall probably have a most uncomfortable voyage    chapter xxv    the voyage was indeed uncomfortable and catherine on arriving in new york had not the compensation of going off in her fathers phrase with morris townsend  she saw him however the day after she landed and in the meantime he formed a natural subject of conversation between our heroine and her aunt lavinia with whom the night she disembarked the girl was closeted for a long time before either lady retired to rest  i have seen a great deal of him said mrs penniman  he is not very easy to know  i suppose you think you know him but you dont my dear  you will some day but it will only be after you have lived with him  i may almost say i have lived with him mrs penniman proceeded while catherine stared  i think i know him now i have had such remarkable opportunities  you will have the sameor rather you will have better and aunt lavinia smiled  then you will see what i mean  its a wonderful character full of passion and energy and just as true  catherine listened with a mixture of interest and apprehension  aunt lavinia was intensely sympathetic and catherine for the past year while she wandered through foreign galleries and churches and rolled over the smoothness of posting roads nursing the thoughts that never passed her lips had often longed for the company of some intelligent person of her own sex  to tell her story to some kind womanat moments it seemed to her that this would give her comfort and she had more than once been on the point of taking the landlady or the nice young person from the dressmakers into her confidence  if a woman had been near her she would on certain occasions have treated such a companion to a fit of weeping and she had an apprehension that on her return this would form her response to aunt lavinias first embrace  in fact however the two ladies had met in washington square without tears and when they found themselves alone together a certain dryness fell upon the girls emotion  it came over her with a greater force that mrs penniman had enjoyed a whole year of her lovers society and it was not a pleasure to her to hear her aunt explain and interpret the young man speaking of him as if her own knowledge of him were supreme  it was not that catherine was jealous but her sense of mrs pennimans innocent falsity which had lain dormant began to haunt her again and she was glad that she was safely at home  with this however it was a blessing to be able to talk of morris to sound his name to be with a person who was not unjust to him  you have been very kind to him said catherine  he has written me that often  i shall never forget that aunt lavinia  i have done what i could it has been very little  to let him come and talk to me and give him his cup of teathat was all  your aunt almond thought it was too much and used to scold me terribly but she promised me at least not to betray me  to betray you  not to tell your father  he used to sit in your fathers study said mrs penniman with a little laugh  catherine was silent a moment  this idea was disagreeable to her and she was reminded again with pain of her aunts secretive habits  morris the reader may be informed had had the tact not to tell her that he sat in her fathers study  he had known her but for a few months and her aunt had known her for fifteen years and yet he would not have made the mistake of thinking that catherine would see the joke of the thing  i am sorry you made him go into fathers room she said after a while  i didnt make him go he went himself  he liked to look at the books and all those things in the glass cases  he knows all about them he knows all about everything  catherine was silent again then i wish he had found some employment she said  he has found some employment  its beautiful news and he told me to tell you as soon as you arrived  he has gone into partnership with a commission merchant  it was all settled quite suddenly a week ago  this seemed to catherine indeed beautiful news it had a fine prosperous air  oh im so glad she said and now for a moment she was disposed to throw herself on aunt lavinias neck  its much better than being under some one and he has never been used to that mrs penniman went on  he is just as good as his partnerthey are perfectly equal  you see how right he was to wait i should like to know what your father can say now  they have got an office in duane street and little printed cards he brought me one to show me  i have got it in my room and you shall see it to morrow  thats what he said to me the last time he was hereyou see how right i was to wait  he has got other people under him instead of being a subordinate  he could never be a subordinate i have often told him i could never think of him in that way  catherine assented to this proposition and was very happy to know that morris was his own master but she was deprived of the satisfaction of thinking that she might communicate this news in triumph to her father  her father would care equally little whether morris were established in business or transported for life  her trunks had been brought into her room and further reference to her lover was for a short time suspended while she opened them and displayed to her aunt some of the spoils of foreign travel  these were rich and abundant and catherine had brought home a present to every oneto every one save morris to whom she had brought simply her undiverted heart  to mrs penniman she had been lavishly generous and aunt lavinia spent half an hour in unfolding and folding again with little ejaculations of gratitude and taste  she marched about for some time in a splendid cashmere shawl which catherine had begged her to accept settling it on her shoulders and twisting down her head to see how low the point descended behind  i shall regard it only as a loan she said  i will leave it to you again when i die or rather she added kissing her niece again i will leave it to your firstborn little girl  and draped in her shawl she stood there smiling  you had better wait till she comes said catherine  i dont like the way you say that mrs penniman rejoined in a moment  catherine are you changed  no i am the same  you have not swerved a line  i am exactly the same catherine repeated wishing her aunt were a little less sympathetic  well i am glad and mrs penniman surveyed her cashmere in the glass  then how is your father she asked in a moment with her eyes on her niece  your letters were so meagrei could never tell  father is very well  ah you know what i mean said mrs penniman with a dignity to which the cashmere gave a richer effect  is he still implacable  oh yes  quite unchanged  he is if possible more firm  mrs penniman took off her great shawl and slowly folded it up that is very bad  you had no success with your little project  what little project  morris told me all about it  the idea of turning the tables on him in europe of watching him when he was agreeably impressed by some celebrated sighthe pretends to be so artistic you knowand then just pleading with him and bringing him round  i never tried it  it was morriss idea but if he had been with us in europe he would have seen that father was never impressed in that way  he is artistictremendously artistic but the more celebrated places we visited and the more he admired them the less use it would have been to plead with him  they seemed only to make him more determinedmore terrible said poor catherine  i shall never bring him round and i expect nothing now  well i must say mrs penniman answered i never supposed you were going to give it up  i have given it up  i dont care now  you have grown very brave said mrs penniman with a short laugh i didnt advise you to sacrifice your property  yes i am braver than i was  you asked me if i had changed i have changed in that way  oh the girl went on i have changed very much  and it isnt my property  if he doesnt care for it why should i  mrs penniman hesitated  perhaps he does care for it  he cares for it for my sake because he doesnt want to injure me but he will knowhe knows alreadyhow little he need be afraid about that  besides said catherine i have got plenty of money of my own  we shall be very well off and now hasnt he got his business  i am delighted about that business  she went on talking showing a good deal of excitement as she proceeded  her aunt had never seen her with just this manner and mrs penniman observing her set it down to foreign travel which had made her more positive more mature  she thought also that catherine had improved in appearance she looked rather handsome  mrs penniman wondered whether morris townsend would be struck with that  while she was engaged in this speculation catherine broke out with a certain sharpness why are you so contradictory aunt penniman  you seem to think one thing at one time and another at another  a year ago before i went away you wished me not to mind about displeasing father and now you seem to recommend me to take another line  you change about so  this attack was unexpected for mrs penniman was not used in any discussion to seeing the war carried into her own countrypossibly because the enemy generally had doubts of finding subsistence there to her own consciousness the flowery fields of her reason had rarely been ravaged by a hostile force  it was perhaps on this account that in defending them she was majestic rather than agile  i dont know what you accuse me of save of being too deeply interested in your happiness  it is the first time i have been told i am capricious  that fault is not what i am usually reproached with  you were angry last year that i wouldnt marry immediately and now you talk about my winning my father over  you told me it would serve him right if he should take me to europe for nothing  well he has taken me for nothing and you ought to be satisfied  nothing is changednothing but my feeling about father  i dont mind nearly so much now  i have been as good as i could but he doesnt care  now i dont care either  i dont know whether i have grown bad perhaps i have  but i dont care for that  i have come home to be married thats all i know  that ought to please you unless you have taken up some new idea you are so strange  you may do as you please but you must never speak to me again about pleading with father  i shall never plead with him for anything that is all over  he has put me off  i am come home to be married  this was a more authoritative speech than she had ever heard on her nieces lips and mrs penniman was proportionately startled  she was indeed a little awestruck and the force of the girls emotion and resolution left her nothing to reply  she was easily frightened and she always carried off her discomfiture by a concession a concession which was often accompanied as in the present case by a little nervous laugh    chapter xxvi    if she had disturbed her nieces tempershe began from this moment forward to talk a good deal about catherines temper an article which up to that time had never been mentioned in connexion with our heroinecatherine had opportunity on the morrow to recover her serenity  mrs penniman had given her a message from morris townsend to the effect that he would come and welcome her home on the day after her arrival  he came in the afternoon but as may be imagined he was not on this occasion made free of dr slopers study  he had been coming and going for the past year so comfortably and irresponsibly that he had a certain sense of being wronged by finding himself reminded that he must now limit his horizon to the front parlour which was catherines particular province  i am very glad you have come back he said it makes me very happy to see you again  and he looked at her smiling from head to foot though it did not appear afterwards that he agreed with mrs penniman who womanlike went more into details in thinking her embellished  to catherine he appeared resplendent it was some time before she could believe again that this beautiful young man was her own exclusive property  they had a great deal of characteristic lovers talka soft exchange of inquiries and assurances  in these matters morris had an excellent grace which flung a picturesque interest even over the account of his debut in the commission businessa subject as to which his companion earnestly questioned him  from time to time he got up from the sofa where they sat together and walked about the room after which he came back smiling and passing his hand through his hair  he was unquiet as was natural in a young man who has just been reunited to a longabsent mistress and catherine made the reflexion that she had never seen him so excited it gave her pleasure somehow to note this fact  he asked her questions about her travels to some of which she was unable to reply for she had forgotten the names of places and the order of her fathers journey  but for the moment she was so happy so lifted up by the belief that her troubles at last were over that she forgot to be ashamed of her meagre answers  it seemed to her now that she could marry him without the remnant of a scruple or a single tremor save those that belonged to joy  without waiting for him to ask she told him that her father had come back in exactly the same state of mindthat he had not yielded an inch  we must not expect it now she said and we must do without it  morris sat looking and smiling  my poor dear girl he exclaimed  you mustnt pity me said catherine i dont mind it nowi am used to it  morris continued to smile and then he got up and walked about again you had better let me try him  try to bring him over  you would only make him worse catherine answered resolutely  you say that because i managed it so badly before  but i should manage it differently now  i am much wiser i have had a year to think of it  i have more tact  is that what you have been thinking of for a year  much of the time  you see the idea sticks in my crop  i dont like to be beaten  how are you beaten if we marry  of course i am not beaten on the main issue but i am dont you see on all the rest of iton the question of my reputation of my relations with your father of my relations with my own children if we should have any  we shall have enough for our childrenwe shall have enough for everything  dont you expect to succeed in business  brilliantly and we shall certainly be very comfortable  but it isnt of the mere material comfort i speak it is of the moral comfort said morrisof the intellectual satisfaction  i have great moral comfort now catherine declared very simply  of course you have  but with me it is different  i have staked my pride on proving to your father that he is wrong and now that i am at the head of a flourishing business i can deal with him as an equal  i have a capital plando let me go at him  he stood before her with his bright face his jaunty air his hands in his pockets and she got up with her eyes resting on his own please dont morris please dont she said and there was a certain mild sad firmness in her tone which he heard for the first time  we must ask no favours of himwe must ask nothing more  he wont relent and nothing good will come of it  i know it nowi have a very good reason  and pray what is your reason  she hesitated to bring it out but at last it came  he is not very fond of me  oh bother cried morris angrily  i wouldnt say such a thing without being sure  i saw it i felt it in england just before he came away  he talked to me one night the last night and then it came over me  you can tell when a person feels that way  i wouldnt accuse him if he hadnt made me feel that way  i dont accuse him i just tell you that thats how it is  he cant help it we cant govern our affections  do i govern mine mightnt he say that to me  its because he is so fond of my mother whom we lost so long ago  she was beautiful and very very brilliant he is always thinking of her  i am not at all like her aunt penniman has told me that  of course it isnt my fault but neither is it his fault  all i mean is its true and its a stronger reason for his never being reconciled than simply his dislike for you  simply cried morris with a laugh i am much obliged for that  i dont mind about his disliking you now i mind everything less  i feel differently i feel separated from my father  upon my word said morris you are a queer family  dont say thatdont say anything unkind the girl entreated you must be very kind to me now because morrisbecause and she hesitated a momentbecause i have done a great deal for you  oh i know that my dear  she had spoken up to this moment without vehemence or outward sign of emotion gently reasoningly only trying to explain  but her emotion had been ineffectually smothered and it betrayed itself at last in the trembling of her voice  it is a great thing to be separated like that from your father when you have worshipped him before  it has made me very unhappy or it would have made me so if i didnt love you  you can tell when a person speaks to you as if as if  as if what  as if they despised you said catherine passionately  he spoke that way the night before we sailed  it wasnt much but it was enough and i thought of it on the voyage all the time  then i made up my mind  i will never ask him for anything again or expect anything from him  it would not be natural now  we must be very happy together and we must not seem to depend upon his forgiveness and morris morris you must never despise me  this was an easy promise to make and morris made it with fine effect  but for the moment he undertook nothing more onerous    chapter xxvii    the doctor of course on his return had a good deal of talk with his sisters  he was at no great pains to narrate his travels or to communicate his impressions of distant lands to mrs penniman upon whom he contented himself with bestowing a memento of his enviable experience in the shape of a velvet gown  but he conversed with her at some length about matters nearer home and lost no time in assuring her that he was still an inflexible father  i have no doubt you have seen a great deal of mr townsend and done your best to console him for catherines absence he said  i dont ask you and you neednt deny it  i wouldnt put the question to you for the world and expose you to the inconvenience of having toa excogitate an answer  no one has betrayed you and there has been no spy upon your proceedings  elizabeth has told no tales and has never mentioned you except to praise your good looks and good spirits  the thing is simply an inference of my ownan induction as the philosophers say  it seems to me likely that you would have offered an asylum to an interesting sufferer  mr townsend has been a good deal in the house there is something in the house that tells me so  we doctors you know end by acquiring fine perceptions and it is impressed upon my sensorium that he has sat in these chairs in a very easy attitude and warmed himself at that fire  i dont grudge him the comfort of it it is the only one he will ever enjoy at my expense  it seems likely indeed that i shall be able to economise at his own  i dont know what you may have said to him or what you may say hereafter but i should like you to know that if you have encouraged him to believe that he will gain anything by hanging on or that i have budged a hairsbreadth from the position i took up a year ago you have played him a trick for which he may exact reparation  im not sure that he may not bring a suit against you of course you have done it conscientiously you have made yourself believe that i can be tired out  this is the most baseless hallucination that ever visited the brain of a genial optimist  i am not in the least tired i am as fresh as when i started i am good for fifty years yet  catherine appears not to have budged an inch either she is equally fresh so we are about where we were before this however you know as well as i  what i wish is simply to give you notice of my own state of mind  take it to heart dear lavinia beware of the just resentment of a deluded fortunehunter  i cant say i expected it said mrs penniman  and i had a sort of foolish hope that you would come home without that odious ironical tone with which you treat the most sacred subjects  dont undervalue irony it is often of great use  it is not however always necessary and i will show you how gracefully i can lay it aside  i should like to know whether you think morris townsend will hang on  i will answer you with your own weapons said mrs penniman  you had better wait and see  do you call such a speech as that one of my own weapons  i never said anything so rough  he will hang on long enough to make you very uncomfortable then  my dear lavinia exclaimed the doctor do you call that irony  i call it pugilism  mrs penniman however in spite of her pugilism was a good deal frightened and she took counsel of her fears  her brother meanwhile took counsel with many reservations of mrs almond to whom he was no less generous than to lavinia and a good deal more communicative  i suppose she has had him there all the while he said  i must look into the state of my wine  you neednt mind telling me now i have already said all i mean to say to her on the subject  i believe he was in the house a good deal mrs almond answered but you must admit that your leaving lavinia quite alone was a great change for her and that it was natural she should want some society  i do admit that and that is why i shall make no row about the wine i shall set it down as compensation to lavinia  she is capable of telling me that she drank it all herself  think of the inconceivable bad taste in the circumstances of that fellow making free with the houseor coming there at all  if that doesnt describe him he is indescribable  his plan is to get what he can  lavinia will have supported him for a year said mrs almond  its so much gained  she will have to support him for the rest of his life then cried the doctor  but without wine as they say at the tables dhote  catherine tells me he has set up a business and is making a great deal of money  the doctor stared  she has not told me thatand lavinia didnt deign  ah he cried catherine has given me up  not that it matters for all that the business amounts to  she has not given up mr townsend said mrs almond  i saw that in the first half minute  she has come home exactly the same  exactly the same not a grain more intelligent  she didnt notice a stick or a stone all the while we were awaynot a picture nor a view not a statue nor a cathedral  how could she notice  she had other things to think of they are never for an instant out of her mind  she touches me very much  she would touch me if she didnt irritate me  thats the effect she has upon me now  i have tried everything upon her i really have been quite merciless  but it is of no use whatever she is absolutely glued  i have passed in consequence into the exasperated stage  at first i had a good deal of a certain genial curiosity about it i wanted to see if she really would stick  but good lord ones curiosity is satisfied  i see she is capable of it and now she can let go  she will never let go said mrs almond  take care or you will exasperate me too  if she doesnt let go she will be shaken offsent tumbling into the dust  thats a nice position for my daughter  she cant see that if you are going to be pushed you had better jump  and then she will complain of her bruises  she will never complain said mrs almond  that i shall object to even more  but the deuce will be that i cant prevent anything  if she is to have a fall said mrs almond with a gentle laugh we must spread as many carpets as we can  and she carried out this idea by showing a great deal of motherly kindness to the girl  mrs penniman immediately wrote to morris townsend  the intimacy between these two was by this time consummate but i must content myself with noting but a few of its features  mrs pennimans own share in it was a singular sentiment which might have been misinterpreted but which in itself was not discreditable to the poor lady  it was a romantic interest in this attractive and unfortunate young man and yet it was not such an interest as catherine might have been jealous of  mrs penniman had not a particle of jealousy of her niece  for herself she felt as if she were morriss mother or sistera mother or sister of an emotional temperamentand she had an absorbing desire to make him comfortable and happy  she had striven to do so during the year that her brother left her an open field and her efforts had been attended with the success that has been pointed out  she had never had a child of her own and catherine whom she had done her best to invest with the importance that would naturally belong to a youthful penniman had only partly rewarded her zeal  catherine as an object of affection and solicitude had never had that picturesque charm which as it seemed to her would have been a natural attribute of her own progeny  even the maternal passion in mrs penniman would have been romantic and factitious and catherine was not constituted to inspire a romantic passion  mrs penniman was as fond of her as ever but she had grown to feel that with catherine she lacked opportunity  sentimentally speaking therefore she had though she had not disinherited her niece adopted morris townsend who gave her opportunity in abundance  she would have been very happy to have a handsome and tyrannical son and would have taken an extreme interest in his love affairs  this was the light in which she had come to regard morris who had conciliated her at first and made his impression by his delicate and calculated deferencea sort of exhibition to which mrs penniman was particularly sensitive  he had largely abated his deference afterwards for he economised his resources but the impression was made and the young mans very brutality came to have a sort of filial value  if mrs penniman had had a son she would probably have been afraid of him and at this stage of our narrative she was certainly afraid of morris townsend  this was one of the results of his domestication in washington square  he took his ease with heras for that matter he would certainly have done with his own mother    chapter xxviii    the letter was a word of warning it informed him that the doctor had come home more impracticable than ever  she might have reflected that catherine would supply him with all the information he needed on this point but we know that mrs pennimans reflexions were rarely just and moreover she felt that it was not for her to depend on what catherine might do  she was to do her duty quite irrespective of catherine  i have said that her young friend took his ease with her and it is an illustration of the fact that he made no answer to her letter  he took note of it amply but he lighted his cigar with it and he waited in tranquil confidence that he should receive another  his state of mind really freezes my blood mrs penniman had written alluding to her brother and it would have seemed that upon this statement she could hardly improve  nevertheless she wrote again expressing herself with the aid of a different figure his hatred of you burns with a lurid flamethe flame that never dies she wrote  but it doesnt light up the darkness of your future  if my affection could do so all the years of your life would be an eternal sunshine  i can extract nothing from c she is so terribly secretive like her father  she seems to expect to be married very soon and has evidently made preparations in europe quantities of clothing ten pairs of shoes etc  my dear friend you cannot set up in married life simply with a few pairs of shoes can you  tell me what you think of this  i am intensely anxious to see you i have so much to say  i miss you dreadfully the house seems so empty without you  what is the news down town  is the business extending  that dear little businessi think its so brave of you couldnt i come to your officejust for three minutes  i might pass for a customeris that what you call them  i might come in to buy somethingsome shares or some railroad things  tell me what you think of this plan  i would carry a little reticule like a woman of the people  in spite of the suggestion about the reticule morris appeared to think poorly of the plan for he gave mrs penniman no encouragement whatever to visit his office which he had already represented to her as a place peculiarly and unnaturally difficult to find  but as she persisted in desiring an interviewup to the last after months of intimate colloquy she called these meetings interviewshe agreed that they should take a walk together and was even kind enough to leave his office for this purpose during the hours at which business might have been supposed to be liveliest  it was no surprise to him when they met at a street corner in a region of empty lots and undeveloped pavements mrs penniman being attired as much as possible like a woman of the people to find that in spite of her urgency what she chiefly had to convey to him was the assurance of her sympathy  of such assurances however he had already a voluminous collection and it would not have been worth his while to forsake a fruitful avocation merely to hear mrs penniman say for the thousandth time that she had made his cause her own  morris had something of his own to say  it was not an easy thing to bring out and while he turned it over the difficulty made him acrimonious  oh yes i know perfectly that he combines the properties of a lump of ice and a redhot coal he observed  catherine has made it thoroughly clear and you have told me so till i am sick of it  you neednt tell me again i am perfectly satisfied  he will never give us a penny i regard that as mathematically proved  mrs penniman at this point had an inspiration  couldnt you bring a lawsuit against him  she wondered that this simple expedient had never occurred to her before  i will bring a lawsuit against you said morris if you ask me any more such aggravating questions  a man should know when he is beaten he added in a moment  i must give her up  mrs penniman received this declaration in silence though it made her heart beat a little  it found her by no means unprepared for she had accustomed herself to the thought that if morris should decidedly not be able to get her brothers money it would not do for him to marry catherine without it  it would not do was a vague way of putting the thing but mrs pennimans natural affection completed the idea which though it had not as yet been so crudely expressed between them as in the form that morris had just given it had nevertheless been implied so often in certain easy intervals of talk as he sat stretching his legs in the doctors wellstuffed armchairs that she had grown first to regard it with an emotion which she flattered herself was philosophic and then to have a secret tenderness for it  the fact that she kept her tenderness secret proves of course that she was ashamed of it but she managed to blink her shame by reminding herself that she was after all the official protector of her nieces marriage  her logic would scarcely have passed muster with the doctor  in the first place morris must get the money and she would help him to it  in the second it was plain it would never come to him and it would be a grievous pity he should marry without ita young man who might so easily find something better  after her brother had delivered himself on his return from europe of that incisive little address that has been quoted morriss cause seemed so hopeless that mrs penniman fixed her attention exclusively upon the latter branch of her argument  if morris had been her son she would certainly have sacrificed catherine to a superior conception of his future and to be ready to do so as the case stood was therefore even a finer degree of devotion  nevertheless it checked her breath a little to have the sacrificial knife as it were suddenly thrust into her hand  morris walked along a moment and then he repeated harshly  i must give her up  i think i understand you said mrs penniman gently  i certainly say it distinctly enoughbrutally and vulgarly enough  he was ashamed of himself and his shame was uncomfortable and as he was extremely intolerant of discomfort he felt vicious and cruel he wanted to abuse somebody and he began cautiouslyfor he was always cautiouswith himself  couldnt you take her down a little he asked  take her down  prepare hertry and ease me off  mrs penniman stopped looking at him very solemnly  my poor morris do you know how much she loves you  no i dont  i dont want to know  i have always tried to keep from knowing  it would be too painful  she will suffer much said mrs penniman  you must console her  if you are as good a friend to me as you pretend to be you will manage it  mrs penniman shook her head sadly  you talk of my pretending to like you but i cant pretend to hate you  i can only tell her i think very highly of you and how will that console her for losing you  the doctor will help you  he will be delighted at the thing being broken off and as he is a knowing fellow he will invent something to comfort her  he will invent a new torture cried mrs penniman  heaven deliver her from her fathers comfort  it will consist of his crowing over her and saying i always told you so  morris coloured a most uncomfortable red  if you dont console her any better than you console me you certainly wont be of much use  its a damned disagreeable necessity i feel it extremely and you ought to make it easy for me  i will be your friend for life mrs penniman declared  be my friend now  and morris walked on  she went with him she was almost trembling  should you like me to tell her she asked  you mustnt tell her but you canyou can  and he hesitated trying to think what mrs penniman could do  you can explain to her why it is  its because i cant bring myself to step in between her and her fatherto give him the pretext he grasps atso eagerly its a hideous sight for depriving her of her rights  mrs penniman felt with remarkable promptitude the charm of this formula  thats so like you she said its so finely felt  morris gave his stick an angry swing  oh botheration he exclaimed perversely  mrs penniman however was not discouraged  it may turn out better than you think  catherine is after all so very peculiar  and she thought she might take it upon herself to assure him that whatever happened the girl would be very quietshe wouldnt make a noise  they extended their walk and while they proceeded mrs penniman took upon herself other things besides and ended by having assumed a considerable burden morris being ready enough as may be imagined to put everything off upon her  but he was not for a single instant the dupe of her blundering alacrity he knew that of what she promised she was competent to perform but an insignificant fraction and the more she professed her willingness to serve him the greater fool he thought her  what will you do if you dont marry her she ventured to inquire in the course of this conversation  something brilliant said morris  shouldnt you like me to do something brilliant  the idea gave mrs penniman exceeding pleasure  i shall feel sadly taken in if you dont  i shall have to to make up for this  this isnt at all brilliant you know  mrs penniman mused a little as if there might be some way of making out that it was but she had to give up the attempt and to carry off the awkwardness of failure she risked a new inquiry  do you meando you mean another marriage  morris greeted this question with a reflexion which was hardly the less impudent from being inaudible  surely women are more crude than men  and then he answered audibly  never in the world  mrs penniman felt disappointed and snubbed and she relieved herself in a little vaguelysarcastic cry  he was certainly perverse  i give her up not for another woman but for a wider career morris announced  this was very grand but still mrs penniman who felt that she had exposed herself was faintly rancorous  do you mean never to come to see her again she asked with some sharpness  oh no i shall come again but what is the use of dragging it out i have been four times since she came back and its terribly awkward work  i cant keep it up indefinitely she oughtnt to expect that you know  a woman should never keep a man dangling he added finely  ah but you must have your last parting urged his companion in whose imagination the idea of last partings occupied a place inferior in dignity only to that of first meetings    chapter xxix    he came again without managing the last parting and again and again without finding that mrs penniman had as yet done much to pave the path of retreat with flowers  it was devilish awkward as he said and he felt a lively animosity for catherines aunt who as he had now quite formed the habit of saying to himself had dragged him into the mess and was bound in common charity to get him out of it  mrs penniman to tell the truth had in the seclusion of her own apartmentand i may add amid the suggestiveness of catherines which wore in those days the appearance of that of a young lady laying out her trousseaumrs penniman had measured her responsibilities and taken fright at their magnitude  the task of preparing catherine and easing off morris presented difficulties which increased in the execution and even led the impulsive lavinia to ask herself whether the modification of the young mans original project had been conceived in a happy spirit  a brilliant future a wider career a conscience exempt from the reproach of interference between a young lady and her natural rightsthese excellent things might be too troublesomely purchased  from catherine herself mrs penniman received no assistance whatever the poor girl was apparently without suspicion of her danger  she looked at her lover with eyes of undiminished trust and though she had less confidence in her aunt than in a young man with whom she had exchanged so many tender vows she gave her no handle for explaining or confessing mrs penniman faltering and wavering declared catherine was very stupid put off the great scene as she would have called it from day to day and wandered about very uncomfortably primed to repletion with her apology but unable to bring it to the light morriss own scenes were very small ones just now but even these were beyond his strength  he made his visits as brief as possible and while he sat with his mistress found terribly little to talk about  she was waiting for him in vulgar parlance to name the day and so long as he was unprepared to be explicit on this point it seemed a mockery to pretend to talk about matters more abstract  she had no airs and no arts she never attempted to disguise her expectancy  she was waiting on his good pleasure and would wait modestly and patiently his hanging back at this supreme time might appear strange but of course he must have a good reason for it catherine would have made a wife of the gentle oldfashioned pattern regarding reasons as favours and windfalls but no more expecting one every day than she would have expected a bouquet of camellias during the period of her engagement however a young lady even of the most slender pretensions counts upon more bouquets than at other times and there was a want of perfume in the air at this moment which at last excited the girls alarm  are you sick she asked of morris  you seem so restless and you look pale  i am not at all well said morris and it occurred to him that if he could only make her pity him enough he might get off  i am afraid you are overworked you oughtnt to work so much  i must do that  and then he added with a sort of calculated brutality i dont want to owe you everything  ah how can you say that  i am too proud said morris  yesyou are too proud  well you must take me as i am he went on you can never change me  i dont want to change you she said gently  i will take you as you are  and she stood looking at him  you know people talk tremendously about a mans marrying a rich girl morris remarked  its excessively disagreeable  but i am not rich said catherine  you are rich enough to make me talked about  of course you are talked about  its an honour  its an honour i could easily dispense with  she was on the point of asking him whether it were not a compensation for this annoyance that the poor girl who had the misfortune to bring it upon him loved him so dearly and believed in him so truly but she hesitated thinking that this would perhaps seem an exacting speech and while she hesitated he suddenly left her  the next time he came however she brought it out and she told him again that he was too proud  he repeated that he couldnt change and this time she felt the impulse to say that with a little effort he might change  sometimes he thought that if he could only make a quarrel with her it might help him but the question was how to quarrel with a young woman who had such treasures of concession  i suppose you think the effort is all on your side he was reduced to exclaiming  dont you believe that i have my own effort to make  its all yours now she said  my effort is finished and done with  well mine is not  we must bear things together said catherine  thats what we ought to do  morris attempted a natural smile  there are some things which we cant very well bear togetherfor instance separation  why do you speak of separation  ah you dont like it i knew you wouldnt  where are you going morris she suddenly asked  he fixed his eye on her for a moment and for a part of that moment she was afraid of it  will you promise not to make a scene  a scenedo i make scenes  all women do said morris with the tone of large experience  i dont  where are you going  if i should say i was going away on business should you think it very strange  she wondered a moment gazing at him  yesno  not if you will take me with you  take you with meon business  what is your business  your business is to be with me  i dont earn my living with you said morris  or rather he cried with a sudden inspiration thats just what i door what the world says i do  this ought perhaps to have been a great stroke but it miscarried where are you going catherine simply repeated  to new orleans  about buying some cotton  i am perfectly willing to go to new orleans  catherine said  do you suppose i would take you to a nest of yellow fever cried morris  do you suppose i would expose you at such a time as this  if there is yellow fever why should you go  morris you must not go  it is to make six thousand dollars said morris  do you grudge me that satisfaction  we have no need of six thousand dollars  you think too much about money  you can afford to say that  this is a great chance we heard of it last night  and he explained to her in what the chance consisted and told her a long story going over more than once several of the details about the remarkable stroke of business which he and his partner had planned between them  but catherines imagination for reasons best known to herself absolutely refused to be fired  if you can go to new orleans i can go she said  why shouldnt you catch yellow fever quite as easily as i  i am every bit as strong as you and not in the least afraid of any fever  when we were in europe we were in very unhealthy places my father used to make me take some pills  i never caught anything and i never was nervous  what will be the use of six thousand dollars if you die of a fever  when persons are going to be married they oughtnt to think so much about business  you shouldnt think about cotton you should think about me  you can go to new orleans some other timethere will always be plenty of cotton  it isnt the moment to choosewe have waited too long already  she spoke more forcibly and volubly than he had ever heard her and she held his arm in her two hands  you said you wouldnt make a scene cried morris  i call this a scene  its you that are making it  i have never asked you anything before  we have waited too long already  and it was a comfort to her to think that she had hitherto asked so little it seemed to make her right to insist the greater now  morris bethought himself a little  very well then we wont talk about it any more  i will transact my business by letter  and he began to smooth his hat as if to take leave  you wont go  and she stood looking up at him  he could not give up his idea of provoking a quarrel it was so much the simplest way  he bent his eyes on her upturned face with the darkest frown he could achieve  you are not discreet  you mustnt bully me  but as usual she conceded everything  no i am not discreet i know i am too pressing  but isnt it natural  it is only for a moment  in a moment you may do a great deal of harm  try and be calmer the next time i come  when will you come  do you want to make conditions morris asked  i will come next saturday  come tomorrow catherine begged i want you to come tomorrow  i will be very quiet she added and her agitation had by this time become so great that the assurance was not becoming  a sudden fear had come over her it was like the solid conjunction of a dozen disembodied doubts and her imagination at a single bound had traversed an enormous distance  all her being for the moment centred in the wish to keep him in the room  morris bent his head and kissed her forehead  when you are quiet you are perfection he said but when you are violent you are not in character  it was catherines wish that there should be no violence about her save the beating of her heart which she could not help and she went on as gently as possible will you promise to come tomorrow  i said saturday morris answered smiling  he tried a frown at one moment a smile at another he was at his wits end  yes saturday too she answered trying to smile  but tomorrow first  he was going to the door and she went with him quickly she leaned her shoulder against it it seemed to her that she would do anything to keep him  if i am prevented from coming tomorrow you will say i have deceived you he said  how can you be prevented  you can come if you will  i am a busy mani am not a dangler cried morris sternly  his voice was so hard and unnatural that with a helpless look at him she turned away and then he quickly laid his hand on the door knob  he felt as if he were absolutely running away from her  but in an instant she was close to him again and murmuring in a tone none the less penetrating for being low morris you are going to leave me  yes for a little while  for how long  till you are reasonable again  i shall never be reasonable in that way  and she tried to keep him longer it was almost a struggle  think of what i have done she broke out  morris i have given up everything  you shall have everything back  you wouldnt say that if you didnt mean something  what is it what has happenedwhat have i donewhat has changed you  i will write to youthat is better morris stammered  ah you wont come back she cried bursting into tears  dear catherine he said dont believe that i promise you that you shall see me again  and he managed to get away and to close the door behind him    chapter xxx    it was almost her last outbreak of passive grief at least she never indulged in another that the world knew anything about  but this one was long and terrible she flung herself on the sofa and gave herself up to her misery  she hardly knew what had happened ostensibly she had only had a difference with her lover as other girls had had before and the thing was not only not a rupture but she was under no obligation to regard it even as a menace  nevertheless she felt a wound even if he had not dealt it it seemed to her that a mask had suddenly fallen from his face  he had wished to get away from her he had been angry and cruel and said strange things with strange looks  she was smothered and stunned she buried her head in the cushions sobbing and talking to herself  but at last she raised herself with the fear that either her father or mrs penniman would come in and then she sat there staring before her while the room grew darker  she said to herself that perhaps he would come back to tell her he had not meant what he said and she listened for his ring at the door trying to believe that this was probable  a long time passed but morris remained absent the shadows gathered the evening settled down on the meagre elegance of the light clearcoloured room the fire went out  when it had grown dark catherine went to the window and looked out she stood there for half an hour on the mere chance that he would come up the steps  at last she turned away for she saw her father come in  he had seen her at the window looking out and he stopped a moment at the bottom of the white steps and gravely with an air of exaggerated courtesy lifted his hat to her  the gesture was so incongruous to the condition she was in this stately tribute of respect to a poor girl despised and forsaken was so out of place that the thing gave her a kind of horror and she hurried away to her room  it seemed to her that she had given morris up  she had to show herself half an hour later and she was sustained at table by the immensity of her desire that her father should not perceive that anything had happened  this was a great help to her afterwards and it served her though never as much as she supposed from the first  on this occasion dr sloper was rather talkative he told a great many stories about a wonderful poodle that he had seen at the house of an old lady whom he visited professionally catherine not only tried to appear to listen to the anecdotes of the poodle but she endeavoured to interest herself in them so as not to think of her scene with morris  that perhaps was an hallucination he was mistaken she was jealous people didnt change like that from one day to another  then she knew that she had had doubts before strange suspicions that were at once vague and acuteand that he had been different ever since her return from europe  whereupon she tried again to listen to her father who told a story so remarkably well  afterwards she went straight to her own room it was beyond her strength to undertake to spend the evening with her aunt  all the evening alone she questioned herself  her trouble was terrible but was it a thing of her imagination engendered by an extravagant sensibility or did it represent a clearcut reality and had the worst that was possible actually come to pass  mrs penniman with a degree of tact that was as unusual as it was commendable took the line of leaving her alone  the truth is that her suspicions having been aroused she indulged a desire natural to a timid person that the explosion should be localised  so long as the air still vibrated she kept out of the way  she passed and repassed catherines door several times in the course of the evening as if she expected to hear a plaintive moan behind it  but the room remained perfectly still and accordingly the last thing before retiring to her own couch she applied for admittance catherine was sitting up and had a book that she pretended to be reading  she had no wish to go to bed for she had no expectation of sleeping  after mrs penniman had left her she sat up half the night and she offered her visitor no inducement to remain  her aunt came stealing in very gently and approached her with great solemnity  i am afraid you are in trouble my dear  can i do anything to help you  i am not in any trouble whatever and do not need any help said catherine fibbing roundly and proving thereby that not only our faults but our most involuntary misfortunes tend to corrupt our morals  has nothing happened to you  nothing whatever  are you very sure dear  perfectly sure  and can i really do nothing for you  nothing aunt but kindly leave me alone said catherine  mrs penniman though she had been afraid of too warm a welcome before was now disappointed at so cold a one and in relating afterwards as she did to many persons and with considerable variations of detail the history of the termination of her nieces engagement she was usually careful to mention that the young lady on a certain occasion had hustled her out of the room  it was characteristic of mrs penniman that she related this fact not in the least out of malignity to catherine whom she very sufficiently pitied but simply from a natural disposition to embellish any subject that she touched  catherine as i have said sat up half the night as if she still expected to hear morris townsend ring at the door  on the morrow this expectation was less unreasonable but it was not gratified by the reappearance of the young man  neither had he written there was not a word of explanation or reassurance  fortunately for catherine she could take refuge from her excitement which had now become intense in her determination that her father should see nothing of it  how well she deceived her father we shall have occasion to learn but her innocent arts were of little avail before a person of the rare perspicacity of mrs penniman  this lady easily saw that she was agitated and if there was any agitation going forward mrs penniman was not a person to forfeit her natural share in it  she returned to the charge the next evening and requested her niece to lean upon herto unburden her heart  perhaps she should be able to explain certain things that now seemed dark and that she knew more about than catherine supposed  if catherine had been frigid the night before today she was haughty  you are completely mistaken and i have not the least idea what you mean  i dont know what you are trying to fasten on me and i have never had less need of any ones explanations in my life  in this way the girl delivered herself and from hour to hour kept her aunt at bay  from hour to hour mrs pennimans curiosity grew she would have given her little finger to know what morris had said and done what tone he had taken what pretext he had found  she wrote to him naturally to request an interview but she received as naturally no answer to her petition  morris was not in a writing mood for catherine had addressed him two short notes which met with no acknowledgment  these notes were so brief that i may give them entire  wont you give me some sign that you didnt mean to be so cruel as you seemed on tuesdaythat was the first the other was a little longer  if i was unreasonable or suspicious on tuesdayif i annoyed you or troubled you in any wayi beg your forgiveness and i promise never again to be so foolish  i am punished enough and i dont understand  dear morris you are killing me  these notes were despatched on the friday and saturday but saturday and sunday passed without bringing the poor girl the satisfaction she desired her punishment accumulated she continued to bear it however with a good deal of superficial fortitude  on saturday morning the doctor who had been watching in silence spoke to his sister lavinia  the thing has happenedthe scoundrel has backed out  never cried mrs penniman who had bethought herself what she should say to catherine but was not provided with a line of defence against her brother so that indignant negation was the only weapon in her hands  he has begged for a reprieve then if you like that better  it seems to make you very happy that your daughters affections have been trifled with  it does said the doctor for i had foretold it  its a great pleasure to be in the right  your pleasures make one shudder his sister exclaimed  catherine went rigidly through her usual occupations that is up to the point of going with her aunt to church on sunday morning  she generally went to afternoon service as well but on this occasion her courage faltered and she begged of mrs penniman to go without her  i am sure you have a secret said mrs penniman with great significance looking at her rather grimly  if i have i shall keep it catherine answered turning away  mrs penniman started for church but before she had arrived she stopped and turned back and before twenty minutes had elapsed she reentered the house looked into the empty parlours and then went upstairs and knocked at catherines door  she got no answer catherine was not in her room and mrs penniman presently ascertained that she was not in the house  she has gone to him she has fled lavinia cried clasping her hands with admiration and envy  but she soon perceived that catherine had taken nothing with herall her personal property in her room was intactand then she jumped at the hypothesis that the girl had gone forth not in tenderness but in resentment  she has followed him to his own doorshe has burst upon him in his own apartment  it was in these terms that mrs penniman depicted to herself her nieces errand which viewed in this light gratified her sense of the picturesque only a shade less strongly than the idea of a clandestine marriage to visit ones lover with tears and reproaches at his own residence was an image so agreeable to mrs pennimans mind that she felt a sort of aesthetic disappointment at its lacking in this case the harmonious accompaniments of darkness and storm  a quiet sunday afternoon appeared an inadequate setting for it and indeed mrs penniman was quite out of humour with the conditions of the time which passed very slowly as she sat in the front parlour in her bonnet and her cashmere shawl awaiting catherines return  this event at last took place  she saw herat the windowmount the steps and she went to await her in the hall where she pounced upon her as soon as she had entered the house and drew her into the parlour closing the door with solemnity  catherine was flushed and her eye was bright  mrs penniman hardly knew what to think  may i venture to ask where you have been she demanded  i have been to take a walk said catherine  i thought you had gone to church  i did go to church but the service was shorter than usual  and pray where did you walk  i dont know said catherine  your ignorance is most extraordinary  dear catherine you can trust me  what am i to trust you with  with your secretyour sorrow  i have no sorrow said catherine fiercely  my poor child mrs penniman insisted you cant deceive me  i know everything  i have been requested toato converse with you  i dont want to converse  it will relieve you  dont you know shakespeares linesthe grief that does not speak  my dear girl it is better as it is  what is better catherine asked  she was really too perverse  a certain amount of perversity was to be allowed for in a young lady whose lover had thrown her over but not such an amount as would prove inconvenient to his apologists that you should be reasonable said mrs penniman with some sternness  that you should take counsel of worldly prudence and submit to practical considerations  that you should agree toa separate  catherine had been ice up to this moment but at this word she flamed up  separate  what do you know about our separating  mrs penniman shook her head with a sadness in which there was almost a sense of injury  your pride is my pride and your susceptibilities are mine  i see your side perfectly but i also and she smiled with melancholy suggestivenessi also see the situation as a whole  this suggestiveness was lost upon catherine who repeated her violent inquiry  why do you talk about separation what do you know about it  we must study resignation said mrs penniman hesitating but sententious at a venture  resignation to what  to a change ofof our plans  my plans have not changed said catherine with a little laugh  ah but mr townsends have her aunt answered very gently  what do you mean  there was an imperious brevity in the tone of this inquiry against which mrs penniman felt bound to protest the information with which she had undertaken to supply her niece was after all a favour  she had tried sharpness and she had tried sternness  but neither would do she was shocked at the girls obstinacy  ah well she said if he hasnt told you     and she turned away  catherine watched her a moment in silence then she hurried after her stopping her before she reached the door  told me what  what do you mean  what are you hinting at and threatening me with  isnt it broken off asked mrs penniman  my engagement  not in the least  i beg your pardon in that case  i have spoken too soon  too soon  soon or late catherine broke out you speak foolishly and cruelly  what has happened between you then asked her aunt struck by the sincerity of this cry  for something certainly has happened  nothing has happened but that i love him more and more  mrs penniman was silent an instant  i suppose thats the reason you went to see him this afternoon  catherine flushed as if she had been struck  yes i did go to see him  but thats my own business  very well then we wont talk about it  and mrs penniman moved towards the door again  but she was stopped by a sudden imploring cry from the girl  aunt lavinia where has he gone  ah you admit then that he has gone away  didnt they know at his house  they said he had left town  i asked no more questions i was ashamed said catherine simply enough  you neednt have taken so compromising a step if you had had a little more confidence in me mrs penniman observed with a good deal of grandeur  is it to new orleans catherine went on irrelevantly  it was the first time mrs penniman had heard of new orleans in this connexion but she was averse to letting catherine know that she was in the dark  she attempted to strike an illumination from the instructions she had received from morris  my dear catherine she said when a separation has been agreed upon the farther he goes away the better  agreed upon  has he agreed upon it with you  a consummate sense of her aunts meddlesome folly had come over her during the last five minutes and she was sickened at the thought that mrs penniman had been let loose as it were upon her happiness  he certainly has sometimes advised with me said mrs penniman  is it you then that have changed him and made him so unnatural catherine cried  is it you that have worked on him and taken him from me  he doesnt belong to you and i dont see how you have anything to do with what is between us  is it you that have made this plot and told him to leave me  how could you be so wicked so cruel  what have i ever done to you why cant you leave me alone i was afraid you would spoil everything for you do spoil everything you touch i was afraid of you all the time we were abroad i had no rest when i thought that you were always talking to him  catherine went on with growing vehemence pouring out in her bitterness and in the clairvoyance of her passion which suddenly jumping all processes made her judge her aunt finally and without appeal the uneasiness which had lain for so many months upon her heart  mrs penniman was scared and bewildered she saw no prospect of introducing her little account of the purity of morriss motives you are a most ungrateful girl she cried  do you scold me for talking with him  i am sure we never talked of anything but you  yes and that was the way you worried him you made him tired of my very name  i wish you had never spoken of me to him i never asked your help  i am sure if it hadnt been for me he would never have come to the house and you would never have known what he thought of you mrs penniman rejoined with a good deal of justice  i wish he never had come to the house and that i never had known it  thats better than this said poor catherine  you are a very ungrateful girl aunt lavinia repeated  catherines outbreak of anger and the sense of wrong gave her while they lasted the satisfaction that comes from all assertion of force they hurried her along and there is always a sort of pleasure in cleaving the air  but at the bottom she hated to be violent and she was conscious of no aptitude for organised resentment  she calmed herself with a great effort but with great rapidity and walked about the room a few moments trying to say to herself that her aunt had meant everything for the best  she did not succeed in saying it with much conviction but after a little she was able to speak quietly enough  i am not ungrateful but i am very unhappy  its hard to be grateful for that she said  will you please tell me where he is  i havent the least idea i am not in secret correspondence with him  and mrs penniman wished indeed that she were so that she might let him know how catherine abused her after all she had done  was it a plan of his then to break off  by this time catherine had become completely quiet  mrs penniman began again to have a glimpse of her chance for explaining  he shrankhe shrank she said  he lacked courage but it was the courage to injure you  he couldnt bear to bring down on you your fathers curse  catherine listened to this with her eyes fixed upon her aunt and continued to gaze at her for some time afterwards  did he tell you to say that  he told me to say many thingsall so delicate so discriminating and he told me to tell you he hoped you wouldnt despise him  i dont said catherine  and then she added  and will he stay away for ever  oh for ever is a long time  your father perhaps wont live for ever  perhaps not  i am sure you appreciateyou understandeven though your heart bleeds said mrs penniman  you doubtless think him too scrupulous  so do i but i respect his scruples  what he asks of you is that you should do the same  catherine was still gazing at her aunt but she spoke at last as if she had not heard or not understood her  it has been a regular plan then  he has broken it off deliberately he has given me up  for the present dear catherine  he has put it off only  he has left me alone catherine went on  havent you me asked mrs penniman with much expression  catherine shook her head slowly  i dont believe it and she left the room    chapter xxxi    though she had forced herself to be calm she preferred practising this virtue in private and she forbore to show herself at teaa repast which on sundays at six oclock took the place of dinner dr sloper and his sister sat face to face but mrs penniman never met her brothers eye  late in the evening she went with him but without catherine to their sister almonds where between the two ladies catherines unhappy situation was discussed with a frankness that was conditioned by a good deal of mysterious reticence on mrs pennimans part  i am delighted he is not to marry her said mrs almond but he ought to be horsewhipped all the same  mrs penniman who was shocked at her sisters coarseness replied that he had been actuated by the noblest of motivesthe desire not to impoverish catherine  i am very happy that catherine is not to be impoverishedbut i hope he may never have a penny too much  and what does the poor girl say to you mrs almond asked  she says i have a genius for consolation said mrs penniman  this was the account of the matter that she gave to her sister and it was perhaps with the consciousness of genius that on her return that evening to washington square she again presented herself for admittance at catherines door  catherine came and opened it she was apparently very quiet  i only want to give you a little word of advice she said  if your father asks you say that everything is going on  catherine stood there with her hand on the knob looking at her aunt but not asking her to come in  do you think he will ask me  i am sure he will  he asked me just now on our way home from your aunt elizabeths  i explained the whole thing to your aunt elizabeth  i said to your father i know nothing about it  do you think he will ask me when he seeswhen he sees  but here catherine stopped  the more he sees the more disagreeable he will be said her aunt  he shall see as little as possible catherine declared  tell him you are to be married  so i am said catherine softly and she closed the door upon her aunt  she could not have said this two days laterfor instance on tuesday when she at last received a letter from morris townsend  it was an epistle of considerable length measuring five large square pages and written at philadelphia  it was an explanatory document and it explained a great many things chief among which were the considerations that had led the writer to take advantage of an urgent professional absence to try and banish from his mind the image of one whose path he had crossed only to scatter it with ruins  he ventured to expect but partial success in this attempt but he could promise her that whatever his failure he would never again interpose between her generous heart and her brilliant prospects and filial duties  he closed with an intimation that his professional pursuits might compel him to travel for some months and with the hope that when they should each have accommodated themselves to what was sternly involved in their respective positionseven should this result not be reached for yearsthey should meet as friends as fellowsufferers as innocent but philosophic victims of a great social law  that her life should be peaceful and happy was the dearest wish of him who ventured still to subscribe himself her most obedient servant  the letter was beautifully written and catherine who kept it for many years after this was able when her sense of the bitterness of its meaning and the hollowness of its tone had grown less acute to admire its grace of expression  at present for a long time after she received it all she had to help her was the determination daily more rigid to make no appeal to the compassion of her father  he suffered a week to elapse and then one day in the morning at an hour at which she rarely saw him he strolled into the back parlour he had watched his time and he found her alone  she was sitting with some work and he came and stood in front of her  he was going out he had on his hat and was drawing on his gloves  it doesnt seem to me that you are treating me just now with all the consideration i deserve he said in a moment  i dont know what i have done catherine answered with her eyes on her work  you have apparently quite banished from your mind the request i made you at liverpool before we sailed the request that you would notify me in advance before leaving my house  i have not left your house said catherine  but you intend to leave it and by what you gave me to understand your departure must be impending  in fact though you are still here in body you are already absent in spirit  your mind has taken up its residence with your prospective husband and you might quite as well be lodged under the conjugal roof for all the benefit we get from your society  i will try and be more cheerful said catherine  you certainly ought to be cheerful you ask a great deal if you are not  to the pleasure of marrying a brilliant young man you add that of having your own way you strike me as a very lucky young lady  catherine got up she was suffocating  but she folded her work deliberately and correctly bending her burning face upon it  her father stood where he had planted himself she hoped he would go but he smoothed and buttoned his gloves and then he rested his hands upon his hips  it would be a convenience to me to know when i may expect to have an empty house he went on  when you go your aunt marches  she looked at him at last with a long silent gaze which in spite of her pride and her resolution uttered part of the appeal she had tried not to make  her fathers cold grey eye sounded her own and he insisted on his point  is it tomorrow  is it next week or the week after  i shall not go away said catherine  the doctor raised his eyebrows  has he backed out  i have broken off my engagement  broken it off  i have asked him to leave new york and he has gone away for a long time  the doctor was both puzzled and disappointed but he solved his perplexity by saying to himself that his daughter simply misrepresentedjustifiably if one would but nevertheless misrepresentedthe facts and he eased off his disappointment which was that of a man losing a chance for a little triumph that he had rather counted on by a few words that he uttered aloud  how does he take his dismissal  i dont know said catherine less ingeniously than she had hitherto spoken  you mean you dont care  you are rather cruel after encouraging him and playing with him for so long  the doctor had his revenge after all    chapter xxxii    our story has hitherto moved with very short steps but as it approaches its termination it must take a long stride  as time went on it might have appeared to the doctor that his daughters account of her rupture with morris townsend mere bravado as he had deemed it was in some degree justified by the sequel  morris remained as rigidly and unremittingly absent as if he had died of a broken heart and catherine had apparently buried the memory of this fruitless episode as deep as if it had terminated by her own choice  we know that she had been deeply and incurably wounded but the doctor had no means of knowing it  he was certainly curious about it and would have given a good deal to discover the exact truth but it was his punishment that he never knewhis punishment i mean for the abuse of sarcasm in his relations with his daughter  there was a good deal of effective sarcasm in her keeping him in the dark and the rest of the world conspired with her in this sense to be sarcastic  mrs penniman told him nothing partly because he never questioned herhe made too light of mrs penniman for thatand partly because she flattered herself that a tormenting reserve and a serene profession of ignorance would avenge her for his theory that she had meddled in the matter  he went two or three times to see mrs montgomery but mrs montgomery had nothing to impart  she simply knew that her brothers engagement was broken off and now that miss sloper was out of danger she preferred not to bear witness in any way against morris  she had done so beforehowever unwillinglybecause she was sorry for miss sloper but she was not sorry for miss sloper nownot at all sorry  morris had told her nothing about his relations with miss sloper at the time and he had told her nothing since  he was always away and he very seldom wrote to her she believed he had gone to california  mrs almond had in her sisters phrase taken up catherine violently since the recent catastrophe but though the girl was very grateful to her for her kindness she revealed no secrets and the good lady could give the doctor no satisfaction even however had she been able to narrate to him the private history of his daughters unhappy love affair it would have given her a certain comfort to leave him in ignorance for mrs almond was at this time not altogether in sympathy with her brother  she had guessed for herself that catherine had been cruelly jiltedshe knew nothing from mrs penniman for mrs penniman had not ventured to lay the famous explanation of morriss motives before mrs almond though she had thought it good enough for catherineand she pronounced her brother too consistently indifferent to what the poor creature must have suffered and must still be suffering  dr sloper had his theory and he rarely altered his theories  the marriage would have been an abominable one and the girl had had a blessed escape  she was not to be pitied for that and to pretend to condole with her would have been to make concessions to the idea that she had ever had a right to think of morris  i put my foot on this idea from the first and i keep it there now said the doctor  i dont see anything cruel in that one cant keep it there too long  to this mrs almond more than once replied that if catherine had got rid of her incongruous lover she deserved the credit of it and that to bring herself to her fathers enlightened view of the matter must have cost her an effort that he was bound to appreciate  i am by no means sure she has got rid of him the doctor said there is not the smallest probability that after having been as obstinate as a mule for two years she suddenly became amenable to reason  it is infinitely more probable that he got rid of her  all the more reason you should be gentle with her  i am gentle with her  but i cant do the pathetic i cant pump up tears to look graceful over the most fortunate thing that ever happened to her  you have no sympathy said mrs almond that was never your strong point  you have only to look at her to see that right or wrong and whether the rupture came from herself or from him her poor little heart is grievously bruised  handling bruisesand even dropping tears on themdoesnt make them any better  my business is to see she gets no more knocks and that i shall carefully attend to  but i dont at all recognise your description of catherine  she doesnt strike me in the least as a young woman going about in search of a moral poultice  in fact she seems to me much better than while the fellow was hanging about  she is perfectly comfortable and blooming she eats and sleeps takes her usual exercise and overloads herself as usual with finery  she is always knitting some purse or embroidering some handkerchief and it seems to me she turns these articles out about as fast as ever  she hasnt much to say but when had she anything to say  she had her little dance and now she is sitting down to rest  i suspect that on the whole she enjoys it  she enjoys it as people enjoy getting rid of a leg that has been crushed  the state of mind after amputation is doubtless one of comparative repose  if your leg is a metaphor for young townsend i can assure you he has never been crushed  crushed  not he  he is alive and perfectly intact and thats why i am not satisfied  should you have liked to kill him asked mrs almond  yes very much  i think it is quite possible that it is all a blind  a blind  an arrangement between them  il fait le mort as they say in france but he is looking out of the corner of his eye  you can depend upon it he has not burned his ships he has kept one to come back in  when i am dead he will set sail again and then she will marry him  it is interesting to know that you accuse your only daughter of being the vilest of hypocrites said mrs almond  i dont see what difference her being my only daughter makes  it is better to accuse one than a dozen  but i dont accuse any one there is not the smallest hypocrisy about catherine and i deny that she even pretends to be miserable  the doctors idea that the thing was a blind had its intermissions and revivals but it may be said on the whole to have increased as he grew older together with his impression of catherines blooming and comfortable condition  naturally if he had not found grounds for viewing her as a lovelorn maiden during the year or two that followed her great trouble he found none at a time when she had completely recovered her selfpossession  he was obliged to recognise the fact that if the two young people were waiting for him to get out of the way they were at least waiting very patiently  he had heard from time to time that morris was in new york but he never remained there long and to the best of the doctors belief had no communication with catherine  he was sure they never met and he had reason to suspect that morris never wrote to her  after the letter that has been mentioned she heard from him twice again at considerable intervals but on none of these occasions did she write herself  on the other hand as the doctor observed she averted herself rigidly from the idea of marrying other people  her opportunities for doing so were not numerous but they occurred often enough to test her disposition  she refused a widower a man with a genial temperament a handsome fortune and three little girls he had heard that she was very fond of children and he pointed to his own with some confidence and she turned a deaf ear to the solicitations of a clever young lawyer who with the prospect of a great practice and the reputation of a most agreeable man had had the shrewdness when he came to look about him for a wife to believe that she would suit him better than several younger and prettier girls  mr macalister the widower had desired to make a marriage of reason and had chosen catherine for what he supposed to be her latent matronly qualities but john ludlow who was a year the girls junior and spoken of always as a young man who might have his pick was seriously in love with her  catherine however would never look at him she made it plain to him that she thought he came to see her too often  he afterwards consoled himself and married a very different person little miss sturtevant whose attractions were obvious to the dullest comprehension  catherine at the time of these events had left her thirtieth year well behind her and had quite taken her place as an old maid  her father would have preferred she should marry and he once told her that he hoped she would not be too fastidious  i should like to see you an honest mans wife before i die he said this was after john ludlow had been compelled to give it up though the doctor had advised him to persevere  the doctor exercised no further pressure and had the credit of not worrying at all over his daughters singleness  in fact he worried rather more than appeared and there were considerable periods during which he felt sure that morris townsend was hidden behind some door  if he is not why doesnt she marry he asked himself  limited as her intelligence may be she must understand perfectly well that she is made to do the usual thing  catherine however became an admirable old maid  she formed habits regulated her days upon a system of her own interested herself in charitable institutions asylums hospitals and aid societies and went generally with an even and noiseless step about the rigid business of her life  this life had however a secret history as well as a public oneif i may talk of the public history of a mature and diffident spinster for whom publicity had always a combination of terrors  from her own point of view the great facts of her career were that morris townsend had trifled with her affection and that her father had broken its spring  nothing could ever alter these facts they were always there like her name her age her plain face  nothing could ever undo the wrong or cure the pain that morris had inflicted on her and nothing could ever make her feel towards her father as she felt in her younger years  there was something dead in her life and her duty was to try and fill the void  catherine recognised this duty to the utmost she had a great disapproval of brooding and moping  she had of course no faculty for quenching memory in dissipation but she mingled freely in the usual gaieties of the town and she became at last an inevitable figure at all respectable entertainments  she was greatly liked and as time went on she grew to be a sort of kindly maiden aunt to the younger portion of society  young girls were apt to confide to her their love affairs which they never did to mrs penniman and young men to be fond of her without knowing why  she developed a few harmless eccentricities her habits once formed were rather stiffly maintained her opinions on all moral and social matters were extremely conservative and before she was forty she was regarded as an oldfashioned person and an authority on customs that had passed away  mrs penniman in comparison was quite a girlish figure she grew younger as she advanced in life she lost none of her relish for beauty and mystery but she had little opportunity to exercise it  with catherines later wooers she failed to establish relations as intimate as those which had given her so many interesting hours in the society of morris townsend these gentlemen had an indefinable mistrust of her good offices and they never talked to her about catherines charms  her ringlets her buckles and bangles glistened more brightly with each succeeding year and she remained quite the same officious and imaginative mrs penniman and the odd mixture of impetuosity and circumspection that we have hitherto known  as regards one point however her circumspection prevailed and she must be given due credit for it for upwards of seventeen years she never mentioned morris townsends name to her niece  catherine was grateful to her but this consistent silence so little in accord with her aunts character gave her a certain alarm and she could never wholly rid herself of a suspicion that mrs penniman sometimes had news of him    chapter xxxiii    little by little dr sloper had retired from his profession he visited only those patients in whose symptoms he recognised a certain originality  he went again to europe and remained two years catherine went with him and on this occasion mrs penniman was of the party  europe apparently had few surprises for mrs penniman who frequently remarked in the most romantic sitesyou know i am very familiar with all this  it should be added that such remarks were usually not addressed to her brother or yet to her niece but to fellowtourists who happened to be at hand or even to the cicerone or the goatherd in the foreground  one day after his return from europe the doctor said something to his daughter that made her startit seemed to come from so far out of the past  i should like you to promise me something before i die  why do you talk about your dying she asked  because i am sixtyeight years old  i hope you will live a long time said catherine  i hope i shall  but some day i shall take a bad cold and then it will not matter much what any one hopes  that will be the manner of my exit and when it takes place remember i told you so  promise me not to marry morris townsend after i am gone  this was what made catherine start as i have said but her start was a silent one and for some moments she said nothing  why do you speak of him she asked at last  you challenge everything i say  i speak of him because hes a topic like any other  hes to be seen like any one else and he is still looking for a wifehaving had one and got rid of her i dont know by what means  he has lately been in new york and at your cousin marians house your aunt elizabeth saw him there  they neither of them told me said catherine  thats their merit its not yours  he has grown fat and bald and he has not made his fortune  but i cant trust those facts alone to steel your heart against him and thats why i ask you to promise  fat and bald  these words presented a strange image to catherines mind out of which the memory of the most beautiful young man in the world had never faded  i dont think you understand she said  i very seldom think of mr townsend  it will be very easy for you to go on then  promise me after my death to do the same  again for some moments catherine was silent her fathers request deeply amazed her it opened an old wound and made it ache afresh i dont think i can promise that she answered  it would be a great satisfaction said her father  you dont understand  i cant promise that  the doctor was silent a minute  i ask you for a particular reason i am altering my will  this reason failed to strike catherine and indeed she scarcely understood it  all her feelings were merged in the sense that he was trying to treat her as he had treated her years before  she had suffered from it then and now all her experience all her acquired tranquillity and rigidity protested  she had been so humble in her youth that she could now afford to have a little pride and there was something in this request and in her fathers thinking himself so free to make it that seemed an injury to her dignity  poor catherines dignity was not aggressive it never sat in state but if you pushed far enough you could find it  her father had pushed very far  i cant promise she simply repeated  you are very obstinate said the doctor  i dont think you understand  please explain then  i cant explain said catherine  and i cant promise  upon my word her father explained i had no idea how obstinate you are  she knew herself that she was obstinate and it gave her a certain joy  she was now a middleaged woman  about a year after this the accident that the doctor had spoken of occurred he took a violent cold  driving out to bloomingdale one april day to see a patient of unsound mind who was confined in a private asylum for the insane and whose family greatly desired a medical opinion from an eminent source he was caught in a spring shower and being in a buggy without a hood he found himself soaked to the skin  he came home with an ominous chill and on the morrow he was seriously ill  it is congestion of the lungs he said to catherine i shall need very good nursing  it will make no difference for i shall not recover but i wish everything to be done to the smallest detail as if i should  i hate an ill conducted sickroom and you will be so good as to nurse me on the hypothesis that i shall get well  he told her which of his fellow physicians to send for and gave her a multitude of minute directions it was quite on the optimistic hypothesis that she nursed him  but he had never been wrong in his life and he was not wrong now  he was touching his seventieth year and though he had a very welltempered constitution his hold upon life had lost its firmness he died after three weeks illness during which mrs penniman as well as his daughter had been assiduous at his bedside  on his will being opened after a decent interval it was found to consist of two portions  the first of these dated from ten years back and consisted of a series of dispositions by which he left the great mass of property to his daughter with becoming legacies to his two sisters  the second was a codicil of recent origin maintaining the annuities to mrs penniman and mrs almond but reducing catherines share to a fifth of what he had first bequeathed her she is amply provided for from her mothers side the document ran never having spent more than a fraction of her income from this source so that her fortune is already more than sufficient to attract those unscrupulous adventurers whom she has given me reason to believe that she persists in regarding as an interesting class the large remainder of his property therefore dr sloper had divided into seven unequal parts which he left as endowments to as many different hospitals and schools of medicine in various cities of the union  to mrs penniman it seemed monstrous that a man should play such tricks with other peoples money for after his death of course as she said it was other peoples  of course you will dispute the will she remarked fatuously to catherine  oh no catherine answered i like it very much  only i wish it had been expressed a little differently    chapter xxxiv    it was her habit to remain in town very late in the summer she preferred the house in washington square to any other habitation whatever and it was under protest that she used to go to the seaside for the month of august  at the sea she spent her month at an hotel the year that her father died she intermitted this custom altogether not thinking it consistent with deep mourning and the year after that she put off her departure till so late that the middle of august found her still in the heated solitude of washington square  mrs penniman who was fond of a change was usually eager for a visit to the country but this year she appeared quite content with such rural impressions as she could gather at the parlour window from the ailantustrees behind the wooden paling  the peculiar fragrance of this vegetation used to diffuse itself in the evening air and mrs penniman on the warm nights of july often sat at the open window and inhaled it  this was a happy moment for mrs penniman after the death of her brother she felt more free to obey her impulses  a vague oppression had disappeared from her life and she enjoyed a sense of freedom of which she had not been conscious since the memorable time so long ago when the doctor went abroad with catherine and left her at home to entertain morris townsend  the year that had elapsed since her brothers death reminded herof that happy time because although catherine in growing older had become a person to be reckoned with yet her society was a very different thing as mrs penniman said from that of a tank of cold water  the elder lady hardly knew what use to make of this larger margin of her life she sat and looked at it very much as she had often sat with her poised needle in her hand before her tapestry frame  she had a confident hope however that her rich impulses her talent for embroidery would still find their application and this confidence was justified before many months had elapsed  catherine continued to live in her fathers house in spite of its being represented to her that a maiden lady of quiet habits might find a more convenient abode in one of the smaller dwellings with brown stone fronts which had at this time begun to adorn the transverse thoroughfares in the upper part of the town  she liked the earlier structureit had begun by this time to be called an old houseand proposed to herself to end her days in it  if it was too large for a pair of unpretending gentlewomen this was better than the opposite fault for catherine had no desire to find herself in closer quarters with her aunt  she expected to spend the rest of her life in washington square and to enjoy mrs pennimans society for the whole of this period as she had a conviction that long as she might live her aunt would live at least as long and always retain her brilliancy and activity  mrs penniman suggested to her the idea of a rich vitality  on one of those warm evenings in july of which mention has been made the two ladies sat together at an open window looking out on the quiet square  it was too hot for lighted lamps for reading or for work it might have appeared too hot even for conversation mrs penniman having long been speechless  she sat forward in the window half on the balcony humming a little song  catherine was within the room in a low rockingchair dressed in white and slowly using a large palmetto fan  it was in this way at this season that the aunt and niece after they had had tea habitually spent their evenings  catherine said mrs penniman at last i am going to say something that will surprise you  pray do catherine answered i like surprises  and it is so quiet now  well then i have seen morris townsend  if catherine was surprised she checked the expression of it she gave neither a start nor an exclamation  she remained indeed for some moments intensely still and this may very well have been a symptom of emotion  i hope he was well she said at last  i dont know he is a great deal changed  he would like very much to see you  i would rather not see him said catherine quickly  i was afraid you would say that  but you dont seem surprised  i amvery much  i met him at marians said mrs penniman  he goes to marians and they are so afraid you will meet him there  its my belief that thats why he goes  he wants so much to see you  catherine made no response to this and mrs penniman went on  i didnt know him at first he is so remarkably changed  but he knew me in a minute  he says i am not in the least changed  you know how polite he always was  he was coming away when i came and we walked a little distance together  he is still very handsome only of course he looks older and he is not soso animated as he used to be  there was a touch of sadness about him but there was a touch of sadness about him beforeespecially when he went away  i am afraid he has not been very successfulthat he has never got thoroughly established i dont suppose he is sufficiently plodding and that after all is what succeeds in this world  mrs penniman had not mentioned morris townsends name to her niece for upwards of the fifth of a century but now that she had broken the spell she seemed to wish to make up for lost time as if there had been a sort of exhilaration in hearing herself talk of him  she proceeded however with considerable caution pausing occasionally to let catherine give some sign catherine gave no other sign than to stop the rocking of her chair and the swaying of her fan she sat motionless and silent  it was on tuesday last said mrs penniman and i have been hesitating ever since about telling you  i didnt know how you might like it at last i thought that it was so long ago that you would probably not have any particular feeling  i saw him again after meeting him at marians  i met him in the street and he went a few steps with me the first thing he said was about you he asked ever so many questions  marian didnt want me to speak to you she didnt want you to know that they receive him  i told him i was sure that after all these years you couldnt have any feeling about that you couldnt grudge him the hospitality of his own cousins house  i said you would be bitter indeed if you did that  marian has the most extraordinary ideas about what happened between you she seems to think he behaved in some very unusual manner  i took the liberty of reminding her of the real facts and placing the story in its true light  he has no bitterness catherine i can assure you and he might be excused for it for things have not gone well with him  he has been all over the world and tried to establish himself everywhere but his evil star was against him  it is most interesting to hear him talk of his evil star  everything failed everything but hisyou know you rememberhis proud high spirit i believe he married some lady somewhere in europe  you know they marry in such a peculiar matterofcourse way in europe a marriage of reason they call it  she died soon afterwards as he said to me she only flitted across his life  he has not been in new york for ten years he came back a few days ago  the first thing he did was to ask me about you  he had heard you had never married he seemed very much interested about that  he said you had been the real romance of his life  catherine had suffered her companion to proceed from point to point and pause to pause without interrupting her she fixed her eyes on the ground and listened  but the last phrase i have quoted was followed by a pause of peculiar significance and then at last catherine spoke  it will be observed that before doing so she had received a good deal of information about morris townsend  please say no more please dont follow up that subject  doesnt it interest you asked mrs penniman with a certain timorous archness  it pains me said catherine  i was afraid you would say that  but dont you think you could get used to it  he wants so much to see you  please dont aunt lavinia said catherine getting up from her seat  she moved quickly away and went to the other window which stood open to the balcony and here in the embrasure concealed from her aunt by the white curtains she remained a long time looking out into the warm darkness  she had had a great shock it was as if the gulf of the past had suddenly opened and a spectral figure had risen out of it  there were some things she believed she had got over some feelings that she had thought of as dead but apparently there was a certain vitality in them still  mrs penniman had made them stir themselves  it was but a momentary agitation catherine said to herself it would presently pass away  she was trembling and her heart was beating so that she could feel it but this also would subside  then suddenly while she waited for a return of her calmness she burst into tears  but her tears flowed very silently so that mrs penniman had no observation of them  it was perhaps however because mrs penniman suspected them that she said no more that evening about morris townsend    chapter xxxv    her refreshed attention to this gentleman had not those limits of which catherine desired for herself to be conscious it lasted long enough to enable her to wait another week before speaking of him again  it was under the same circumstances that she once more attacked the subject  she had been sitting with her niece in the evening only on this occasion as the night was not so warm the lamp had been lighted and catherine had placed herself near it with a morsel of fancywork  mrs penniman went and sat alone for half an hour on the balcony then she came in moving vaguely about the room at last she sank into a seat near catherine with clasped hands and a little look of excitement  shall you be angry if i speak to you again about him she asked  catherine looked up at her quietly  who is he  he whom you once loved  i shall not be angry but i shall not like it  he sent you a message said mrs penniman  i promised him to deliver it and i must keep my promise  in all these years catherine had had time to forget how little she had to thank her aunt for in the season of her misery she had long ago forgiven mrs penniman for taking too much upon herself  but for a moment this attitude of interposition and disinterestedness this carrying of messages and redeeming of promises brought back the sense that her companion was a dangerous woman  she had said she would not be angry but for an instant she felt sore  i dont care what you do with your promise she answered  mrs penniman however with her high conception of the sanctity of pledges carried her point  i have gone too far to retreat she said though precisely what this meant she was not at pains to explain  mr townsend wishes most particularly to see you catherine he believes that if you knew how much and why he wishes it you would consent to do so  there can be no reason said catherine no good reason  his happiness depends upon it  is not that a good reason asked mrs penniman impressively  not for me  my happiness does not  i think you will be happier after you have seen him  he is going away againgoing to resume his wanderings  it is a very lonely restless joyless life  before he goes he wishes to speak to you it is a fixed idea with himhe is always thinking of it  he has something very important to say to you  he believes that you never understood himthat you never judged him rightly and the belief has always weighed upon him terribly  he wishes to justify himself he believes that in a very few words he could do so  he wishes to meet you as a friend  catherine listened to this wonderful speech without pausing in her work she had now had several days to accustom herself to think of morris townsend again as an actuality  when it was over she said simply please say to mr townsend that i wish he would leave me alone  she had hardly spoken when a sharp firm ring at the door vibrated through the summer night  catherine looked up at the clock it marked a quarterpast ninea very late hour for visitors especially in the empty condition of the town  mrs penniman at the same moment gave a little start and then catherines eyes turned quickly to her aunt  they met mrs pennimans and sounded them for a moment sharply  mrs penniman was blushing her look was a conscious one it seemed to confess something  catherine guessed its meaning and rose quickly from her chair  aunt penniman she said in a tone that scared her companion have you taken the liberty      my dearest catherine stammered mrs penniman just wait till you see him  catherine had frightened her aunt but she was also frightened herself she was on the point of rushing to give orders to the servant who was passing to the door to admit no one but the fear of meeting her visitor checked her  mr morris townsend  this was what she heard vaguely but recognisably articulated by the domestic while she hesitated  she had her back turned to the door of the parlour and for some moments she kept it turned feeling that he had come in  he had not spoken however and at last she faced about  then she saw a gentleman standing in the middle of the room from which her aunt had discreetly retired  she would never have known him  he was fortyfive years old and his figure was not that of the straight slim young man she remembered but it was a very fine person and a fair and lustrous beard spreading itself upon a wellpresented chest contributed to its effect  after a moment catherine recognised the upper half of the face which though her visitors clustering locks had grown thin was still remarkably handsome  he stood in a deeply deferential attitude with his eyes on her face  i have venturedi have ventured he said and then he paused looking about him as if he expected her to ask him to sit down  it was the old voice but it had not the old charm  catherine for a minute was conscious of a distinct determination not to invite him to take a seat  why had he come  it was wrong for him to come  morris was embarrassed but catherine gave him no help  it was not that she was glad of his embarrassment on the contrary it excited all her own liabilities of this kind and gave her great pain  but how could she welcome him when she felt so vividly that he ought not to have come  i wanted so muchi was determined morris went on  but he stopped again it was not easy  catherine still said nothing and he may well have recalled with apprehension her ancient faculty of silence  she continued to look at him however and as she did so she made the strangest observation  it seemed to be he and yet not he it was the man who had been everything and yet this person was nothing how long ago it washow old she had grownhow much she had lived she had lived on something that was connected with him and she had consumed it in doing so  this person did not look unhappy  he was fair and wellpreserved perfectly dressed mature and complete  as catherine looked at him the story of his life defined itself in his eyes he had made himself comfortable and he had never been caught but even while her perception opened itself to this she had no desire to catch him his presence was painful to her and she only wished he would go  will you not sit down he asked  i think we had better not said catherine  i offend you by coming  he was very grave he spoke in a tone of the richest respect  i dont think you ought to have come  did not mrs penniman tell youdid she not give you my message  she told me something but i did not understand  i wish you would let me tell youlet me speak for myself  i dont think it is necessary said catherine  not for you perhaps but for me  it would be a great satisfaction and i have not many  he seemed to be coming nearer catherine turned away  can we not be friends again he said  we are not enemies said catherine  i have none but friendly feelings to you  ah i wonder whether you know the happiness it gives me to hear you say that  catherine uttered no intimation that she measured the influence of her words and he presently went on you have not changedthe years have passed happily for you  they have passed very quietly said catherine  they have left no marks you are admirably young  this time he succeeded in coming nearerhe was close to her she saw his glossy perfumed beard and his eyes above it looking strange and hard  it was very different from his oldfrom his youngface  if she had first seen him this way she would not have liked him  it seemed to her that he was smiling or trying to smile  catherine he said lowering his voice i have never ceased to think of you  please dont say those things she answered  do you hate me  oh no said catherine  something in her tone discouraged him but in a moment he recovered himself  have you still some kindness for me then  i dont know why you have come here to ask me such things catherine exclaimed  because for many years it has been the desire of my life that we should be friends again  that is impossible  why so  not if you will allow it  i will not allow it said catherine  he looked at her again in silence  i see my presence troubles you and pains you  i will go away but you must give me leave to come again  please dont come again she said  nevernever  she made a great effort she wished to say something that would make it impossible he should ever again cross her threshold  it is wrong of you  there is no propriety in itno reason for it  ah dearest lady you do me injustice cried morris townsend  we have only waited and now we are free  you treated me badly said catherine  not if you think of it rightly  you had your quiet life with your fatherwhich was just what i could not make up my mind to rob you of  yes i had that  morris felt it to be a considerable damage to his cause that he could not add that she had had something more besides for it is needless to say that he had learnt the contents of dr slopers will  he was nevertheless not at a loss  there are worse fates than that he exclaimed with expression and he might have been supposed to refer to his own unprotected situation  then he added with a deeper tenderness catherine have you never forgiven me  i forgave you years ago but it is useless for us to attempt to be friends  not if we forget the past  we have still a future thank god  i cant forgeti dont forget said catherine  you treated me too badly  i felt it very much i felt it for years  and then she went on with her wish to show him that he must not come to her this way i cant begin againi cant take it up  everything is dead and buried  it was too serious it made a great change in my life i never expected to see you here  ah you are angry cried morris who wished immensely that he could extort some flash of passion from her mildness  in that case he might hope  no i am not angry  anger does not last that way for years  but there are other things  impressions last when they have been strong  but i cant talk  morris stood stroking his beard with a clouded eye  why have you never married he asked abruptly  you have had opportunities  i didnt wish to marry  yes you are rich you are free you had nothing to gain  i had nothing to gain said catherine  morris looked vaguely round him and gave a deep sigh  well i was in hopes that we might still have been friends  i meant to tell you by my aunt in answer to your messageif you had waited for an answerthat it was unnecessary for you to come in that hope  goodbye then said morris  excuse my indiscretion  he bowed and she turned awaystanding there averted with her eyes on the ground for some moments after she had heard him close the door of the room  in the hall he found mrs penniman fluttered and eager she appeared to have been hovering there under the irreconcilable promptings of her curiosity and her dignity  that was a precious plan of yours said morris clapping on his hat  is she so hard asked mrs penniman  she doesnt care a button for mewith her confounded little dry manner  was it very dry pursued mrs penniman with solicitude  morris took no notice of her question he stood musing an instant with his hat on  but why the deuce then would she never marry  yeswhy indeed sighed mrs penniman  and then as if from a sense of the inadequacy of this explanation but you will not despairyou will come back  come back  damnation  and morris townsend strode out of the house leaving mrs penniman staring  catherine meanwhile in the parlour picking up her morsel of fancy work had seated herself with it againfor life as it were
