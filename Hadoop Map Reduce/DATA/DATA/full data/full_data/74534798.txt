arabian nights     to  robert alan mowbray stevenson  in grateful remembrance of their youth and their already old affection     new arabian nights     the suicide club   story of the young man with the cream tarts  during his residence in london the accomplished prince florizel of bohemia gained the affection of all classes by the seduction of his manner and by a wellconsidered generosity he was a remarkable man even by what was known of him and that was but a small part of what he actually did although of a placid temper in ordinary circumstances and accustomed to take the world with as much philosophy as any ploughman the prince of bohemia was not without a taste for ways of life more adventurous and eccentric than that to which he was destined by his birth now and then when he fell into a low humour when there was no laughable play to witness in any of the london theatres and when the season of the year was unsuitable to those field sports in which he excelled all competitors he would summon his confidant and master of the horse colonel geraldine and bid him prepare himself against an evening ramble the master of the horse was a young officer of a brave and even temerarious disposition he greeted the news with delight and hastened to make ready long practice and a varied acquaintance of life had given him a singular facility in disguise he could adapt not only his face and bearing but his voice and almost his thoughts to those of any rank character or nation and in this way he diverted attention from the prince and sometimes gained admission for the pair into strange societies the civil authorities were never taken into the secret of these adventures the imperturbable courage of the one and the ready invention and chivalrous devotion of the other had brought them through a score of dangerous passes and they grew in confidence as time went on  one evening in march they were driven by a sharp fall of sleet into an oyster bar in the immediate neighbourhood of leicester square colonel geraldine was dressed and painted to represent a person connected with the press in reduced circumstances while the prince had as usual travestied his appearance by the addition of false whiskers and a pair of large adhesive eyebrows these lent him a shaggy and weatherbeaten air which for one of his urbanity formed the most impenetrable disguise thus equipped the commander and his satellite sipped their brandy and soda in security  the bar was full of guests male and female but though more than one of these offered to fall into talk with our adventurers none of them promised to grow interesting upon a nearer acquaintance there was nothing present but the lees of london and the commonplace of disrespectability and the prince had already fallen to yawning and was beginning to grow weary of the whole excursion when the swing doors were pushed violently open and a young man followed by a couple of commissionaires entered the bar each of the commissionaires carried a large dish of cream tarts under a cover which they at once removed and the young man made the round of the company and pressed these confections upon every ones acceptance with an exaggerated courtesy sometimes the offer was laughingly accepted sometimes it was firmly or even harshly rejected in these latter cases the newcomer always ate the tart himself with some more or less humorous commentary  at last he accosted prince florizel  sir said he with a profound obeisance proffering the tart at the same time between his thumb and forefinger will you so far honour an entire stranger i can answer for the quality of the pastry having eaten two dozen and three of them myself since five oclock  i am in the habit replied the prince of looking not so much to the nature of a gift as to the spirit in which it is offered  the spirit sir returned the young man with another bow is one of mockery  mockery repeated florizel and whom do you propose to mock  i am not here to expound my philosophy replied the other but to distribute these cream tarts if i mention that i heartily include myself in the ridicule of the transaction i hope you will consider honour satisfied and condescend if not you will constrain me to eat my twentyeighth and i own to being weary of the exercise  you touch me said the prince and i have all the will in the world to rescue you from this dilemma but upon one condition if my friend and i eat your cakesfor which we have neither of us any natural inclinationwe shall expect you to join us at supper by way of recompense  the young man seemed to reflect  i have still several dozen upon hand he said at last and that will make it necessary for me to visit several more bars before my great affair is concluded this will take some time and if you are hungry  the prince interrupted him with a polite gesture  my friend and i will accompany you he said for we have already a deep interest in your very agreeable mode of passing an evening and now that the preliminaries of peace are settled allow me to sign the treaty for both  and the prince swallowed the tart with the best grace imaginable  it is delicious said he  i perceive you are a connoisseur replied the young man  colonel geraldine likewise did honour to the pastry and every one in that bar having now either accepted or refused his delicacies the young man with the cream tarts led the way to another and similar establishment the two commissionaires who seemed to have grown accustomed to their absurd employment followed immediately after and the prince and the colonel brought up the rear arminarm and smiling to each other as they went in this order the company visited two other taverns where scenes were enacted of a like nature to that already describedsome refusing some accepting the favours of this vagabond hospitality and the young man himself eating each rejected tart  on leaving the third saloon the young man counted his store there were but nine remaining three in one tray and six in the other  gentlemen said he addressing himself to his two new followers i am unwilling to delay your supper i am positively sure you must be hungry i feel that i owe you a special consideration and on this great day for me when i am closing a career of folly by my most conspicuously silly action i wish to behave handsomely to all who give me countenance gentlemen you shall wait no longer although my constitution is shattered by previous excesses at the risk of my life i liquidate the suspensory condition  with these words he crushed the nine remaining tarts into his mouth and swallowed them at a single movement each then turning to the commissionaires he gave them a couple of sovereigns  i have to thank you said he for your extraordinary patience  and he dismissed them with a bow apiece for some seconds he stood looking at the purse from which he had just paid his assistants then with a laugh he tossed it into the middle of the street and signified his readiness for supper  in a small french restaurant in soho which had enjoyed an exaggerated reputation for some little while but had already begun to be forgotten and in a private room up two pair of stairs the three companions made a very elegant supper and drank three or four bottles of champagne talking the while upon indifferent subjects the young man was fluent and gay but he laughed louder than was natural in a person of polite breeding his hands trembled violently and his voice took sudden and surprising inflections which seemed to be independent of his will the dessert had been cleared away and all three had lighted their cigars when the prince addressed him in these words  you will i am sure pardon my curiosity what i have seen of you has greatly pleased but even more puzzled me and though i should be loth to seem indiscreet i must tell you that my friend and i are persons very well worthy to be entrusted with a secret we have many of our own which we are continually revealing to improper ears and if as i suppose your story is a silly one you need have no delicacy with us who are two of the silliest men in england my name is godall theophilus godall my friend is major alfred hammersmithor at least such is the name by which he chooses to be known we pass our lives entirely in the search for extravagant adventures and there is no extravagance with which we are not capable of sympathy  i like you mr godall returned the young man you inspire me with a natural confidence and i have not the slightest objection to your friend the major whom i take to be a nobleman in masquerade at least i am sure he is no soldier  the colonel smiled at this compliment to the perfection of his art and the young man went on in a more animated manner  there is every reason why i should not tell you my story perhaps that is just the reason why i am going to do so at least you seem so well prepared to hear a tale of silliness that i cannot find it in my heart to disappoint you my name in spite of your example i shall keep to myself my age is not essential to the narrative i am descended from my ancestors by ordinary generation and from them i inherited the very eligible human tenement which i still occupy and a fortune of three hundred pounds a year i suppose they also handed on to me a harebrain humour which it has been my chief delight to indulge i received a good education i can play the violin nearly well enough to earn money in the orchestra of a penny gaff but not quite the same remark applies to the flute and the french horn i learned enough of whist to lose about a hundred a year at that scientific game my acquaintance with french was sufficient to enable me to squander money in paris with almost the same facility as in london in short i am a person full of manly accomplishments i have had every sort of adventure including a duel about nothing only two months ago i met a young lady exactly suited to my taste in mind and body i found my heart melt i saw that i had come upon my fate at last and was in the way to fall in love but when i came to reckon up what remained to me of my capital i found it amounted to something less than four hundred pounds i ask you fairlycan a man who respects himself fall in love on four hundred pounds i concluded certainly not left the presence of my charmer and slightly accelerating my usual rate of expenditure came this morning to my last eighty pounds this i divided into two equal parts forty i reserved for a particular purpose the remaining forty i was to dissipate before the night i have passed a very entertaining day and played many farces besides that of the cream tarts which procured me the advantage of your acquaintance for i was determined as i told you to bring a foolish career to a still more foolish conclusion and when you saw me throw my purse into the street the forty pounds were at an end now you know me as well as i know myself a fool but consistent in his folly and as i will ask you to believe neither a whimperer nor a coward  from the whole tone of the young mans statement it was plain that he harboured very bitter and contemptuous thoughts about himself his auditors were led to imagine that his love affair was nearer his heart than he admitted and that he had a design on his own life the farce of the cream tarts began to have very much the air of a tragedy in disguise  why is this not odd broke out geraldine giving a look to prince florizel that we three fellows should have met by the merest accident in so large a wilderness as london and should be so nearly in the same condition  how cried the young man are you too ruined is this supper a folly like my cream tarts has the devil brought three of his own together for a last carouse  the devil depend upon it can sometimes do a very gentlemanly thing returned prince florizel and i am so much touched by this coincidence that although we are not entirely in the same case i am going to put an end to the disparity let your heroic treatment of the last cream tarts be my example  so saying the prince drew out his purse and took from it a small bundle of banknotes  you see i was a week or so behind you but i mean to catch you up and come neckandneck into the winningpost he continued this laying one of the notes upon the table will suffice for the bill as for the rest  he tossed them into the fire and they went up the chimney in a single blaze  the young man tried to catch his arm but as the table was between them his interference came too late  unhappy man he cried you should not have burned them all you should have kept forty pounds  forty pounds repeated the prince why in heavens name forty pounds  why not eighty cried the colonel for to my certain knowledge there must have been a hundred in the bundle  it was only forty pounds he needed said the young man gloomily but without them there is no admission the rule is strict forty pounds for each accursed life where a man cannot even die without money  the prince and the colonel exchanged glances  explain yourself said the latter i have still a pocketbook tolerably well lined and i need not say how readily i should share my wealth with godall but i must know to what end you must certainly tell us what you mean  the young man seemed to awaken he looked uneasily from one to the other and his face flushed deeply  you are not fooling me he asked you are indeed ruined men like me  indeed i am for my part replied the colonel  and for mine said the prince i have given you proof who but a ruined man would throw his notes into the fire the action speaks for itself  a ruined manyes returned the other suspiciously or else a millionaire  enough sir said the prince i have said so and i am not accustomed to have my word remain in doubt  ruined said the young man are you ruined like me are you after a life of indulgence come to such a pass that you can only indulge yourself in one thing more are youhe kept lowering his voice as he went onare you going to give yourselves that last indulgence are you going to avoid the consequences of your folly by the one infallible and easy path are you going to give the slip to the sheriffs officers of conscience by the one open door  suddenly he broke off and attempted to laugh  here is your health he cried emptying his glass and goodnight to you my merry ruined men  colonel geraldine caught him by the arm as he was about to rise  you lack confidence in us he said and you are wrong to all your questions i make answer in the affirmative but i am not so timid and can speak the queens english plainly we too like yourself have had enough of life and are determined to die sooner or later alone or together we meant to seek out death and beard him where he lies ready since we have met you and your case is more pressing let it be tonightand at onceand if you will all three together such a penniless trio he cried should go arminarm into the halls of pluto and give each other some countenance among the shades  geraldine had hit exactly on the manners and intonations that became the part he was playing the prince himself was disturbed and looked over at his confidant with a shade of doubt as for the young man the flush came back darkly into his cheek and his eyes threw out a spark of light  you are the men for me he cried with an almost terrible gaiety shake hands upon the bargain his hand was cold and wet you little know in what a company you will begin the march you little know in what a happy moment for yourselves you partook of my cream tarts i am only a unit but i am a unit in an army i know deaths private door i am one of his familiars and can show you into eternity without ceremony and yet without scandal  they called upon him eagerly to explain his meaning  can you muster eighty pounds between you he demanded  geraldine ostentatiously consulted his pocketbook and replied in the affirmative  fortunate beings cried the young man forty pounds is the entrymoney of the suicide club  the suicide club said the prince why what the devil is that  listen said the young man this is the age of conveniences and i have to tell you of the last perfection of the sort we have affairs in different places and hence railways were invented railways separated us infallibly from our friends and so telegraphs were made that we might communicate speedily at great distances even in hotels we have lifts to spare us a climb of some hundred steps now we know that life is only a stage to play the fool upon as long as the part amuses us there was one more convenience lacking to modern comfort a decent easy way to quit that stage the back stairs to liberty or as i said this moment deaths private door this my two fellowrebels is supplied by the suicide club do not suppose that you and i are alone or even exceptional in the highly reasonable desire that we profess a large number of our fellowmen who have grown heartily sick of the performance in which they are expected to join daily and all their lives long are only kept from flight by one or two considerations some have families who would be shocked or even blamed if the matter became public others have a weakness at heart and recoil from the circumstances of death that is to some extent my own experience i cannot put a pistol to my head and draw the trigger for something stronger than myself withholds the act and although i loathe life i have not strength enough in my body to take hold of death and be done with it for such as i and for all who desire to be out of the coil without posthumous scandal the suicide club has been inaugurated how this has been managed what is its history or what may be its ramifications in other lands i am myself uninformed and what i know of its constitution i am not at liberty to communicate to you to this extent however i am at your service if you are truly tired of life i will introduce you tonight to a meeting and if not tonight at least some time within the week you will be easily relieved of your existences it is now consulting his watch eleven by halfpast at latest we must leave this place so that you have half an hour before you to consider my proposal it is more serious than a cream tart he added with a smile and i suspect more palatable  more serious certainly returned colonel geraldine and as it is so much more so will you allow me five minutes speech in private with my friend mr godall  it is only fair answered the young man if you will permit i will retire  you will be very obliging said the colonel  as soon as the two were alonewhat said prince florizel is the use of this confabulation geraldine i see you are flurried whereas my mind is very tranquilly made up i will see the end of this  your highness said the colonel turning pale let me ask you to consider the importance of your life not only to your friends but to the public interest if not tonight said this madman but supposing that tonight some irreparable disaster were to overtake your highnesss person what let me ask you what would be my despair and what the concern and disaster of a great nation  i will see the end of this repeated the prince in his most deliberate tones and have the kindness colonel geraldine to remember and respect your word of honour as a gentleman under no circumstances recollect nor without my special authority are you to betray the incognito under which i choose to go abroad these were my commands which i now reiterate and now he added let me ask you to call for the bill  colonel geraldine bowed in submission but he had a very white face as he summoned the young man of the cream tarts and issued his directions to the waiter the prince preserved his undisturbed demeanour and described a palaisroyal farce to the young suicide with great humour and gusto he avoided the colonels appealing looks without ostentation and selected another cheroot with more than usual care indeed he was now the only man of the party who kept any command over his nerves  the bill was discharged the prince giving the whole change of the note to the astonished waiter and the three drove off in a fourwheeler they were not long upon the way before the cab stopped at the entrance to a rather dark court here all descended  after geraldine had paid the fare the young man turned and addressed prince florizel as follows  it is still time mr godall to make good your escape into thraldom and for you too major hammersmith reflect well before you take another step and if your hearts say nohere are the crossroads  lead on sir said the prince i am not the man to go back from a thing once said  your coolness does me good replied their guide i have never seen any one so unmoved at this conjuncture and yet you are not the first whom i have escorted to this door more than one of my friends has preceded me where i knew i must shortly follow but this is of no interest to you wait me here for only a few moments i shall return as soon as i have arranged the preliminaries of your introduction  and with that the young man waving his hand to his companions turned into the court entered a doorway and disappeared  of all our follies said colonel geraldine in a low voice this is the wildest and most dangerous  i perfectly believe so returned the prince  we have still pursued the colonel a moment to ourselves let me beseech your highness to profit by the opportunity and retire the consequences of this step are so dark and may be so grave that i feel myself justified in pushing a little further than usual the liberty which your highness is so condescending as to allow me in private  am i to understand that colonel geraldine is afraid asked his highness taking his cheroot from his lips and looking keenly into the others face  my fear is certainly not personal replied the other proudly of that your highness may rest well assured  i had supposed as much returned the prince with undisturbed goodhumour but i was unwilling to remind you of the difference in our stations no moreno more he added seeing geraldine about to apologise you stand excused  and he smoked placidly leaning against a railing until the young man returned  well he asked has our reception been arranged  follow me was the reply the president will see you in the cabinet and let me warn you to be frank in your answers i have stood your guarantee but the club requires a searching inquiry before admission for the indiscretion of a single member would lead to the dispersion of the whole society for ever  the prince and geraldine put their heads together for a moment bear me out in this said the one and bear me out in that said the other and by boldly taking up the characters of men with whom both were acquainted they had come to an agreement in a twinkling and were ready to follow their guide into the presidents cabinet  there were no formidable obstacles to pass the outer door stood open the door of the cabinet was ajar and there in a small but very high apartment the young man left them once more  he will be here immediately he said with a nod as he disappeared  voices were audible in the cabinet through the foldingdoors which formed one end and now and then the noise of a champagne cork followed by a burst of laughter intervened among the sounds of conversation a single tall window looked out upon the river and the embankment and by the disposition of the lights they judged themselves not far from charing cross station the furniture was scanty and the coverings worn to the thread and there was nothing movable except a handbell in the centre of a round table and the hats and coats of a considerable party hung round the wall on pegs  what sort of a den is this said geraldine  that is what i have come to see replied the prince if they keep live devils on the premises the thing may grow amusing  just then the foldingdoor was opened no more than was necessary for the passage of a human body and there entered at the same moment a louder buzz of talk and the redoubtable president of the suicide club the president was a man of fifty or upwards large and rambling in his gait with shaggy side whiskers a bald top to his head and a veiled grey eye which now and then emitted a twinkle his mouth which embraced a large cigar he kept continually screwing round and round and from side to side as he looked sagaciously and coldly at the strangers he was dressed in light tweeds with his neck very open in a striped shirt collar and carried a minutebook under one arm  goodevening said he after he had closed the door behind him i am told you wish to speak with me  we have a desire sir to join the suicide club replied the colonel  the president rolled his cigar about in his mouth  what is that he said abruptly  pardon me returned the colonel but i believe you are the person best qualified to give us information on that point  i cried the president a suicide club come come this is a frolic for all fools day i can make allowances for gentlemen who get merry in their liquor but let there be an end to this  call your club what you will said the colonel you have some company behind these doors and we insist on joining it  sir returned the president curtly you have made a mistake this is a private house and you must leave it instantly  the prince had remained quietly in his seat throughout this little colloquy but now when the colonel looked over to him as much as to say take your answer and come away for gods sake he drew his cheroot from his mouth and spoke  i have come here said he upon the invitation of a friend of yours he has doubtless informed you of my intention in thus intruding on your party let me remind you that a person in my circumstances has exceedingly little to bind him and is not at all likely to tolerate much rudeness i am a very quiet man as a usual thing but my dear sir you are either going to oblige me in the little matter of which you are aware or you shall very bitterly repent that you ever admitted me to your antechamber  the president laughed aloud  that is the way to speak said he you are a man who is a man you know the way to my heart and can do what you like with me will you he continued addressing geraldine will you step aside for a few minutes i shall finish first with your companion and some of the clubs formalities require to be fulfilled in private  with the words he opened the door of a small closet into which he shut the colonel  i believe in you he said to florizel as soon as they were alone but are you sure of your friend  not so sure as i am of myself though he has more cogent reasons answered florizel but sure enough to bring him here without alarm he has had enough to cure the most tenacious man of life he was cashiered the other day for cheating at cards  a good reason i daresay replied the president at least we have another in the same case and i feel sure of him have you also been in the service may i ask  i have was the reply but i was too lazyi left it early  what is your reason for being tired of life pursued the president  the same as near as i can make out answered the prince unadulterated laziness  the president started dn it said he you must have something better than that  i have no more money added florizel that is also a vexation without doubt it brings my sense of idleness to an acute point  the president rolled his cigar round in his mouth for some seconds directing his gaze straight into the eyes of this unusual neophyte but the prince supported his scrutiny with unabashed good temper  if i had not a deal of experience said the president at last i should turn you off but i know the world and this much any way that the most frivolous excuses for a suicide are often the toughest to stand by and when i downright like a man as i do you sir i would rather strain the regulation than deny him  the prince and the colonel one after the other were subjected to a long and particular interrogatory the prince alone but geraldine in the presence of the prince so that the president might observe the countenance of the one while the other was being warmly crossexamined the result was satisfactory and the president after having booked a few details of each case produced a form of oath to be accepted nothing could be conceived more passive than the obedience promised or more stringent than the terms by which the juror bound himself the man who forfeited a pledge so awful could scarcely have a rag of honour or any of the consolations of religion left to him florizel signed the document but not without a shudder the colonel followed his example with an air of great depression then the president received the entry money and without more ado introduced the two friends into the smokingroom of the suicide club  the smokingroom of the suicide club was the same height as the cabinet into which it opened but much larger and papered from top to bottom with an imitation of oak wainscot a large and cheerful fire and a number of gasjets illuminated the company the prince and his follower made the number up to eighteen most of the party were smoking and drinking champagne a feverish hilarity reigned with sudden and rather ghastly pauses  is this a full meeting asked the prince  middling said the presidentby the way he added if you have any money it is usual to offer some champagne it keeps up a good spirit and is one of my own little perquisites  hammersmith said florizel i may leave the champagne to you  and with that he turned away and began to go round among the guests accustomed to play the host in the highest circles he charmed and dominated all whom he approached there was something at once winning and authoritative in his address and his extraordinary coolness gave him yet another distinction in this halfmaniacal society as he went from one to another he kept both his eyes and ears open and soon began to gain a general idea of the people among whom he found himself as in all other places of resort one type predominated people in the prime of youth with every show of intelligence and sensibility in their appearance but with little promise of strength or the quality that makes success few were much above thirty and not a few were still in their teens they stood leaning on tables and shifting on their feet sometimes they smoked extraordinarily fast and sometimes they let their cigars go out some talked well but the conversation of others was plainly the result of nervous tension and was equally without wit or purport as each new bottle of champagne was opened there was a manifest improvement in gaiety only two were seatedone in a chair in the recess of the window with his head hanging and his hands plunged deep into his trousers pockets pale visibly moist with perspiration saying never a word a very wreck of soul and body the other sat on the divan close by the chimney and attracted notice by a trenchant dissimilarity from all the rest he was probably upwards of forty but he looked fully ten years older and florizel thought he had never seen a man more naturally hideous nor one more ravaged by disease and ruinous excitements he was no more than skin and bone was partly paralysed and wore spectacles of such unusual power that his eyes appeared through the glasses greatly magnified and distorted in shape except the prince and the president he was the only person in the room who preserved the composure of ordinary life  there was little decency among the members of the club some boasted of the disgraceful actions the consequences of which had reduced them to seek refuge in death and the others listened without disapproval there was a tacit understanding against moral judgments and whoever passed the club doors enjoyed already some of the immunities of the tomb they drank to each others memories and to those of notable suicides in the past they compared and developed their different views of deathsome declaring that it was no more than blackness and cessation others full of a hope that that very night they should be scaling the stars and commercing with the mighty dead  to the eternal memory of baron trenck the type of suicides cried one he went out of a small cell into a smaller that he might come forth again to freedom  for my part said a second i wish no more than a bandage for my eyes and cotton for my ears only they have no cotton thick enough in this world  a third was for reading the mysteries of life in a future state and a fourth professed that he would never have joined the club if he had not been induced to believe in mr darwin  i could not bear said this remarkable suicide to be descended from an ape  altogether the prince was disappointed by the bearing and conversation of the members  it does not seem to me he thought a matter of so much disturbance if a man has made up his mind to kill himself let him do it in gods name like a gentleman this flutter and big talk is out of place  in the meanwhile colonel geraldine was a prey to the blackest apprehensions the club and its rules were still a mystery and he looked round the room for some one who should be able to set his mind at rest in this survey his eye lighted on the paralytic person with the strong spectacles and seeing him so exceedingly tranquil he besought the president who was going in and out of the room under a pressure of business to present him to the gentleman on the divan  the functionary explained the needlessness of all such formalities within the club but nevertheless presented mr hammersmith to mr malthus  mr malthus looked at the colonel curiously and then requested him to take a seat upon his right  you are a newcomer he said and wish information you have come to the proper source it is two years since i first visited this charming club  the colonel breathed again if mr malthus had frequented the place for two years there could be little danger for the prince in a single evening but geraldine was none the less astonished and began to suspect a mystification  what cried he two years i thoughtbut indeed i see i have been made the subject of a pleasantry  by no means replied mr malthus mildly my case is peculiar i am not properly speaking a suicide at all but as it were an honorary member i rarely visit the club twice in two months my infirmity and the kindness of the president have procured me these little immunities for which besides i pay at an advanced rate even as it is my luck has been extraordinary  i am afraid said the colonel that i must ask you to be more explicit you must remember that i am still most imperfectly acquainted with the rules of the club  an ordinary member who comes here in search of death like yourself replied the paralytic returns every evening until fortune favours him he can even if he is penniless get board and lodging from the president very fair i believe and clean although of course not luxurious that could hardly be considering the exiguity if i may so express myself of the subscription and then the presidents company is a delicacy in itself  indeed cried geraldine he had not greatly prepossessed me  ah said mr malthus you do not know the man the drollest fellow what stories what cynicism he knows life to admiration and between ourselves is probably the most corrupt rogue in christendom  and he also asked the colonel is a permanencylike yourself if i may say so without offence  indeed he is a permanency in a very different sense from me replied mr malthus i have been graciously spared but i must go at last now he never plays he shuffles and deals for the club and makes the necessary arrangements that man my dear mr hammersmith is the very soul of ingenuity for three years he has pursued in london his useful and i think i may add his artistic calling and not so much as a whisper of suspicion has been once aroused i believe himself to be inspired you doubtless remember the celebrated case six months ago of the gentleman who was accidentally poisoned in a chemists shop that was one of the least rich one of the least racy of his notions but then how simple and how safe  you astound me said the colonel was that unfortunate gentleman one of the he was about to say victims but bethinking himself in time he substitutedmembers of the club  in the same flash of thought it occurred to him that mr malthus himself had not at all spoken in the tone of one who is in love with death and he added hurriedly  but i perceive i am still in the dark you speak of shuffling and dealing pray for what end and since you seem rather unwilling to die than otherwise i must own that i cannot conceive what brings you here at all  you say truly that you are in the dark replied mr malthus with more animation why my dear sir this club is the temple of intoxication if my enfeebled health could support the excitement more often you may depend upon it i should be more often here it requires all the sense of duty engendered by a long habit of illhealth and careful regimen to keep me from excess in this which is i may say my last dissipation i have tried them all sir he went on laying his hand on geraldines arm all without exception and i declare to you upon my honour there is not one of them that has not been grossly and untruthfully overrated people trifle with love now i deny that love is a strong passion fear is the strong passion it is with fear that you must trifle if you wish to taste the intensest joys of living envy meenvy me sir he added with a chuckle i am a coward  geraldine could scarcely repress a movement of repulsion for this deplorable wretch but he commanded himself with an effort and continued his inquiries  how sir he asked is the excitement so artfully prolonged and where is there any element of uncertainty  i must tell you how the victim for every evening is selected returned mr malthus and not only the victim but another member who is to be the instrument in the clubs hands and deaths high priest for that occasion  good god said the colonel do they then kill each other  the trouble of suicide is removed in that way returned malthus with a nod  merciful heavens ejaculated the colonel and may youmay imay themy friend i meanmay any of us be pitched upon this evening as the slayer of another mans body and immortal spirit can such things be possible among men born of women oh infamy of infamies  he was about to rise in his horror when he caught the princes eye it was fixed upon him from across the room with a frowning and angry stare and in a moment geraldine recovered his composure  after all he added why not and since you say the game is interesting vogue la gal√®rei follow the club  mr malthus had keenly enjoyed the colonels amazement and disgust he had the vanity of wickedness and it pleased him to see another man give way to a generous movement while he felt himself in his entire corruption superior to such emotions  you now after your first moment of surprise said he are in a position to appreciate the delights of our society you can see how it combines the excitement of a gamingtable a duel and a roman amphitheatre the pagans did well enough i cordially admire the refinement of their minds but it has been reserved for a christian country to attain this extreme this quintessence this absolute of poignancy you will understand how vapid are all amusements to a man who has acquired a taste for this one the game we play he continued is one of extreme simplicity a full packbut i perceive you are about to see the thing in progress will you lend me the help of your arm i am unfortunately paralysed  indeed just as mr malthus was beginning his description another pair of foldingdoors was thrown open and the whole club began to pass not without some hurry into the adjoining room it was similar in every respect to the one from which it was entered but somewhat differently furnished the centre was occupied by a long green table at which the president sat shuffling a pack of cards with great particularity even with the stick and the colonels arm mr malthus walked with so much difficulty that everyone was seated before this pair and the prince who had waited for them entered the apartment and in consequence the three took seats close together at the lower end of the board  it is a pack of fiftytwo whispered mr malthus watch for the ace of spades which is the sign of death and the ace of clubs which designates the official of the night happy happy young men he added you have good eyes and can follow the game alas i cannot tell an ace from a deuce across the table  and he proceeded to equip himself with a second pair of spectacles  i must at least watch the faces he explained  the colonel rapidly informed his friend of all that he had learned from the honorary member and of the horrible alternative that lay before them the prince was conscious of a deadly chill and a contraction about his heart he swallowed with difficulty and looked from side to side like a man in a maze  one bold stroke whispered the colonel and we may still escape  but the suggestion recalled the princes spirits  silence said he let me see that you can play like a gentleman for any stake however serious  and he looked about him once more to all appearance at his ease although his heart beat thickly and he was conscious of an unpleasant heat in his bosom the members were all very quiet and intent every one was pale but none so pale as mr malthus his eyes protruded his head kept nodding involuntarily upon his spine his hands found their way one after the other to his mouth where they made clutches at his tremulous and ashen lips it was plain that the honorary member enjoyed his membership on very startling terms  attention gentlemen said the president  and he began slowly dealing the cards about the table in the reverse direction pausing until each man had shown his card nearly every one hesitated and sometimes you would see a players fingers stumble more than once before he could turn over the momentous slip of pasteboard as the princes turn drew nearer he was conscious of a growing and almost suffocating excitement but he had somewhat of the gamblers nature and recognised almost with astonishment that there was a degree of pleasure in his sensations the nine of clubs fell to his lot the three of spades was dealt to geraldine and the queen of hearts to mr malthus who was unable to suppress a sob of relief the young man of the cream tarts almost immediately afterwards turned over the ace of clubs and remained frozen with horror the card still resting on his finger he had not come there to kill but to be killed and the prince in his generous sympathy with his position almost forgot the peril that still hung over himself and his friend  the deal was coming round again and still deaths card had not come out the players held their respiration and only breathed by gasps the prince received another club geraldine had a diamond but when mr malthus turned up his card a horrible noise like that of something breaking issued from his mouth and he rose from his seat and sat down again with no sign of his paralysis it was the ace of spades the honorary member had trifled once too often with his terrors  conversation broke out again almost at once the players relaxed their rigid attitudes and began to rise from the table and stroll back by twos and threes into the smokingroom the president stretched his arms and yawned like a man who has finished his days work but mr malthus sat in his place with his head in his hands and his hands upon the table drunk and motionlessa thing stricken down  the prince and geraldine made their escape at once in the cold night air their horror of what they had witnessed was redoubled  alas cried the prince to be bound by an oath in such a matter to allow this wholesale trade in murder to be continued with profit and impunity if i but dared to forfeit my pledge  that is impossible for your highness replied the colonel whose honour is the honour of bohemia but i dare and may with propriety forfeit mine  geraldine said the prince if your honour suffers in any of the adventures into which you follow me not only will i never pardon you butwhat i believe will much more sensibly affect youi should never forgive myself  i receive your highnesss commands replied the colonel shall we go from this accursed spot  yes said the prince call a cab in heavens name and let me try to forget in slumber the memory of this nights disgrace  but it was notable that he carefully read the name of the court before he left it  the next morning as soon as the prince was stirring colonel geraldine brought him a daily newspaper with the following paragraph marked    melancholy accidentthis morning about two oclock mr   bartholomew malthus of 16 chepstow place westbourne grove on his   way home from a party at a friends house fell over the upper   parapet in trafalgar square fracturing his skull and breaking a leg   and an arm death was instantaneous mr malthus accompanied by a   friend was engaged in looking for a cab at the time of the   unfortunate occurrence as mr malthus was paralytic it is thought   that his fall may have been occasioned by another seizure the   unhappy gentleman was well known in the most respectable circles and   his loss will be widely and deeply deplored  if ever a soul went straight to hell said geraldine solemnly it was that paralytic mans  the prince buried his face in his hands and remained silent  i am almost rejoiced continued the colonel to know that he is dead but for our young man of the cream tarts i confess my heart bleeds  geraldine said the prince raising his face that unhappy lad was last night as innocent as you and i and this morning the guilt of blood is on his soul when i think of the president my heart grows sick within me i do not know how it shall be done but i shall have that scoundrel at my mercy as there is a god in heaven what an experience what a lesson was that game of cards  one said the colonel never to be repeated  the prince remained so long without replying that geraldine grew alarmed  you cannot mean to return he said you have suffered too much and seen too much horror already the duties of your high position forbid the repetition of the hazard  there is much in what you say replied prince florizel and i am not altogether pleased with my own determination alas in the clothes of the greatest potentate what is there but a man i never felt my weakness more acutely than now geraldine but it is stronger than i can i cease to interest myself in the fortunes of the unhappy young man who supped with us some hours ago can i leave the president to follow his nefarious career unwatched can i begin an adventure so entrancing and not follow it to an end no geraldine you ask of the prince more than the man is able to perform tonight once more we take our places at the table of the suicide club  colonel geraldine fell upon his knees  will your highness take my life he cried it is hishis freely but do not o do not let him ask me to countenance so terrible a risk  colonel geraldine replied the prince with some haughtiness of manner your life is absolutely your own i only looked for obedience and when that is unwillingly rendered i shall look for that no longer i add one word your importunity in this affair has been sufficient  the master of the horse regained his feet at once  your highness he said may i be excused in my attendance this afternoon i dare not as an honourable man venture a second time into that fatal house until i have perfectly ordered my affairs your highness shall meet i promise him with no more opposition from the most devoted and grateful of his servants  my dear geraldine returned prince florizel i always regret when you oblige me to remember my rank dispose of your day as you think fit but be here before eleven in the same disguise  the club on this second evening was not so fully attended and when geraldine and the prince arrived there were not above half a dozen persons in the smokingroom his highness took the president aside and congratulated him warmly on the demise of mr malthus  i like he said to meet with capacity and certainly find much of it in you your profession is of a very delicate nature but i see you are well qualified to conduct it with success and secrecy  the president was somewhat affected by these compliments from one of his highnesss superior bearing he acknowledged them almost with humility  poor malthy he added i shall hardly know the club without him the most of my patrons are boys sir and poetical boys who are not much company for me not but what malthy had some poetry too but it was of a kind that i could understand  i can readily imagine you should find yourself in sympathy with mr malthus returned the prince he struck me as a man of a very original disposition  the young man of the cream tarts was in the room but painfully depressed and silent his late companions sought in vain to lead him into conversation  how bitterly i wish he cried that i had never brought you to this infamous abode begone while you are cleanhanded if you could have heard the old man scream as he fell and the noise of his bones upon the pavement wish me if you have any kindness to so fallen a beingwish the ace of spades for me tonight  a few more members dropped in as the evening went on but the club did not muster more than the devils dozen when they took their places at the table the prince was again conscious of a certain joy in his alarms but he was astonished to see geraldine so much more selfpossessed than on the night before  it is extraordinary thought the prince that a will made or unmade should so greatly influence a young mans spirit  attention gentlemen said the president and he began to deal  three times the cards went all round the table and neither of the marked cards had yet fallen from his hand the excitement as he began the fourth distribution was overwhelming there were just cards enough to go once more entirely round the prince who sat second from the dealers left would receive in the reverse mode of dealing practised at the club the second last card the third player turned up a black aceit was the ace of clubs the next received a diamond the next a heart and so on but the ace of spades was still undelivered at last geraldine who sat upon the princes left turned his card it was an ace but the ace of hearts  when prince florizel saw his fate upon the table in front of him his heart stood still he was a brave man but the sweat poured off his face there were exactly fifty chances out of a hundred that he was doomed he reversed the card it was the ace of spades a loud roaring filled his brain and the table swam before his eyes he heard the player on his right break into a fit of laughter that sounded between mirth and disappointment he saw the company rapidly dispersing but his mind was full of other thoughts he recognised how foolish how criminal had been his conduct in perfect health in the prime of his years the heir to a throne he had gambled away his future and that of a brave and loyal country god he cried god forgive me and with that the confusion of his senses passed away and he regained his selfpossession in a moment  to his surprise geraldine had disappeared there was no one in the cardroom but his destined butcher consulting with the president and the young man of the cream tarts who slipped up to the prince and whispered in his ear  i would give a million if i had it for your luck  his highness could not help reflecting as the young man departed that he would have sold his opportunity for a much more moderate sum  the whispered conference now came to an end the holder of the ace of clubs left the room with a look of intelligence and the president approaching the unfortunate prince proffered him his hand  i am pleased to have met you sir said he and pleased to have been in a position to do you this trifling service at least you cannot complain of delay on the second eveningwhat a stroke of luck  the prince endeavoured in vain to articulate something in response but his mouth was dry and his tongue seemed paralysed  you feel a little sickish asked the president with some show of solicitude most gentlemen do will you take a little brandy  the prince signified in the affirmative and the other immediately filled some of the spirit into a tumbler  poor old malthy ejaculated the president as the prince drained the glass he drank near upon a pint and little enough good it seemed to do him  i am more amenable to treatment said the prince a good deal revived i am my own man again at once as you perceive and so let me ask you what are my directions  you will proceed along the strand in the direction of the city and on the lefthand pavement until you meet the gentleman who has just left the room he will continue your instructions and him you will have the kindness to obey the authority of the club is vested in his person for the night and now added the president i wish you a pleasant walk  florizel acknowledged the salutation rather awkwardly and took his leave he passed through the smokingroom where the bulk of the players were still consuming champagne some of which he had himself ordered and paid for and he was surprised to find himself cursing them in his heart he put on his hat and greatcoat in the cabinet and selected his umbrella from a corner the familiarity of these acts and the thought that he was about them for the last time betrayed him into a fit of laughter which sounded unpleasantly in his own ears he conceived a reluctance to leave the cabinet and turned instead to the window the sight of the lamps and the darkness recalled him to himself  come come i must be a man he thought and tear myself away  at the corner of box court three men fell upon prince florizel and he was unceremoniously thrust into a carriage which at once drove rapidly away there was already an occupant  will your highness pardon my zeal said a wellknown voice  the prince threw himself upon the colonels neck in a passion of relief  how can i ever thank you he cried and how was this effected  although he had been willing to march upon his doom he was overjoyed to yield to friendly violence and return once more to life and hope  you can thank me effectually enough replied the colonel by avoiding all such dangers in the future and as for your second question all has been managed by the simplest means i arranged this afternoon with a celebrated detective secrecy has been promised and paid for your own servants have been principally engaged in the affair the house in box court has been surrounded since nightfall and this which is one of your own carriages has been awaiting you for nearly an hour  and the miserable creature who was to have slain mewhat of him inquired the prince  he was pinioned as he left the club replied the colonel and now awaits your sentence at the palace where he will soon be joined by his accomplices  geraldine said the prince you have saved me against my explicit orders and you have done well i owe you not only my life but a lesson and i should be unworthy of my rank if i did not show myself grateful to my teacher let it be yours to choose the manner  there was a pause during which the carriage continued to speed through the streets and the two men were each buried in his own reflections the silence was broken by colonel geraldine  your highness said he has by this time a considerable body of prisoners there is at least one criminal among the number to whom justice should be dealt our oath forbids us all recourse to law and discretion would forbid it equally if the oath were loosened may i inquire your highnesss intention  it is decided answered florizel the president must fall in duel it only remains to choose his adversary  your highness has permitted me to name my own recompense said the colonel will he permit me to ask the appointment of my brother it is an honourable post but i dare assure your highness that the lad will acquit himself with credit  you ask me an ungracious favour said the prince but i must refuse you nothing  the colonel kissed his hand with the greatest affection and at that moment the carriage rolled under the archway of the princes splendid residence  an hour after florizel in his official robes and covered with all the orders of bohemia received the members of the suicide club  foolish and wicked men said he as many of you as have been driven into this strait by the lack of fortune shall receive employment and remuneration from my officers those who suffer under a sense of guilt must have recourse to a higher and more generous potentate than i i feel pity for all of you deeper than you can imagine tomorrow you shall tell me your stories and as you answer more frankly i shall be the more able to remedy your misfortunes as for you he added turning to the president i should only offend a person of your parts by any offer of assistance but i have instead a piece of diversion to propose to you here laying his hand on the shoulder of colonel geraldines young brother is an officer of mine who desires to make a little tour upon the continent and i ask you as a favour to accompany him on this excursion do you he went on changing his tone do you shoot well with the pistol because you may have need of that accomplishment when two men go travelling together it is best to be prepared for all let me add that if by any chance you should lose young mr geraldine upon the way i shall always have another member of my household to place at your disposal and i am known mr president to have long eyesight and as long an arm  with these words said with much sternness the prince concluded his address next morning the members of the club were suitably provided for by his munificence and the president set forth upon his travels under the supervision of mr geraldine and a pair of faithful and adroit lackeys well trained in the princes household not content with this discreet agents were put in possession of the house in box court and all letters or visitors for the suicide club or its officials were to be examined by prince florizel in person   here says my arabian author ends the story of the young man with the cream tarts who is now a comfortable householder in wigmore street cavendish square the number for obvious reasons i suppress those who care to pursue the adventures of prince florizel and the president of the suicide club may read   the story of the physician and the saratoga trunk  mr silas q scuddamore was a young american of a simple and harmless disposition which was the more to his credit as he came from new englanda quarter of the new world not precisely famous for those qualities although he was exceedingly rich he kept a note of all his expenses in a little paper pocketbook and he had chosen to study the attractions of paris from the seventh story of what is called a furnished hotel in the latin quarter there was a great deal of habit in his penuriousness and his virtue which was very remarkable among his associates was principally founded upon diffidence and youth  the next room to his was inhabited by a lady very attractive in her air and very elegant in toilette whom on his first arrival he had taken for a countess in course of time he had learned that she was known by the name of madame z√©phyrine and that whatever station she occupied in life it was not that of a person of title madame z√©phyrine probably in the hope of enchanting the young american used to flaunt by him on the stairs with a civil inclination a word of course and a knockdown look out of her black eyes and disappear in a rustle of silk and with the revelation of an admirable foot and ankle but these advances so far from encouraging mr scuddamore plunged him into the depths of depression and bashfulness she had come to him several times for a light or to apologise for imaginary depredations of her poodle but his mouth was closed in the presence of so superior a being his french promptly left him and he could only stare and stammer until she was gone the slenderness of their intercourse did not prevent him from throwing out insinuations of a very glorious order when he was safely alone with a few males  the room on the other side of the americansfor there were three rooms on a floor in the hotelwas tenanted by an old english physician of rather doubtful reputation dr noel for that was his name had been forced to leave london where he enjoyed a large and increasing practice and it was hinted that the police had been the instigators of this change of scene at least he who had made something of a figure in earlier life now dwelt in the latin quarter in great simplicity and solitude and devoted much of his time to study mr scuddamore had made his acquaintance and the pair would now and then dine together frugally in a restaurant across the street  silas q scuddamore had many little vices of the more respectable order and was not restrained by delicacy from indulging them in many rather doubtful ways chief among his foibles stood curiosity he was a born gossip and life and especially those parts of it in which he had no experience interested him to the degree of passion he was a pert invincible questioner pushing his inquiries with equal pertinacity and indiscretion he had been observed when he took a letter to the post to weigh it in his hand to turn it over and over and to study the address with care and when he found a flaw in the partition between his room and madame z√©phyrines instead of filling it up he enlarged and improved the opening and made use of it as a spyhole on his neighbours affairs  one day in the end of march his curiosity growing as it was indulged he enlarged the hole a little further so that he might command another corner of the room that evening when he went as usual to inspect madame z√©phyrines movements he was astonished to find the aperture obscured in an odd manner on the other side and still more abashed when the obstacle was suddenly withdrawn and a titter of laughter reached his ears some of the plaster had evidently betrayed the secret of his spyhole and his neighbour had been returning the compliment in kind mr scuddamore was moved to a very acute feeling of annoyance he condemned madame z√©phyrine unmercifully he even blamed himself but when he found next day that she had taken no means to baulk him of his favourite pastime he continued to profit by her carelessness and gratify his idle curiosity  that next day madame z√©phyrine received a long visit from a tall looselybuilt man of fifty or upwards whom silas had not hitherto seen his tweed suit and coloured shirt no less than his shaggy sidewhiskers identified him as a britisher and his dull grey eye affected silas with a sense of cold he kept screwing his mouth from side to side and round and round during the whole colloquy which was carried on in whispers more than once it seemed to the young new englander as if their gestures indicated his own apartment but the only thing definite he could gather by the most scrupulous attention was this remark made by the englishman in a somewhat higher key as if in answer to some reluctance or opposition  i have studied his taste to a nicety and i tell you again and again you are the only woman of the sort that i can lay my hands on  in answer to this madame z√©phyrine sighed and appeared by a gesture to resign herself like one yielding to unqualified authority  that afternoon the observatory was finally blinded a wardrobe having been drawn in front of it upon the other side and while silas was still lamenting over this misfortune which he attributed to the britishers malign suggestion the concierge brought him up a letter in a female handwriting it was conceived in french of no very rigorous orthography bore no signature and in the most encouraging terms invited the young american to be present in a certain part of the bullier ball at eleven oclock that night curiosity and timidity fought a long battle in his heart sometimes he was all virtue sometimes all fire and daring and the result of it was that long before ten mr silas q scuddamore presented himself in unimpeachable attire at the door of the bullier ball rooms and paid his entry money with a sense of reckless devilry that was not without its charm  it was carnival time and the ball was very full and noisy the lights and the crowd at first rather abashed our young adventurer and then mounting to his brain with a sort of intoxication put him in possession of more than his own share of manhood he felt ready to face the devil and strutted in the ballroom with the swagger of a cavalier while he was thus parading he became aware of madame z√©phyrine and her britisher in conference behind a pillar the catlike spirit of eavesdropping overcame him at once he stole nearer and nearer on the couple from behind until he was within earshot  that is the man the britisher was saying therewith the long blond hairspeaking to a girl in green  silas identified a very handsome young fellow of small stature who was plainly the object of this designation  it is well said madame z√©phyrine i shall do my utmost but remember the best of us may fail in such a matter  tut returned her companion i answer for the result have i not chosen you from thirty go but be wary of the prince i cannot think what cursed accident has brought him here tonight as if there were not a dozen balls in paris better worth his notice than this riot of students and counterjumpers see him where he sits more like a reigning emperor at home than a prince upon his holidays  silas was again lucky he observed a person of rather a full build strikingly handsome and of a very stately and courteous demeanour seated at table with another handsome young man several years his junior who addressed him with conspicuous deference the name of prince struck gratefully on silass republican hearing and the aspect of the person to whom that name was applied exercised its usual charm upon his mind he left madame z√©phyrine and her englishman to take care of each other and threading his way through the assembly approached the table which the prince and his confidant had honoured with their choice  i tell you geraldine the former was saying the action is madness yourself i am glad to remember it chose your brother for this perilous service and you are bound in duty to have a guard upon his conduct he has consented to delay so many days in paris that was already an imprudence considering the character of the man he has to deal with but now when he is within eightandforty hours of his departure when he is within two or three days of the decisive trial i ask you is this a place for him to spend his time he should be in a gallery at practice he should be sleeping long hours and taking moderate exercise on foot he should be on a rigorous diet without white wines or brandy does the dog imagine we are all playing comedy the thing is deadly earnest geraldine  i know the lad too well to interfere replied colonel geraldine and well enough not to be alarmed he is more cautious than you fancy and of an indomitable spirit if it had been a woman i should not say so much but i trust the president to him and the two valets without an instants apprehension  i am gratified to hear you say so replied the prince but my mind is not at rest these servants are welltrained spies and already has not this miscreant succeeded three times in eluding their observation and spending several hours on each in private and most likely dangerous affairs an amateur might have lost him by accident but if rudolph and j√©rome were thrown off the scent it must have been done on purpose and by a man who had a cogent reason and exceptional resources  i believe the question is now one between my brother and myself replied geraldine with a shade of offence in his tone  i permit it to be so colonel geraldine returned prince florizel perhaps for that very reason you should be all the more ready to accept my counsels but enough that girl in yellow dances well  and the talk veered into the ordinary topics of a paris ballroom in the carnival  silas remembered where he was and that the hour was already near at hand when he ought to be upon the scene of his assignation the more he reflected the less he liked the prospect and as at that moment an eddy in the crowd began to draw him in the direction of the door he suffered it to carry him away without resistance the eddy stranded him in a corner under the gallery where his ear was immediately struck with the voice of madame z√©phyrine she was speaking in french with the young man of the blond locks who had been pointed out by the strange britisher not half an hour before  i have a character at stake she said or i would put no other condition than my heart recommends but you have only to say so much to the porter and he will let you go by without a word  but why this talk of debt objected her companion  heavens said she do you think i do not understand my own hotel  and she went by clinging affectionately to her companions arm  this put silas in mind of his billet  ten minutes hence thought he and i may be walking with as beautiful a woman as that and even better dressedperhaps a real lady possibly a woman of title  and then he remembered the spelling and was a little downcast  but it may have been written by her maid he imagined  the clock was only a few minutes from the hour and this immediate proximity set his heart beating at a curious and rather disagreeable speed he reflected with relief that he was in no way bound to put in an appearance virtue and cowardice were together and he made once more for the door but this time of his own accord and battling against the stream of people which was now moving in a contrary direction perhaps this prolonged resistance wearied him or perhaps he was in that frame of mind when merely to continue in the same determination for a certain number of minutes produces a reaction and a different purpose certainly at least he wheeled about for a third time and did not stop until he had found a place of concealment within a few yards of the appointed place  here he went through an agony of spirit in which he several times prayed to god for help for silas had been devoutly educated he had now not the least inclination for the meeting nothing kept him from flight but a silly fear lest he should be thought unmanly but this was so powerful that it kept head against all other motives and although it could not decide him to advance prevented him from definitely running away at last the clock indicated ten minutes past the hour young scuddamores spirit began to rise he peered round the corner and saw no one at the place of meeting doubtless his unknown correspondent had wearied and gone away he became as bold as he had formerly been timid it seemed to him that if he came at all to the appointment however late he was clear from the charge of cowardice nay now he began to suspect a hoax and actually complimented himself on his shrewdness in having suspected and outmanoeuvred his mystifiers so very idle a thing is a boys mind  armed with these reflections he advanced boldly from his corner but he had not taken above a couple of steps before a hand was laid upon his arm he turned and beheld a lady cast in a very large mould and with somewhat stately features but bearing no mark of severity in her looks  i see that you are a very selfconfident ladykiller said she for you make yourself expected but i was determined to meet you when a woman has once so far forgotten herself as to make the first advance she has long ago left behind her all considerations of petty pride  silas was overwhelmed by the size and attractions of his correspondent and the suddenness with which she had fallen upon him but she soon set him at his ease she was very towardly and lenient in her behaviour she led him on to make pleasantries and then applauded him to the echo and in a very short time between blandishments and a liberal exhibition of warm brandy she had not only induced him to fancy himself in love but to declare his passion with the greatest vehemence  alas she said i do not know whether i ought not to deplore this moment great as is the pleasure you give me by your words hitherto i was alone to suffer now poor boy there will be two i am not my own mistress i dare not ask you to visit me at my own house for i am watched by jealous eyes let me see she added i am older than you although so much weaker and while i trust in your courage and determination i must employ my own knowledge of the world for our mutual benefit where do you live  he told her that he lodged in a furnished hotel and named the street and number  she seemed to reflect for some minutes with an effort of mind  i see she said at last you will be faithful and obedient will you not  silas assured her eagerly of his fidelity  tomorrow night then she continued with an encouraging smile you must remain at home all the evening and if any friends should visit you dismiss them at once on any pretext that most readily presents itself your door is probably shut by ten she asked  by eleven answered silas  at a quarter past eleven pursued the lady leave the house merely cry for the door to be opened and be sure you fall into no talk with the porter as that might ruin everything go straight to the corner where the luxembourg gardens join the boulevard there you will find me waiting you i trust you to follow my advice from point to point and remember if you fail me in only one particular you will bring the sharpest trouble on a woman whose only fault is to have seen and loved you  i cannot see the use of all these instructions said silas  i believe you are already beginning to treat me as a master she cried tapping him with her fan upon the arm patience patience that should come in time a woman loves to be obeyed at first although afterwards she finds her pleasure in obeying do as i ask you for heavens sake or i will answer for nothing indeed now i think of it she added with a manner of one who has just seen further into a difficulty i find a better plan of keeping importunate visitors away tell the porter to admit no one for you except a person who may come that night to claim a debt and speak with some feeling as though you feared the interview so that he may take your words in earnest  i think you may trust me to protect myself against intruders he said not without a little pique  that is how i should prefer the thing arranged she answered coldly i know you men you think nothing of a womans reputation  silas blushed and somewhat hung his head for the scheme he had in view had involved a little vainglorying before his acquaintances  above all she added do not speak to the porter as you come out  and why said he of all your instructions that seems to me the least important  you at first doubted the wisdom of some of the others which you now see to be very necessary she replied believe me this also has its uses in time you will see them and what am i to think of your affection if you refuse me such trifles at our first interview  silas confounded himself in explanations and apologies in the middle of these she looked up at the clock and clapped her hands together with a suppressed scream  heavens she cried is it so late i have not an instant to lose alas we poor women what slaves we are what have i not risked for you already  and after repeating her directions which she artfully combined with caresses and the most abandoned looks she bade him farewell and disappeared among the crowd  the whole of the next day silas was filled with a sense of great importance he was now sure she was a countess and when evening came he minutely obeyed her orders and was at the corner of the luxembourg gardens by the hour appointed no one was there he waited nearly half an hour looking in the face of every one who passed or loitered near the spot he even visited the neighbouring corners of the boulevard and made a complete circuit of the garden railings but there was no beautiful countess to throw herself into his arms at last and most reluctantly he began to retrace his steps towards his hotel on the way he remembered the words he had heard pass between madame z√©phyrine and the blond young man and they gave him an indefinite uneasiness  it appears he reflected that every one has to tell lies to our porter  he rang the bell the door opened before him and the porter in his bedclothes came to offer him a light  has he gone inquired the porter  he whom do you mean asked silas somewhat sharply for he was irritated by his disappointment  i did not notice him go out continued the porter but i trust you paid him we do not care in this house to have lodgers who cannot meet their liabilities  what the devil do you mean demanded silas rudely i cannot understand a word of this farrago  the short blond young man who came for his debt returned the other him it is i mean who else should it be when i had your orders to admit no one else  why good god of course he never came retorted silas  i believe what i believe returned the porter putting his tongue into his cheek with a most roguish air  you are an insolent scoundrel cried silas and feeling that he had made a ridiculous exhibition of asperity and at the same time bewildered by a dozen alarms he turned and began to run upstairs  do you not want a light then cried the porter  but silas only hurried the faster and did not pause until he had reached the seventh landing and stood in front of his own door there he waited a moment to recover his breath assailed by the worst forebodings and almost dreading to enter the room  when at last he did so he was relieved to find it dark and to all appearance untenanted he drew a long breath here he was home again in safety and this should be his last folly as certainly as it had been his first the matches stood on a little table by the bed and he began to grope his way in that direction as he moved his apprehensions grew upon him once more and he was pleased when his foot encountered an obstacle to find it nothing more alarming than a chair at last he touched curtains from the position of the window which was faintly visible he knew he must be at the foot of the bed and had only to feel his way along it in order to reach the table in question  he lowered his hand but what it touched was not simply a counterpaneit was a counterpane with something underneath it like the outline of a human leg silas withdrew his arm and stood a moment petrified  what what he thought can this betoken  he listened intently but there was no sound of breathing once more with a great effort he reached out the end of his finger to the spot he had already touched but this time he leaped back half a yard and stood shivering and fixed with terror there was something in his bed what it was he knew not but there was something there  it was some seconds before he could move then guided by an instinct he fell straight upon the matches and keeping his back towards the bed lighted a candle as soon as the flame had kindled he turned slowly round and looked for what he feared to see sure enough there was the worst of his imaginations realised the coverlid was drawn carefully up over the pillow but it moulded the outline of a human body lying motionless and when he dashed forward and flung aside the sheets he beheld the blond young man whom he had seen in the bullier ball the night before his eyes open and without speculation his face swollen and blackened and a thin stream of blood trickling from his nostrils  silas uttered a long tremulous wail dropped the candle and fell on his knees beside the bed  silas was awakened from the stupor into which his terrible discovery had plunged him by a prolonged but discreet tapping at the door it took him some seconds to remember his position and when he hastened to prevent any one from entering it was already too late dr noel in a tall nightcap carrying a lamp which lighted up his long white countenance sidling in his gait and peering and cocking his head like some sort of bird pushed the door slowly open and advanced into the middle of the room  i thought i heard a cry began the doctor and fearing you might be unwell i did not hesitate to offer this intrusion  silas with a flushed face and a fearful beating heart kept between the doctor and the bed but he found no voice to answer  you are in the dark pursued the doctor and yet you have not even begun to prepare for rest you will not easily persuade me against my own eyesight and your face declares most eloquently that you require either a friend or a physicianwhich is it to be let me feel your pulse for that is often a just reporter of the heart  he advanced to silas who still retreated before him backwards and sought to take him by the wrist but the strain on the young americans nerves had become too great for endurance he avoided the doctor with a febrile movement and throwing himself upon the floor burst into a flood of weeping  as soon as dr noel perceived the dead man in the bed his face darkened and hurrying back to the door which he had left ajar he hastily closed and doublelocked it  up he cried addressing silas in strident tones this is no time for weeping what have you done how came this body in your room speak freely to one who may be helpful do you imagine i would ruin you do you think this piece of dead flesh on your pillow can alter in any degree the sympathy with which you have inspired me credulous youth the horror with which blind and unjust law regards an action never attaches to the doer in the eyes of those who love him and if i saw the friend of my heart return to me out of seas of blood he would be in no way changed in my affection raise yourself he said good and ill are a chimera there is nought in life except destiny and however you may be circumstanced there is one at your side who will help you to the last  thus encouraged silas gathered himself together and in a broken voice and helped out by the doctors interrogations contrived at last to put him in possession of the facts but the conversation between the prince and geraldine he altogether omitted as he had understood little of its purport and had no idea that it was in any way related to his own misadventure  alas cried dr noel i am much abused or you have fallen innocently into the most dangerous hands in europe poor boy what a pit has been dug for your simplicity into what a deadly peril have your unwary feet been conducted this man he said this englishman whom you twice saw and whom i suspect to be the soul of the contrivance can you describe him was he young or old tall or short  but silas who for all his curiosity had not a seeing eye in his head was able to supply nothing but meagre generalities which it was impossible to recognise  i would have it a piece of education in all schools cried the doctor angrily where is the use of eyesight and articulate speech if a man cannot observe and recollect the features of his enemy i who know all the gangs of europe might have identified him and gained new weapons for your defence cultivate this art in future my poor boy you may find it of momentous service  the future repeated silas what future is there left for me except the gallows  youth is but a cowardly season returned the doctor and a mans own troubles look blacker than they are i am old and yet i never despair  can i tell such a story to the police demanded silas  assuredly not replied the doctor from what i see already of the machination in which you have been involved your case is desperate upon that side and for the narrow eye of the authorities you are infallibly the guilty person and remember that we only know a portion of the plot and the same infamous contrivers have doubtless arranged many other circumstances which would be elicited by a police inquiry and help to fix the guilt more certainly upon your innocence  i am then lost indeed cried silas  i have not said so answered dr noel for i am a cautious man  but look at this objected silas pointing to the body here is this object in my bed not to be explained not to be disposed of not to be regarded without horror  horror replied the doctor no when this sort of clock has run down it is no more to me than an ingenious piece of mechanism to be investigated with the bistoury when blood is once cold and stagnant it is no longer human blood when flesh is once dead it is no longer that flesh which we desire in our lovers and respect in our friends the grace the attraction the terror have all gone from it with the animating spirit accustom yourself to look upon it with composure for if my scheme is practicable you will have to live some days in constant proximity to that which now so greatly horrifies you  your scheme cried silas what is that tell me speedily doctor for i have scarcely courage enough to continue to exist  without replying dr noel turned towards the bed and proceeded to examine the corpse  quite dead he murmured yes as i had supposed the pockets empty yes and the name cut off the shirt their work has been done thoroughly and well fortunately he is of small stature  silas followed these words with an extreme anxiety at last the doctor his autopsy completed took a chair and addressed the young american with a smile  since i came into your room said he although my ears and my tongue have been so busy i have not suffered my eyes to remain idle i noted a little while ago that you have there in the corner one of those monstrous constructions which your fellowcountrymen carry with them into all quarters of the globein a word a saratoga trunk until this moment i have never been able to conceive the utility of these erections but then i began to have a glimmer whether it was for convenience in the slavetrade or to obviate the results of too ready an employment of the bowieknife i cannot bring myself to decide but one thing i see plainlythe object of such a box is to contain a human body  surely cried silas surely this is not a time for jesting  although i may express myself with some degree of pleasantry replied the doctor the purport of my words is entirely serious and the first thing we have to do my young friend is to empty your coffer of all that it contains  silas obeying the authority of dr noel put himself at his disposition the saratoga trunk was soon gutted of its contents which made a considerable litter on the floor and thensilas taking the heels and the doctor supporting the shouldersthe body of the murdered man was carried from the bed and after some difficulty doubled up and inserted whole into the empty box with an effort on the part of both the lid was forced down upon this unusual baggage and the trunk was locked and corded by the doctors own hand while silas disposed of what had been taken out between the closet and a chest of drawers  now said the doctor the first step has been taken on the way to your deliverance tomorrow or rather today it must be your task to allay the suspicions of your porter paying him all that you owe while you may trust me to make the arrangements necessary to a safe conclusion meantime follow me to my room where i shall give you a safe and powerful opiate for whatever you do you must have rest  the next day was the longest in silass memory it seemed as if it would never be done he denied himself to his friends and sat in a corner with his eyes fixed upon the saratoga trunk in dismal contemplation his own former indiscretions were now returned upon him in kind for the observatory had been once more opened and he was conscious of an almost continual study from madame z√©phyrines apartment so distressing did this become that he was at last obliged to block up the spyhole from his own side and when he was thus secured from observation he spent a considerable portion of his time in contrite tears and prayer  late in the evening dr noel entered the room carrying in his hand a pair of sealed envelopes without address one somewhat bulky and the other so slim as to seem without enclosure  silas he said seating himself at the table the time has now come for me to explain my plan for your salvation tomorrow morning at an early hour prince florizel of bohemia returns to london after having diverted himself for a few days with the parisian carnival it was my fortune a good while ago to do colonel geraldine his master of the horse one of those services so common in my profession which are never forgotten upon either side i have no need to explain to you the nature of the obligation under which he was laid suffice it to say that i knew him ready to serve me in any practicable manner now it was necessary for you to gain london with your trunk unopened to this the custom house seemed to oppose a fatal difficulty but i bethought me that the baggage of so considerable a person as the prince is as a matter of courtesy passed without examination by the officers of custom i applied to colonel geraldine and succeeded in obtaining a favourable answer tomorrow if you go before six to the hotel where the prince lodges your baggage will be passed over as a part of his and you yourself will make the journey as a member of his suite  it seems to me as you speak that i have already seen both the prince and colonel geraldine i even overheard some of their conversation the other evening at the bullier ball  it is probable enough for the prince loves to mix with all societies replied the doctor once arrived in london he pursued your task is nearly ended in this more bulky envelope i have given you a letter which i dare not address but in the other you will find the designation of the house to which you must carry it along with your box which will there be taken from you and not trouble you any more  alas said silas i have every wish to believe you but how is it possible you open up to me a bright prospect but i ask you is my mind capable of receiving so unlikely a solution be more generous and let me further understand your meaning  the doctor seemed painfully impressed  boy he answered you do not know how hard a thing you ask of me but be it so i am now inured to humiliation and it would be strange if i refused you this after having granted you so much know then that although i now make so quiet an appearancefrugal solitary addicted to studywhen i was younger my name was once a rallyingcry among the most astute and dangerous spirits of london and while i was outwardly an object for respect and consideration my true power resided in the most secret terrible and criminal relations it is to one of the persons who then obeyed me that i now address myself to deliver you from your burden they were men of many different nations and dexterities all bound together by a formidable oath and working to the same purposes the trade of the association was in murder and i who speak to you innocent as i appear was the chieftain of this redoubtable crew  what cried silas a murderer and one with whom murder was a trade can i take your hand ought i so much as to accept your services dark and criminal old man would you make an accomplice of my youth and my distress  the doctor bitterly laughed  you are difficult to please mr scuddamore said he but i now offer you your choice of company between the murdered man and the murderer if your conscience is too nice to accept my aid say so and i will immediately leave you thenceforward you can deal with your trunk and its belongings as best suits your upright conscience  i own myself wrong replied silas i should have remembered how generously you offered to shield me even before i had convinced you of my innocence and i continue to listen to your counsels with gratitude  that is well returned the doctor and i perceive you are beginning to learn some of the lessons of experience  at the same time resumed the new englander as you confess yourself accustomed to this tragical business and the people to whom you recommend me are your own former associates and friends could you not yourself undertake the transport of the box and rid me at once of its detested presence  upon my word replied the doctor i admire you cordially if you do not think i have already meddled sufficiently in your concerns believe me from my heart i think the contrary take or leave my services as i offer them and trouble me with no more words of gratitude for i value your consideration even more lightly than i do your intellect a time will come if you should be spared to see a number of years in health of mind when you will think differently of all this and blush for your tonights behaviour  so saying the doctor arose from his chair repeated his directions briefly and clearly and departed from the room without permitting silas any time to answer  the next morning silas presented himself at the hotel where he was politely received by colonel geraldine and relieved from that moment of all immediate alarm about his trunk and its grisly contents the journey passed over without much incident although the young man was horrified to overhear the sailors and railway porters complaining among themselves about the unusual weight of the princes baggage silas travelled in a carriage with the valets for prince florizel chose to be alone with his master of the horse on board the steamer however silas attracted his highnesss attention by the melancholy of his air and attitude as he stood gazing at the pile of baggage for he was still full of disquietude about the future  there is a young man observed the prince who must have some cause for sorrow  that replied geraldine is the american for whom i obtained permission to travel with your suite  you remind me that i have been remiss in courtesy said prince florizel and advancing to silas he addressed him with the most exquisite condescension in these words  i was charmed young sir to be able to gratify the desire you made known to me through colonel geraldine remember if you please that i shall be glad at any future time to lay you under a more serious obligation  and he then put some questions as to the political condition of america which silas answered with sense and propriety  you are still a young man said the prince but i observe you to be very serious for your years perhaps you allow your attention to be too much occupied with grave studies but perhaps on the other hand i am myself indiscreet and touch upon a painful subject  i have certainly cause to be the most miserable of men said silas never has a more innocent person been more dismally abused  i will not ask you for your confidence returned prince florizel but do not forget that colonel geraldines recommendation is an unfailing passport and that i am not only willing but possibly more able than many others to do you a service  silas was delighted with the amiability of this great personage but his mind soon returned upon its gloomy preoccupations for not even the favour of a prince to a republican can discharge a brooding spirit of its cares  the train arrived at charing cross where the officers of the revenue respected the baggage of prince florizel in the usual manner the most elegant equipages were in waiting and silas was driven along with the rest to the princes residence there colonel geraldine sought him out and expressed himself pleased to have been of any service to a friend of the physicians for whom he professed a great consideration  i hope he added that you will find none of your porcelain injured special orders were given along the line to deal tenderly with the princes effects  and then directing the servants to place one of the carriages at the young gentlemans disposal and at once to charge the saratoga trunk upon the dickey the colonel shook hands and excused himself on account of his occupations in the princely household  silas now broke the seal of the envelope containing the address and directed the stately footman to drive him to box court opening off the strand it seemed as if the place were not at all unknown to the man for he looked startled and begged a repetition of the order it was with a heart full of alarms that silas mounted into the luxurious vehicle and was driven to his destination the entrance to box court was too narrow for the passage of a coach it was a mere footway between railings with a post at either end on one of these posts was seated a man who at once jumped down and exchanged a friendly sign with the driver while the footman opened the door and inquired of silas whether he should take down the saratoga trunk and to what number it should be carried  if you please said silas to number three  the footman and the man who had been sitting on the post even with the aid of silas himself had hard work to carry in the trunk and before it was deposited at the door of the house in question the young american was horrified to find a score of loiterers looking on but he knocked with as good a countenance as he could muster up and presented the other envelope to him who opened  he is not at home said he but if you will leave your letter and return tomorrow early i shall be able to inform you whether and when he can receive your visit would you like to leave your box he added  dearly cried silas and the next moment he repented his precipitation and declared with equal emphasis that he would rather carry the box along with him to the hotel  the crowd jeered at his indecision and followed him to the carriage with insulting remarks and silas covered with shame and terror implored the servants to conduct him to some quiet and comfortable house of entertainment in the immediate neighbourhood  the princes equipage deposited silas at the craven hotel in craven street and immediately drove away leaving him alone with the servants of the inn the only vacant room it appeared was a little den up four pairs of stairs and looking towards the back to this hermitage with infinite trouble and complaint a pair of stout porters carried the saratoga trunk it is needless to mention that silas kept closely at their heels throughout the ascent and had his heart in his mouth at every corner a single false step he reflected and the box might go over the banisters and land its fatal contents plainly discovered on the pavement of the hall  arrived in the room he sat down on the edge of his bed to recover from the agony that he had just endured but he had hardly taken his position when he was recalled to a sense of his peril by the action of the boots who had knelt beside the trunk and was proceeding officiously to undo its elaborate fastenings  let it be cried silas i shall want nothing from it while i stay here  you might have let it lie in the hall then growled the man a thing as big and heavy as a church what you have inside i cannot fancy if it is all money you are a richer man than we  money repeated silas in a sudden perturbation what do you mean by money i have no money and you are speaking like a fool  all right captain retorted the boots with a wink theres nobody will touch your lordships money im as safe as the bank he added but as the box is heavy i shouldnt mind drinking something to your lordships health  silas pressed two napoleons upon his acceptance apologising at the same time for being obliged to trouble him with foreign money and pleading his recent arrival for excuse and the man grumbling with even greater fervour and looking contemptuously from the money in his hand to the saratoga trunk and back again from the one to the other at last consented to withdraw  for nearly two days the dead body had been packed into silass box and as soon as he was alone the unfortunate new englander nosed all the cracks and openings with the most passionate attention but the weather was cool and the trunk still managed to contain his shocking secret  he took a chair beside it and buried his face in his hands and his mind in the most profound reflection if he were not speedily relieved no question but he must be speedily discovered alone in a strange city without friends or accomplices if the doctors introduction failed him he was indubitably a lost new englander he reflected pathetically over his ambitious designs for the future he should not now become the hero and spokesman of his native place of bangor maine he should not as he had fondly anticipated move on from office to office from honour to honour he might as well divest himself at once of all hope of being acclaimed president of the united states and leaving behind him a statue in the worst possible style of art to adorn the capitol at washington here he was chained to a dead englishman doubled up inside a saratoga trunk whom he must get rid of or perish from the rolls of national glory  i should be afraid to chronicle the language employed by this young man to the doctor to the murdered man to madame z√©phyrine to the boots of the hotel to the princes servants and in a word to all who had been ever so remotely connected with his horrible misfortune  he slunk down to dinner about seven at night but the yellow coffeeroom appalled him the eyes of the other diners seemed to rest on his with suspicion and his mind remained upstairs with the saratoga trunk when the waiter came to offer him cheese his nerves were already so much on edge that he leaped halfway out of his chair and upset the remainder of a pint of ale upon the tablecloth  the fellow offered to show him to the smokingroom when he had done and although he would have much preferred to return at once to his perilous treasure he had not the courage to refuse and was shown downstairs to the black gaslit cellar which formed and possibly still forms the divan of the craven hotel  two very sad betting men were playing billiards attended by a moist consumptive marker and for the moment silas imagined that these were the only occupants of the apartment but at the next glance his eye fell upon a person smoking in the farthest corner with lowered eyes and a most respectable and modest aspect he knew at once that he had seen the face before and in spite of the entire change of clothes recognised the man whom he had found seated on a post at the entrance to box court and who had helped him to carry the trunk to and from the carriage the new englander simply turned and ran nor did he pause until he had locked and bolted himself into his bedroom  there all night long a prey to the most terrible imaginations he watched beside the fatal boxful of dead flesh the suggestion of the boots that his trunk was full of gold inspired him with all manner of new terrors if he so much as dared to close an eye and the presence in the smokingroom and under an obvious disguise of the loiterer from box court convinced him that he was once more the centre of obscure machinations  midnight had sounded some time when impelled by uneasy suspicions silas opened his bedroom door and peered into the passage it was dimly illuminated by a single jet of gas and some distance off he perceived a man sleeping on the floor in the costume of an hotel underservant silas drew near the man on tiptoe he lay partly on his back partly on his side and his right forearm concealed his face from recognition suddenly while the american was still bending over him the sleeper removed his arm and opened his eyes and silas found himself once more face to face with the loiterer of box court  goodnight sir said the man pleasantly  but silas was too profoundly moved to find an answer and regained his room in silence  towards morning worn out by apprehension he fell asleep on his chair with his head forward on the trunk in spite of so constrained an attitude and such a grisly pillow his slumber was sound and prolonged and he was only awakened at a late hour and by a sharp tapping at the door  he hurried to open and found the boots without  you are the gentleman who called yesterday at box court he asked  silas with a quaver admitted that he had done so  then this note is for you added the servant proffering a sealed envelope  silas tore it open and found inside the words twelve oclock  he was punctual to the hour the trunk was carried before him by several stout servants and he was himself ushered into a room where a man sat warming himself before the fire with his back towards the door the sound of so many persons entering and leaving and the scraping of the trunk as it was deposited upon the bare boards were alike unable to attract the notice of the occupant and silas stood waiting in an agony of fear until he should deign to recognise his presence  perhaps five minutes had elapsed before the man turned leisurely about and disclosed the features of prince florizel of bohemia  so sir he said with great severity this is the manner in which you abuse my politeness you join yourself to persons of condition i perceive for no other purpose than to escape the consequences of your crimes and i can readily understand your embarrassment when i addressed myself to you yesterday  indeed cried silas i am innocent of everything except misfortune  and in a hurried voice and with the greatest ingenuousness he recounted to the prince the whole history of his calamity  i see i have been mistaken said his highness when he had heard him to an end you are no other than a victim and since i am not to punish you may be sure i shall do my utmost to helpand now he continued to business open your box at once and let me see what it contains  silas changed colour  i almost fear to look upon it he exclaimed  nay replied the prince have you not looked at it already this is a form of sentimentality to be resisted the sight of a sick man whom we can still help should appeal more directly to the feelings than that of a dead man who is equally beyond help or harm love or hatred nerve yourself mr scuddamoreand then seeing that silas still hesitated i do not desire to give another name to my request he added  the young american awoke as if out of a dream and with a shiver of repugnance addressed himself to loose the straps and open the lock of the saratoga trunk the prince stood by watching with a composed countenance and his hands behind his back the body was quite stiff and it cost silas a great effort both moral and physical to dislodge it from its position and discover the face  prince florizel started back with an exclamation of painful surprise  alas he cried you little know mr scuddamore what a cruel gift you have brought me this is a young man of my own suite the brother of my trusted friend and it was upon matters of my own service that he has thus perished at the hands of violent and treacherous men poor geraldine he went on as if to himself in what words am i to tell you of your brothers fate how can i excuse myself in your eyes or in the eyes of god for the presumptuous schemes that led him to this bloody and unnatural death ah florizel florizel when will you learn the discretion that suits mortal life and be no longer dazzled with the image of power at your disposal power he cried who is more powerless i look upon this young man whom i have sacrificed mr scuddamore and feel how small a thing it is to be a prince  silas was moved at the sight of his emotion he tried to murmur some consolatory words and burst into tears the prince touched by his obvious intention came up to him and took him by the hand  command yourself said he we have both much to learn and we shall both be better men for todays meeting  silas thanked him in silence with an affectionate look  write me the address of doctor noel on this piece of paper continued the prince leading him towards the table and let me recommend you when you are again in paris to avoid the society of that dangerous man he has acted in this matter on a generous inspiration that i must believe had he been privy to young geraldines death he would never have despatched the body to the care of the actual criminal  the actual criminal repeated silas in astonishment  even so returned the prince this letter which the disposition of almighty providence has so strangely delivered into my hands was addressed to no less a person than the criminal himself the infamous president of the suicide club seek to pry no further in these perilous affairs but content yourself with your own miraculous escape and leave this house at once i have pressing affairs and must arrange at once about this poor clay which was so lately a gallant and handsome youth  silas took a grateful and submissive leave of prince florizel but he lingered in box court until he saw him depart in a splendid carriage on a visit to colonel henderson of the police republican as he was the young american took off his hat with almost a sentiment of devotion to the retreating carriage and the same night he started by rail on his return to paris   here observes my arabian author is the end of the history of the physician and the saratoga trunk omitting some reflections on the power of providence highly pertinent in the original but little suited to our occidental taste i shall only add that mr scuddamore has already begun to mount the ladder of political fame and by last advices was the sheriff of his native town   the adventure of the hansom cabs  lieutenant brackenbury rich had greatly distinguished himself in one of the lesser indian hill wars he it was who took the chieftain prisoner with his own hand his gallantry was universally applauded and when he came home prostrated by an ugly sabrecut and a protracted junglefever society was prepared to welcome the lieutenant as a celebrity of minor lustre but his was a character remarkable for unaffected modesty adventure was dear to his heart but he cared little for adulation and he waited at foreign wateringplaces and in algiers until the fame of his exploits had run through its nine days vitality and begun to be forgotten he arrived in london at last in the early season with as little observation as he could desire and as he was an orphan and had none but distant relatives who lived in the provinces it was almost as a foreigner that he installed himself in the capital of the country for which he had shed his blood  on the day following his arrival he dined alone at a military club he shook hands with a few old comrades and received their warm congratulations but as one and all had some engagement for the evening he found himself left entirely to his own resources he was in dress for he had entertained the notion of visiting a theatre but the great city was new to him he had gone from a provincial school to a military college and thence direct to the eastern empire and he promised himself a variety of delights in this world for exploration swinging his cane he took his way westward it was a mild evening already dark and now and then threatening rain the succession of faces in the lamplight stirred the lieutenants imagination and it seemed to him as if he could walk for ever in that stimulating city atmosphere and surrounded by the mystery of four million private lives he glanced at the houses and marvelled what was passing behind those warmlylighted windows he looked into face after face and saw them each intent upon some unknown interest criminal or kindly  they talk of war he thought but this is the great battlefield of mankind  and then he began to wonder that he should walk so long in this complicated scene and not chance upon so much as the shadow of an adventure for himself  all in good time he reflected i am still a stranger and perhaps wear a strange air but i must be drawn into the eddy before long  the night was already well advanced when a plump of cold rain fell suddenly out of the darkness brackenbury paused under some trees and as he did so he caught sight of a hansom cabman making him a sign that he was disengaged the circumstance fell in so happily to the occasion that he at once raised his cane in answer and had soon ensconced himself in the london gondola  where to sir asked the driver  where you please said brackenbury  and immediately at a pace of surprising swiftness the hansom drove off through the rain into a maze of villas one villa was so like another each with its front garden and there was so little to distinguish the deserted lamplit streets and crescents through which the flying hansom took its way that brackenbury soon lost all idea of direction he would have been tempted to believe that the cabman was amusing himself by driving him round and round and in and out about a small quarter but there was something businesslike in the speed which convinced him of the contrary the man had an object in view he was hastening towards a definite end and brackenbury was at once astonished at the fellows skill in picking a way through such a labyrinth and a little concerned to imagine what was the occasion of his hurry he had heard tales of strangers falling ill in london did the driver belong to some bloody and treacherous association and was he himself being whirled to a murderous death  the thought had scarcely presented itself when the cab swung sharply round a corner and pulled up before the garden gate of a villa in a long and wide road the house was brilliantly lighted up another hansom had just driven away and brackenbury could see a gentleman being admitted at the front door and received by several liveried servants he was surprised that the cabman should have stopped so immediately in front of a house where a reception was being held but he did not doubt it was the result of accident and sat placidly smoking where he was until he heard the trap thrown open over his head  here we are sir said the driver  here repeated brackenbury where  you told me to take you where i pleased sir returned the man with a chuckle and here we are  it struck brackenbury that the voice was wonderfully smooth and courteous for a man in so inferior a position he remembered the speed at which he had been driven and now it occurred to him that the hansom was more luxuriously appointed than the common run of public conveyances  i must ask you to explain said he do you mean to turn me out into the rain my good man i suspect the choice is mine  the choice is certainly yours replied the driver but when i tell you all i believe i know how a gentleman of your figure will decide there is a gentlemans party in this house i do not know whether the master be a stranger to london and without acquaintances of his own or whether he is a man of odd notions but certainly i was hired to kidnap single gentlemen in evening dress as many as i pleased but military officers by preference you have simply to go in and say that mr morris invited you  are you mr morris inquired the lieutenant  oh no replied the cabman mr morris is the person of the house  it is not a common way of collecting guests said brackenbury but an eccentric man might very well indulge the whim without any intention to offend and suppose that i refuse mr morriss invitation he went on what then  my orders are to drive you back where i took you from replied the man and set out to look for others up to midnight those who have no fancy for such an adventure mr morris said were not the guests for him  these words decided the lieutenant on the spot  after all he reflected as he descended from the hansom i have not had long to wait for my adventure  he had hardly found footing on the sidewalk and was still feeling in his pocket for the fare when the cab swung about and drove off by the way it came at the former breakneck velocity brackenbury shouted after the man who paid no heed and continued to drive away but the sound of his voice was overheard in the house the door was again thrown open emitting a flood of light upon the garden and a servant ran down to meet him holding an umbrella  the cabman has been paid observed the servant in a very civil tone and he proceeded to escort brackenbury along the path and up the steps in the hall several other attendants relieved him of his hat cane and paletot gave him a ticket with a number in return and politely hurried him up a stair adorned with tropical flowers to the door of an apartment on the first story here a grave butler inquired his name and announcing lieutenant brackenbury rich ushered him into the drawingroom of the house  a young man slender and singularly handsome came forward and greeted him with an air at once courtly and affectionate hundreds of candles of the finest wax lit up a room that was perfumed like the staircase with a profusion of rare and beautiful flowering shrubs a sidetable was loaded with tempting viands several servants went to and fro with fruits and goblets of champagne the company was perhaps sixteen in number all men few beyond the prime of life and with hardly an exception of a dashing and capable exterior they were divided into two groups one about a rouletteboard and the other surrounding a table at which one of their number held a bank of baccarat  i see thought brackenbury i am in a private gambling saloon and the cabman was a tout  his eye had embraced the details and his mind formed the conclusion while his host was still holding him by the hand and to him his looks returned from this rapid survey at a second view mr morris surprised him still more than on the first the easy elegance of his manners the distinction amiability and courage that appeared upon his features fitted very ill with the lieutenants preconceptions on the subject of the proprietor of a hell and the tone of his conversation seemed to mark him out for a man of position and merit brackenbury found he had an instinctive liking for his entertainer and though he chid himself for the weakness he was unable to resist a sort of friendly attraction for mr morriss person and character  i have heard of you lieutenant rich said mr morris lowering his tone and believe me i am gratified to make your acquaintance your looks accord with the reputation that has preceded you from india and if you will forget for a while the irregularity of your presentation in my house i shall feel it not only an honour but a genuine pleasure besides a man who makes a mouthful of barbarian cavaliers he added with a laugh should not be appalled by a breach of etiquette however serious  and he led him towards the sideboard and pressed him to partake of some refreshment  upon my word the lieutenant reflected this is one of the pleasantest fellows and i do not doubt one of the most agreeable societies in london  he partook of some champagne which he found excellent and observing that many of the company were already smoking he lit one of his own manillas and strolled up to the rouletteboard where he sometimes made a stake and sometimes looked on smilingly on the fortune of others it was while he was thus idling that he became aware of a sharp scrutiny to which the whole of the guests were subjected mr morris went here and there ostensibly busied on hospitable concerns but he had ever a shrewd glance at disposal not a man of the party escaped his sudden searching looks he took stock of the bearing of heavy losers he valued the amount of the stakes he paused behind couples who were deep in conversation and in a word there was hardly a characteristic of any one present but he seemed to catch and make a note of it brackenbury began to wonder if this were indeed a gamblinghell it had so much the air of a private inquisition he followed mr morris in all his movements and although the man had a ready smile he seemed to perceive as it were under a mask a haggard careworn and preoccupied spirit the fellows around him laughed and made their game but brackenbury had lost interest in the guests  this morris thought he is no idler in the room some deep purpose inspires him let it be mine to fathom it  now and then mr morris would call one of his visitors aside and after a brief colloquy in an anteroom he would return alone and the visitors in question reappeared no more after a certain number of repetitions this performance excited brackenburys curiosity to a high degree he determined to be at the bottom of this minor mystery at once and strolling into the anteroom found a deep window recess concealed by curtains of the fashionable green here he hurriedly ensconced himself nor had he to wait long before the sound of steps and voices drew near him from the principal apartment peering through the division he saw mr morris escorting a fat and ruddy personage with somewhat the look of a commercial traveller whom brackenbury had already remarked for his coarse laugh and underbred behaviour at the table the pair halted immediately before the window so that brackenbury lost not a word of the following discourse  i beg you a thousand pardons began mr morris with the most conciliatory manner and if i appear rude i am sure you will readily forgive me in a place so great as london accidents must continually happen and the best that we can hope is to remedy them with as small delay as possible i will not deny that i fear you have made a mistake and honoured my poor house by inadvertence for to speak openly i cannot at all remember your appearance let me put the question without unnecessary circumlocutionbetween gentlemen of honour a word will sufficeunder whose roof do you suppose yourself to be  that of mr morris replied the other with a prodigious display of confusion which had been visibly growing upon him throughout the last few words  mr john or mr james morris inquired the host  i really cannot tell you returned the unfortunate guest i am not personally acquainted with the gentleman any more than i am with yourself  i see said mr morris there is another person of the same name farther down the street and i have no doubt the policeman will be able to supply you with his number believe me i felicitate myself on the misunderstanding which has procured me the pleasure of your company for so long and let me express a hope that we may meet again upon a more regular footing meantime i would not for the world detain you longer from your friends john he added raising his voice will you see that this gentleman finds his greatcoat  and with the most agreeable air mr morris escorted his visitor as far as the anteroom door where he left him under conduct of the butler as he passed the window on his return to the drawingroom brackenbury could hear him utter a profound sigh as though his mind was loaded with a great anxiety and his nerves already fatigued with the task on which he was engaged  for perhaps an hour the hansoms kept arriving with such frequency that mr morris had to receive a new guest for every old one that he sent away and the company preserved its number undiminished but towards the end of that time the arrivals grew few and far between and at length ceased entirely while the process of elimination was continued with unimpaired activity the drawingroom began to look empty the baccarat was discontinued for lack of a banker more than one person said goodnight of his own accord and was suffered to depart without expostulation and in the meanwhile mr morris redoubled in agreeable attentions to those who stayed behind he went from group to group and from person to person with looks of the readiest sympathy and the most pertinent and pleasing talk he was not so much like a host as like a hostess and there was a feminine coquetry and condescension in his manner which charmed the hearts of all  as the guests grew thinner lieutenant rich strolled for a moment out of the drawingroom into the hall in quest of fresher air but he had no sooner passed the threshold of the antechamber than he was brought to a dead halt by a discovery of the most surprising nature the flowering shrubs had disappeared from the staircase three large furniturewaggons stood before the garden gate the servants were busy dismantling the house upon all sides and some of them had already donned their greatcoats and were preparing to depart it was like the end of a country ball where everything has been supplied by contract brackenbury had indeed some matter for reflection first the guests who were no real guests after all had been dismissed and now the servants who could hardly be genuine servants were actively dispersing  was the whole establishment a sham he asked himself the mushroom of a single night which should disappear before morning  watching a favourable opportunity brackenbury dashed upstairs to the higher regions of the house it was as he had expected he ran from room to room and saw although the house had been painted and papered it was not only uninhabited at present but plainly had never been inhabited at all the young officer remembered with astonishment its specious settled and hospitable air on his arrival it was only at a prodigious cost that the imposture could have been carried out upon so great a scale  who then was mr morris what was his intention in thus playing the householder for a single night in the remote west of london and why did he collect his visitors at hazard from the streets  brackenbury remembered that he had already delayed too long and hastened to join the company many had left during his absence and counting the lieutenant and his host there were not more than five persons in the drawingroomrecently so thronged mr morris greeted him as he reentered the apartment with a smile and immediately rose to his feet  it is now time gentlemen said he to explain my purpose in decoying you from your amusements i trust you did not find the evening hang very dully on your hands but my object i will confess it was not to entertain your leisure but to help myself in an unfortunate necessity you are all gentlemen he continued your appearance does you that much justice and i ask for no better security hence i speak it without concealment i ask you to render me a dangerous and delicate service dangerous because you may run the hazard of your lives and delicate because i must ask an absolute discretion upon all that you shall see or hear from an utter stranger the request is almost comically extravagant i am well aware of this and i would add at once if there be any one present who has heard enough if there be one among the party who recoils from a dangerous confidence and a piece of quixotic devotion to he knows not whomhere is my hand ready and i shall wish him goodnight and godspeed with all the sincerity in the world  a very tall black man with a heavy stoop immediately responded to this appeal  i commend your frankness sir said he and for my part i go i make no reflections but i cannot deny that you fill me with suspicious thoughts i go myself as i say and perhaps you will think i have no right to add words to my example  on the contrary replied mr morris i am obliged to you for all you say it would be impossible to exaggerate the gravity of my proposal  well gentlemen what do you say said the tall man addressing the others we have had our evenings frolic shall we all go homeward peaceably in a body you will think well of my suggestion in the morning when you see the sun again in innocence and safety  the speaker pronounced the last words with an intonation which added to their force and his face wore a singular expression full of gravity and significance another of the company rose hastily and with some appearance of alarm prepared to take his leave there were only two who held their ground brackenbury and an old rednosed cavalry major but these two preserved a nonchalant demeanour and beyond a look of intelligence which they rapidly exchanged appeared entirely foreign to the discussion that had just been terminated  mr morris conducted the deserters as far as the door which he closed upon their heels then he turned round disclosing a countenance of mingled relief and animation and addressed the two officers as follows  i have chosen my men like joshua in the bible said mr morris and i now believe i have the pick of london your appearance pleased my hansom cabmen then it delighted me i have watched your behaviour in a strange company and under the most unusual circumstances i have studied how you played and how you bore your losses lastly i have put you to the test of a staggering announcement and you received it like an invitation to dinner it is not for nothing he cried that i have been for years the companion and the pupil of the bravest and wisest potentate in europe  at the affair of bunderchang observed the major i asked for twelve volunteers and every trooper in the ranks replied to my appeal but a gaming party is not the same thing as a regiment under fire you may be pleased i suppose to have found two and two who will not fail you at a push as for the pair who ran away i count them among the most pitiful hounds i ever met withlieutenant rich he added addressing brackenbury i have heard much of you of late and i cannot doubt but you have also heard of me i am major orooke  and the veteran tendered his hand which was red and tremulous to the young lieutenant  who has not answered brackenbury  when this little matter is settled said mr morris you will think i have sufficiently rewarded you for i could offer neither a more valuable service than to make him acquainted with the other  and now said major orooke is it a duel  a duel after a fashion replied mr morris a duel with unknown and dangerous enemies and as i gravely fear a duel to the death i must ask you he continued to call me morris no longer call me if you please hammersmith my real name as well as that of another person to whom i hope to present you before long you will gratify me by not asking and not seeking to discover for yourselves three days ago the person of whom i speak disappeared suddenly from home and until this morning i received no hint of his situation you will fancy my alarm when i tell you that he is engaged upon a work of private justice bound by an unhappy oath too lightly sworn he finds it necessary without the help of law to rid the earth of an insidious and bloody villain already two of our friends and one of them my own born brother have perished in the enterprise he himself or i am much deceived is taken in the same fatal toils but at least he still lives and still hopes as this billet sufficiently proves  and the speaker no other than colonel geraldine proffered a letter thus conceived    major hammersmithon wednesday at 3 am you will be admitted by   the small door to the gardens of rochester house regents park by a   man who is entirely in my interest i must request you not to fail me   by a second pray bring my case of swords and if you can find them   one or two gentlemen of conduct and discretion to whom my person is   unknown my name must not be used in this affair       t godall  from his wisdom alone if he had no other title pursued colonel geraldine when the others had each satisfied his curiosity my friend is a man whose directions should implicitly be followed i need not tell you therefore that i have not so much as visited the neighbourhood of rochester house and that i am still as wholly in the dark as either of yourselves as to the nature of my friends dilemma i betook myself as soon as i had received this order to a furnishing contractor and in a few hours the house in which we now are had assumed its late air of festival my scheme was at least original and i am far from regretting an action which has procured me the services of major orooke and lieutenant brackenbury rich but the servants in the street will have a strange awakening the house which this evening was full of lights and visitors they will find uninhabited and for sale tomorrow morning thus even the most serious concerns added the colonel have a merry side  and let us add a merry ending said brackenbury  the colonel consulted his watch  it is now hard on two he said we have an hour before us and a swift cab is at the door tell me if i may count upon your help  during a long life replied major orooke i never took back my hand from anything nor so much as hedged a bet  brackenbury signified his readiness in the most becoming terms and after they had drunk a glass or two of wine the colonel gave each of them a loaded revolver and the three mounted into the cab and drove off for the address in question  rochester house was a magnificent residence on the banks of the canal the large extent of the garden isolated it in an unusual degree from the annoyances of neighbourhood it seemed the parc aux cerfs of some great nobleman or millionaire as far as could be seen from the street there was not a glimmer of light in any of the numerous windows of the mansion and the place had a look of neglect as though the master had been long from home  the cab was discharged and the three gentlemen were not long in discovering the small door which was a sort of postern in a lane between two garden walls it still wanted ten or fifteen minutes of the appointed time the rain fell heavily and the adventurers sheltered themselves below some pendent ivy and spoke in low tones of the approaching trial  suddenly geraldine raised his finger to command silence and all three bent their hearing to the utmost through the continuous noise of the rain the steps and voices of two men became audible from the other side of the wall and as they drew nearer brackenbury whose sense of hearing was remarkably acute could even distinguish some fragments of their talk  is the grave dug asked one  it is replied the other behind the laurel hedge when the job is done we can cover it with a pile of stakes  the first speaker laughed and the sound of his merriment was shocking to the listeners on the other side  in an hour from now he said  and by the sound of the steps it was obvious that the pair had separated and were proceeding in contrary directions  almost immediately after the postern door was cautiously opened a white face was protruded into the lane and a hand was seen beckoning to the watchers in dead silence the three passed the door which was immediately locked behind them and followed their guide through several garden alleys to the kitchen entrance of the house a single candle burned in the great paved kitchen which was destitute of the customary furniture and as the party proceeded to ascend from thence by a flight of winding stairs a prodigious noise of rats testified still more plainly to the dilapidation of the house  their conductor preceded them carrying the candle he was a lean man much bent but still agile and he turned from time to time and admonished silence and caution by his gestures colonel geraldine followed on his heels the case of swords under one arm and a pistol ready in the other brackenburys heart beat thickly he perceived that they were still in time but he judged from the alacrity of the old man that the hour of action must be near at hand and the circumstances of this adventure were so obscure and menacing the place seemed so well chosen for the darkest acts that an older man than brackenbury might have been pardoned a measure of emotion as he closed the procession up the winding stair  at the top the guide threw open a door and ushered the three officers before him into a small apartment lighted by a smoky lamp and the glow of a modest fire at the chimney corner sat a man in the early prime of life and of a stout but courtly and commanding appearance his attitude and expression were those of the most unmoved composure he was smoking a cheroot with much enjoyment and deliberation and on a table by his elbow stood a long glass of some effervescing beverage which diffused an agreeable odour through the room  welcome said he extending his hand to colonel geraldine i knew i might count on your exactitude  on my devotion replied the colonel with a bow  present me to your friends continued the first and when that ceremony had been performed i wish gentlemen he added with the most exquisite affability that i could offer you a more cheerful programme it is ungracious to inaugurate an acquaintance upon serious affairs but the compulsion of events is stronger than the obligations of goodfellowship i hope and believe you will be able to forgive me this unpleasant evening and for men of your stamp it will be enough to know that you are conferring a considerable favour  your highness said the major must pardon my bluntness i am unable to hide what i know for some time back i have suspected major hammersmith but mr godall is unmistakable to seek two men in london unacquainted with prince florizel of bohemia was to ask too much at fortunes hands  prince florizel cried brackenbury in amazement  and he gazed with the deepest interest on the features of the celebrated personage before him  i shall not lament the loss of my incognito remarked the prince for it enables me to thank you with the more authority you would have done as much for mr godall i feel sure as for the prince of bohemia but the latter can perhaps do more for you the gain is mine he added with a courteous gesture  and the next moment he was conversing with the two officers about the indian army and the native troops a subject on which as on all others he had a remarkable fund of information and the soundest views  there was something so striking in this mans attitude at a moment of deadly peril that brackenbury was overcome with respectful admiration nor was he less sensible to the charm of his conversation or the surprising amenity of his address every gesture every intonation was not only noble in itself but seemed to ennoble the fortunate mortal for whom it was intended and brackenbury confessed to himself with enthusiasm that this was a sovereign for whom a brave man might thankfully lay down his life  many minutes had thus passed when the person who had introduced them into the house and who had sat ever since in a corner and with his watch in his hand arose and whispered a word into the princes ear  it is well dr noel replied florizel aloud and then addressing the others you will excuse me gentlemen he added if i have to leave you in the dark the moment now approaches  dr noel extinguished the lamp a faint grey light premonitory of the dawn illuminated the window but was not sufficient to illuminate the room and when the prince rose to his feet it was impossible to distinguish his features or to make a guess at the nature of the emotion which obviously affected him as he spoke he moved towards the door and placed himself at one side of it in an attitude of the wariest attention  you will have the kindness he said to maintain the strictest silence and to conceal yourselves in the densest of the shadow  the three officers and the physician hastened to obey and for nearly ten minutes the only sound in rochester house was occasioned by the excursions of the rats behind the woodwork at the end of that period a loud creak of a hinge broke in with surprising distinctness on the silence and shortly after the watchers could distinguish a slow and cautious tread approaching up the kitchen stair at every second step the intruder seemed to pause and lend an ear and during these intervals which seemed of an incalculable duration a profound disquiet possessed the spirit of the listeners dr noel accustomed as he was to dangerous emotions suffered an almost pitiful physical prostration his breath whistled in his lungs his teeth grated one upon another and his joints cracked aloud as he nervously shifted his position  at last a hand was laid upon the door and the bolt shot back with a slight report there followed another pause during which brackenbury could see the prince draw himself together noiselessly as if for some unusual exertion then the door opened letting in a little more of the light of the morning and the figure of a man appeared upon the threshold and stood motionless he was tall and carried a knife in his hand even in the twilight they could see his upper teeth bare and glistening for his mouth was open like that of a hound about to leap the man had evidently been over the head in water but a minute or two before and even while he stood there the drops kept falling from his wet clothes and pattered on the floor  the next moment he crossed the threshold there was a leap a stifled cry an instantaneous struggle and before colonel geraldine could spring to his aid the prince held the man disarmed and helpless by the shoulders  dr noel he said you will be so good as to relight the lamp  and relinquishing the charge of his prisoner to geraldine and brackenbury he crossed the room and set his back against the chimneypiece as soon as the lamp had kindled the party beheld an unaccustomed sternness on the princes features it was no longer florizel the careless gentleman it was the prince of bohemia justly incensed and full of deadly purpose who now raised his head and addressed the captive president of the suicide club  president he said you have laid your last snare and your own feet are taken in it the day is beginning it is your last morning you have just swum the regents canal it is your last bathe in this world your old accomplice dr noel so far from betraying me has delivered you into my hands for judgment and the grave you had dug for me this afternoon shall serve in gods almighty providence to hide your own just doom from the curiosity of mankind kneel and pray sir if you have a mind that way for your time is short and god is weary of your iniquities  the president made no answer either by word or sign but continued to hang his head and gaze sullenly on the floor as though he were conscious of the princes prolonged and unsparing regard  gentlemen continued florizel resuming the ordinary tone of his conversation this is a fellow who has long eluded me but whom thanks to dr noel i now have tightly by the heels to tell the story of his misdeeds would occupy more time than we can now afford but if the canal had contained nothing but the blood of his victims i believe the wretch would have been no drier than you see him even in an affair of this sort i desire to preserve the forms of honour but i make you the judges gentlementhis is more an execution than a duel and to give the rogue his choice of weapons would be to push too far a point of etiquette i cannot afford to lose my life in such a business he continued unlocking the case of swords and as a pistolbullet travels so often on the wings of chance and skill and courage may fall by the most trembling marksman i have decided and i feel sure you will approve my determination to put this question to the touch of swords  when brackenbury and major orooke to whom these remarks were particularly addressed had each intimated his approval quick sir added prince florizel to the president choose a blade and do not keep me waiting i have an impatience to be done with you for ever  for the first time since he was captured and disarmed the president raised his head and it was plain that he began instantly to pluck up courage  is it to be stand up he asked eagerly and between you and me  i mean so far to honour you replied the prince  oh come cried the president with a fair field who knows how things may happen i must add that i consider it handsome behaviour on your highnesss part and if the worst comes to the worst i shall die by one of the most gallant gentlemen in europe  and the president liberated by those who had detained him stepped up to the table and began with minute attention to select a sword he was highly elated and seemed to feel no doubt that he should issue victorious from the contest the spectators grew alarmed in the face of so entire a confidence and adjured prince florizel to reconsider his intention  it is but a farce he answered and i think i can promise you gentlemen that it will not be long aplaying  your highness will be careful not to overreach said colonel geraldine  geraldine returned the prince did you ever know me fail in a debt of honour i owe you this mans death and you shall have it  the president at last satisfied himself with one of the rapiers and signified his readiness by a gesture that was not devoid of a rude nobility the nearness of peril and the sense of courage even to this obnoxious villain lent an air of manhood and a certain grace  the prince helped himself at random to a sword  colonel geraldine and doctor noel he said will have the goodness to await me in this room i wish no personal friend of mine to be involved in this transaction major orooke you are a man of some years and a settled reputationlet me recommend the president to your good graces lieutenant rich will be so good as lend me his attentions a young man cannot have too much experience in such affairs  your highness replied brackenbury it is an honour i shall prize extremely  it is well returned prince florizel i shall hope to stand your friend in more important circumstances  and so saying he led the way out of the apartment and down the kitchen stairs  the two men who were thus left alone threw open the window and leaned out straining every sense to catch an indication of the tragical events that were about to follow the rain was now over day had almost come and the birds were piping in the shrubbery and on the foresttrees of the garden the prince and his companions were visible for a moment as they followed an alley between two flowering thickets but at the first corner a clump of foliage intervened and they were again concealed from view this was all that the colonel and the physician had an opportunity to see and the garden was so vast and the place of combat evidently so remote from the house that not even the noise of swordplay reached their ears  he has taken him towards the grave said dr noel with a shudder  god cried the colonel god defend the right  and they awaited the event in silence the doctor shaking with fear the colonel in an agony of sweat many minutes must have elapsed the day was sensibly broader and the birds were singing more heartily in the garden before a sound of returning footsteps recalled their glances towards the door it was the prince and the two indian officers who entered god had defended the right  i am ashamed of my emotion said prince florizel i feel it is a weakness unworthy of my station but the continued existence of that hound of hell had begun to prey upon me like a disease and his death has more refreshed me than a night of slumber look geraldine he continued throwing his sword upon the floor there is the blood of the man who killed your brother it should be a welcome sight and yet he added see how strangely we men are made my revenge is not yet five minutes old and already i am beginning to ask myself if even revenge be attainable on this precarious stage of life the ill he did who can undo it the career in which he amassed a huge fortune for the house itself in which we stand belonged to himthat career is now a part of the destiny of mankind for ever and i might weary myself making thrusts in carte until the crack of judgment and geraldines brother would be none the less dead and a thousand other innocent persons would be none the less dishonoured and debauched the existence of a man is so small a thing to take so mighty a thing to employ alas he cried is there anything in life so disenchanting as attainment  gods justice has been done replied the doctor so much i behold the lesson your highness has been a cruel one for me and i await my own turn with deadly apprehension  what was i saying cried the prince i have punished and here is the man beside us who can help me to undo ah dr noel you and i have before us many a day of hard and honourable toil and perhaps before we have done you may have more than redeemed your early errors  and in the meantime said the doctor let me go and bury my oldest friend   and this observes the erudite arabian is the fortunate conclusion of the tale the prince it is superfluous to mention forgot none of those who served him in this great exploit and to this day his authority and influence help them forward in their public career while his condescending friendship adds a charm to their private life to collect continues my author all the strange events in which this prince has played the part of providence were to fill the habitable globe with books but the stories which relate to the fortunes of the rajahs diamond are of too entertaining a description says he to be omitted following prudently in the footsteps of this oriental we shall now begin the series to which he refers with the story of the bandbox     the rajahs diamond   story of the bandbox  up to the age of sixteen at a private school and afterwards at one of those great institutions for which england is justly famous mr harry hartley had received the ordinary education of a gentleman at that period he manifested a remarkable distaste for study and his only surviving parent being both weak and ignorant he was permitted thenceforward to spend his time in the attainment of petty and purely elegant accomplishments two years later he was left an orphan and almost a beggar for all active and industrious pursuits harry was unfitted alike by nature and training he could sing romantic ditties and accompany himself with discretion on the piano he was a graceful although a timid cavalier he had a pronounced taste for chess and nature had sent him into the world with one of the most engaging exteriors that can well be fancied blond and pink with doves eyes and a gentle smile he had an air of agreeable tenderness and melancholy and the most submissive and caressing manners but when all is said he was not the man to lead armaments of war or direct the councils of a state  a fortunate chance and some influence obtained for harry at the time of his bereavement the position of private secretary to majorgeneral sir thomas vandeleur cb sir thomas was a man of sixty loudspoken boisterous and domineering for some reason some service the nature of which had been often whispered and repeatedly denied the rajah of kashgar had presented this officer with the sixth known diamond of the world the gift transformed general vandeleur from a poor into a wealthy man from an obscure and unpopular soldier into one of the lions of london society the possessor of the rajahs diamond was welcome in the most exclusive circles and he had found a lady young beautiful and wellborn who was willing to call the diamond hers even at the price of marriage with sir thomas vandeleur it was commonly said at the time that as like draws to like one jewel had attracted another certainly lady vandeleur was not only a gem of the finest water in her own person but she showed herself to the world in a very costly setting and she was considered by many respectable authorities as one among the three or four bestdressed women in england  harrys duty as secretary was not particularly onerous but he had a dislike for all prolonged work it gave him pain to ink his fingers and the charms of lady vandeleur and her toilettes drew him often from the library to the boudoir he had the prettiest ways among women could talk fashions with enjoyment and was never more happy than when criticising a shade of ribbon or running on an errand to the milliners in short sir thomass correspondence fell into pitiful arrears and my lady had another ladys maid  at last the general who was one of the least patient of military commanders arose from his place in a violent access of passion and indicated to his secretary that he had no further need for his services with one of those explanatory gestures which are most rarely employed between gentlemen the door being unfortunately open mr hartley fell downstairs headforemost  he arose somewhat hurt and very deeply aggrieved the life in the generals house precisely suited him he moved on a more or less doubtful footing in very genteel company he did little he ate of the best and he had a lukewarm satisfaction in the presence of lady vandeleur which in his own heart he dubbed by a more emphatic name  immediately after he had been outraged by the military foot he hurried to the boudoir and recounted his sorrows  you know very well my dear harry replied lady vandeleur for she called him by name like a child or a domestic servant that you never by any chance do what the general tells you no more do i you may say but that is different a woman can earn her pardon for a good year of disobedience by a single adroit submission and besides no one is married to his private secretary i shall be sorry to lose you but since you cannot stay longer in a house where you have been insulted i shall wish you goodbye and i promise you to make the general smart for his behaviour  harrys countenance fell tears came into his eyes and he gazed on lady vandeleur with a tender reproach  my lady said he what is an insult i should think little indeed of any one who could not forgive them by the score but to leave ones friends to tear up the bonds of affection  he was unable to continue for his emotion choked him and he began to weep  lady vandeleur looked at him with a curious expression  this little fool she thought imagines himself to be in love with me why should he not become my servant instead of the generals he is goodnatured obliging and understands dress and besides it will keep him out of mischief he is positively too pretty to be unattached  that night she talked over the general who was already somewhat ashamed of his vivacity and harry was transferred to the feminine department where his life was little short of heavenly he was always dressed with uncommon nicety wore delicate flowers in his buttonhole and could entertain a visitor with tact and pleasantry he took a pride in servility to a beautiful woman received lady vandeleurs commands as so many marks of favour and was pleased to exhibit himself before other men who derided and despised him in his character of male ladysmaid and manmilliner nor could he think enough of his existence from a moral point of view wickedness seemed to him an essentially male attribute and to pass ones days with a delicate woman and principally occupied about trimmings was to inhabit an enchanted isle among the storms of life  one fine morning he came into the drawingroom and began to arrange some music on the top of the piano lady vandeleur at the other end of the apartment was speaking somewhat eagerly with her brother charlie pendragon an elderly young man much broken with dissipation and very lame of one foot the private secretary to whose entrance they paid no regard could not avoid overhearing a part of their conversation  today or never said the lady once and for all it shall be done today  today if it must be replied the brother with a sigh but it is a false step a ruinous step clara and we shall live to repent it dismally  lady vandeleur looked her brother steadily and somewhat strangely in the face  you forget she said the man must die at last  upon my word clara said pendragon i believe you are the most heartless rascal in england  you men she returned are so coarsely built that you can never appreciate a shade of meaning you are yourselves rapacious violent immodest careless of distinction and yet the least thought for the future shocks you in a woman i have no patience with such stuff you would despise in a common banker the imbecility that you expect to find in us  you are very likely right replied her brother you were always cleverer than i and anyway you know my motto the family before all  yes charlie she returned taking his hand in hers i know your motto better than you know it yourself and clara before the family is not that the second part of it indeed you are the best of brothers and i love you dearly  mr pendragon got up looking a little confused by these family endearments  i had better not be seen said he i understand my part to a miracle and ill keep an eye on the tame cat  do she replied he is an abject creature and might ruin all  she kissed the tips of her fingers to him daintily and the brother withdrew by the boudoir and the back stair  harry said lady vandeleur turning towards the secretary as soon as they were alone i have a commission for you this morning but you shall take a cab i cannot have my secretary freckled  she spoke the last words with emphasis and a look of halfmotherly pride that caused great contentment to poor harry and he professed himself charmed to find an opportunity of serving her  it is another of our great secrets she went on archly and no one must know of it but my secretary and me sir thomas would make the saddest disturbance and if you only knew how weary i am of these scenes o harry harry can you explain to me what makes you men so violent and unjust but indeed i know you cannot you are the only man in the world who knows nothing of these shameful passions you are so good harry and so kind you at least can be a womans friend and do you know i think you make the others more ugly by comparison  it is you said harry gallantly who are so kind to me you treat me like  like a mother interposed lady vandeleur i try to be a mother to you or at least she corrected herself with a smile almost a mother i am afraid i am too young to be your mother really let us say a frienda dear friend  she paused long enough to let her words take effect in harrys sentimental quarters but not long enough to allow him a reply  but all this is beside our purpose she resumed you will find a bandbox in the lefthand side of the oak wardrobe it is underneath the pink slip that i wore on wednesday with my mechlin you will take it immediately to this address and she gave him a paper but do not on any account let it out of your hands until you have received a receipt written by myself do you understand answer if you pleaseanswer this is extremely important and i must ask you to pay some attention  harry pacified her by repeating her instructions perfectly and she was just going to tell him more when general vandeleur flung into the apartment scarlet with anger and holding a long and elaborate milliners bill in his hand  will you look at this madam cried he will you have the goodness to look at this document i know well enough you married me for my money and i hope i can make as great allowances as any other man in the service but as sure as god made me i mean to put a period to this disreputable prodigality  mr hartley said lady vandeleur i think you understand what you have to do may i ask you to see to it at once  stop said the general addressing harry one word before you go and then turning again to lady vandeleur what is this precious fellows errand he demanded i trust him no further than i do yourself let me tell you if he had as much as the rudiments of honesty he would scorn to stay in this house and what he does for his wages is a mystery to all the world what is his errand madam and why are you hurrying him away  i supposed you had something to say to me in private replied the lady  you spoke about an errand insisted the general do not attempt to deceive me in my present state of temper you certainly spoke about an errand  if you insist on making your servants privy to our humiliating dissensions replied lady vandeleur perhaps i had better ask mr hartley to sit down no she continued then you may go mr hartley i trust you may remember all that you have heard in this room it may be useful to you  harry at once made his escape from the drawingroom and as he ran upstairs he could hear the generals voice upraised in declamation and the thin tones of lady vandeleur planting icy repartees at every opening how cordially he admired the wife how skilfully she could evade an awkward question with what secure effrontery she repeated her instructions under the very guns of the enemy and on the other hand how he detested the husband  there had been nothing unfamiliar in the mornings events for he was continually in the habit of serving lady vandeleur on secret missions principally connected with millinery there was a skeleton in the house as he well knew the bottomless extravagance and the unknown liabilities of the wife had long since swallowed her own fortune and threatened day by day to engulf that of the husband once or twice in every year exposure and ruin seemed imminent and harry kept trotting round to all sorts of furnishers shops telling small fibs and paying small advances on the gross amount until another term was tided over and the lady and her faithful secretary breathed again for harry in a double capacity was heart and soul upon that side of the war not only did he adore lady vandeleur and fear and dislike her husband but he naturally sympathised with the love of finery and his own single extravagance was at the tailors  he found the bandbox where it had been described arranged his toilette with care and left the house the sun shone brightly the distance he had to travel was considerable and he remembered with dismay that the generals sudden irruption had prevented lady vandeleur from giving him money for a cab on this sultry day there was every chance that his complexion would suffer severely and to walk through so much of london with a bandbox on his arm was a humiliation almost insupportable to a youth of his character he paused and took counsel with himself the vandeleurs lived in eaton place his destination was near notting hill plainly he might cross the park by keeping well in the open and avoiding populous alleys and he thanked his stars when he reflected that it was still comparatively early in the day  anxious to be rid of his incubus he walked somewhat faster than his ordinary and he was already some way through kensington gardens when in a solitary spot among trees he found himself confronted by the general  i beg your pardon sir thomas observed harry politely falling on one side for the other stood directly in his path  where are you going sir asked the general  i am taking a little walk among the trees replied the lad  the general struck the bandbox with his cane  with that thing he cried you lie sir and you know you lie  indeed sir thomas returned harry i am not accustomed to be questioned in so high a key  you do not understand your position said the general you are my servant and a servant of whom i have conceived the most serious suspicions how do i know but that your box is full of teaspoons  it contains a silk hat belonging to a friend said harry  very well replied general vandeleur then i want to see your friends silk hat i have he added grimly a singular curiosity for hats and i believe you know me to be somewhat positive  i beg your pardon sir thomas i am exceedingly grieved harry apologised but indeed this is a private affair  the general caught him roughly by the shoulder with one hand while he raised his cane in the most menacing manner with the other harry gave himself up for lost but at the same moment heaven vouchsafed him an unexpected defender in the person of charlie pendragon who now strode forward from behind the trees  come come general hold your hand said he this is neither courteous nor manly  aha cried the general wheeling round upon his new antagonist mr pendragon and do you suppose mr pendragon that because i have had the misfortune to marry your sister i shall suffer myself to be dogged and thwarted by a discredited and bankrupt libertine like you my acquaintance with lady vandeleur sir has taken away all my appetite for the other members of her family  and do you fancy general vandeleur retorted charlie that because my sister has had the misfortune to marry you she there and then forfeited her rights and privileges as a lady i own sir that by that action she did as much as anybody could to derogate from her position but to me she is still a pendragon i make it my business to protect her from ungentlemanly outrage and if you were ten times her husband i would not permit her liberty to be restrained nor her private messengers to be violently arrested  how is that mr hartley interrogated the general mr pendragon is of my opinion it appears he too suspects that lady vandeleur has something to do with your friends silk hat  charlie saw that he had committed an unpardonable blunder which he hastened to repair  how sir he cried i suspect do you say i suspect nothing only where i find strength abused and a man brutalising his inferiors i take the liberty to interfere  as he said these words he made a sign to harry which the latter was too dull or too much troubled to understand  in what way am i to construe your attitude sir demanded vandeleur  why sir as you please returned pendragon  the general once more raised his cane and made a cut for charlies head but the latter lame foot and all evaded the blow with his umbrella ran in and immediately closed with his formidable adversary  run harry run he cried run you dolt  harry stood petrified for a moment watching the two men sway together in this fierce embrace then he turned and took to his heels when he cast a glance over his shoulder he saw the general prostrate under charlies knee but still making desperate efforts to reverse the situation and the gardens seemed to have filled with people who were running from all directions towards the scene of fight this spectacle lent the secretary wings and he did not relax his pace until he had gained the bayswater road and plunged at random into an unfrequented bystreet  to see two gentlemen of his acquaintance thus brutally mauling each other was deeply shocking to harry he desired to forget the sight he desired above all to put as great a distance as possible between himself and general vandeleur and in his eagerness for this he forgot everything about his destination and hurried before him headlong and trembling when he remembered that lady vandeleur was the wife of one and the sister of the other of these gladiators his heart was touched with sympathy for a woman so distressingly misplaced in life even his own situation in the generals household looked hardly so pleasing as usual in the light of these violent transactions  he had walked some little distance busied with these meditations before a slight collision with another passenger reminded him of the bandbox on his arm  heavens cried he where was my head and whither have i wandered  thereupon he consulted the envelope which lady vandeleur had given him the address was there but without a name harry was simply directed to ask for the gentleman who expected a parcel from lady vandeleur and if he were not at home to await his return the gentleman added the note should present a receipt in the handwriting of the lady herself all this seemed mightily mysterious and harry was above all astonished at the omission of the name and the formality of the receipt he had thought little of this last when he heard it dropped in conversation but reading it in cold blood and taking it in connection with the other strange particulars he became convinced that he was engaged in perilous affairs for half a moment he had a doubt of lady vandeleur herself for he found these obscure proceedings somewhat unworthy of so high a lady and became more critical when her secrets were preserved against himself but her empire over his spirit was too complete he dismissed his suspicions and blamed himself roundly for having so much as entertained them  in one thing however his duty and interest his generosity and his terrors coincidedto get rid of the bandbox with the greatest possible despatch  he accosted the first policeman and courteously inquired his way it turned out that he was already not far from his destination and a walk of a few minutes brought him to a small house in a lane freshly painted and kept with the most scrupulous attention the knocker and bellpull were highly polished flowering potherbs garnished the sills of the different windows and curtains of some rich material concealed the interior from the eyes of curious passengers the place had an air of repose and secrecy and harry was so far caught with this spirit that he knocked with more than usual discretion and was more than usually careful to remove all impurity from his boots  a servantmaid of some personal attractions immediately opened the door and seemed to regard the secretary with no unkind eyes  this is a parcel from lady vandeleur said harry  i know replied the maid with a nod but the gentleman is from home will you leave it with me  i cannot answered harry i am directed not to part with it but upon a certain condition and i must ask you i am afraid to let me wait  well said she i suppose i may let you wait i am lonely enough i can tell you and you do not look as though you would eat a girl but be sure and do not ask the gentlemans name for that i am not to tell you  do you say so cried harry why how strange but indeed for some time back i walk among surprises one question i think i may surely ask without indiscretion is he the master of this house  he is a lodger and not eight days old at that returned the maid and now a question for a question do you know lady vandeleur  i am her private secretary replied harry with a glow of modest pride  she is pretty is she not pursued the servant  oh beautiful cried harry wonderfully lovely and not less good and kind  you look kind enough yourself she retorted and i wager you are worth a dozen lady vandeleurs  harry was properly scandalised  i he cried i am only a secretary  do you mean that for me said the girl because i am only a housemaid if you please and then relenting at the sight of harrys obvious confusion i know you mean nothing of the sort she added and i like your looks but i think nothing of your lady vandeleur oh these mistresses she cried to send out a real gentleman like youwith a bandboxin broad day  during this talk they had remained in their original positionsshe on the doorstep he on the sidewalk bareheaded for the sake of coolness and with the bandbox on his arm but upon this last speech harry who was unable to support such pointblank compliments to his appearance nor the encouraging look with which they were accompanied began to change his attitude and glance from left to right in perturbation in so doing he turned his face towards the lower end of the lane and there to his indescribable dismay his eyes encountered those of general vandeleur the general in a prodigious fluster of heat hurry and indignation had been scouring the streets in chase of his brotherinlaw but so soon as he caught a glimpse of the delinquent secretary his purpose changed his anger flowed into a new channel and he turned on his heel and came tearing up the lane with truculent gestures and vociferations  harry made but one bolt of it into the house driving the maid before him and the door was slammed in his pursuers countenance  is there a bar will it lock asked harry while a salvo on the knocker made the house echo from wall to wall  why what is wrong with you asked the maid is it this old gentleman  if he gets hold of me whispered harry i am as good as dead he has been pursuing me all day carries a swordstick and is an indian military officer  these are fine manners cried the maid and what if you please may be his name  it is the general my master answered harry he is after this bandbox  did not i tell you cried the maid in triumph i told you i thought worse than nothing of your lady vandeleur and if you had an eye in your head you might see what she is for yourself an ungrateful minx i will be bound for that  the general renewed his attack upon the knocker and his passion growing with delay began to kick and beat upon the panels of the door  it is lucky observed the girl that i am alone in the house your general may hammer until he is weary and there is none to open for him follow me  so saying she led harry into the kitchen where she made him sit down and stood by him herself in an affectionate attitude with a hand upon his shoulder the din at the door so far from abating continued to increase in volume and at each blow the unhappy secretary was shaken to the heart  what is your name asked the girl  harry hartley he replied  mine she went on is prudence do you like it  very much said harry but hear for a moment how the general beats upon the door he will certainly break it in and then in heavens name what have i to look for but death  you put yourself very much about with no occasion answered prudence let your general knock he will do no more than blister his hands do you think i would keep you here if i were not sure to save you oh no i am a good friend to those that please me and we have a back door upon another lane but she added checking him for he had got upon his feet immediately on this welcome news but i will not show where it is unless you kiss me will you harry  that i will he cried remembering his gallantry not for your back door but because you are good and pretty  and he administered two or three cordial salutes which were returned to him in kind  then prudence led him to the back gate and put her hand upon the key  will you come and see me she asked  i will indeed said harry do not i owe you my life  and now she added opening the door run as hard as you can for i shall let in the general  harry scarcely required this advice fear had him by the forelock and he addressed himself diligently to flight a few steps and he believed he would escape from his trials and return to lady vandeleur in honour and safety but these few steps had not been taken before he heard a mans voice hailing him by name with many execrations and looking over his shoulder he beheld charlie pendragon waving him with both arms to return the shock of this new incident was so sudden and profound and harry was already worked into so high a state of nervous tension that he could think of nothing better than to accelerate his pace and continue running he should certainly have remembered the scene in kensington gardens he should certainly have concluded that where the general was his enemy charlie pendragon could be no other than a friend but such was the fever and perturbation of his mind that he was struck by none of these considerations and only continued to run the faster up the lane  charlie by the sound of his voice and the vile terms that he hurled after the secretary was obviously beside himself with rage he too ran his very best but try as he might the physical advantages were not upon his side and his outcries and the fall of his lame foot on the macadam began to fall farther and farther into the wake  harrys hopes began once more to arise the lane was both steep and narrow but it was exceedingly solitary bordered on either hand by garden walls overhung with foliage and for as far as the fugitive could see in front of him there was neither a creature moving nor an open door providence weary of persecution was now offering him an open field for his escape  alas as he came abreast of a garden door under a tuft of chestnuts it was suddenly drawn back and he could see inside upon a garden path the figure of a butchers boy with his tray upon his arm he had hardly recognised the fact before he was some steps beyond upon the other side but the fellow had had time to observe him he was evidently much surprised to see a gentleman go by at so unusual a pace and he came out into the lane and began to call after harry with shouts of ironical encouragement  his appearance gave a new idea to charlie pendragon who although he was now sadly out of breath once more upraised his voice  stop thief he cried  and immediately the butchers boy had taken up the cry and joined in the pursuit  this was a bitter moment for the hunted secretary it is true that his terror enabled him once more to improve his pace and gain with every step on his pursuers but he was well aware that he was near the end of his resources and should he meet any one coming the other way his predicament in the narrow lane would be desperate indeed  i must find a place of concealment he thought and that within the next few seconds or all is over with me in this world  scarcely had the thought crossed his mind than the lane took a sudden turning and he found himself hidden from his enemies there are circumstances in which even the least energetic of mankind learn to behave with vigour and decision and the most cautious forget their prudence and embrace foolhardy resolutions this was one of those occasions for harry hartley and those who knew him best would have been the most astonished at the lads audacity he stopped dead flung the bandbox over a garden wall and leaping upward with incredible agility and seizing the copestone with his hands he tumbled headlong after it into the garden  he came to himself a moment afterwards seated in a border of small rosebushes his hands and knees were cut and bleeding for the wall had been protected against such an escalade by a liberal provision of old bottles and he was conscious of a general dislocation and a painful swimming in the head facing him across the garden which was in admirable order and set with flowers of the most delicious perfume he beheld the back of a house it was of considerable extent and plainly habitable but in odd contrast to the grounds it was crazy illkept and of a mean appearance on all other sides the circuit of the garden wall appeared unbroken  he took in these features of the scene with mechanical glances but his mind was still unable to piece together or draw a rational conclusion from what he saw and when he heard footsteps advancing on the gravel although he turned his eyes in that direction it was with no thought either for defence or flight  the newcomer was a large coarse and very sordid personage in gardening clothes and with a wateringpot in his left hand one less confused would have been affected with some alarm at the sight of this mans huge proportions and black and lowering eyes but harry was too gravely shaken by his fall to be so much as terrified and if he was unable to divert his glances from the gardener he remained absolutely passive and suffered him to draw near to take him by the shoulder and to plant him roughly on his feet without a motion of resistance  for a moment the two stared into each others eyes harry fascinated the man filled with wrath and a cruel sneering humour  who are you he demanded at last who are you to come flying over my wall and break my gloire de dijons what is your name he added shaking him and what may be your business here  harry could not as much as proffer a word in explanation  but just at that moment pendragon and the butchers boy went clumping past and the sound of their feet and their hoarse cries echoed loudly in the narrow lane the gardener had received his answer and he looked down into harrys face with an obnoxious smile  a thief he said upon my word and a very good thing you must make of it for i see you dressed like a gentleman from top to toe are you not ashamed to go about the world in such a trim with honest folk i daresay glad to buy your castoff finery secondhand speak up you dog the man went on you can understand english i suppose and i mean to have a bit of talk with you before i march you to the station  indeed sir said harry this is all a dreadful misconception and if you will go with me to sir thomas vandeleurs in eaton place i can promise that all will be made plain the most upright person as i now perceive can be led into suspicious positions  my little man replied the gardener i will go with you no farther than the stationhouse in the next street the inspector no doubt will be glad to take a stroll with you as far as eaton place and have a bit of afternoon tea with your great acquaintances or would you prefer to go direct to the home secretary sir thomas vandeleur indeed perhaps you think i dont know a gentleman when i see one from a common runthehedge like you clothes or no clothes i can read you like a book here is a shirt that maybe cost as much as my sunday hat and that coat i take it has never seen the inside of ragfair and then your boots  the man whose eyes had fallen upon the ground stopped short in his insulting commentary and remained for a moment looking intently upon something at his feet when he spoke his voice was strangely altered  what in gods name said he is all this  harry following the direction of the mans eyes beheld a spectacle that struck him dumb with terror and amazement in his fall he had descended vertically upon the bandbox and burst it open from end to end thence a great treasure of diamonds had poured forth and now lay abroad part trodden in the soil part scattered on the surface in regal and glittering profusion there was a magnificent coronet which he had often admired on lady vandeleur there were rings and brooches eardrops and bracelets and even unset brilliants rolling here and there among the rosebushes like drops of morning dew a princely fortune lay between the two men upon the grounda fortune in the most inviting solid and durable form capable of being carried in an apron beautiful in itself and scattering the sunlight in a million rainbow flashes  good god said harry i am lost  his mind racked backwards into the past with the incalculable velocity of thought and he began to comprehend his days adventures to conceive them as a whole and to recognise the sad imbroglio in which his own character and fortunes had become involved he looked round him as if for help but he was alone in the garden with his scattered diamonds and his redoubtable interlocutor and when he gave ear there was no sound but the rustle of the leaves and the hurried pulsation of his heart it was little wonder if the young man felt himself deserted by his spirits and with a broken voice repeated his last ejaculation  i am lost  the gardener peered in all directions with an air of guilt but there was no face at any of the windows and he seemed to breathe again  pick up a heart he said you fool the worst of it is done why could you not say at first there was enough for two two he repeated ay and for two hundred but come away from here where we may be observed and for the love of wisdom straighten out your hat and brush your clothes you could not travel two steps the figure of fun you look just now  while harry mechanically adopted these suggestions the gardener getting upon his knees hastily drew together the scattered jewels and returned them to the bandbox the touch of these costly crystals sent a shiver of emotion through the mans stalwart frame his face was transfigured and his eyes shone with concupiscence indeed it seemed as if he luxuriously prolonged his occupation and dallied with every diamond that he handled at last however it was done and concealing the bandbox in his smock the gardener beckoned to harry and preceded him in the direction of the house  near the door they were met by a young man evidently in holy orders dark and strikingly handsome with a look of mingled weakness and resolution and very neatly attired after the manner of his caste the gardener was plainly annoyed by this encounter but he put as good a face upon it as he could and accosted the clergyman with an obsequious and smiling air  here is a fine afternoon mr rolles said he a fine afternoon as sure as god made it and here is a young friend of mine who had a fancy to look at my roses i took the liberty to bring him in for i thought none of the lodgers would object  speaking for myself replied the reverend mr rolles i do not nor do i fancy any of the rest of us would be more difficult upon so small a matter the garden is your own mr raeburn we must none of us forget that and because you give us liberty to walk there we should be indeed ungracious if we so far presumed upon your politeness as to interfere with the convenience of your friends but on second thoughts he added i believe that this gentleman and i have met before mr hartley i think i regret to observe that you have had a fall  and he offered his hand  a sort of maiden dignity and a desire to delay as long as possible the necessity for explanation moved harry to refuse this chance of help and to deny his own identity he chose the tender mercies of the gardener who was at least unknown to him rather than the curiosity and perhaps the doubts of an acquaintance  i fear there is some mistake said he my name is thomlinson and i am a friend of mr raeburns  indeed said mr rolles the likeness is amazing  mr raeburn who had been upon thorns throughout this colloquy now felt it high time to bring it to a period  i wish you a pleasant saunter sir said he  and with that he dragged harry after him into the house and then into a chamber on the garden his first care was to draw down the blind for mr rolles still remained where they had left him in an attitude of perplexity and thought then he emptied the broken bandbox on the table and stood before the treasure thus fully displayed with an expression of rapturous greed and rubbing his hands upon his thighs for harry the sight of the mans face under the influence of this base emotion added another pang to those he was already suffering it seemed incredible that from his life of pure and delicate trifling he should be plunged in a breath among sordid and criminal relations he could reproach his conscience with no sinful act and yet he was now suffering the punishment of sin in its most acute and cruel formsthe dread of punishment the suspicions of the good and the companionship and contamination of vile and brutal natures he felt he could lay his life down with gladness to escape from the room and the society of mr raeburn  and now said the latter after he had separated the jewels into two nearly equal parts and drawn one of them nearer to himself and now said he everything in this world has to be paid for and some things sweetly you must know mr hartley if such be your name that i am a man of a very easy temper and goodnature has been my stumblingblock from first to last i could pocket the whole of these pretty pebbles if i chose and i should like to see you dare to say a word but i think i must have taken a liking to you for i declare i have not the heart to shave you so close so do you see in pure kind feeling i propose that we divide and these indicating the two heaps are the proportions that seem to me just and friendly do you see any objection mr hartley may i ask i am not the man to stick upon a brooch  but sir cried harry what you propose to me is impossible the jewels are not mine and i cannot share what is anothers no matter with whom nor in what proportions  they are not yours are they not returned raeburn and you could not share them with anybody couldnt you well now that is what i call a pity for here am i obliged to take you to the station the policethink of that he continued think of the disgrace for your respectable parents think he went on taking harry by the wrist think of the colonies and the day of judgment  i cannot help it wailed harry it is not my fault you will not come with me to eaton place  no replied the man i will not that is certain and i mean to divide these playthings with you here  and so saying he applied a sudden and severe torsion to the lads wrist  harry could not suppress a scream and the perspiration burst forth upon his face perhaps pain and terror quickened his intelligence but certainly at that moment the whole business flashed across him in another light and he saw that there was nothing for it but to accede to the ruffians proposal and trust to find the house and force him to disgorge under more favourable circumstances and when he himself was clear from all suspicion  i agree he said  there is a lamb sneered the gardener i thought you would recognise your interests at last this bandbox he continued i shall burn with my rubbish it is a thing that curious folk might recognise and as for you scrape up your gaieties and put them in your pocket  harry proceeded to obey raeburn watching him and every now and again his greed rekindled by some bright scintillation abstracting another jewel from the secretarys share and adding it to his own  when this was finished both proceeded to the front door which raeburn cautiously opened to observe the street this was apparently clear of passengers for he suddenly seized harry by the nape of the neck and holding his face downward so that he could see nothing but the roadway and the door steps of the houses pushed him violently before him down one street and up another for the space of perhaps a minute and a half harry had counted three corners before the bully relaxed his grasp and crying now be off with you sent the lad flying headforemost with a welldirected and athletic kick  when harry gathered himself up halfstunned and bleeding freely at the nose mr raeburn had entirely disappeared for the first time anger and pain so completely overcame the lads spirits that he burst into a fit of tears and remained sobbing in the middle of the road  after he had thus somewhat assuaged his emotion he began to look about him and read the names of the streets at whose intersection he had been deserted by the gardener he was still in an unfrequented portion of west london among villas and large gardens but he could see some persons at a window who had evidently witnessed his misfortune and almost immediately after a servant came running from the house and offered him a glass of water at the same time a dirty rogue who had been slouching somewhere in the neighbourhood drew near him from the other side  poor fellow said the maid how vilely you have been handled to be sure why your knees are all cut and your clothes ruined do you know the wretch who used you so  that i do cried harry who was somewhat refreshed by the water and shall run him home in spite of his precautions he shall pay dearly for this days work i promise you  you had better come into the house and have yourself washed and brushed continued the maid my mistress will make you welcome never fear and see i will pick up your hat why love of mercy she screamed if you have not dropped diamonds all over the street  such was the case a good half of what remained to him after the depredations of mr raeburn had been shaken out of his pockets by the summersault and once more lay glittering on the ground he blessed his fortune that the maid had been so quick of eye there is nothing so bad but it might be worse thought he and the recovery of these few seemed to him almost as great an affair as the loss of all the rest but alas as he stooped to pick up his treasures the loiterer made a rapid onslaught overset both harry and the maid with a movement of his arms swept up a doublehandful of the diamonds and made off along the street with an amazing swiftness  harry as soon as he could get upon his feet gave chase to the miscreant with many cries but the latter was too fleet of foot and probably too well acquainted with the locality for turn where the pursuer would he could find no traces of the fugitive  in the deepest despondency harry revisited the scene of his mishap where the maid who was still waiting very honestly returned him his hat and the remainder of the fallen diamonds harry thanked her from his heart and being now in no humour for economy made his way to the nearest cabstand and set off for eaton place by coach  the house on his arrival seemed in some confusion as if a catastrophe had happened in the family and the servants clustered together in the hall and were unable or perhaps not altogether anxious to suppress their merriment at the tatterdemalion figure of the secretary he passed them with as good an air of dignity as he could assume and made directly for the boudoir when he opened the door an astonishing and even menacing spectacle presented itself to his eyes for he beheld the general and his wife and of all people charlie pendragon closeted together and speaking with earnestness and gravity on some important subject harry saw at once that there was little left for him to explainplenary confession had plainly been made to the general of the intended fraud upon his pocket and the unfortunate miscarriage of the scheme and they had all made common cause against a common danger  thank heaven cried lady vandeleur here he is the bandbox harrythe bandbox  but harry stood before them silent and downcast  speak she cried speak where is the bandbox  and the men with threatening gestures repeated the demand  harry drew a handful of jewels from his pocket he was very white  this is all that remains said he i declare before heaven it was through no fault of mine and if you will have patience although some are lost i am afraid for ever others i am sure may be still recovered  alas cried lady vandeleur all our diamonds are gone and i owe ninety thousand pounds for dress  madam said the general you might have paved the gutter with your own trash you might have made debts to fifty times the sum you mention you might have robbed me of my mothers coronet and ring and nature might have still so far prevailed that i could have forgiven you at last but madam you have taken the rajahs diamondthe eye of light as the orientals poetically termed itthe pride of kashgar you have taken from me the rajahs diamond he cried raising his hands and all madam all is at an end between us  believe me general vandeleur she replied that is one of the most agreeable speeches that ever i heard from your lips and since we are to be ruined i could almost welcome the change if it delivers me from you you have told me often enough that i married you for your money let me tell you now that i always bitterly repented the bargain and if you were still marriageable and had a diamond bigger than your head i should counsel even my maid against a union so uninviting and disastrousas for you mr hartley she continued turning on the secretary you have sufficiently exhibited your valuable qualities in this house we are now persuaded that you equally lack manhood sense and selfrespect and i can see only one course open for youto withdraw instanter and if possible return no more for your wages you may rank as a creditor in my late husbands bankruptcy  harry had scarcely comprehended this insulting address before the general was down upon him with another  and in the meantime said that personage follow me before the nearest inspector of police you may impose upon a simpleminded soldier sir but the eye of the law will read your disreputable secret if i must spend my old age in poverty through your underhand intriguing with my wife i mean at least that you shall not remain unpunished for your pains and god sir will deny me a very considerable satisfaction if you do not pick oakum from now until your dying day  with that the general dragged harry from the apartment and hurried him downstairs and along the street to the policestation of the district   here says my arabian author ended this deplorable business of the bandbox but to the unfortunate secretary the whole affair was the beginning of a new and manlier life the police were easily persuaded of his innocence and after he had given what help he could in the subsequent investigations he was even complimented by one of the chiefs of the detective department on the probity and simplicity of his behaviour several persons interested themselves in one so unfortunate and soon after he inherited a sum of money from a maiden aunt in worcestershire with this he married prudence and set sail for bendigo or according to another account for trincomalee exceedingly content and with the best of prospects   story of the young man in holy orders  the reverend mr simon rolles had distinguished himself in the moral sciences and was more than usually proficient in the study of divinity his essay on the christian doctrine of the social obligations obtained for him at the moment of its production a certain celebrity in the university of oxford and it was understood in clerical and learned circles that young mr rolles had in contemplation a considerable worka folio it was saidon the authority of the fathers of the church these attainments these ambitious designs however were far from helping him to any preferment and he was still in quest of his first curacy when a chance ramble in that part of london the peaceful and rich aspect of the garden a desire for solitude and study and the cheapness of the lodging led him to take up his abode with mr raeburn the nurseryman of stockdove lane  it was his habit every afternoon after he had worked seven or eight hours on st ambrose or st chrysostom to walk for a while in meditation among the roses and this was usually one of the most productive moments of his day but even a sincere appetite for thought and the excitement of grave problems awaiting solution are not always sufficient to preserve the mind of the philosopher against the petty shocks and contacts of the world and when mr rolles found general vandeleurs secretary ragged and bleeding in the company of his landlord when he saw both change colour and seek to avoid his questions and above all when the former denied his own identity with the most unmoved assurance he speedily forgot the saints and fathers in the vulgar interest of curiosity  i cannot be mistaken thought he that is mr hartley beyond a doubt how comes he in such a pickle why does he deny his name and what can be his business with that blacklooking ruffian my landlord  as he was thus reflecting another peculiar circumstance attracted his attention the face of mr raeburn appeared at a low window next the door and as chance directed his eyes met those of mr rolles the nurseryman seemed disconcerted and even alarmed and immediately after the blind of the apartment was pulled sharply down  this may all be very well reflected mr rolles it may be all excellently well but i confess freely that i do not think so suspicious underhand untruthful fearful of observationi believe upon my soul he thought the pair are plotting some disgraceful action  the detective that there is in all of us awoke and became clamant in the bosom of mr rolles and with a brisk eager step that bore no resemblance to his usual gait he proceeded to make the circuit of the garden when he came to the scene of harrys escalade his eye was at once arrested by a broken rosebush and marks of trampling on the mould he looked up and saw scratches on the brick and a rag of trouser floating from a broken bottle this then was the mode of entrance chosen by mr raeburns particular friend it was thus that general vandeleurs secretary came to admire a flowergarden the young clergyman whistled softly to himself as he stooped to examine the ground he could make out where harry had landed from his perilous leap he recognised the flat foot of mr raeburn where it had sunk deeply in the soil as he pulled up the secretary by the collar nay on a closer inspection he seemed to distinguish the marks of groping fingers as though something had been spilt abroad and eagerly collected  upon my word he thought the thing grows vastly interesting  and just then he caught sight of something almost entirely buried in the earth in an instant he had disinterred a dainty morocco case ornamented and clasped in gilt it had been trodden heavily underfoot and thus escaped the hurried search of mr raeburn mr rolles opened the case and drew a long breath of almost horrified astonishment for there lay before him in a cradle of green velvet a diamond of prodigious magnitude and of the finest water it was of the bigness of a ducks egg beautifully shaped and without a flaw and as the sun shone upon it it gave forth a lustre like that of electricity and seemed to burn in his hand with a thousand internal fires  he knew little of precious stones but the rajahs diamond was a wonder that explained itself a village child if he found it would run screaming for the nearest cottage and a savage would prostrate himself in adoration before so imposing a fetich the beauty of the stone flattered the young clergymans eyes the thought of its incalculable value overpowered his intellect he knew that what he held in his hand was worth more than many years purchase of an archiepiscopal see that it would build cathedrals more stately than ely or cologne that he who possessed it was set free for ever from the primal curse and might follow his own inclinations without concern or hurry without let or hindrance and as he suddenly turned it the rays leaped forth again with renewed brilliancy and seemed to pierce his very heart  decisive actions are often taken in a moment and without any conscious deliverance from the rational parts of man so it was now with mr rolles he glanced hurriedly round beheld like mr raeburn before him nothing but the sunlit flowergarden the tall treetops and the house with blinded windows and in a trice he had shut the case thrust it into his pocket and was hastening to his study with the speed of guilt  the reverend simon rolles had stolen the rajahs diamond  early in the afternoon the police arrived with harry hartley the nurseryman who was beside himself with terror readily discovered his hoard and the jewels were identified and inventoried in the presence of the secretary as for mr rolles he showed himself in a most obliging temper communicated what he knew with freedom and professed regret that he could do no more to help the officers in their duty  still he added i suppose your business is nearly at an end  by no means replied the man from scotland yard and he narrated the second robbery of which harry had been the immediate victim and gave the young clergyman a description of the more important jewels that were still not found dilating particularly on the rajahs diamond  it must be worth a fortune observed mr rolles  ten fortunestwenty fortunes cried the officer  the more it is worth remarked simon shrewdly the more difficult it must be to sell such a thing has a physiognomy not to be disguised and i should fancy a man might as easily negotiate st pauls cathedral  oh truly said the officer but if the thief be a man of any intelligence he will cut it into three or four and there will be still enough to make him rich  thank you said the clergyman you cannot imagine how much your conversation interests me  whereupon the functionary admitted that they knew many strange things in his profession and immediately after took his leave  mr rolles regained his apartment it seemed smaller and barer than usual the materials for his great work had never presented so little interest and he looked upon his library with the eye of scorn he took down volume by volume several fathers of the church and glanced them through but they contained nothing to his purpose  these old gentlemen thought he are no doubt very valuable writers but they seem to me conspicuously ignorant of life here am i with learning enough to be a bishop and i positively do not know how to dispose of a stolen diamond i glean a hint from a common policeman and with all my folios i cannot so much as put it into execution this inspires me with very low ideas of university training  herewith he kicked over his bookshelf and putting on his hat hastened from the house to the club of which he was a member in such a place of mundane resort he hoped to find some man of good counsel and a shrewd experience in life in the readingroom he saw many of the country clergy and an archdeacon there were three journalists and a writer upon the higher metaphysic playing pool and at dinner only the raff of ordinary club frequenters showed their commonplace and obliterated countenances none of these thought mr rolles would know more on dangerous topics than he knew himself none of them were fit to give him guidance in his present strait at length in the smokingroom up many weary stairs he hit upon a gentleman of somewhat portly build and dressed with conspicuous plainness he was smoking a cigar and reading the fortnightly review his face was singularly free from all sign of preoccupation or fatigue and there was something in his air which seemed to invite confidence and to expect submission the more the young clergyman scrutinised his features the more he was convinced that he had fallen on one capable of giving pertinent advice  sir said he you will excuse my abruptness but i judge you from your appearance to be preeminently a man of the world  i have indeed considerable claims to that distinction replied the stranger laying aside his magazine with a look of mingled amusement and surprise  i sir continued the curate am a recluse a student a creature of inkbottles and patristic folios a recent event has brought my folly vividly before my eyes and i desire to instruct myself in life by life he added i do not mean thackerays novels but the crimes and secret possibilities of our society and the principles of wise conduct among exceptional events i am a patient reader can the thing be learnt in books  you put me in a difficulty said the stranger i confess i have no great notion of the use of books except to amuse a railway journey although i believe there are some very exact treatises on astronomy the use of the globes agriculture and the art of making paperflowers upon the less apparent provinces of life i fear you will find nothing truthful yet stay he added have you read gaboriau  mr rolles admitted that he had never even heard the name  you may gather some notions from gaboriau resumed the stranger he is at least suggestive and as he is an author much studied by prince bismarck you will at the worst lose your time in good society  sir said the curate i am infinitely obliged by your politeness  you have already more than repaid me returned the other  how inquired simon  by the novelty of your request replied the gentleman and with a polite gesture as though to ask permission he resumed the study of the fortnightly review  on his way home mr rolles purchased a work on precious stones and several of gaboriaus novels these last he eagerly skimmed until an advanced hour in the morning but although they introduced him to many new ideas he could nowhere discover what to do with a stolen diamond he was annoyed moreover to find the information scattered amongst romantic storytelling instead of soberly set forth after the manner of a manual and he concluded that even if the writer had thought much upon these subjects he was totally lacking in educational method for the character and attainments of lecoq however he was unable to contain his admiration  he was truly a great creature ruminated mr rolles he knew the world as i know paleys evidences there was nothing that he could not carry to a termination with his own hand and against the largest odds heavens he broke out suddenly is not this the lesson must i not learn to cut diamonds for myself  it seemed to him as if he had sailed at once out of his perplexities he remembered that he knew a jeweller one b macculloch in edinburgh who would be glad to put him in the way of the necessary training a few months perhaps a few years of sordid toil and he would be sufficiently expert to divide and sufficiently cunning to dispose with advantage of the rajahs diamond that done he might return to pursue his researches at leisure a wealthy and luxurious student envied and respected by all golden visions attended him through his slumber and he awoke refreshed and lighthearted with the morning sun  mr raeburns house was on that day to be closed by the police and this afforded a pretext for his departure he cheerfully prepared his baggage transported it to kings cross where he left it in the cloakroom and returned to the club to while away the afternoon and dine  if you dine here today rolles observed an acquaintance you may see two of the most remarkable men in englandprince florizel of bohemia and old jack vandeleur  i have heard of the prince replied mr rolles and general vandeleur i have even met in society  general vandeleur is an ass returned the other this is his brother john the biggest adventurer the best judge of precious stones and one of the most acute diplomatists in europe have you never heard of his duel with the duc de val dorge of his exploits and atrocities when he was dictator of paraguay of his dexterity in recovering sir samuel levis jewellery nor of his services in the indian mutinyservices by which the government profited but which the government dared not recognise you make me wonder what we mean by fame or even by infamy for jack vandeleur has prodigious claims to both run downstairs he continued take a table near them and keep your ears open you will hear some strange talk or i am much misled  but how shall i know them inquired the clergyman  know them cried his friend why the prince is the finest gentleman in europe the only living creature who looks like a king and as for jack vandeleur if you can imagine ulysses at seventy years of age and with a sabrecut across his face you have the man before you know them indeed why you could pick either of them out of a derby day  rolles eagerly hurried to the diningroom it was as his friend had asserted it was impossible to mistake the pair in question old john vandeleur was of a remarkable force of body and obviously broken to the most difficult exercises he had neither the carriage of a swordsman nor of a sailor nor yet of one much inured to the saddle but something made up of all these and the result and expression of many different habits and dexterities his features were bold and aquiline his expression arrogant and predatory his whole appearance that of a swift violent unscrupulous man of action and his copious white hair and the deep sabrecut that traversed his nose and temple added a note of savagery to a head already remarkable and menacing in itself  in his companion the prince of bohemia mr rolles was astonished to recognise the gentleman who had recommended him the study of gaboriau doubtless prince florizel who rarely visited the club of which as of most others he was an honorary member had been waiting for john vandeleur when simon accosted him on the previous evening  the other diners had modestly retired into the angles of the room and left the distinguished pair in a certain isolation but the young clergyman was unrestrained by any sentiment of awe and marching boldly up took his place at the nearest table  the conversation was indeed new to the students ears the exdictator of paraguay stated many extraordinary experiences in different quarters of the world and the prince supplied a commentary which to a man of thought was even more interesting than the events themselves two forms of experience were thus brought together and laid before the young clergyman and he did not know which to admire the mostthe desperate actor or the skilled expert in life the man who spoke boldly of his own deeds and perils or the man who seemed like a god to know all things and to have suffered nothing the manner of each aptly fitted with his part in the discourse the dictator indulged in brutalities alike of speech and gesture his hand opened and shut and fell roughly on the table and his voice was loud and heady the prince on the other hand seemed the very type of urbane docility and quiet the least movement the least inflection had with him a weightier significance than all the shouts and pantomime of his companion and if ever as must frequently have been the case he described some experience personal to himself it was so aptly dissimulated as to pass unnoticed with the rest  at length the talk wandered on to the late robberies and the rajahs diamond  that diamond would be better in the sea observed prince florizel  as a vandeleur replied the dictator your highness may imagine my dissent  i speak on grounds of public policy pursued the prince jewels so valuable should be reserved for the collection of a prince or the treasury of a great nation to hand them about among the common sort of men is to set a price on virtues head and if the rajah of kashgara prince i understand of great enlightenmentdesired vengeance upon the men of europe he could hardly have gone more efficaciously about his purpose than by sending us this apple of discord there is no honesty too robust for such a trial i myself who have many duties and many privileges of my owni myself mr vandeleur could scarce handle the intoxicating crystal and be safe as for you who are a diamondhunter by taste and profession i do not believe there is a crime in the calendar you would not perpetratei do not believe you have a friend in the world whom you would not eagerly betrayi do not know if you have a family but if you have i declare you would sacrifice your childrenand all this for what not to be richer nor to have more comforts or more respect but simply to call this diamond yours for a year or two until you die and now and again to open a safe and look at it as one looks at a picture  it is true replied vandeleur i have hunted most things from men and women down to mosquitoes i have dived for coral i have followed both whales and tigers and a diamond is the tallest quarry of the lot it has beauty and worth it alone can properly reward the ardours of the chase at this moment as your highness may fancy i am upon the trail i have a sure knack a wide experience i know every stone of price in my brothers collection as a shepherd knows his sheep and i wish i may die if i do not recover them every one  sir thomas vandeleur will have great cause to thank you said the prince  i am not so sure returned the dictator with a laugh one of the vandeleurs will thomas or johnpeter or paulwe are all apostles  i did not catch your observation said the prince with some disgust  and at the same moment the waiter informed mr vandeleur that his cab was at the door  mr rolles glanced at the clock and saw that he also must be moving and the coincidence struck him sharply and unpleasantly for he desired to see no more of the diamondhunter  much study having somewhat shaken the young mans nerves he was in the habit of travelling in the most luxurious manner and for the present journey he had taken a sofa in the sleeping carriage  you will be very comfortable said the guard there is no one in your compartment and only one old gentleman in the other end  it was close upon the hour and the tickets were being examined when mr rolles beheld this other fellowpassenger ushered by several porters into his place certainly there was not another man in the world whom he would not have preferredfor it was old john vandeleur the exdictator  the sleeping carriages on the great northern line were divided into three compartmentsone at each end for travellers and one in the centre fitted with the conveniences of a lavatory a door running in grooves separated each of the others from the lavatory but as there were neither bolts nor locks the whole suite was practically common ground  when mr rolles had studied his position he perceived himself without defence if the dictator chose to pay him a visit in the course of the night he could do no less than receive it he had no means of fortification and lay open to attack as if he had been lying in the fields this situation caused him some agony of mind he recalled with alarm the boastful statements of his fellowtraveller across the diningtable and the professions of immorality which he had heard him offering to the disgusted prince some persons he remembered to have read are endowed with a singular quickness of perception for the neighbourhood of precious metals through walls and even at considerable distances they are said to divine the presence of gold might it not be the same with diamonds he wondered and if so who was more likely to enjoy this transcendental sense than the person who gloried in the appellation of the diamond hunter from such a man he recognised that he had everything to fear and longed eagerly for the arrival of the day  in the meantime he neglected no precaution concealed his diamond in the most internal pocket of a system of greatcoats and devoutly recommended himself to the care of providence  the train pursued its usual even and rapid course and nearly half the journey had been accomplished before slumber began to triumph over uneasiness in the breast of mr rolles for some time he resisted its influence but it grew upon him more and more and a little before york he was fain to stretch himself upon one of the couches and suffer his eyes to close and almost at the same instant consciousness deserted the young clergyman his last thought was of his terrifying neighbour  when he awoke it was still pitch dark except for the flicker of the veiled lamp and the continual roaring and oscillation testified to the unrelaxed velocity of the train he sat upright in a panic for he had been tormented by the most uneasy dreams it was some seconds before he recovered his selfcommand and even after he had resumed a recumbent attitude sleep continued to flee him and he lay awake with his brain in a state of violent agitation and his eyes fixed upon the lavatory door he pulled his clerical felt hat over his brow still further to shield him from the light and he adopted the usual expedients such as counting a thousand or banishing thought by which experienced invalids are accustomed to woo the approach of sleep in the case of mr rolles they proved one and all vain he was harassed by a dozen different anxietiesthe old man in the other end of the carriage haunted him in the most alarming shapes and in whatever attitude he chose to lie the diamond in his pocket occasioned him a sensible physical distress it burned it was too large it bruised his ribs and there were infinitesimal fractions of a second in which he had half a mind to throw it from the window  while he was thus lying a strange incident took place  the slidingdoor into the lavatory stirred a little and then a little more and was finally drawn back for the space of about twenty inches the lamp in the lavatory was unshaded and in the lighted aperture thus disclosed mr rolles could see the head of mr vandeleur in an attitude of deep attention he was conscious that the gaze of the dictator rested intently on his own face and the instinct of selfpreservation moved him to hold his breath to refrain from the least movement and keeping his eyes lowered to watch his visitor from underneath the lashes after about a moment the head was withdrawn and the door of the lavatory replaced  the dictator had not come to attack but to observe his action was not that of a man threatening another but that of a man who was himself threatened if mr rolles was afraid of him it appeared that he in his turn was not quite easy on the score of mr rolles he had come it would seem to make sure that his only fellowtraveller was asleep and when satisfied on that point he had at once withdrawn  the clergyman leaped to his feet the extreme of terror had given place to a reaction of foolhardy daring he reflected that the rattle of the flying train concealed all other sounds and determined come what might to return the visit he had just received divesting himself of his cloak which might have interfered with the freedom of his action he entered the lavatory and paused to listen as he had expected there was nothing to be heard above the roar of the trains progress and laying his hand on the door at the farther side he proceeded cautiously to draw it back for about six inches then he stopped and could not contain an ejaculation of surprise  john vandeleur wore a fur travellingcap with lappets to protect his ears and this may have combined with the sound of the express to keep him in ignorance of what was going forward it is certain at least that he did not raise his head but continued without interruption to pursue his strange employment between his feet stood an open hatbox in one hand he held the sleeve of his sealskin greatcoat in the other a formidable knife with which he had just slit up the lining of the sleeve mr rolles had read of persons carrying money in a belt and as he had no acquaintance with any but cricketbelts he had never been able rightly to conceive how this was managed but here was a stranger thing before his eyes for john vandeleur it appeared carried diamonds in the lining of his sleeve and even as the young clergyman gazed he could see one glittering brilliant drop after another into the hatbox  he stood riveted to the spot following this unusual business with his eyes the diamonds were for the most part small and not easily distinguishable either in shape or fire suddenly the dictator appeared to find a difficulty he employed both hands and stooped over his task but it was not until after considerable manoeuvring that he extricated a large tiara of diamonds from the lining and held it up for some seconds examination before he placed it with the others in the hatbox the tiara was a ray of light to mr rolles he immediately recognised it for a part of the treasure stolen from harry hartley by the loiterer there was no room for mistake it was exactly as the detective had described it there were the ruby stars with a great emerald in the centre there were the interlacing crescents and there were the pearshaped pendants each a single stone which gave a special value to lady vandeleurs tiara  mr rolles was hugely relieved the dictator was as deeply in the affair as he was neither could tell tales upon the other in the first glow of happiness the clergyman suffered a deep sigh to escape him and as his bosom had become choked and his throat dry during his previous suspense the sigh was followed by a cough  mr vandeleur looked up his face contracted with the blackest and most deadly passion his eyes opened widely and his under jaw dropped in an astonishment that was upon the brink of fury by an instinctive movement he had covered the hatbox with the coat for half a minute the two men stared upon each other in silence it was not a long interval but it sufficed for mr rolles he was one of those who think swiftly on dangerous occasions he decided on a course of action of a singularly daring nature and although he felt he was setting his life upon the hazard he was the first to break silence  i beg your pardon said he  the dictator shivered slightly and when he spoke his voice was hoarse  what do you want here he asked  i take a particular interest in diamonds replied mr rolles with an air of perfect selfpossession two connoisseurs should be acquainted i have here a trifle of my own which may perhaps serve for an introduction  and so saying he quietly took the case from his pocket showed the rajahs diamond to the dictator for an instant and replaced it in security  it was once your brothers he added  john vandeleur continued to regard him with a look of almost painful amazement but he neither spoke nor moved  i was pleased to observe resumed the young man that we have gems from the same collection  the dictators surprise overpowered him  i beg your pardon he said i begin to perceive that i am growing old i am positively not prepared for little incidents like this but set my mind at rest upon one point do my eyes deceive me or are you indeed a parson  i am in holy orders answered mr rolles  well cried the other as long as i live i will never hear another word against the cloth  you flatter me said mr rolles  pardon me replied vandeleur pardon me young man you are no coward but it still remains to be seen whether you are not the worst of fools perhaps he continued leaning back upon his seat perhaps you would oblige me with a few particulars i must suppose you had some object in the stupefying impudence of your proceedings and i confess i have a curiosity to know it  it is very simple replied the clergyman it proceeds from my great inexperience of life  i shall be glad to be persuaded answered vandeleur  whereupon mr rolles told him the whole story of his connection with the rajahs diamond from the time he found it in raeburns garden to the time when he left london in the flying scotchman he added a brief sketch of his feelings and thoughts during the journey and concluded in these words  when i recognised the tiara i knew we were in the same attitude towards society and this inspired me with a hope which i trust you will not say was illfounded that you might become in some sense my partner in the difficulties and of course the profits of my situation to one of your special knowledge and obviously great experience the negotiation of the diamond would give but little trouble while to me it was a matter of impossibility on the other part i judged that i might lose nearly as much by cutting the diamond and that not improbably with an unskilful hand as might enable me to pay you with proper generosity for your assistance the subject was a delicate one to broach and perhaps i fell short in delicacy but i must ask you to remember that for me the situation was a new one and i was entirely unacquainted with the etiquette in use i believe without vanity that i could have married or baptised you in a very acceptable manner but every man has his own aptitudes and this sort of bargain was not among the lists of my accomplishments  i do not wish to flatter you replied vandeleur but upon my word you have an unusual disposition for a life of crime you have more accomplishments than you imagine and though i have encountered a number of rogues in different quarters of the world i never met with one so unblushing as yourself cheer up mr rolles you are in the right profession at last as for helping you you may command me as you will i have only a days business in edinburgh on a little matter for my brother and once that is concluded i return to paris where i usually reside if you please you may accompany me thither and before the end of a month i believe i shall have brought your little business to a satisfactory conclusion   at this point contrary to all the canons of his art our arabian author breaks off the story of the young man in holy orders i regret and condemn such practices but i must follow my original and refer the reader for the conclusion of mr rolles adventures to the next number of the cycle   the story of the house with the green blinds  francis scrymgeour a clerk in the bank of scotland at edinburgh had attained the age of twentyfive in a sphere of quiet creditable and domestic life his mother died while he was young but his father a man of sense and probity had given him an excellent education at school and brought him up at home to orderly and frugal habits francis who was of a docile and affectionate disposition profited by these advantages with zeal and devoted himself heart and soul to his employment a walk upon saturday afternoon an occasional dinner with members of his family and a yearly tour of a fortnight in the highlands or even on the continent of europe were his principal distractions and he grew rapidly in favour with his superiors and enjoyed already a salary of nearly two hundred pounds a year with the prospect of an ultimate advance to almost double that amount few young men were more contented few more willing and laborious than francis scrymgeour sometimes at night when he had read the daily paper he would play upon the flute to amuse his father for whose qualities he entertained a great respect  one day he received a note from a wellknown firm of writers to the signet requesting the favour of an immediate interview with him the letter was marked private and confidential and had been addressed to him at the bank instead of at hometwo unusual circumstances which made him obey the summons with the more alacrity the senior member of the firm a man of much austerity of manner made him gravely welcome requested him to take a seat and proceeded to explain the matter in hand in the picked expressions of a veteran man of business a person who must remain nameless but of whom the lawyer had every reason to think wella man in short of some station in the countrydesired to make francis an annual allowance of five hundred pounds the capital was to be placed under the control of the lawyers firm and two trustees who must also remain anonymous there were conditions annexed to this liberality but he was of opinion that his new client would find nothing either excessive or dishonourable in the terms and he repeated these two words with emphasis as though he desired to commit himself to nothing more  francis asked their nature  the conditions said the writer to the signet are as i have twice remarked neither dishonourable nor excessive at the same time i cannot conceal from you that they are most unusual indeed the whole case is very much out of our way and i should certainly have refused it had it not been for the reputation of the gentleman who entrusted it to my care and let me add mr scrymgeour the interest i have been led to take in yourself by many complimentary and i have no doubt welldeserved reports  francis entreated him to be more specific  you cannot picture my uneasiness as to these conditions he said  they are two replied the lawyer only two and the sum as you will remember is five hundred a yearand unburdened i forgot to add unburdened  and the lawyer raised his eyebrows at him with solemn gusto  the first he resumed is of remarkable simplicity you must be in paris by the afternoon of sunday the 15th there you will find at the boxoffice of the com√©die fran√ßaise a ticket for admission taken in your name and waiting you you are requested to sit out the whole performance in the seat provided and that is all  i should certainly have preferred a weekday replied francis but after all once in a way  and in paris my dear sir added the lawyer soothingly i believe i am something of a precisian myself but upon such a consideration and in paris i should not hesitate an instant  and the pair laughed pleasantly together  the other is of more importance continued the writer to the signet it regards your marriage my client taking a deep interest in your welfare desires to advise you absolutely in the choice of a wife absolutely you understand he repeated  let us be more explicit if you please returned francis am i to marry any one maid or widow black or white whom this invisible person chooses to propose  i was to assure you that suitability of age and position should be a principle with your benefactor replied the lawyer as to race i confess the difficulty had not occurred to me and i failed to inquire but if you like i will make a note of it at once and advise you on the earliest opportunity  sir said francis it remains to be seen whether this whole affair is not a most unworthy fraud the circumstances are inexplicablei had almost said incredible and until i see a little more daylight and some plausible motive i confess i should be very sorry to put a hand to the transaction i appeal to you in this difficulty for information i must learn what is at the bottom of it all if you do not know cannot guess or are not at liberty to tell me i shall take my hat and go back to my bank as i came  i do not know answered the lawyer but i have an excellent guess your father and no one else is at the root of this apparently unnatural business  my father cried francis in extreme disdain worthy man i know every thought of his mind every penny of his fortune  you misinterpret my words said the lawyer i do not refer to mr scrymgeour senior for he is not your father when he and his wife came to edinburgh you were already nearly one year old and you had not yet been three months in their care the secret has been well kept but such is the fact your father is unknown and i say again that i believe him to be the original of the offers i am charged at present to transmit to you  it would be impossible to exaggerate the astonishment of francis scrymgeour at this unexpected information he pled this confusion to the lawyer  sir said he after a piece of news so startling you must grant me some hours for thought you shall know this evening what conclusion i have reached  the lawyer commended his prudence and francis excusing himself upon some pretext at the bank took a long walk into the country and fully considered the different steps and aspects of the case a pleasant sense of his own importance rendered him the more deliberate but the issue was from the first not doubtful his whole carnal man leaned irresistibly towards the five hundred a year and the strange conditions with which it was burdened he discovered in his heart an invincible repugnance to the name of scrymgeour which he had never hitherto disliked he began to despise the narrow and unromantic interests of his former life and when once his mind was fairly made up he walked with a new feeling of strength and freedom and nourished himself with the gayest anticipations  he said but a word to the lawyer and immediately received a cheque for two quarters arrears for the allowance was antedated from the first of january with this in his pocket he walked home the flat in scotland street looked mean in his eyes his nostrils for the first time rebelled against the odour of broth and he observed little defects of manner in his adoptive father which filled him with surprise and almost with disgust the next day he determined should see him on his way to paris  in that city where he arrived long before the appointed date he put up at a modest hotel frequented by english and italians and devoted himself to improvement in the french tongue for this purpose he had a master twice a week entered into conversation with loiterers in the champs elys√©es and nightly frequented the theatre he had his whole toilette fashionably renewed and was shaved and had his hair dressed every morning by a barber in a neighbouring street this gave him something of a foreign air and seemed to wipe off the reproach of his past years  at length on the saturday afternoon he betook himself to the boxoffice of the theatre in the rue richelieu no sooner had he mentioned his name than the clerk produced the order in an envelope of which the address was scarcely dry  it has been taken this moment said the clerk  indeed said francis may i ask what the gentleman was like  your friend is easy to describe replied the official he is old and strong and beautiful with white hair and a sabrecut across his face you cannot fail to recognise so marked a person  no indeed returned francis and i thank you for your politeness  he cannot yet be far distant added the clerk if you make haste you might still overtake him  francis did not wait to be twice told he ran precipitately from the theatre into the middle of the street and looked in all directions more than one whitehaired man was within sight but though he overtook each of them in succession all wanted the sabrecut for nearly half an hour he tried one street after another in the neighbourhood until at length recognising the folly of continued search he started on a walk to compose his agitated feelings for this proximity of an encounter with him to whom he could not doubt he owed the day had profoundly moved the young man  it chanced that his way lay up the rue drouot and thence up the rue des martyrs and chance in this case served him better than all the forethought in the world for on the outer boulevard he saw two men in earnest colloquy upon a seat one was dark young and handsome secularly dressed but with an indelible clerical stamp the other answered in every particular to the description given him by the clerk francis felt his heart beat high in his bosom he knew he was now about to hear the voice of his father and making a wide circuit he noiselessly took his place behind the couple in question who were too much interested in their talk to observe much else as francis had expected the conversation was conducted in the english language  your suspicions begin to annoy me rolles said the older man i tell you i am doing my utmost a man cannot lay his hand on millions in a moment have i not taken you up a mere stranger out of pure goodwill are you not living largely on my bounty  on your advances mr vandeleur corrected the other  advances if you choose and interest instead of goodwill if you prefer it returned vandeleur angrily i am not here to pick expressions business is business and your business let me remind you is too muddy for such airs trust me or leave me alone and find someone else but let us have an end for gods sake of your jeremiads  i am beginning to learn the world replied the other and i see that you have every reason to play me false and not one to deal honestly i am not here to pick expressions either you wish the diamond for yourself you know you doyou dare not deny it have you not already forged my name and searched my lodging in my absence i understand the cause of your delays you are lying in wait you are the diamondhunter forsooth and sooner or later by fair means or foul youll lay your hands upon it i tell you it must stop push me much further and i promise you a surprise  it does not become you to use threats returned vandeleur two can play at that my brother is here in paris the police are on the alert and if you persist in wearying me with your caterwauling i will arrange a little astonishment for you mr rolles but mine shall be once and for all do you understand or would you prefer me to tell it you in hebrew there is an end to all things and you have come to the end of my patience tuesday at seven not a day not an hour sooner not the least part of a second if it were to save your life and if you do not choose to wait you may go to the bottomless pit for me and welcome  and so saying the dictator arose from the bench and marched off in the direction of montmartre shaking his head and swinging his cane with a most furious air while his companion remained where he was in an attitude of great dejection  francis was at the pitch of surprise and horror his sentiments had been shocked to the last degree the hopeful tenderness with which he had taken his place upon the bench was transformed into repulsion and despair old mr scrymgeour he reflected was a far more kindly and creditable parent than this dangerous and violent intriguer but he retained his presence of mind and suffered not a moment to elapse before he was on the trail of the dictator  that gentlemans fury carried him forward at a brisk pace and he was so completely occupied in his angry thoughts that he never so much as cast a look behind him till he reached his own door  his house stood high up in the rue lepic commanding a view of all paris and enjoying the pure air of the heights it was two stories high with green blinds and shutters and all the windows looking on the street were hermetically closed tops of trees showed over the high garden wall and the wall was protected by chevauxdefrise the dictator paused a moment while he searched his pocket for a key and then opening a gate disappeared within the enclosure  francis looked about him the neighbourhood was very lonely the house isolated in its garden it seemed as if his observation must here come to an abrupt end a second glance however showed him a tall house next door presenting a gable to the garden and in this gable a single window he passed to the front and saw a ticket offering unfurnished lodgings by the month and on inquiry the room which commanded the dictators garden proved to be one of those to let francis did not hesitate a moment he took the room paid an advance upon the rent and returned to his hotel to seek his baggage  the old man with the sabrecut might or might not be his father he might or he might not be upon the true scent but he was certainly on the edge of an exciting mystery and he promised himself that he would not relax his observation until he had got to the bottom of the secret  from the window of his new apartment francis scrymgeour commanded a complete view into the garden of the house with the green blinds immediately below him a very comely chestnut with wide boughs sheltered a pair of rustic tables where people might dine in the height of summer on all sides save one a dense vegetation concealed the soil but there between the tables and the house he saw a patch of gravel walk leading from the verandah to the garden gate studying the place from between the boards of the venetian shutters which he durst not open for fear of attracting attention francis observed but little to indicate the manners of the inhabitants and that little argued no more than a close reserve and a taste for solitude the garden was conventual the house had the air of a prison the green blinds were all drawn down upon the outside the door into the verandah was closed the garden as far as he could see it was left entirely to itself in the evening sunshine a modest curl of smoke from a single chimney alone testified to the presence of living people  in order that he might not be entirely idle and to give a certain colour to his way of life francis had purchased euclids geometry in french which he set himself to copy and translate on the top of his portmanteau and seated on the floor against the wall for he was equally without chair or table from time to time he would rise and cast a glance into the enclosure of the house with the green blinds but the windows remained obstinately closed and the garden empty  only late in the evening did anything occur to reward his continued attention between nine and ten the sharp tinkle of a bell aroused him from a fit of dozing and he sprang to his observatory in time to hear an important noise of locks being opened and bars removed and to see mr vandeleur carrying a lantern and clothed in a flowing robe of black velvet with a skullcap to match issue from under the verandah and proceed leisurely towards the garden gate the sound of bolts and bars was then repeated and a moment after francis perceived the dictator escorting into the house in the mobile light of the lantern an individual of the lowest and most despicable appearance  half an hour afterwards the visitor was reconducted to the street and mr vandeleur setting his light upon one of the rustic tables finished a cigar with great deliberation under the foliage of the chestnut francis peering through a clear space among the leaves was able to follow his gestures as he threw away the ash or enjoyed a copious inhalation and beheld a cloud upon the old mans brow and a forcible action of the lips which testified to some deep and probably painful train of thought the cigar was already almost at an end when the voice of a young girl was heard suddenly crying the hour from the interior of the house  in a moment replied john vandeleur  and with that he threw away the stump and taking up the lantern sailed away under the verandah for the night as soon as the door was closed absolute darkness fell upon the house francis might try his eyesight as much as he pleased he could not detect so much as a single chink of light below a blind and he concluded with great good sense that the bedchambers were all upon the other side  early the next morning for he was early awake after an uncomfortable night upon the floor he saw cause to adopt a different explanation the blinds rose one after another by means of a spring in the interior and disclosed steel shutters such as we see on the front of shops these in their turn were rolled up by a similar contrivance and for the space of about an hour the chambers were left open to the morning air at the end of that time mr vandeleur with his own hand once more closed the shutters and replaced the blinds from within  while francis was still marvelling at these precautions the door opened and a young girl came forth to look about her in the garden it was not two minutes before she reentered the house but even in that short time he saw enough to convince him that she possessed the most unusual attractions his curiosity was not only highly excited by this incident but his spirits were improved to a still more notable degree the alarming manners and more than equivocal life of his father ceased from that moment to prey upon his mind from that moment he embraced his new family with ardour and whether the young lady should prove his sister or his wife he felt convinced she was an angel in disguise so much was this the case that he was seized with a sudden horror when he reflected how little he really knew and how possible it was that he had followed the wrong person when he followed mr vandeleur  the porter whom he consulted could afford him little information but such as it was it had a mysterious and questionable sound the person next door was an english gentleman of extraordinary wealth and proportionately eccentric in his tastes and habits he possessed great collections which he kept in the house beside him and it was to protect these that he had fitted the place with steel shutters elaborate fastenings and chevauxdefrise along the garden wall he lived much alone in spite of some strange visitors with whom it seemed he had business to transact and there was no one else in the house except mademoiselle and an old woman servant  is mademoiselle his daughter inquired francis  certainly replied the porter mademoiselle is the daughter of the house and strange it is to see how she is made to work for all his riches it is she who goes to market and every day in the week you may see her going by with a basket on her arm  and the collections asked the other  sir said the man they are immensely valuable more i cannot tell you since m de vandeleurs arrival no one in the quarter has so much as passed the door  suppose not returned francis you must surely have some notion what these famous galleries contain is it pictures silks statues jewels or what  my faith sir said the fellow with a shrug it might be carrots and still i could not tell you how should i know the house is kept like a garrison as you perceive  and then as francis was returning disappointed to his room the porter called him back  i have just remembered sir said he m de vandeleur has been in all parts of the world and i once heard the old woman declare that he had brought many diamonds back with him if that be the truth there must be a fine show behind those shutters  by an early hour on sunday francis was in his place at the theatre the seat which had been taken for him was only two or three numbers from the lefthand side and directly opposite one of the lower boxes as the seat had been specially chosen there was doubtless something to be learned from its position and he judged by an instinct that the box upon his right was in some way or other to be connected with the drama in which he ignorantly played a part indeed it was so situated that its occupants could safely observe him from beginning to end of the piece if they were so minded while profiting by the depth they could screen themselves sufficiently well from any counterexamination on his side he promised himself not to leave it for a moment out of sight and whilst he scanned the rest of the theatre or made a show of attending to the business of the stage he always kept a corner of an eye upon the empty box  the second act had been some time in progress and was even drawing towards a close when the door opened and two persons entered and ensconced themselves in the darkest of the shade francis could hardly control his emotion it was mr vandeleur and his daughter the blood came and went in his arteries and veins with stunning activity his ears sang his head turned he dared not look lest he should awake suspicion his playbill which he kept reading from end to end and over and over again turned from white to red before his eyes and when he cast a glance upon the stage it seemed incalculably far away and he found the voices and gestures of the actors to the last degree impertinent and absurd  from time to time he risked a momentary look in the direction which principally interested him and once at least he felt certain that his eyes encountered those of the young girl a shock passed over his body and he saw all the colours of the rainbow what would he not have given to overhear what passed between the vandeleurs what would he not have given for the courage to take up his operaglass and steadily inspect their attitude and expression there for aught he knew his whole life was being decidedand he not able to interfere not able even to follow the debate but condemned to sit and suffer where he was in impotent anxiety  at last the act came to an end the curtain fell and the people around him began to leave their places for the interval it was only natural that he should follow their example and if he did so it was not only natural but necessary that he should pass immediately in front of the box in question summoning all his courage but keeping his eyes lowered francis drew near the spot his progress was slow for the old gentleman before him moved with incredible deliberation wheezing as he went what was he to do should he address the vandeleurs by name as he went by should he take the flower from his buttonhole and throw it into the box should he raise his face and direct one long and affectionate look upon the lady who was either his sister or his betrothed as he found himself thus struggling among so many alternatives he had a vision of his old equable existence in the bank and was assailed by a thought of regret for the past  by this time he had arrived directly opposite the box and although he was still undetermined what to do or whether to do anything he turned his head and lifted his eyes no sooner had he done so than he uttered a cry of disappointment and remained rooted to the spot the box was empty during his slow advance mr vandeleur and his daughter had quietly slipped away  a polite person in his rear reminded him that he was stopping the path and he moved on again with mechanical footsteps and suffered the crowd to carry him unresisting out of the theatre once in the street the pressure ceasing he came to a halt and the cool night air speedily restored him to the possession of his faculties he was surprised to find that his head ached violently and that he remembered not one word of the two acts which he had witnessed as the excitement wore away it was succeeded by an overmastering appetite for sleep and he hailed a cab and drove to his lodging in a state of extreme exhaustion and some disgust of life  next morning he lay in wait for miss vandeleur on her road to market and by eight oclock beheld her stepping down a lane she was simply and even poorly attired but in the carriage of her head and body there was something flexible and noble that would have lent distinction to the meanest toilette even her basket so aptly did she carry it became her like an ornament it seemed to francis as he slipped into a doorway that the sunshine followed and the shadows fled before her as she walked and he was conscious for the first time of a bird singing in a cage above the lane  he suffered her to pass the doorway and then coming forth once more addressed her by name from behind  miss vandeleur said he  she turned and when she saw who he was became deadly pale  pardon me he continued heaven knows i had no will to startle you and indeed there should be nothing startling in the presence of one who wishes you so well as i do and believe me i am acting rather from necessity than choice we have many things in common and i am sadly in the dark there is much that i should be doing and my hands are tied i do not know even what to feel nor who are my friends and enemies  she found her voice with an effort  i do not know who you are she said  ah yes miss vandeleur you do returned francis better than i do myself indeed it is on that above all that i seek light tell me what you know he pleaded tell me who i am who you are and how our destinies are intermixed give me a little help with my life miss vandeleuronly a word or two to guide me only the name of my father if you willand i shall be grateful and content  i will not attempt to deceive you she replied i know who you are but i am not at liberty to say  tell me at least that you have forgiven my presumption and i shall wait with all the patience i have he said if i am not to know i must do without it is cruel but i can bear more upon a push only do not add to my troubles the thought that i have made an enemy of you  you did only what was natural she said and i have nothing to forgive you farewell  is it to be farewell he asked  nay that i do not know myself she answered farewell for the present if you like  and with these words she was gone  francis returned to his lodging in a state of considerable commotion of mind he made the most trifling progress with his euclid for that forenoon and was more often at the window than at his improvised writingtable but beyond seeing the return of miss vandeleur and the meeting between her and her father who was smoking a trichinopoli cigar in the verandah there was nothing notable in the neighbourhood of the house with the green blinds before the time of the midday meal the young man hastily allayed his appetite in a neighbouring restaurant and returned with the speed of unallayed curiosity to the house in the rue lepic a mounted servant was leading a saddlehorse to and fro before the garden wall and the porter of franciss lodging was smoking a pipe against the doorpost absorbed in contemplation of the livery and the steeds  look he cried to the young man what fine cattle what an elegant costume they belong to the brother of m de vandeleur who is now within upon a visit he is a great man a general in your country and you doubtless know him well by reputation  i confess returned francis that i have never heard of general vandeleur before we have many officers of that grade and my pursuits have been exclusively civil  it is he replied the porter who lost the great diamond of the indies of that at least you must have read often in the papers  as soon as francis could disengage himself from the porter he ran upstairs and hurried to the window immediately below the clear space in the chestnut leaves the two gentlemen were seated in conversation over a cigar the general a red militarylooking man offered some traces of a family resemblance to his brother he had something of the same features something although very little of the same free and powerful carriage but he was older smaller and more common in air his likeness was that of a caricature and he seemed altogether a poor and debile being by the side of the dictator  they spoke in tones so low leaning over the table with every appearance of interest that francis could catch no more than a word or two on an occasion for as little as he heard he was convinced that the conversation turned upon himself and his own career several times the name of scrymgeour reached his ear for it was easy to distinguish and still more frequently he fancied he could distinguish the name francis  at length the general as if in a hot anger broke forth into several violent exclamations  francis vandeleur he cried accentuating the last word francis vandeleur i tell you  the dictator made a movement of his whole body half affirmative half contemptuous but his answer was inaudible to the young man  was he the francis vandeleur in question he wondered were they discussing the name under which he was to be married or was the whole affair a dream and a delusion of his own conceit and selfabsorption  after another interval of inaudible talk dissension seemed again to rise between the couple underneath the chestnut and again the general raised his voice angrily so as to be audible to francis  my wife he cried i have done with my wife for good i will not hear her name i am sick of her very name  and he swore aloud and beat the table with his fist  the dictator appeared by his gestures to pacify him after a paternal fashion and a little after he conducted him to the garden gate the pair shook hands affectionately enough but as soon as the door had closed behind his visitor john vandeleur fell into a fit of laughter which sounded unkindly and even devilish in the ears of francis scrymgeour  so another day had passed and little more learnt but the young man remembered that the morrow was tuesday and promised himself some curious discoveries all might be well or all might be ill he was sure at least to glean some curious information and perhaps by good luck get at the heart of the mystery which surrounded his father and his family  as the hour of the dinner drew near many preparations were made in the garden of the house with the green blinds that table which was partly visible to francis through the chestnut leaves was destined to serve as a sideboard and carried relays of plates and the materials for salad the other which was almost entirely concealed had been set apart for the diners and francis could catch glimpses of white cloth and silver plate  mr rolles arrived punctual to the minute he looked like a man upon his guard and spoke low and sparingly the dictator on the other hand appeared to enjoy an unusual flow of spirits his laugh which was youthful and pleasant to hear sounded frequently from the garden by the modulation and the changes of his voice it was obvious that he told many droll stories and imitated the accents of a variety of different nations and before he and the young clergyman had finished their vermouth all feeling of distrust was at an end and they were talking together like a pair of school companions  at length miss vandeleur made her appearance carrying the souptureen mr rolles ran to offer her assistance which she laughingly refused and there was an interchange of pleasantries among the trio which seemed to have reference to this primitive manner of waiting by one of the company  one is more at ones ease mr vandeleur was heard to declare  next moment they were all three in their places and francis could see as little as he could hear of what passed but the dinner seemed to go merrily there was a perpetual babble of voices and sound of knives and forks below the chestnut and francis who had no more than a roll to gnaw was affected with envy by the comfort and deliberation of the meal the party lingered over one dish after another and then over a delicate dessert with a bottle of cold wine carefully uncorked by the hand of the dictator himself as it began to grow dark a lamp was set upon the table and a couple of candles on the sideboard for the night was perfectly pure starry and windless light overflowed besides from the door and window in the verandah so that the garden was fairly illuminated and the leaves twinkled in the darkness  for perhaps the tenth time miss vandeleur entered the house and on this occasion she returned with the coffeetray which she placed upon the sideboard at the same moment her father rose from his seat  the coffee is my province francis heard him say  and the next moment he saw his supposed father standing by the sideboard in the light of the candles  talking over his shoulder all the while mr vandeleur poured out two cups of the brown stimulant and then by a rapid act of prestidigitation emptied the contents of a tiny phial into the smaller of the two the thing was so swiftly done that even francis who looked straight into his face had hardly time to perceive the movement before it was completed and next instant and still laughing mr vandeleur had turned again towards the table with a cup in either hand  ere we have done with this said he we may expect our famous hebrew  it would be impossible to depict the confusion and distress of francis scrymgeour he saw foul play going forward before his eyes and he felt bound to interfere but knew not how it might be a mere pleasantry and then how should he look if he were to offer an unnecessary warning or again if it were serious the criminal might be his own father and then how should he not lament if he were to bring ruin on the author of his days for the first time he became conscious of his own position as a spy to wait inactive at such a juncture and with such a conflict of sentiments in his bosom was to suffer the most acute torture he clung to the bars of the shutters his heart beat fast and with irregularity and he felt a strong sweat break forth upon his body  several minutes passed  he seemed to perceive the conversation die away and grow less and less in vivacity and volume but still no sign of any alarming or even notable event  suddenly the ring of a glass breaking was followed by a faint and dull sound as of a person who should have fallen forward with his head upon the table at the same moment a piercing scream rose from the garden  what have you done cried miss vandeleur he is dead  the dictator replied in a violent whisper so strong and sibilant that every word was audible to the watcher at the window  silence said mr vandeleur the man is as well as i am take him by the heels whilst i carry him by the shoulders  francis heard miss vandeleur break forth into a passion of tears  do you hear what i say resumed the dictator in the same tones or do you wish to quarrel with me i give you your choice miss vandeleur  there was another pause and the dictator spoke again  take that man by the heels he said i must have him brought into the house if i were a little younger i could help myself against the world but now that years and dangers are upon me and my hands are weakened i must turn to you for aid  it is a crime replied the girl  i am your father said mr vandeleur  this appeal seemed to produce its effect a scuffling noise followed upon the gravel a chair was overset and then francis saw the father and daughter stagger across the walk and disappear under the verandah bearing the inanimate body of mr rolles embraced about the knees and shoulders the young clergyman was limp and pallid and his head rolled upon his shoulders at every step  was he alive or dead francis in spite of the dictators declaration inclined to the latter view a great crime had been committed a great calamity had fallen upon the inhabitants of the house with the green blinds to his surprise francis found all horror for the deed swallowed up in sorrow for a girl and an old man whom he judged to be in the height of peril a tide of generous feeling swept into his heart he too would help his father against man and mankind against fate and justice and casting open the shutters he closed his eyes and threw himself with outstretched arms into the foliage of the chestnut  branch after branch slipped from his grasp or broke under his weight then he caught a stalwart bough under his armpit and hung suspended for a second and then he let himself drop and fell heavily against the table a cry of alarm from the house warned him that his entrance had not been effected unobserved he recovered himself with a stagger and in three bounds crossed the intervening space and stood before the door in the verandah  in a small apartment carpeted with matting and surrounded by glazed cabinets full of rare and costly curios mr vandeleur was stooping over the body of mr rolles he raised himself as francis entered and there was an instantaneous passage of hands it was the business of a second as fast as an eye can wink the thing was done the young man had not the time to be sure but it seemed to him as if the dictator had taken something from the curates breast looked at it for the least fraction of time as it lay in his hand and then suddenly and swiftly passed it to his daughter  all this was over while francis had still one foot upon the threshold and the other raised in air the next instant he was on his knees to mr vandeleur  father he cried let me too help you i will do what you wish and ask no questions i will obey you with my life treat me as a son and you will find i have a sons devotion  a deplorable explosion of oaths was the dictators first reply  son and father he cried father and son what dd unnatural comedy is all this how do you come in my garden what do you want and who in gods name are you  francis with a stunned and shamefaced aspect got upon his feet again and stood in silence  then a light seemed to break upon mr vandeleur and he laughed aloud  i see cried he it is the scrymgeour very well mr scrymgeour let me tell you in a few words how you stand you have entered my private residence by force or perhaps by fraud but certainly with no encouragement from me and you come at a moment of some annoyance a guest having fainted at my table to besiege me with your protestations you are no son of mine you are my brothers bastard by a fishwife if you want to know i regard you with an indifference closely bordering on aversion and from what i now see of your conduct i judge your mind to be exactly suitable to your exterior i recommend you these mortifying reflections for your leisure and in the meantime let me beseech you to rid us of your presence if i were not occupied added the dictator with a terrifying oath i should give you the unholiest drubbing ere you went  francis listened in profound humiliation he would have fled had it been possible but as he had no means of leaving the residence into which he had so unfortunately penetrated he could do no more than stand foolishly where he was  it was miss vandeleur who broke the silence  father she said you speak in anger mr scrymgeour may have been mistaken but he meant well and kindly  thank you for speaking returned the dictator you remind me of some other observations which i hold it a point of honour to make to mr scrymgeour my brother he continued addressing the young man has been foolish enough to give you an allowance he was foolish enough and presumptuous enough to propose a match between you and this young lady you were exhibited to her two nights ago and i rejoice to tell you that she rejected the idea with disgust let me add that i have considerable influence with your father and it shall not be my fault if you are not beggared of your allowance and sent back to your scrivening ere the week be out  the tones of the old mans voice were if possible more wounding than his language francis felt himself exposed to the most cruel blighting and unbearable contempt his head turned and he covered his face with his hands uttering at the same time a tearless sob of agony but miss vandeleur once again interfered in his behalf  mr scrymgeour she said speaking in clear and even tones you must not be concerned at my fathers harsh expressions i felt no disgust for you on the contrary i asked an opportunity to make your better acquaintance as for what has passed tonight believe me it has filled my mind with both pity and esteem  just then mr rolles made a convulsive movement with his arm which convinced francis that he was only drugged and was beginning to throw off the influence of the opiate mr vandeleur stooped over him and examined his face for an instant  come come cried he raising his head let there be an end of this and since you are so pleased with his conduct miss vandeleur take a candle and show the bastard out  the young lady hastened to obey  thank you said francis as soon as he was alone with her in the garden i thank you from my soul this has been the bitterest evening of my life but it will have always one pleasant recollection  i spoke as i felt she replied and in justice to you it made my heart sorry that you should be so unkindly used  by this time they had reached the garden gate and miss vandeleur having set the candle on the ground was already unfastening the bolts  one word more said francis this is not for the last timei shall see you again shall i not  alas she answered you have heard my father what can i do but obey  tell me at least that it is not with your consent returned francis tell me that you have no wish to see the last of me  indeed replied she i have none you seem to me both brave and honest  then said francis give me a keepsake  she paused for a moment with her hand upon the key for the various bars and bolts were all undone and there was nothing left but to open the lock  if i agree she said will you promise to do as i tell you from point to point  can you ask replied francis i would do so willingly on your bare word  she turned the key and threw open the door  be it so said she you do not know what you ask but be it so whatever you hear she continued whatever happens do not return to this house hurry fast until you reach the lighted and populous quarters of the city even there be upon your guard you are in a greater danger than you fancy promise me you will not so much as look at my keepsake until you are in a place of safety  i promise replied francis  she put something loosely wrapped in a handkerchief into the young mans hand and at the same time with more strength than he could have anticipated she pushed him into the street  now run she cried  he heard the door close behind him and the noise of the bolts being replaced  my faith said he since i have promised  and he took to his heels down the lane that leads into the rue ravignan  he was not fifty paces from the house with the green blinds when the most diabolical outcry suddenly arose out of the stillness of the night mechanically he stood still another passenger followed his example in the neighbouring floors he saw people crowding to the windows a conflagration could not have produced more disturbance in this empty quarter and yet it seemed to be all the work of a single man roaring between grief and rage like a lioness robbed of her whelps and francis was surprised and alarmed to hear his own name shouted with english imprecations to the wind  his first movement was to return to the house his second as he remembered miss vandeleurs advice to continue his flight with greater expedition than before and he was in the act of turning to put his thought in action when the dictator bareheaded bawling aloud his white hair blowing about his head shot past him like a ball out of the cannons mouth and went careering down the street  that was a close shave thought francis to himself what he wants with me and why he should be so disturbed i cannot think but he is plainly not good company for the moment and i cannot do better than follow miss vandeleurs advice  so saying he turned to retrace his steps thinking to double and descend by the rue lepic itself while his pursuer should continue to follow after him on the other line of street the plan was illdevised as a matter of fact he should have taken his seat in the nearest caf√© and waited there until the first heat of the pursuit was over but besides that francis had no experience and little natural aptitude for the small war of private life he was so unconscious of any evil on his part that he saw nothing to fear beyond a disagreeable interview and to disagreeable interviews he felt he had already served his apprenticeship that evening nor could he suppose that miss vandeleur had left anything unsaid indeed the young man was sore both in body and mindthe one was all bruised the other was full of smarting arrows and he owned to himself that mr vandeleur was master of a very deadly tongue  the thought of his bruises reminded him that he had not only come without a hat but that his clothes had considerably suffered in his descent through the chestnut at the first magazine he purchased a cheap wideawake and had the disorder of his toilet summarily repaired the keepsake still rolled in the handkerchief he thrust in the meantime into his trousers pocket  not many steps beyond the shop he was conscious of a sudden shock a hand upon his throat an infuriated face close to his own and an open mouth bawling curses in his ear the dictator having found no trace of his quarry was returning by the other way francis was a stalwart young fellow but he was no match for his adversary whether in strength or skill and after a few ineffectual struggles he resigned himself entirely to his captor  what do you want with me said he  we will talk of that at home returned the dictator grimly  and he continued to march the young man up hill in the direction of the house with the green blinds  but francis although he no longer struggled was only waiting an opportunity to make a bold push for freedom with a sudden jerk he left the collar of his coat in the hands of mr vandeleur and once more made off at his best speed in the direction of the boulevards  the tables were now turned if the dictator was the stronger francis in the top of his youth was the more fleet of foot and he had soon effected his escape among the crowds relieved for a moment but with a growing sentiment of alarm and wonder in his mind he walked briskly until he debouched upon the place de lop√©ra lit up like day with electric lamps  this at least thought he should satisfy miss vandeleur  and turning to his right along the boulevards he entered the caf√© am√©ricain and ordered some beer it was both late and early for the majority of the frequenters of the establishment only two or three persons all men were dotted here and there at separate tables in the hall and francis was too much occupied by his own thoughts to observe their presence  he drew the handkerchief from his pocket the object wrapped in it proved to be a morocco case clasped and ornamented in gilt which opened by means of a spring and disclosed to the horrified young man a diamond of monstrous bigness and extraordinary brilliancy the circumstance was so inexplicable the value of the stone was plainly so enormous that francis sat staring into the open casket without movement without conscious thought like a man stricken suddenly with idiocy  a hand was laid upon his shoulder lightly but firmly and a quiet voice which yet had in it the ring of command uttered these words in his ear  close the casket and compose your face  looking up he beheld a man still young of an urbane and tranquil presence and dressed with rich simplicity this personage had risen from a neighbouring table and bringing his glass with him had taken a seat beside francis  close the casket repeated the stranger and put it quietly back into your pocket where i feel persuaded it should never have been try if you please to throw off your bewildered air and act as though i were one of your acquaintances whom you had met by chance so touch glasses with me that is better i fear sir you must be an amateur  and the stranger pronounced these last words with a smile of peculiar meaning leaned back in his seat and enjoyed a deep inhalation of tobacco  for gods sake said francis tell me who you are and what this means why i should obey your most unusual suggestions i am sure i know not but the truth is i have fallen this evening into so many perplexing adventures and all i meet conduct themselves so strangely that i think i must either have gone mad or wandered into another planet your face inspires me with confidence you seem wise good and experienced tell me for heavens sake why you accost me in so odd a fashion  all in due time replied the stranger but i have the first hand and you must begin by telling me how the rajahs diamond is in your possession  the rajahs diamond echoed francis  i would not speak so loud if i were you returned the other but most certainly you have the rajahs diamond in your pocket i have seen and handled it a score of times in sir thomas vandeleurs collection  sir thomas vandeleur the general my father cried francis  your father repeated the stranger i was not aware the general had any family  i am illegitimate sir replied francis with a flush  the other bowed with gravity it was a respectful bow as of a man silently apologising to his equal and francis felt relieved and comforted he scarce knew why the society of this person did him good he seemed to touch firm ground a strong feeling of respect grew up in his bosom and mechanically he removed his wideawake as though in the presence of a superior  i perceive said the stranger that your adventures have not at all been peaceful your collar is torn your face is scratched you have a cut upon your temple you will perhaps pardon my curiosity when i ask you to explain how you come by these injuries and how you happen to have stolen property to an enormous value in your pocket  i must differ from you returned francis hotly i possess no stolen property and if you refer to the diamond it was given to me not an hour ago by miss vandeleur in the rue lepic  by miss vandeleur in the rue lepic repeated the other you interest me more than you suppose pray continue  heavens cried francis  his memory had made a sudden bound he had seen mr vandeleur take an article from the breast of his drugged visitor and that article he was now persuaded was a morocco case  you have a light inquired the stranger  listen replied francis i know not who you are but i believe you to be worthy of confidence and helpful i find myself in strange waters i must have counsel and support and since you invite me i shall tell you all  and he briefly recounted his experience since the day when he was summoned from the bank by his lawyer  yours is indeed a remarkable history said the stranger after the young man had made an end of his narrative and your position is full of difficulty and peril many would counsel you to seek out your father and give the diamond to him but i have other viewswaiter he cried  the waiter drew near  will you ask the manager to speak with me a moment said he and francis observed once more both in his tone and manner the evidence of a habit of command  the waiter withdrew and returned in a moment with the manager who bowed with obsequious respect  what said he can i do to serve you  have the goodness replied the stranger indicating francis to tell this gentleman my name  you have the honour sir said the functionary addressing young scrymgeour to occupy the same table with his highness prince florizel of bohemia  francis rose with precipitation and made a grateful reverence to the prince who bade him resume his seat  i thank you said florizel once more addressing the functionary i am sorry to have deranged you for so small a matter  and he dismissed him with a movement of his hand  and now added the prince turning to francis give me the diamond  without a word the casket was handed over  you have done right said florizel your sentiments have properly inspired you and you will live to be grateful for the misfortunes of tonight a man mr scrymgeour may fall into a thousand perplexities but if his heart be upright and his intelligence unclouded he will issue from them all without dishonour let your mind be at rest your affairs are in my hand and with the aid of heaven i am strong enough to bring them to a good end follow me if you please to my carriage  so saying the prince arose and having left a piece of gold for the waiter conducted the young man from the caf√© and along the boulevard to where an unpretentious brougham and a couple of servants out of livery awaited his arrival  this carriage said he is at your disposal collect your baggage as rapidly as you can make it convenient and my servants will conduct you to a villa in the neighbourhood of paris where you can wait in some degree of comfort until i have had time to arrange your situation you will find there a pleasant garden a library of good authors a cook a cellar and some good cigars which i recommend to your attention j√©rome he added turning to one of the servants you have heard what i say i leave mr scrymgeour in your charge you will i know be careful of my friend  francis uttered some broken phrases of gratitude  it will be time enough to thank me said the prince when you are acknowledged by your father and married to miss vandeleur  and with that the prince turned away and strolled leisurely in the direction of montmartre he hailed the first passing cab gave an address and a quarter of an hour afterwards having discharged the driver some distance lower he was knocking at mr vandeleurs garden gate  it was opened with singular precautions by the dictator in person  who are you he demanded  you must pardon me this late visit mr vandeleur replied the prince  your highness is always welcome returned mr vandeleur stepping back  the prince profited by the open space and without waiting for his host walked right into the house and opened the door of the salon two people were seated there one was miss vandeleur who bore the marks of weeping about her eyes and was still shaken from time to time by a sob in the other the prince recognised the young man who had consulted him on literary matters about a month before in a club smokingroom  goodevening miss vandeleur said florizel you look fatigued mr rolles i believe i hope you have profited by the study of gaboriau mr rolles  but the young clergymans temper was too much embittered for speech and he contented himself with bowing stiffly and continued to gnaw his lip  to what good wind said mr vandeleur following his guest am i to attribute the honour of your highnesss presence  i am come on business returned the prince on business with you as soon as that is settled i shall request mr rolles to accompany me for a walkmr rolles he added with severity let me remind you that i have not yet sat down  the clergyman sprang to his feet with an apology whereupon the prince took an armchair beside the table handed his hat to mr vandeleur his cane to mr rolles and leaving them standing and thus menially employed upon his service spoke as follows  i have come here as i said upon business but had i come looking for pleasure i could not have been more displeased with my reception nor more dissatisfied with my company you sir addressing mr rolles you have treated your superior in station with discourtesy you vandeleur receive me with a smile but you know right well that your hands are not yet cleansed from misconducti do not desire to be interrupted sir he added imperiously i am here to speak and not to listen and i have to ask you to hear me with respect and to obey punctiliously at the earliest possible date your daughter shall be married at the embassy to my friend francis scrymgeour your brothers acknowledged son you will oblige me by offering not less than ten thousand pounds dowry for yourself i will indicate to you in writing a mission of some importance in siam which i destine to your care and now sir you will answer me in two words whether or not you agree to these conditions  your highness will pardon me said mr vandeleur and permit me with all respect to submit to him two queries  the permission is granted replied the prince  your highness resumed the dictator has called mr scrymgeour his friend believe me had i known he was thus honoured i should have treated him with proportional respect  you interrogate adroitly said the prince but it will not serve your turn you have my commands if i had never seen that gentleman before tonight it would not render them less absolute  your highness interprets my meaning with his usual subtlety returned vandeleur once more i have unfortunately put the police upon the track of mr scrymgeour on a charge of theft am i to withdraw or to uphold the accusation  you will please yourself replied florizel the question is one between your conscience and the laws of this land give me my hat and you mr rolles give me my cane and follow me miss vandeleur i wish you goodevening i judge he added to vandeleur that your silence means unqualified assent  if i can do no better replied the old man i shall submit but i warn you openly it shall not be without a struggle  you are old said the prince but years are disgraceful to the wicked your age is more unwise than the youth of others do not provoke me or you may find me harder than you dream this is the first time that i have fallen across your path in anger take care that it be the last  with these words motioning the clergyman to follow florizel left the apartment and directed his steps towards the garden gate and the dictator following with a candle gave them light and once more undid the elaborate fastenings with which he sought to protect himself from intrusion  your daughter is no longer present said the prince turning on the threshold let me tell you that i understand your threats and you have only to lift your hand to bring upon yourself sudden and irremediable ruin  the dictator made no reply but as the prince turned his back upon him in the lamplight he made a gesture full of menace and insane fury and the next moment slipping round a corner he was running at full speed for the nearest cabstand   here says my arabian the thread of events is finally diverted from the house with the green blinds one more adventure he adds and we have done with the rajahs diamond that last link in the chain is known among the inhabitants of bagdad by the name of   the adventure of prince florizel and a detective  prince florizel walked with mr rolles to the door of a small hotel where the latter resided they spoke much together and the clergyman was more than once affected to tears by the mingled severity and tenderness of florizels reproaches  i have made ruin of my life he said at last help me tell me what i am to do i have alas neither the virtues of a priest nor the dexterity of a rogue  now that you are humbled said the prince i command no longer the repentant have to do with god and not with princes but if you will let me advise you go to australia as a colonist seek menial labour in the open air and try to forget that you have ever been a clergyman or that you ever set eyes on that accursed stone  accurst indeed replied mr rolles where is it now what further hurt is it not working for mankind  it will do no more evil returned the prince it is here in my pocket and this he added kindly will show that i place some faith in your penitence young as it is  suffer me to touch your hand pleaded mr rolles  no replied prince florizel not yet  the tone in which he uttered these last words was eloquent in the ears of the young clergyman and for some minutes after the prince had turned away he stood on the threshold following with his eyes the retreating figure and invoking the blessing of heaven upon a man so excellent in counsel  for several hours the prince walked alone in unfrequented streets his mind was full of concern what to do with the diamond whether to return it to its owner whom he judged unworthy of this rare possession or to take some sweeping and courageous measure and put it out of the reach of all mankind at once and for ever was a problem too grave to be decided in a moment the manner in which it had come into his hands appeared manifestly providential and as he took out the jewel and looked at it under the street lamps its size and surprising brilliancy inclined him more and more to think of it as of an unmixed and dangerous evil for the world  god help me he thought if i look at it much oftener i shall begin to grow covetous myself  at last though still uncertain in his mind he turned his steps towards the small but elegant mansion on the riverside which had belonged for centuries to his royal family the arms of bohemia are deeply graved over the door and upon the tall chimneys passengers have a look into a green court set with the most costly flowers and a stork the only one in paris perches on the gable all day long and keeps a crowd before the house grave servants are seen passing to and fro within and from time to time the great gate is thrown open and a carriage rolls below the arch for many reasons this residence was especially dear to the heart of prince florizel he never drew near to it without enjoying that sentiment of homecoming so rare in the lives of the great and on the present evening he beheld its tall roof and mildly illuminated windows with unfeigned relief and satisfaction  as he was approaching the postern door by which he always entered when alone a man stepped forth from the shadow and presented himself with an obeisance in the princes path  i have the honour of addressing prince florizel of bohemia said he  such is my title replied the prince what do you want with me  i am said the man a detective and i have to present your highness with this billet from the prefect of police  the prince took the letter and glanced it through by the light of the street lamp it was highly apologetic but requested him to follow the bearer to the prefecture without delay  in short said florizel i am arrested  your highness replied the officer nothing i am certain could be further from the intention of the prefect you will observe that he has not granted a warrant it is mere formality or call it if you prefer an obligation that your highness lays on the authorities  at the same time asked the prince if i were to refuse to follow you  i will not conceal from your highness that a considerable discretion has been granted me replied the detective with a bow  upon my word cried florizel your effrontery astounds me yourself as an agent i must pardon but your superiors shall dearly smart for their misconduct what have you any idea is the cause of this impolitic and unconstitutional act you will observe that i have as yet neither refused nor consented and much may depend on your prompt and ingenuous answer let me remind you officer that this is an affair of some gravity  your highness said the detective humbly general vandeleur and his brother have had the incredible presumption to accuse you of theft the famous diamond they declare is in your hands a word from you in denial will most amply satisfy the prefect nay i go further if your highness would so far honour a subaltern as to declare his ignorance of the matter even to myself i should ask permission to retire upon the spot  florizel up to the last moment had regarded his adventure in the light of a trifle only serious upon international considerations at the name of vandeleur the horrible truth broke upon him in a moment he was not only arrested but he was guilty this was not only an annoying incidentit was a peril to his honour what was he to say what was he to do the rajahs diamond was indeed an accursed stone and it seemed as if he were to be the last victim to its influence  one thing was certain he could not give the required assurance to the detective he must gain time  his hesitation had not lasted a second  be it so said he let us walk together to the prefecture  the man once more bowed and proceeded to follow florizel at a respectful distance in the rear  approach said the prince i am in a humour to talk and if i mistake not now i look at you again this is not the first time that we have met  i count it an honour replied the officer that your highness should recollect my face it is eight years since i had the pleasure of an interview  to remember faces returned florizel is as much a part of my profession as it is of yours indeed rightly looked upon a prince and a detective serve in the same corps we are both combatants against crime only mine is the more lucrative and yours the more dangerous rank and there is a sense in which both may be made equally honourable to a good man i had rather strange as you may think it be a detective of character and parts than a weak and ignoble sovereign  the officer was overwhelmed  your highness returns good for evil said he to an act of presumption he replies by the most amiable condescension  how do you know replied florizel that i am not seeking to corrupt you  heaven preserve me from the temptation cried the detective  i applaud your answer returned the prince it is that of a wise and honest man the world is a great place and stocked with wealth and beauty and there is no limit to the rewards that may be offered such an one who would refuse a million of money may sell his honour for an empire or the love of a woman and i myself who speak to you have seen occasions so tempting provocations so irresistible to the strength of human virtue that i have been glad to tread in your steps and recommend myself to the grace of god it is thus thanks to that modest and becoming habit alone he added that you and i can walk this town together with untarnished hearts  i had always heard that you were brave replied the officer but i was not aware that you were wise and pious you speak the truth and you speak it with an accent that moves me to the heart this world is indeed a place of trial  we are now said florizel in the middle of the bridge lean your elbows on the parapet and look over as the water rushing below so the passions and complications of life carry away the honesty of weak men let me tell you a story  i receive your highnesss commands replied the man  and imitating the prince he leaned against the parapet and disposed himself to listen the city was already sunk in slumber had it not been for the infinity of lights and the outline of buildings on the starry sky they might have been alone beside some country river  an officer began prince florizel a man of courage and conduct who had already risen by merit to an eminent rank and won not only admiration but respect visited in an unfortunate hour for his peace of mind the collections of an indian prince here he beheld a diamond so extraordinary for size and beauty that from that instant he had only one desire in life honour reputation friendship the love of countryhe was ready to sacrifice all for this lump of sparkling crystal for three years he served this semibarbarian potentate as jacob served laban he falsified frontiers he connived at murders he unjustly condemned and executed a brotherofficer who had the misfortune to displease the rajah by some honest freedoms lastly at a time of great danger to his native land he betrayed a body of his fellowsoldiers and suffered them to be defeated and massacred by thousands in the end he had amassed a magnificent fortune and brought home with him the coveted diamond  years passed continued the prince and at length the diamond is accidentally lost it falls into the hands of a simple and laborious youth a student a minister of god just entering on a career of usefulness and even distinction upon him also the spell is cast he deserts everything his holy calling his studies and flees with the gem into a foreign country the officer has a brother an astute daring unscrupulous man who learns the clergymans secret what does he do tell his brother inform the police no upon this man also the satanic charm has fallen he must have the stone for himself at the risk of murder he drugs the young priest and seizes the prey and now by an accident which is not important to my moral the jewel passes out of his custody into that of another who terrified at what he sees gives it into the keeping of a man in high station and above reproach  the officers name is thomas vandeleur continued florizel the stone is called the rajahs diamond andsuddenly opening his handyou behold it here before your eyes  the officer started back with a cry  we have spoken of corruption said the prince to me this nugget of bright crystal is as loathsome as though it were crawling with the worms of death it is as shocking as though it were compacted out of innocent blood i see it here in my hand and i know it is shining with hellfire i have told you but a hundredth part of its story what passed in former ages to what crimes and treacheries it incited men of yore the imagination trembles to conceive for years and years it has faithfully served the powers of hell enough i say of blood enough of disgrace enough of broken lives and friendships all things come to an end the evil like the good pestilence as well as beautiful music and as for this diamond god forgive me if i do wrong but its empire ends tonight  the prince made a sudden movement with his hand and the jewel describing an arc of light dived with a splash into the flowing river  amen said florizel with gravity i have slain a cockatrice  god pardon me cried the detective what have you done i am a ruined man  i think returned the prince with a smile that many welltodo people in this city might envy you your ruin  alas your highness said the officer and you corrupt me after all  it seems there was no help for it replied florizeland now let us go forward to the prefecture   not long after the marriage of francis scrymgeour and miss vandeleur was celebrated in great privacy and the prince acted on that occasion as grooms man the two vandeleurs surprised some rumour of what had happened to the diamond and their vast diving operations on the river seine are the wonder and amusement of the idle it is true that through some miscalculation they have chosen the wrong branch of the river as for the prince that sublime person having now served his turn may go along with the arabian author topsyturvy into space but if the reader insists on more specific information i am happy to say that a recent revolution hurled him from the throne of bohemia in consequence of his continued absence and edifying neglect of public business and that his highness now keeps a cigar store in rupert street much frequented by other foreign refugees i go there from time to time to smoke and have a chat and find him as great a creature as in the days of his prosperity he has an olympian air behind the counter and although a sedentary life is beginning to tell upon his waistcoat he is probably take him for all in all the handsomest tobacconist in london     the pavilion on the links     chapter i  tells how i camped in graden seawood and beheld a light in the pavilion   i was a great solitary when i was young i made it my pride to keep aloof and suffice for my own entertainment and i may say that i had neither friends nor acquaintances until i met that friend who became my wife and the mother of my children with one man only was i on private terms this was r northmour esquire of gradeneaster in scotland we had met at college and though there was not much liking between us nor even much intimacy we were so nearly of a humour that we could associate with ease to both misanthropes we believed ourselves to be but i have thought since that we were only sulky fellows it was scarcely a companionship but a coexistence in unsociability northmours exceptional violence of temper made it no easy affair for him to keep the peace with any one but me and as he respected my silent ways and let me come and go as i pleased i could tolerate his presence without concern i think we called each other friends  when northmour took his degree and i decided to leave the university without one he invited me on a long visit to gradeneaster and it was thus that i first became acquainted with the scene of my adventures the mansionhouse of graden stood in a bleak stretch of country some three miles from the shore of the german ocean it was as large as a barrack and as it had been built of a soft stone liable to consume in the eager air of the seaside it was damp and draughty within and halfruinous without it was impossible for two young men to lodge with comfort in such a dwelling but there stood in the northern part of the estate in a wilderness of links and blowing sandhills and between a plantation and the sea a small pavilion or belvidere of modern design which was exactly suited to our wants and in this hermitage speaking little reading much and rarely associating except at meals northmour and i spent four tempestuous winter months i might have stayed longer but one march night there sprang up between us a dispute which rendered my departure necessary northmour spoke hotly i remember and i suppose i must have made some tart rejoinder he leaped from his chair and grappled me i had to fight without exaggeration for my life and it was only with a great effort that i mastered him for he was near as strong in body as myself and seemed filled with the devil the next morning we met on our usual terms but i judged it more delicate to withdraw nor did he attempt to dissuade me  it was nine years before i revisited the neighbourhood i travelled at that time with a tiltcart a tent and a cookingstove tramping all day beside the waggon and at night whenever it was possible gipsying in a cove of the hills or by the side of a wood i believe i visited in this manner most of the wild and desolate regions both in england and scotland and as i had neither friends nor relations i was troubled with no correspondence and had nothing in the nature of headquarters unless it was the office of my solicitors from whom i drew my income twice a year it was a life in which i delighted and i fully thought to have grown old upon the march and at last died in a ditch  it was my whole business to find desolate corners where i could camp without the fear of interruption and hence being in another part of the same shire i bethought me suddenly of the pavilion on the links no thoroughfare passed within three miles of it the nearest town and that was but a fisher village was at a distance of six or seven for ten miles of length and from a depth varying from three miles to half a mile this belt of barren country lay along the sea the beach which was the natural approach was full of quicksands indeed i may say there is hardly a better place of concealment in the united kingdom i determined to pass a week in the seawood of gradeneaster and making a long stage reached it about sundown on a wild september day  the country i have said was mixed sandhill and links links being a scottish name for sand which has ceased drifting and become more or less solidly covered with turf the pavilion stood on an even space a little behind it the wood began in a hedge of elders huddled together by the wind in front a few tumbled sandhills stood between it and the sea an outcropping of rock had formed a bastion for the sand so that there was here a promontory in the coastline between two shallow bays and just beyond the tides the rock again cropped out and formed an islet of small dimensions but strikingly designed the quicksands were of great extent at low water and had an infamous reputation in the country close inshore between the islet and the promontory it was said they would swallow a man in four minutes and a half but there may have been little ground for this precision the district was alive with rabbits and haunted by gulls which made a continual piping about the pavilion on summer days the outlook was bright and even gladsome but at sundown in september with a high wind and a heavy surf rolling in close along the links the place told of nothing but dead mariners and sea disaster a ship beating to windward on the horizon and a huge truncheon of wreck halfburied in the sands at my feet completed the innuendo of the scene  the pavilionit had been built by the last proprietor northmours uncle a silly and prodigal virtuosopresented little signs of age it was two stories in height italian in design surrounded by a patch of garden in which nothing had prospered but a few coarse flowers and looked with its shuttered windows not like a house that had been deserted but like one that had never been tenanted by man northmour was plainly from home whether as usual sulking in the cabin of his yacht or in one of his fitful and extravagant appearances in the world of society i had of course no means of guessing the place had an air of solitude that daunted even a solitary like myself the wind cried in the chimneys with a strange and wailing note and it was with a sense of escape as if i were going indoors that i turned away and driving my cart before me entered the skirts of the wood  the seawood of graden had been planted to shelter the cultivated fields behind and check the encroachments of the blowing sand as you advanced into it from coastward elders were succeeded by other hardy shrubs but the timber was all stunted and bushy it led a life of conflict the trees were accustomed to swing there all night long in fierce winter tempests and even in early spring the leaves were already flying and autumn was beginning in this exposed plantation inland the ground rose into a little hill which along with the islet served as a sailing mark for seamen when the hill was open of the islet to the north vessels must bear well to the eastward to clear graden ness and the graden bullers in the lower ground a streamlet ran among the trees and being dammed with dead leaves and clay of its own carrying spread out every here and there and lay in stagnant pools one or two ruined cottages were dotted about the wood and according to northmour these were ecclesiastical foundations and in their time had sheltered pious hermits  i found a den or small hollow where there was a spring of pure water and there clearing away the brambles i pitched the tent and made a fire to cook my supper my horse i picketed farther in the wood where there was a patch of sward the banks of the den not only concealed the light of my fire but sheltered me from the wind which was cold as well as high  the life i was leading made me both hardy and frugal i never drank but water and rarely ate anything more costly than oatmeal and i required so little sleep that although i rose with the peep of day i would often lie long awake in the dark or starry watches of the night thus in graden seawood although i fell thankfully asleep by eight in the evening i was awake again before eleven with a full possession of my faculties and no sense of drowsiness or fatigue i rose and sat by the fire watching the trees and clouds tumultuously tossing and fleeing overhead and hearkening to the wind and the rollers along the shore till at length growing weary of inaction i quitted the den and strolled towards the borders of the wood a young moon buried in mist gave a faint illumination to my steps and the light grew brighter as i walked forth into the links at the same moment the wind smelling salt of the open ocean and carrying particles of sand struck me with its full force so that i had to bow my head  when i raised it again to look about me i was aware of a light in the pavilion it was not stationary but passed from one window to another as though some one were reviewing the different apartments with a lamp or candle i watched it for some seconds in great surprise when i had arrived in the afternoon the house had been plainly deserted now it was as plainly occupied it was my first idea that a gang of thieves might have broken in and be now ransacking northmours cupboards which were many and not ill supplied but what should bring thieves to gradeneaster and again all the shutters had been thrown open and it would have been more in the character of such gentry to close them i dismissed the notion and fell back upon another northmour himself must have arrived and was now airing and inspecting the pavilion  i have said that there was no real affection between this man and me but had i loved him like a brother i was then so much more in love with solitude that i should none the less have shunned his company as it was i turned and ran for it and it was with genuine satisfaction that i found myself safely back beside the fire i had escaped an acquaintance i should have one more night in comfort in the morning i might either slip away before northmour was abroad or pay him as short a visit as i chose  but when morning came i thought the situation so diverting that i forgot my shyness northmour was at my mercy i arranged a good practical jest though i knew well that my neighbour was not the man to jest with in security and chuckling beforehand over its success took my place among the elders at the edge of the wood whence i could command the door of the pavilion the shutters were all once more closed which i remember thinking odd and the house with its white walls and green venetians looked spruce and habitable in the morning light hour after hour passed and still no sign of northmour i knew him for a sluggard in the morning but as it drew on towards noon i lost my patience to say the truth i had promised myself to break my fast in the pavilion and hunger began to prick me sharply it was a pity to let the opportunity go by without some cause for mirth but the grosser appetite prevailed and i relinquished my jest with regret and sallied from the wood  the appearance of the house affected me as i drew near with disquietude it seemed unchanged since last evening and i had expected it i scarce knew why to wear some external signs of habitation but no the windows were all closely shuttered the chimneys breathed no smoke and the front door itself was closely padlocked northmour therefore had entered by the back this was the natural and indeed the necessary conclusion and you may judge of my surprise when on turning the house i found the backdoor similarly secured  my mind at once reverted to the original theory of thieves and i blamed myself sharply for my last nights inaction i examined all the windows on the lower story but none of them had been tampered with i tried the padlocks but they were both secure it thus became a problem how the thieves if thieves they were had managed to enter the house they must have got i reasoned upon the roof of the outhouse where northmour used to keep his photographic battery and from thence either by the window of the study or that of my old bedroom completed their burglarious entry  i followed what i supposed was their example and getting on the roof tried the shutters of each room both were secure but i was not to be beaten and with a little force one of them flew open grazing as it did so the back of my hand i remember i put the wound to my mouth and stood for perhaps half a minute licking it like a dog and mechanically gazing behind me over the waste links and the sea and in that space of time my eye made note of a large schooner yacht some miles to the northeast then i threw up the window and climbed in  i went over the house and nothing can express my mystification there was no sign of disorder but on the contrary the rooms were unusually clean and pleasant i found fires laid ready for lighting three bedrooms prepared with a luxury quite foreign to northmours habits and with water in the ewers and the beds turned down a table set for three in the diningroom and an ample supply of cold meats game and vegetables on the pantry shelves there were guests expected that was plain but why guests when northmour hated society and above all why was the house thus stealthily prepared at dead of night and why were the shutters closed and the doors padlocked  i effaced all traces of my visit and came forth from the window feeling sobered and concerned  the schooner yacht was still in the same place and it flashed for a moment through my mind that this might be the red earl bringing the owner of the pavilion and his guests but the vessels head was set the other way     chapter ii  tells of the nocturnal landing from the yacht   i returned to the den to cook myself a meal of which i stood in great need as well as to care for my horse which i had somewhat neglected in the morning from time to time i went down to the edge of the wood but there was no change in the pavilion and not a human creature was seen all day upon the links the schooner in the offing was the one touch of life within my range of vision she apparently with no set object stood off and on or lay to hour after hour but as the evening deepened she drew steadily nearer i became more convinced that she carried northmour and his friends and that they would probably come ashore after dark not only because that was of a piece with the secrecy of the preparations but because the tide would not have flowed sufficiently before eleven to cover graden floe and the other sea quags that fortified the shore against invaders  all day the wind had been going down and the sea along with it but there was a return towards sunset of the heavy weather of the day before the night set in pitch dark the wind came off the sea in squalls like the firing of a battery of cannon now and then there was a flaw of rain and the surf rolled heavier with the rising tide i was down at my observatory among the elders when a light was run up to the masthead of the schooner and showed she was closer in than when i had last seen her by the dying daylight i concluded that this must be a signal to northmours associates on shore and stepping forth into the links looked around me for something in response  a small footpath ran along the margin of the wood and formed the most direct communication between the pavilion and the mansionhouse and as i cast my eyes to that side i saw a spark of light not a quarter of a mile away and rapidly approaching from its uneven course it appeared to be the light of a lantern carried by a person who followed the windings of the path and was often staggered and taken aback by the more violent squalls i concealed myself once more among the elders and waited eagerly for the newcomers advance it proved to be a woman and as she passed within half a rod of my ambush i was able to recognise the features the deaf and silent old dame who had nursed northmour in his childhood was his associate in this underhand affair  i followed her at a little distance taking advantage of the innumerable heights and hollows concealed by the darkness and favoured not only by the nurses deafness but by the uproar of the wind and surf she entered the pavilion and going at once to the upper story opened and set a light in one of the windows that looked towards the sea immediately afterwards the light at the schooners masthead was run down and extinguished its purpose had been attained and those on board were sure that they were expected the old woman resumed her preparations although the other shutters remained closed i could see a glimmer going to and fro about the house and a gush of sparks from one chimney after another soon told me that the fires were being kindled  northmour and his guests i was now persuaded would come ashore as soon as there was water on the floe it was a wild night for boat service and i felt some alarm mingle with my curiosity as i reflected on the danger of the landing my old acquaintance it was true was the most eccentric of men but the present eccentricity was both disquieting and lugubrious to consider a variety of feelings thus led me towards the beach where i lay flat on my face in a hollow within six feet of the track that led to the pavilion thence i should have the satisfaction of recognising the arrivals and if they should prove to be acquaintances greeting them as soon as they had landed  some time before eleven while the tide was still dangerously low a boats lantern appeared close inshore and my attention being thus awakened i could perceive another still far to seaward violently tossed and sometimes hidden by the billows the weather which was getting dirtier as the night went on and the perilous situation of the yacht upon a leeshore had probably driven them to attempt a landing at the earliest possible moment  a little afterwards four yachtsmen carrying a very heavy chest and guided by a fifth with a lantern passed close in front of me as i lay and were admitted to the pavilion by the nurse they returned to the beach and passed me a second time with another chest larger but apparently not so heavy as the first a third time they made the transit and on this occasion one of the yachtsmen carried a leather portmanteau and the others a ladys trunk and carriage bag my curiosity was sharply excited if a woman were among the guests of northmour it would show a change in his habits and an apostasy from his pet theories of life well calculated to fill me with surprise when he and i dwelt there together the pavilion had been a temple of misogyny and now one of the detested sex was to be installed under its roof i remembered one or two particulars a few notes of daintiness and almost of coquetry which had struck me the day before as i surveyed the preparations in the house their purpose was now clear and i thought myself dull not to have perceived it from the first  while i was thus reflecting a second lantern drew near me from the beach it was carried by a yachtsman whom i had not yet seen and who was conducting two other persons to the pavilion these two persons were unquestionably the guests for whom the house was made ready and straining eye and ear i set myself to watch them as they passed one was an unusually tall man in a travelling hat slouched over his eyes and a highland cape closely buttoned and turned up so as to conceal his face you could make out no more of him than that he was as i have said unusually tall and walked feebly with a heavy stoop by his side and either clinging to him or giving him supporti could not make out whichwas a young tall and slender figure of a woman she was extremely pale but in the light of the lantern her face was so marred by strong and changing shadows that she might equally well have been as ugly as sin or as beautiful as i afterwards found her to be  when they were just abreast of me the girl made some remark which was drowned by the noise of the wind  hush said her companion and there was something in the tone with which the word was uttered that thrilled and rather shook my spirits it seemed to breathe from a bosom labouring under the deadliest terror i have never heard another syllable so expressive and i still hear it again when i am feverish at night and my mind runs upon old times the man turned towards the girl as he spoke i had a glimpse of much red beard and a nose which seemed to have been broken in youth and his light eyes seemed shining in his face with some strong and unpleasant emotion  but these two passed on and were admitted in their turn to the pavilion  one by one or in groups the seamen returned to the beach the wind brought me the sound of a rough voice crying shove off then after a pause another lantern drew near it was northmour alone  my wife and i a man and a woman have often agreed to wonder how a person could be at the same time so handsome and so repulsive as northmour he had the appearance of a finished gentleman his face bore every mark of intelligence and courage but you had only to look at him even in the most amiable moment to see that he had the temper of a slaver captain i never knew a character that was both explosive and revengeful to the same degree he combined the vivacity of the south with the sustained and deadly hatreds of the north and both traits were plainly written on his face which was a sort of dangersignal in person he was tall strong and active his hair and complexion very dark his features handsomely designed but spoiled by a menacing expression  at that moment he was somewhat paler than by nature he wore a heavy frown and his lips worked and he looked sharply round him as he walked like a man besieged with apprehensions and yet i thought he had a look of triumph underlying all as though he had already done much and was near the end of an achievement  partly from a scruple of delicacywhich i daresay came too latepartly from the pleasure of startling an acquaintance i desired to make my presence known to him without delay  i got suddenly to my feet and stepped forward  northmour said i  i have never had so shocking a surprise in all my days he leaped on me without a word something shone in his hand and he struck for my heart with a dagger at the same moment i knocked him head over heels whether it was my quickness or his own uncertainty i know not but the blade only grazed my shoulder while the hilt and his fist struck me violently on the mouth  i fled but not far i had often and often observed the capabilities of the sandhills for protracted ambush or stealthy advances and retreats and not ten yards from the scene of the scuffle plumped down again upon the grass the lantern had fallen and gone out but what was my astonishment to see northmour slip at a bound into the pavilion and hear him bar the door behind him with a clang of iron  he had not pursued me he had run away northmour whom i knew for the most implacable and daring of men had run away i could scarcely believe my reason and yet in this strange business where all was incredible there was nothing to make a work about in an incredibility more or less for why was the pavilion secretly prepared why had northmour landed with his guests at dead of night in half a gale of wind and with the floe scarce covered why had he sought to kill me had he not recognised my voice i wondered and above all how had he come to have a dagger ready in his hand a dagger or even a sharp knife seemed out of keeping with the age in which we lived and a gentleman landing from his yacht on the shore of his own estate even although it was at night and with some mysterious circumstances does not usually as a matter of fact walk thus prepared for deadly onslaught the more i reflected the further i felt at sea i recapitulated the elements of mystery counting them on my fingers the pavilion secretly prepared for guests the guests landed at the risk of their lives and to the imminent peril of the yacht the guests or at least one of them in undisguised and seemingly causeless terror northmour with a naked weapon northmour stabbing his most intimate acquaintance at a word last and not least strange northmour fleeing from the man whom he had sought to murder and barricading himself like a hunted creature behind the door of the pavilion here were at least six separate causes for extreme surprise each part and parcel with the others and forming all together one consistent story i felt almost ashamed to believe my own senses  as i thus stood transfixed with wonder i began to grow painfully conscious of the injuries i had received in the scuffle skulked round among the sandhills and by a devious path regained the shelter of the wood on the way the old nurse passed again within several yards of me still carrying her lantern on the return journey to the mansionhouse of graden this made a seventh suspicious feature in the case northmour and his guests it appeared were to cook and do the cleaning for themselves while the old woman continued to inhabit the big empty barrack among the policies there must surely be great cause for secrecy when so many inconveniences were confronted to preserve it  so thinking i made my way to the den for greater security i trod out the embers of the fire and lit my lantern to examine the wound upon my shoulder it was a trifling hurt although it bled somewhat freely and i dressed it as well as i could for its position made it difficult to reach with some rag and cold water from the spring while i was thus busied i mentally declared war against northmour and his mystery i am not an angry man by nature and i believe there was more curiosity than resentment in my heart but war i certainly declared and by way of preparation i got out my revolver and having drawn the charges cleaned and reloaded it with scrupulous care next i became preoccupied about my horse it might break loose or fall to neighing and so betray my camp in the seawood i determined to rid myself of its neighbourhood and long before dawn i was leading it over the links in the direction of the fisher village     chapter iii  tells how i became acquainted with my wife   for two days i skulked round the pavilion profiting by the uneven surface of the links i became an adept in the necessary tactics these low hillocks and shallow dells running one into another became a kind of cloak of darkness for my enthralling but perhaps dishonourable pursuit yet in spite of this advantage i could learn but little of northmour or his guests  fresh provisions were brought under cover of darkness by the old woman from the mansionhouse northmour and the young lady sometimes together but more often singly would walk for an hour or two at a time on the beach beside the quicksand i could not but conclude that this promenade was chosen with an eye to secrecy for the spot was open only to the seaward but it suited me not less excellently the highest and most accidented of the sandhills immediately adjoined and from these lying flat in a hollow i could overlook northmour or the young lady as they walked  the tall man seemed to have disappeared not only did he never cross the threshold but he never so much as showed face at a window or at least not so far as i could see for i dared not creep forward beyond a certain distance in the day since the upper floor commanded the bottoms of the links and at night when i could venture farther the lower windows were barricaded as if to stand a siege sometimes i thought the tall man must be confined to bed for i remembered the feebleness of his gait and sometimes i thought he must have gone clear away and that northmour and the young lady remained alone together in the pavilion the idea even then displeased me  whether or not this pair were man and wife i had seen abundant reason to doubt the friendliness of their relation although i could hear nothing of what they said and rarely so much as glean a decided expression on the face of either there was a distance almost a stiffness in their bearing which showed them to be either unfamiliar or at enmity the girl walked faster when she was with northmour than when she was alone and i conceived that any inclination between a man and a woman would rather delay than accelerate the step moreover she kept a good yard free of him and trailed her umbrella as if it were a barrier on the side between them northmour kept sidling closer and as the girl retired from his advance their course lay at a sort of diagonal across the beach and would have landed them in the surf had it been long enough continued but when this was imminent the girl would unostentatiously change sides and put northmour between her and the sea i watched these manoeuvres for my part with high enjoyment and approval and chuckled to myself at every move  on the morning of the third day she walked alone for some time and i perceived to my great concern that she was more than once in tears you will see that my heart was already interested more than i supposed she had a firm yet airy motion of the body and carried her head with unimaginable grace every step was a thing to look at and she seemed in my eyes to breathe sweetness and distinction  the day was so agreeable being calm and sunshiny with a tranquil sea and yet with a healthful piquancy and vigour in the air that contrary to custom she was tempted forth a second time to walk on this occasion she was accompanied by northmour and they had been but a short while on the beach when i saw him take forcible possession of her hand she struggled and uttered a cry that was almost a scream i sprang to my feet unmindful of my strange position but ere i had taken a step i saw northmour bareheaded and bowing very low as if to apologise and dropped again at once into my ambush a few words were interchanged and then with another bow he left the beach to return to the pavilion he passed not far from me and i could see him flushed and lowering and cutting savagely with his cane among the grass it was not without satisfaction that i recognised my own handiwork in a great cut under his right eye and a considerable discoloration round the socket  for some time the girl remained where he had left her looking out past the islet and over the bright sea then with a start as one who throws off preoccupation and puts energy again upon its mettle she broke into a rapid and decisive walk she also was much incensed by what had passed she had forgotten where she was and i beheld her walk straight into the borders of the quicksand where it is more abrupt and dangerous two or three steps farther and her life would have been in serious jeopardy when i slid down the face of the sandhill which is there precipitous and running halfway forward called to her to stop  she did so and turned round there was not a tremor of fear in her behaviour and she marched directly up to me like a queen i was barefoot and clad like a common sailor save for an egyptian scarf round my waist and she probably took me at first for some one from the fisher village straying after bait as for her when i thus saw her face to face her eyes set steadily and imperiously upon mine i was filled with admiration and astonishment and thought her even more beautiful than i had looked to find her nor could i think enough of one who acting with so much boldness yet preserved a maidenly air that was both quaint and engaging for my wife kept an oldfashioned precision of manner through all her admirable lifean excellent thing in woman since it sets another value on her sweet familiarities  what does this mean she asked  you were walking i told her directly into graden floe  you do not belong to these parts she said again you speak like an educated man  i believe i have right to that name said i although in this disguise  but her womans eye had already detected the sash  oh she said your sash betrays you  you have said the word betray i resumed may i ask you not to betray me i was obliged to disclose myself in your interest but if northmour learned my presence it might be worse than disagreeable for me  do you know she asked to whom you are speaking  not to mr northmours wife i asked by way of answer  she shook her head all this while she was studying my face with an embarrassing intentness then she broke out  you have an honest face be honest like your face sir and tell me what you want and what you are afraid of do you think i could hurt you i believe you have far more power to injure me and yet you do not look unkind what do you meanyou a gentlemanby skulking like a spy about this desolate place tell me she said who is it you hate  i hate no one i answered and i fear no one face to face my name is cassilisfrank cassilis i lead the life of a vagabond for my own good pleasure i am one of northmours oldest friends and three nights ago when i addressed him on these links he stabbed me in the shoulder with a knife  it was you she said  why he did so i continued disregarding the interruption is more than i can guess and more than i care to know i have not many friends nor am i very susceptible to friendship but no man shall drive me from a place by terror i had camped in graden seawood ere he came i camp in it still if you think i mean harm to you or yours madam the remedy is in your hand tell him that my camp is in the hemlock den and tonight he can stab me in safety while i sleep  with this i doffed my cap to her and scrambled up once more among the sandhills i do not know why but i felt a prodigious sense of injustice and felt like a hero and a martyr while as a matter of fact i had not a word to say in my defence nor so much as one plausible reason to offer for my conduct i had stayed at graden out of a curiosity natural enough but undignified and though there was another motive growing in along with the first it was not one which at that period i could have properly explained to the lady of my heart  certainly that night i thought of no one else and though her whole conduct and position seemed suspicious i could not find it in my heart to entertain a doubt of her integrity i could have staked my life that she was clear of blame and though all was dark at the present that the explanation of the mystery would show her part in these events to be both right and needful it was true let me cudgel my imagination as i pleased that i could invent no theory of her relations to northmour but i felt none the less sure of my conclusion because it was founded on instinct in place of reason and as i may say went to sleep that night with the thought of her under my pillow  next day she came out about the same hour alone and as soon as the sandhills concealed her from the pavilion drew nearer to the edge and called me by name in guarded tones i was astonished to observe that she was deadly pale and seemingly under the influence of strong emotion  mr cassilis she cried mr cassilis  i appeared at once and leaped down upon the beach a remarkable air of relief overspread her countenance as soon as she saw me  oh she cried with a hoarse sound like one whose bosom has been lightened of a weight and then thank god you are still safe she added i knew if you were you would be here was not this strange so swiftly and wisely does nature prepare our hearts for these great lifelong intimacies that both my wife and i had been given a presentiment on this the second day of our acquaintance i had even then hoped that she would seek me she had felt sure that she would find me do not she went on swiftly do not stay in this place promise me that you will sleep no longer in that wood you do not know how i suffer all last night i could not sleep for thinking of your peril  peril i repeated peril from whom from northmour  not so she said did you think i would tell him after what you said  not from northmour i repeated then how from whom i see none to be afraid of  you must not ask me was her reply for i am not free to tell you only believe me and go hencebelieve me and go away quickly quickly for your life  an appeal to his alarm is never a good plan to rid oneself of a spirited young man my obstinacy was but increased by what she said and i made it a point of honour to remain and her solicitude for my safety still more confirmed me in the resolve  you must not think me inquisitive madam i replied but if graden is so dangerous a place you yourself perhaps remain here at some risk  she only looked at me reproachfully  you and your father i resumed but she interrupted me almost with a gasp  my father how do you know that she cried  i saw you together when you landed was my answer and i do not know why but it seemed satisfactory to both of us as indeed it was the truth but i continued you need have no fear from me i see you have some reason to be secret and you may believe me your secret is as safe with me as if i were in graden floe i have scarce spoken to any one for years my horse is my only companion and even he poor beast is not beside me you see then you may count on me for silence so tell me the truth my dear young lady are you not in danger  mr northmour says you are an honourable man she returned and i believe it when i see you i will tell you so much you are right we are in dreadful dreadful danger and you share it by remaining where you are  ah said i you have heard of me from northmour and he gives me a good character  i asked him about you last night was her reply i pretended she hesitated i pretended to have met you long ago and spoken to you of him it was not true but i could not help myself without betraying you and you had put me in a difficulty he praised you highly  andyou may permit me one questiondoes this danger come from northmour i asked  from mr northmour she cried oh no he stays with us to share it  while you propose that i should run away i said you do not rate me very high  why should you stay she asked you are no friend of ours  i know not what came over me for i had not been conscious of a similar weakness since i was a child but i was so mortified by this retort that my eyes pricked and filled with tears as i continued to gaze upon her face  no no she said in a changed voice i did not mean the words unkindly  it was i who offended i said and i held out my hand with a look of appeal that somehow touched her for she gave me hers at once and even eagerly i held it for a while in mine and gazed into her eyes it was she who first tore her hand away and forgetting all about her request and the promise she had sought to extort ran at the top of her speed and without turning till she was out of sight and then i knew that i loved her and thought in my glad heart that sheshe herselfwas not indifferent to my suit many a time she has denied it in after days but it was with a smiling and not a serious denial for my part i am sure our hands would not have lain so closely in each other if she had not begun to melt to me already and when all is said it is no great contention since by her own avowal she began to love me on the morrow  and yet on the morrow very little took place she came and called me down as on the day before upbraided me for lingering at graden and when she found i was still obdurate began to ask me more particularly as to my arrival i told her by what series of accidents i had come to witness their disembarkation and how i had determined to remain partly from the interest which had been wakened in me by northmours guests and partly because of his own murderous attack as to the former i fear i was disingenuous and led her to regard herself as having been an attraction to me from the first moment that i saw her on the links it relieves my heart to make this confession even now when my wife is with god and already knows all things and the honesty of my purpose even in this for while she lived although it often pricked my conscience i had never the hardihood to undeceive her even a little secret in such a married life as ours is like the roseleaf which kept the princess from her sleep  from this the talk branched into other subjects and i told her much about my lonely and wandering existence she for her part giving ear and saying little although we spoke very naturally and latterly on topics that might seem indifferent we were both sweetly agitated too soon it was time for her to go and we separated as if by mutual consent without shaking hands for both knew that between us it was no idle ceremony  the next and that was the fourth day of our acquaintance we met in the same spot but early in the morning with much familiarity and yet much timidity on either side when she had once more spoken about my dangerand that i understood was her excuse for comingi who had prepared a great deal of talk during the night began to tell her how highly i valued her kind interest and how no one had ever cared to hear about my life nor had i ever cared to relate it before yesterday suddenly she interrupted me saying with vehemence  and yet if you knew who i was you would not so much as speak to me  i told her such a thought was madness and little as we had met i counted her already a dear friend but my protestations seemed only to make her more desperate  my father is in hiding she cried  my dear i said forgetting for the first time to add young lady what do i care if he were in hiding twenty times over would it make one thought of change in you  ah but the cause she cried the cause it is she faltered for a secondit is disgraceful to us     chapter iv  tells in what a startling manner i learned that i was not alone in graden seawood   this was my wifes story as i drew it from her among tears and sobs her name was clara huddlestone it sounded very beautiful in my ears but not so beautiful as that other name of clara cassilis which she wore during the longer and i thank god the happier portion of her life her father bernard huddlestone had been a private banker in a very large way of business many years before his affairs becoming disordered he had been led to try dangerous and at last criminal expedients to retrieve himself from ruin all was in vain he became more and more cruelly involved and found his honour lost at the same moment with his fortune about this period northmour had been courting his daughter with great assiduity though with small encouragement and to him knowing him thus disposed in his favour bernard huddlestone turned for help in his extremity it was not merely ruin and dishonour nor merely a legal condemnation that the unhappy man had brought upon his head it seems he could have gone to prison with a light heart what he feared what kept him awake at night or recalled him from slumber into frenzy was some secret sudden and unlawful attempt upon his life hence he desired to bury his existence and escape to one of the islands in the south pacific and it was in northmours yacht the red earl that he designed to go the yacht picked them up clandestinely upon the coast of wales and had once more deposited them at graden till she could be refitted and provisioned for the longer voyage nor could clara doubt that her hand had been stipulated as the price of passage for although northmour was neither unkind nor even discourteous he had shown himself in several instances somewhat overbold in speech and manner  i listened i need not say with fixed attention and put many questions as to the more mysterious part it was in vain she had no clear idea of what the blow was nor of how it was expected to fall her fathers alarm was unfeigned and physically prostrating and he had thought more than once of making an unconditional surrender to the police but the scheme was finally abandoned for he was convinced that not even the strength of our english prisons could shelter him from his pursuers he had had many affairs with italy and with italians resident in london in the later years of his business and these last as clara fancied were somehow connected with the doom that threatened him he had shown great terror at the presence of an italian seaman on board the red earl and had bitterly and repeatedly accused northmour in consequence the latter had protested that beppo that was the seamans name was a capital fellow and could be trusted to the death but mr huddlestone had continued ever since to declare that all was lost that it was only a question of days and that beppo would be the ruin of him yet  i regarded the whole story as the hallucination of a mind shaken by calamity he had suffered heavy loss by his italian transactions and hence the sight of an italian was hateful to him and the principal part in his nightmare would naturally enough be played by one of that nation  what your father wants i said is a good doctor and some calming medicine  but mr northmour objected your mother he is untroubled by losses and yet he shares in this terror  i could not help laughing at what i considered her simplicity  my dear said i you have told me yourself what reward he has to look for all is fair in love you must remember and if northmour foments your fathers terrors it is not at all because he is afraid of any italian man but simply because he is infatuated with a charming english woman  she reminded me of his attack upon myself on the night of the disembarkation and this i was unable to explain in short and from one thing to another it was agreed between us that i should set out at once for the fisher village gradenwester as it is called look up all the newspapers i could find and see for myself if there seemed any basis of fact for these continued alarms the next morning at the same hour and place i was to make my report to clara she said no more on that occasion about my departure nor indeed did she make it a secret that she clung to the thought of my proximity as something helpful and pleasant and for my part i could not have left her if she had gone upon her knees to ask it  i reached gradenwester before ten in the forenoon for in those days i was an excellent pedestrian and the distance as i think i have said was little over seven miles fine walking all the way upon the springy turf the village is one of the bleakest on that coast which is saying much there is a church in a hollow a miserable haven in the rocks where many boats have been lost as they returned from fishing two or three score of stone houses arranged along the beach and in two streets one leading from the harbour and another striking out from it at right angles and at the corner of these two a very dark and cheerless tavern by way of principal hotel  i had dressed myself somewhat more suitably to my station in life and at once called upon the minister in his little manse beside the graveyard he knew me although it was more than nine years since we had met and when i told him that i had been long upon a walking tour and was behind with the news readily lent me an armful of newspapers dating from a month back to the day before with these i sought the tavern and ordering some breakfast sat down to study the huddlestone failure  it had been it appeared a very flagrant case thousands of persons were reduced to poverty and one in particular had blown out his brains as soon as payment was suspended it was strange to myself that while i read these details i continued rather to sympathise with mr huddlestone than with his victims so complete already was the empire of my love for my wife a price was naturally set upon the bankers head and as the case was inexcusable and the public indignation thoroughly aroused the unusual figure of ¬£750 was offered for his capture he was reported to have large sums of money in his possession one day he had been heard of in spain the next there was sure intelligence that he was still lurking between manchester and liverpool or along the border of wales and the day after a telegram would announce his arrival in cuba or yucatan but in all this there was no word of an italian nor any sign of mystery  in the very last paper however there was one item not so clear the accountants who were charged to verify the failure had it seemed come upon the traces of a very large number of thousands which figured for some time in the transactions of the house of huddlestone but which came from nowhere and disappeared in the same mysterious fashion it was only once referred to by name and then under the initials xx but it had plainly been floated for the first time into the business at a period of great depression some six years ago the name of a distinguished royal personage had been mentioned by rumour in connection with this sum the cowardly desperadosuch i remember was the editorial expressionwas supposed to have escaped with a large part of this mysterious fund still in his possession  i was still brooding over the fact and trying to torture it into some connection with mr huddlestones danger when a man entered the tavern and asked for some bread and cheese with a decided foreign accent  siete italiano said i  si signor was his reply  i said it was unusually far north to find one of his compatriots at which he shrugged his shoulders and replied that a man would go anywhere to find work what work he could hope to find at gradenwester i was totally unable to conceive and the incident struck so unpleasantly upon my mind that i asked the landlord while he was counting me some change whether he had ever before seen an italian in the village he said he had once seen some norwegians who had been shipwrecked on the other side of graden ness and rescued by the lifeboat from cauldhaven  no said i but an italian like the man who had just had bread and cheese  what cried he yon blackavised fellow wi the teeth was he an italian weel yons the first that ever i saw an i daresay hes like to be the last  even as he was speaking i raised my eyes and casting a glance into the street beheld three men in earnest conversation together and not thirty yards away one of them was my recent companion in the tavern parlour the other two by their handsome sallow features and soft hats should evidently belong to the same race a crowd of village children stood around them gesticulating and talking gibberish in imitation the trio looked singularly foreign to the bleak dirty street in which they were standing and the dark grey heaven that overspread them and i confess my incredulity received at that moment a shock from which it never recovered i might reason with myself as i pleased but i could not argue down the effect of what i had seen and i began to share in the italian terror  it was already drawing towards the close of the day before i had returned the newspapers at the manse and got well forward on to the links on my way home i shall never forget that walk it grew very cold and boisterous the wind sang in the short grass about my feet thin rain showers came running on the gusts and an immense mountain range of clouds began to arise out of the bosom of the sea it would be hard to imagine a more dismal evening and whether it was from these external influences or because my nerves were already affected by what i had heard and seen my thoughts were as gloomy as the weather  the upper windows of the pavilion commanded a considerable spread of links in the direction of gradenwester to avoid observation it was necessary to hug the beach until i had gained cover from the higher sandhills on the little headland when i might strike across through the hollows for the margin of the wood the sun was about setting the tide was low and all the quicksands uncovered and i was moving along lost in unpleasant thought when i was suddenly thunderstruck to perceive the prints of human feet they ran parallel to my own course but low down upon the beach instead of along the border of the turf and when i examined them i saw at once by the size and coarseness of the impression that it was a stranger to me and to those in the pavilion who had recently passed that way not only so but from the recklessness of the course which he had followed steering near to the most formidable portions of the sand he was as evidently a stranger to the country and to the illrepute of graden beach  step by step i followed the prints until a quarter of a mile farther i beheld them die away into the southeastern boundary of graden floe there whoever he was the miserable man had perished one or two gulls who had perhaps seen him disappear wheeled over his sepulchre with their usual melancholy piping the sun had broken through the clouds by a last effort and coloured the wide level of quicksands with a dusky purple i stood for some time gazing at the spot chilled and disheartened by my own reflections and with a strong and commanding consciousness of death i remember wondering how long the tragedy had taken and whether his screams had been audible at the pavilion and then making a strong resolution i was about to tear myself away when a gust fiercer than usual fell upon this quarter of the beach and i saw now whirling high in air now skimming lightly across the surface of the sands a soft black felt hat somewhat conical in shape such as i had remarked already on the heads of the italians  i believe but i am not sure that i uttered a cry the wind was driving the hat shoreward and i ran round the border of the floe to be ready against its arrival the gust fell dropping the hat for a while upon the quicksand and then once more freshening landed it a few yards from where i stood i seized it with the interest you may imagine it had seen some service indeed it was rustier than either of those i had seen that day upon the street the lining was red stamped with the name of the maker which i have forgotten and that of the place of manufacture venedig this it is not yet forgotten was the name given by the austrians to the beautiful city of venice then and for long after a part of their dominions  the shock was complete i saw imaginary italians upon every side and for the first and i may say for the last time in my experience became overpowered by what is called a panic terror i knew nothing that is to be afraid of and yet i submit that i was heartily afraid and it was with a sensible reluctance that i returned to my exposed and solitary camp in the seawood  there i ate some cold porridge which had been left over from the night before for i was disinclined to make a fire and feeling strengthened and reassured dismissed all these fanciful terrors from my mind and lay down to sleep with composure  how long i may have slept it is impossible for me to guess but i was awakened at last by a sudden blinding flash of light into my face it woke me like a blow in an instant i was upon my knees but the light had gone as suddenly as it came the darkness was intense and as it was blowing great guns from the sea and pouring with rain the noises of the storm effectually concealed all others  it was i daresay half a minute before i regained my selfpossession but for two circumstances i should have thought i had been awakened by some new and vivid form of nightmare first the flap of my tent which i had shut carefully when i retired was now unfastened and second i could still perceive with a sharpness that excluded any theory of hallucination the smell of hot metal and of burning oil the conclusion was obvious i had been wakened by some one flashing a bullseye lantern in my face it had been but a flash and away he had seen my face and then gone i asked myself the object of so strange a proceeding and the answer came pat the man whoever he was had thought to recognise me and he had not there was yet another question unresolved and to this i may say i feared to give an answer if he had recognised me what would he have done  my fears were immediately diverted from myself for i saw that i had been visited in a mistake and i became persuaded that some dreadful danger threatened the pavilion it required some nerve to issue forth into the black and intricate thicket which surrounded and overhung the den but i groped my way to the links drenched with rain beaten upon and deafened by the gusts and fearing at every step to lay my hand upon some lurking adversary the darkness was so complete that i might have been surrounded by an army and yet none the wiser and the uproar of the gale so loud that my hearing was as useless as my sight  for the rest of that night which seemed interminably long i patrolled the vicinity of the pavilion without seeing a living creature or hearing any noise but the concert of the wind the sea and the rain a light in the upper story filtered through a cranny of the shutter and kept me company till the approach of dawn     chapter v  tells of an interview between northmour clara and myself   with the first peep of day i retired from the open to my old lair among the sandhills there to await the coming of my wife the morning was grey wild and melancholy the wind moderated before sunrise and then went about and blew in puffs from the shore the sea began to go down but the rain still fell without mercy over all the wilderness of links there was not a creature to be seen yet i felt sure the neighbourhood was alive with skulking foes the light had been so suddenly and surprisingly flashed upon my face as i lay sleeping and the hat that had been blown ashore by the wind from over graden floe were two speaking signals of the peril that environed clara and the party in the pavilion  it was perhaps halfpast seven or nearer eight before i saw the door open and that dear figure come towards me in the rain i was waiting for her on the beach before she had crossed the sandhills  i have had such trouble to come she cried they did not wish me to go walking in the rain  clara i said you are not frightened  no said she with a simplicity that filled my heart with confidence for my wife was the bravest as well as the best of women in my experience i have not found the two go always together but with her they did and she combined the extreme of fortitude with the most endearing and beautiful virtues  i told her what had happened and though her cheek grew visibly paler she retained perfect control over her senses  you see now that i am safe said i in conclusion they do not mean to harm me for had they chosen i was a dead man last night  she laid her hand upon my arm  and i had no presentiment she cried  her accent thrilled me with delight i put my arm about her and strained her to my side and before either of us was aware her hands were on my shoulders and my lips upon her mouth yet up to that moment no word of love had passed between us to this day i remember the touch of her cheek which was wet and cold with the rain and many a time since when she has been washing her face i have kissed it again for the sake of that morning on the beach now that she is taken from me and i finish my pilgrimage alone i recall our old lovingkindnesses and the deep honesty and affection which united us and my present loss seems but a trifle in comparison  we may have thus stood for some secondsfor time passes quickly with loversbefore we were startled by a peal of laughter close at hand it was not natural mirth but seemed to be affected in order to conceal an angrier feeling we both turned though i still kept my left arm about claras waist nor did she seek to withdraw herself and there a few paces off upon the beach stood northmour his head lowered his hands behind his back his nostrils white with passion  ah cassilis he said as i disclosed my face  that same said i for i was not at all put about  and so miss huddlestone he continued slowly but savagely this is how you keep your faith to your father and to me this is the value you set upon your fathers life and you are so infatuated with this young gentleman that you must brave ruin and decency and common human caution  miss huddlestone i was beginning to interrupt him when he in his turn cut in brutally  you hold your tongue said he i am speaking to that girl  that girl as you call her is my wife said i and my wife only leaned a little nearer so that i knew she had affirmed my words  your what he cried you lie  northmour i said we all know you have a bad temper and i am the last man to be irritated by words for all that i propose that you speak lower for i am convinced that we are not alone  he looked round him and it was plain my remark had in some degree sobered his passion what do you mean he asked  i only said one word italians  he swore a round oath and looked at us from one to the other  mr cassilis knows all that i know said my wife  what i want to know he broke out is where the devil mr cassilis comes from and what the devil mr cassilis is doing here you say you are married that i do not believe if you were graden floe would soon divorce you four minutes and a half cassilis i keep my private cemetery for my friends  it took somewhat longer said i for that italian  he looked at me for a moment halfdaunted and then almost civilly asked me to tell my story you have too much the advantage of me cassilis he added i complied of course and he listened with several ejaculations while i told him how i had come to graden that it was i whom he had tried to murder on the night of landing and what i had subsequently seen and heard of the italians  well said he when i had done it is here at last there is no mistake about that and what may i ask do you propose to do  i propose to stay with you and lend a hand said i  you are a brave man he returned with a peculiar intonation  i am not afraid said i  and so he continued i am to understand that you two are married and you stand up to it before my face miss huddlestone  we are not yet married said clara but we shall be as soon as we can  bravo cried northmour and the bargain dn it youre not a fool young woman i may call a spade a spade with you how about the bargain you know as well as i do what your fathers life depends upon i have only to put my hands under my coattails and walk away and his throat would be cut before the evening  yes mr northmour returned clara with great spirit but that is what you will never do you made a bargain that was unworthy of a gentleman but you are gentleman for all that and you will never desert a man whom you have begun to help  aha said he you think i will give my yacht for nothing you think i will risk my life and liberty for love of the old gentleman and then i suppose be bestman at the wedding to wind up well he added with an odd smile perhaps you are not altogether wrong but ask cassilis here he knows me am i a man to trust am i safe and scrupulous am i kind  i know you talk a great deal and sometimes i think very foolishly replied clara but i know you are a gentleman and i am not the least afraid  he looked at her with a peculiar approval and admiration then turning to me do you think i would give her up without a struggle frank said he i tell you plainly you look out the next time we come to blows  will make the third i interrupted smiling  ay true so it will he said i had forgotten well the third times lucky  the third time you mean you will have the crew of the red earl to help i said  do you hear him he asked turning to my wife  i hear two men speaking like cowards said she i should despise myself either to think or speak like that and neither of you believe one word that you are saying which makes it the more wicked and silly  shes a trump cried northmour but shes not yet mrs cassilis i say no more the present is not for me  then my wife surprised me  i leave you here she said suddenly my father has been too long alone but remember this you are to be friends for you are both good friends to me  she has since told me her reason for this step as long as she remained she declares that we two should have continued to quarrel and i suppose that she was right for when she was gone we fell at once into a sort of confidentiality  northmour stared after her as she went away over the sandhill  she is the only woman in the world he exclaimed with an oath look at her action  i for my part leaped at this opportunity for a little further light  see here northmour said i we are all in a tight place are we not  i believe you my boy he answered looking me in the eyes and with great emphasis we have all hell upon us thats the truth you may believe me or not but im afraid of my life  tell me one thing said i what are they after these italians what do they want with mr huddlestone  dont you know he cried the black old scamp had carbonaro funds on a deposittwo hundred and eighty thousand and of course he gambled it away on stocks there was to have been a revolution in the tridentino or parma but the revolution is off and the whole wasps nest is after huddlestone we shall all be lucky if we can save our skins  the carbonari i exclaimed god help him indeed  amen said northmour and now look here i have said that we are in a fix and frankly i shall be glad of your help if i cant save huddlestone i want at least to save the girl come and stay in the pavilion and theres my hand on it i shall act as your friend until the old man is either clear or dead but he added once that is settled you become my rival once again and i warn youmind yourself  done said i and we shook hands  and now let us go directly to the fort said northmour and he began to lead the way through the rain     chapter vi  tells of my introduction to the tall man   we were admitted to the pavilion by clara and i was surprised by the completeness and security of the defences a barricade of great strength and yet easy to displace supported the door against any violence from without and the shutters of the diningroom into which i was led directly and which was feebly illuminated by a lamp were even more elaborately fortified the panels were strengthened by bars and crossbars and these in their turn were kept in position by a system of braces and struts some abutting on the floor some on the roof and others in fine against the opposite wall of the apartment it was at once a solid and welldesigned piece of carpentry and i did not seek to conceal my admiration  i am the engineer said northmour you remember the planks in the garden behold them  i did not know you had so many talents said i  are you armed he continued pointing to an array of guns and pistols all in admirable order which stood in line against the wall or were displayed upon the sideboard  thank you i returned i have gone armed since our last encounter but to tell you the truth i have had nothing to eat since early yesterday evening  northmour produced some cold meat to which i eagerly set myself and a bottle of good burgundy by which wet as i was i did not scruple to profit i have always been an extreme temperance man on principle but it is useless to push principle to excess and on this occasion i believe that i finished threequarters of the bottle as i ate i still continued to admire the preparations for defence  we could stand a siege i said at length  yees drawled northmour a very little one perhaps it is not so much the strength of the pavilion i misdoubt it is the double danger that kills me if we get to shooting wild as the country is some one is sure to hear it and thenwhy then its the same thing only different as they say caged by law or killed by carbonari theres the choice it is a devilish bad thing to have the law against you in this world and so i tell the old gentleman upstairs he is quite of my way of thinking  speaking of that said i what kind of person is he  oh he cried the other hes a rancid fellow as far as he goes i should like to have his neck wrung tomorrow by all the devils in italy i am not in this affair for him you take me i made a bargain for missys hand and i mean to have it too  that by the way said i i understand but how will mr huddlestone take my intrusion  leave that to clara returned northmour  i could have struck him in the face for this coarse familiarity but i respected the truce as i am bound to say did northmour and so long as the danger continued not a cloud arose in our relation i bear him this testimony with the most unfeigned satisfaction nor am i without pride when i look back upon my own behaviour for surely no two men were ever left in a position so invidious and irritating  as soon as i had done eating we proceeded to inspect the lower floor window by window we tried the different supports now and then making an inconsiderable change and the strokes of the hammer sounded with startling loudness through the house i proposed i remember to make loopholes but he told me they were already made in the windows of the upper story it was an anxious business this inspection and left me downhearted there were two doors and five windows to protect and counting clara only four of us to defend them against an unknown number of foes i communicated my doubts to northmour who assured me with unmoved composure that he entirely shared them  before morning said he we shall all be butchered and buried in graden floe for me that is written  i could not help shuddering at the mention of the quicksand but reminded northmour that our enemies had spared me in the wood  do not flatter yourself said he then you were not in the same boat with the old gentleman now you are its the floe for all of us mark my words  i trembled for clara and just then her dear voice was heard calling us to come upstairs northmour showed me the way and when he had reached the landing knocked at the door of what used to be called my uncles bedroom as the founder of the pavilion had designed it especially for himself  come in northmour come in dear mr cassilis said a voice from within  pushing open the door northmour admitted me before him into the apartment as i came in i could see the daughter slipping out by the sidedoor into the study which had been prepared as her bedroom in the bed which was drawn back against the wall instead of standing as i had last seen it boldly across the window sat bernard huddlestone the defaulting banker little as i had seen of him by the shifting light of the lantern on the links i had no difficulty in recognising him for the same he had a long and sallow countenance surrounded by a long red beard and sidewhiskers his broken nose and high cheekbones gave him somewhat the air of a kalmuck and his light eyes shone with the excitement of a high fever he wore a skullcap of black silk a huge bible lay open before him on the bed with a pair of gold spectacles in the place and a pile of other books lay on the stand by his side the green curtains lent a cadaverous shade to his cheek and as he sat propped on pillows his great stature was painfully hunched and his head protruded till it overhung his knees i believe if he had not died otherwise he must have fallen a victim to consumption in the course of but a very few weeks  he held out to me a hand long thin and disagreeably hairy  come in come in mr cassilis said he another protectorahemanother protector always welcome as a friend of my daughters mr cassilis how they have rallied about me my daughters friends may god in heaven bless and reward them for it  i gave him my hand of course because i could not help it but the sympathy i had been prepared to feel for claras father was immediately soured by his appearance and the wheedling unreal tones in which he spoke  cassilis is a good man said northmour worth ten  so i hear cried mr huddlestone eagerly so my girl tells me ah mr cassilis my sin has found me out you see i am very low very low but i hope equally penitent we must all come to the throne of grace at last mr cassilis for my part i come late indeed but with unfeigned humility i trust  fiddlededee said northmour roughly  no no dear northmour cried the banker you must not say that you must not try to shake me you forget my dear good boy you forget i may be called this very night before my maker  his excitement was pitiful to behold and i felt myself grow indignant with northmour whose infidel opinions i well knew and heartily derided as he continued to taunt the poor sinner out of his humour of repentance  pooh my dear huddlestone said he you do yourself injustice you are a man of the world inside and out and were up to all kinds of mischief before i was born your conscience is tanned like south american leatheronly you forgot to tan your liver and that if you will believe me is the seat of the annoyance  rogue rogue bad boy said mr huddlestone shaking his finger i am no precisian if you come to that i always hated a precisian but i never lost hold of something better through it all i have been a bad boy mr cassilis i do not seek to deny that but it was after my wifes death and you know with a widower its a different thing sinfuli wont say no but there is a gradation we shall hope and talking of that hark he broke out suddenly his hand raised his fingers spread his face racked with interest and terror only the rain bless god he added after a pause and with indescribable relief  for some seconds he lay back among the pillows like a man near to fainting then he gathered himself together and in somewhat tremulous tones began once more to thank me for the share i was prepared to take in his defence  one question sir said i when he had paused is it true that you have money with you  he seemed annoyed by the question but admitted with reluctance that he had a little  well i continued it is their money they are after is it not why not give it up to them  ah replied he shaking his head i have tried that already mr cassilis and alas that it should be so but it is blood they want  huddlestone thats a little less than fair said northmour you should mention that what you offered them was upwards of two hundred thousand short the deficit is worth a reference it is for what they call a cool sum frank then you see the fellows reason in their clear italian way and it seems to them as indeed it seems to me that they may just as well have both while theyre about itmoney and blood together by george and no more trouble for the extra pleasure  is it in the pavilion i asked  it is and i wish it were in the bottom of the sea instead said northmour and then suddenlywhat are you making faces at me for he cried to mr huddlestone on whom i had unconsciously turned my back do you think cassilis would sell you  mr huddlestone protested that nothing had been further from his mind  it is a good thing retorted northmour in his ugliest manner you might end by wearying uswhat were you going to say he added turning to me  i was going to propose an occupation for the afternoon said i let us carry that money out piece by piece and lay it down before the pavilion door if the carbonari come why its theirs at any rate  no no cried mr huddlestone it does not it cannot belong to them it should be distributed pro rata among all my creditors  come now huddlestone said northmour none of that  well but my daughter moaned the wretched man  your daughter will do well enough here are two suitors cassilis and i neither of us beggars between whom she has to choose and as for yourself to make an end of arguments you have no right to a farthing and unless im much mistaken you are going to die  it was certainly very cruelly said but mr huddlestone was a man who attracted little sympathy and although i saw him wince and shudder i mentally endorsed the rebuke nay i added a contribution of my own  northmour and i i said are willing enough to help you to save your life but not to escape with stolen property  he struggled for a while with himself as though he were on the point of giving way to anger but prudence had the best of the controversy  my dear boys he said do with me or my money what you will i leave all in your hands let me compose myself  and so we left him gladly enough i am sure the last that i saw he had once more taken up his great bible and with tremulous hands was adjusting his spectacles to read     chapter vii  tells how a word was cried through the pavilion window   the recollection of that afternoon will always be graven on my mind northmour and i were persuaded that an attack was imminent and if it had been in our power to alter in any way the order of events that power would have been used to precipitate rather than delay the critical moment the worst was to be anticipated yet we could conceive no extremity so miserable as the suspense we were now suffering i have never been an eager though always a great reader but i never knew books so insipid as those which i took up and cast aside that afternoon in the pavilion even talk became impossible as the hours went on one or other was always listening for some sound or peering from an upstairs window over the links and yet not a sign indicated the presence of our foes  we debated over and over again my proposal with regard to the money and had we been in complete possession of our faculties i am sure we should have condemned it as unwise but we were flustered with alarm grasped at a straw and determined although it was as much as advertising mr huddlestones presence in the pavilion to carry my proposal into effect  the sum was part in specie part in bank paper and part in circular notes payable to the name of james gregory we took it out counted it enclosed it once more in a despatchbox belonging to northmour and prepared a letter in italian which he tied to the handle it was signed by both of us under oath and declared that this was all the money which had escaped the failure of the house of huddlestone this was perhaps the maddest action ever perpetrated by two persons professing to be sane had the despatchbox fallen into other hands than those for which it was intended we stood criminally convicted on our own written testimony but as i have said we were neither of us in a condition to judge soberly and had a thirst for action that drove us to do something right or wrong rather than endure the agony of waiting moreover as we were both convinced that the hollows of the links were alive with hidden spies upon our movements we hoped that our appearance with the box might lead to a parley and perhaps a compromise  it was nearly three when we issued from the pavilion the rain had taken off the sun shone quite cheerfully i have never seen the gulls fly so close about the house or approach so fearlessly to human beings on the very doorstep one flapped heavily past our heads and uttered its wild cry in my very ear  there is an omen for you said northmour who like all freethinkers was much under the influence of superstition they think we are already dead  i made some light rejoinder but it was with half my heart for the circumstance had impressed me  a yard or two before the gate on a patch of smooth turf we set down the despatchbox and northmour waved a white handkerchief over his head nothing replied we raised our voices and cried aloud in italian that we were there as ambassadors to arrange the quarrel but the stillness remained unbroken save by the seagulls and the surf i had a weight at my heart when we desisted and i saw that even northmour was unusually pale he looked over his shoulder nervously as though he feared that some one had crept between him and the pavilion door  by god he said in a whisper this is too much for me  i replied in the same key suppose there should be none after all  look there he returned nodding with his head as though he had been afraid to point  i glanced in the direction indicated and there from the northern quarter of the seawood beheld a thin column of smoke rising steadily against the now cloudless sky  northmour i said we still continued to talk in whispers it is not possible to endure this suspense i prefer death fifty times over stay you here to watch the pavilion i will go forward and make sure if i have to walk right into their camp  he looked once again all round him with puckered eyes and then nodded assentingly to my proposal  my heart beat like a sledgehammer as i set out walking rapidly in the direction of the smoke and though up to that moment i had felt chill and shivering i was suddenly conscious of a glow of heat over all my body the ground in this direction was very uneven a hundred men might have lain hidden in as many square yards about my path but i had not practised the business in vain chose such routes as cut at the very root of concealment and by keeping along the most convenient ridges commanded several hollows at a time it was not long before i was rewarded for my caution coming suddenly on to a mound somewhat more elevated than the surrounding hummocks i saw not thirty yards away a man bent almost double and running as fast as his attitude permitted along the bottom of a gully i had dislodged one of the spies from his ambush as soon as i sighted him i called loudly both in english and italian and he seeing concealment was no longer possible straightened himself out leaped from the gully and made off as straight as an arrow for the borders of the wood  it was none of my business to pursue i had learned what i wantedthat we were beleaguered and watched in the pavilion and i returned at once and walking as nearly as possible in my old footsteps to where northmour awaited me beside the despatchbox he was even paler than when i had left him and his voice shook a little  could you see what he was like he asked  he kept his back turned i replied  let us get into the house frank i dont think im a coward but i can stand no more of this he whispered  all was still and sunshiny about the pavilion as we turned to reenter it even the gulls had flown in a wider circuit and were seen flickering along the beach and sandhills and this loneliness terrified me more than a regiment under arms it was not until the door was barricaded that i could draw a full inspiration and relieve the weight that lay upon my bosom northmour and i exchanged a steady glance and i suppose each made his own reflections on the white and startled aspect of the other  you were right i said all is over shake hands old man for the last time  yes replied he i will shake hands for as sure as i am here i bear no malice but remember if by some impossible accident we should give the slip to these blackguards ill take the upper hand of you by fair or foul  oh said i you weary me  he seemed hurt and walked away in silence to the foot of the stairs where he paused  you do not understand said he i am not a swindler and i guard myself that is all it may weary you or not mr cassilis i do not care a rush i speak for my own satisfaction and not for your amusement you had better go upstairs and court the girl for my part i stay here  and i stay with you i returned do you think i would steal a march even with your permission  frank he said smiling its a pity you are an ass for you have the makings of a man i think i must be fey today you cannot irritate me even when you try do you know he continued softly i think we are the two most miserable men in england you and i we have got on to thirty without wife or child or so much as a shop to look afterpoor pitiful lost devils both and now we clash about a girl as if there were not several millions in the united kingdom ah frank frank the one who loses this throw be it you or me he has my pity it were better for himhow does the bible saythat a millstone were hanged about his neck and he were cast into the depth of the sea let us take a drink he concluded suddenly but without any levity of tone  i was touched by his words and consented he sat down on the table in the diningroom and held up the glass of sherry to his eye  if you beat me frank he said i shall take to drink what will you do if it goes the other way  god knows i returned  well said he here is a toast in the meantime italia irredenta  the remainder of the day was passed in the same dreadful tedium and suspense i laid the table for dinner while northmour and clara prepared the meal together in the kitchen i could hear their talk as i went to and fro and was surprised to find it ran all the time upon myself northmour again bracketed us together and rallied clara on a choice of husbands but he continued to speak of me with some feeling and uttered nothing to my prejudice unless he included himself in the condemnation this awakened a sense of gratitude in my heart which combined with the immediateness of our peril to fill my eye with tears after all i thoughtand perhaps the thought was laughably vainwe were here three very noble human beings to perish in defence of a thieving banker  before we sat down to table i looked forth from an upstairs window the day was beginning to decline the links were utterly deserted the despatchbox still lay untouched where we had left it hours before  mr huddlestone in a long yellow dressinggown took one end of the table clara the other while northmour and i faced each other from the sides the lamp was brightly trimmed the wine was good the viands although mostly cold excellent of their sort we seemed to have agreed tacitly all reference to the impending catastrophe was carefully avoided and considering our tragic circumstances we made a merrier party than could have been expected from time to time it is true northmour or i would rise from table and make a round of the defences and on each of these occasions mr huddlestone was recalled to a sense of his tragic predicament glanced up with ghastly eyes and bore for an instant on his countenance the stamp of terror but he hastened to empty his glass wiped his forehead with his handkerchief and joined again in the conversation  i was astonished at the wit and information he displayed mr huddlestones was certainly no ordinary character he had read and observed for himself his gifts were sound and though i could never have learned to love the man i began to understand his success in business and the great respect in which he had been held before his failure he had above all the talent of society and though i never heard him speak but on this one and most unfavourable occasion i set him down among the most brilliant conversationalists i ever met  he was relating with great gusto and seemingly no feeling of shame the manoeuvres of a scoundrelly commission merchant whom he had known and studied in his youth and we were all listening with an odd mixture of mirth and embarrassment when our little party was brought abruptly to an end in the most startling manner  a noise like that of a wet finger on the windowpane interrupted mr huddlestones tale and in an instant we were all four as white as paper and sat tonguetied and motionless round the table  a snail i said at last for i had heard that these animals make a noise somewhat similar in character  snail be dd said northmour hush  the same sound was repeated twice at regular intervals and then a formidable voice shouted through the shutters the italian word traditore  mr huddlestone threw his head in the air his eyelids quivered next moment he fell insensible below the table northmour and i had each run to the armoury and seized a gun clara was on her feet with her hand at her throat  so we stood waiting for we thought the hour of attack was certainly come but second passed after second and all but the surf remained silent in the neighbourhood of the pavilion  quick said northmour upstairs with him before they come     chapter viii  tells the last of the tall man   somehow or other by hook and crook and between the three of us we got bernard huddlestone bundled upstairs and laid upon the bed in my uncles room during the whole process which was rough enough he gave no sign of consciousness and he remained as we had thrown him without changing the position of a finger his daughter opened his shirt and began to wet his head and bosom while northmour and i ran to the window the weather continued clear the moon which was now about full had risen and shed a very clear light upon the links yet strain our eyes as we might we could distinguish nothing moving a few dark spots more or less on the uneven expanse were not to be identified they might be crouching men they might be shadows it was impossible to be sure  thank god said northmour aggie is not coming tonight  aggie was the name of the old nurse he had not thought of her till now but that he should think of her at all was a trait that surprised me in the man  we were again reduced to waiting northmour went to the fireplace and spread his hands before the red embers as if he were cold i followed him mechanically with my eyes and in so doing turned my back upon the window at that moment a very faint report was audible from without and a ball shivered a pane of glass and buried itself in the shutter two inches from my head i heard clara scream and though i whipped instantly out of range and into a corner she was there so to speak before me beseeching to know if i were hurt i felt that i could stand to be shot at every day and all day long with such marks of solicitude for a reward and i continued to reassure her with the tenderest caresses and in complete forgetfulness of our situation till the voice of northmour recalled me to myself  an airgun he said they wish to make no noise  i put clara aside and looked at him he was standing with his back to the fire and his hands clasped behind him and i knew by the black look on his face that passion was boiling within i had seen just such a look before he attacked me that march night in the adjoining chamber and though i could make every allowance for his anger i confess i trembled for the consequences he gazed straight before him but he could see us with the tail of his eye and his temper kept rising like a gale of wind with regular battle awaiting us outside this prospect of an internecine strife within the walls began to daunt me  suddenly as i was thus closely watching his expression and prepared against the worst i saw a change a flash a look of relief upon his face he took up the lamp which stood beside him on the table and turned to us with an air of some excitement  there is one point that we must know said he are they going to butcher the lot of us or only huddlestone did they take you for him or fire at you for your own beaux yeux  they took me for him for certain i replied i am near as tall and my head is fair  i am going to make sure returned northmour and he stepped up to the window holding the lamp above his head and stood there quietly affronting death for half a minute  clara sought to rush forward and pull him from the place of danger but i had the pardonable selfishness to hold her back by force  yes said northmour turning coolly from the window its only huddlestone they want  oh mr northmour cried clara but found no more to add the temerity she had just witnessed seeming beyond the reach of words  he on his part looked at me cocking his head with a fire of triumph in his eyes and i understood at once that he had thus hazarded his life merely to attract claras notice and depose me from my position as the hero of the hour he snapped his fingers  the fire is only beginning said he when they warm up to their work they wont be so particular  a voice was now heard hailing us from the entrance from the window we could see the figure of a man in the moonlight he stood motionless his face uplifted to ours and a rag of something white on his extended arm and as we looked right down upon him though he was a good many yards distant on the links we could see the moonlight glitter on his eyes  he opened his lips again and spoke for some minutes on end in a key so loud that he might have been heard in every corner of the pavilion and as far away as the borders of the wood it was the same voice that had already shouted traditore through the shutters of the diningroom this time it made a complete and clear statement if the traitor oddlestone were given up all others should be spared if not no one should escape to tell the tale  well huddlestone what do you say to that asked northmour turning to the bed  up to that moment the banker had given no sign of life and i at least had supposed him to be still lying in a faint but he replied at once and in such tones as i have never heard elsewhere save from a delirious patient adjured and besought us not to desert him it was the most hideous and abject performance that my imagination can conceive  enough cried northmour and then he threw open the window leaned out into the night and in a tone of exultation and with a total forgetfulness of what was due to the presence of a lady poured out upon the ambassador a string of the most abominable raillery both in english and italian and bade him be gone where he had come from i believe that nothing so delighted northmour at that moment as the thought that we must all infallibly perish before the night was out  meantime the italian put his flag of truce into his pocket and disappeared at a leisurely pace among the sandhills  they make honourable war said northmour they are all gentlemen and soldiers for the credit of the thing i wish we could change sidesyou and i frank and you too missy my darlingand leave that being on the bed to some one else tut dont look shocked we are all going post to what they call eternity and may as well be aboveboard while theres time as far as im concerned if i could first strangle huddlestone and then get clara in my arms i could die with some pride and satisfaction and as it is by god ill have a kiss  before i could do anything to interfere he had rudely embraced and repeatedly kissed the resisting girl next moment i had pulled him away with fury and flung him heavily against the wall he laughed loud and long and i feared his wits had given way under the strain for even in the best of days he had been a sparing and a quiet laugher  now frank said he when his mirth was somewhat appeased its your turn heres my hand goodbye farewell then seeing me stand rigid and indignant and holding clara to my sideman he broke out are you angry did you think we were going to die with all the airs and graces of society i took a kiss im glad i had it and now you can take another if you like and square accounts  i turned from him with a feeling of contempt which i did not seek to dissemble  as you please said he youve been a prig in life a prig youll die  and with that he sat down on a chair a rifle over his knee and amused himself with snapping the lock but i could see that his ebullition of light spirits the only one i ever knew him to display had already come to an end and was succeeded by a sullen scowling humour  all this time our assailants might have been entering the house and we been none the wiser we had in truth almost forgotten the danger that so imminently overhung our days but just then mr huddlestone uttered a cry and leaped from the bed  i asked him what was wrong  fire he cried they have set the house on fire  northmour was on his feet in an instant and he and i ran through the door of communication with the study the room was illuminated by a red and angry light almost at the moment of our entrance a tower of flame arose in front of the window and with a tingling report a pane fell inwards on the carpet they had set fire to the leanto outhouse where northmour used to nurse his negatives  hot work said northmour let us try in your old room  we ran thither in a breath threw up the casement and looked forth along the whole back wall of the pavilion piles of fuel had been arranged and kindled and it is probable they had been drenched with mineral oil for in spite of the mornings rain they all burned bravely the fire had taken a firm hold already on the outhouse which blazed higher and higher every moment the backdoor was in the centre of a redhot bonfire the eaves we could see as we looked upward were already smouldering for the roof overhung and was supported by considerable beams of wood at the same time hot pungent and choking volumes of smoke began to fill the house there was not a human being to be seen to right or left  ah well said northmour heres the end thank god  and we returned to my uncles room mr huddlestone was putting on his boots still violently trembling but with an air of determination such as i had not hitherto observed clara stood close by him with her cloak in both hands ready to throw about her shoulders and a strange look in her eyes as if she were halfhopeful halfdoubtful of her father  well boys and girls said northmour how about a sally the oven is heating it is not good to stay here and be baked and for my part i want to come to my hands with them and be done  there is nothing else left i replied  and both clara and mr huddlestone though with a very different intonation added nothing  as we went downstairs the heat was excessive and the roaring of the fire filled our ears and we had scarce reached the passage before the stairs window fell in a branch of flame shot brandishing through the aperture and the interior of the pavilion became lit up with that dreadful and fluctuating glare at the same moment we heard the fall of something heavy and inelastic in the upper story the whole pavilion it was plain had gone alight like a box of matches and now not only flamed skyhigh to land and sea but threatened with every moment to crumble and fall in about our ears  northmour and i cocked our revolvers mr huddlestone who had already refused a firearm put us behind him with a manner of command  let clara open the door said he so if they fire a volley she will be protected and in the meantime stand behind me i am the scapegoat my sins have found me out  i heard him as i stood breathless by his shoulder with my pistol ready pattering off prayers in a tremulous rapid whisper and i confess horrid as the thought may seem i despised him for thinking of supplications in a moment so critical and thrilling in the meantime clara who was dead white but still possessed her faculties had displaced the barricade from the front door another moment and she had pulled it open firelight and moonlight illuminated the links with confused and changeful lustre and far away against the sky we could see a long trail of glowing smoke  mr huddlestone filled for the moment with a strength greater than his own struck northmour and myself a backhander in the chest and while we were thus for the moment incapacitated from action lifting his arms above his head like one about to dive he ran straight forward out of the pavilion  here am i he criedhuddlestone kill me and spare the others  his sudden appearance daunted i suppose our hidden enemies for northmour and i had time to recover to seize clara between us one by each arm and to rush forth to his assistance ere anything further had taken place but scarce had we passed the threshold when there came near a dozen reports and flashes from every direction among the hollows of the links mr huddlestone staggered uttered a weird and freezing cry threw up his arms over his head and fell backward on the turf  traditore traditore cried the invisible avengers  and just then a part of the roof of the pavilion fell in so rapid was the progress of the fire a loud vague and horrible noise accompanied the collapse and a vast volume of flame went soaring up to heaven it must have been visible at that moment from twenty miles out at sea from the shore at gradenwester and far inland from the peak of graystiel the most eastern summit of the caulder hills bernard huddlestone although god knows what were his obsequies had a fine pyre at the moment of his death     chapter ix  tells how northmour carried out his threat   i should have the greatest difficulty to tell you what followed next after this tragic circumstance it is all to me as i look back upon it mixed strenuous and ineffectual like the struggles of a sleeper in a nightmare clara i remember uttered a broken sigh and would have fallen forward to earth had not northmour and i supported her insensible body i do not think we were attacked i do not remember even to have seen an assailant and i believe we deserted mr huddlestone without a glance i only remember running like a man in a panic now carrying clara altogether in my own arms now sharing her weight with northmour now scuffling confusedly for the possession of that dear burden why we should have made for my camp in the hemlock den or how we reached it are points lost for ever to my recollection the first moment at which i became definitely sure clara had been suffered to fall against the outside of my little tent northmour and i were tumbling together on the ground and he with contained ferocity was striking for my head with the butt of his revolver he had already twice wounded me on the scalp and it is to the subsequent loss of blood that i am tempted to attribute the sudden clearness of my mind  i caught him by the wrist  northmour i remember saying you can kill me afterwards let us first attend to clara  he was at that moment uppermost scarcely had the words passed my lips when he had leaped to his feet and ran towards the tent and the next moment he was straining clara to his heart and covering her unconscious hands and face with his caresses  shame i cried shame to you northmour  and giddy though i still was i struck him repeatedly upon the head and shoulders  he relinquished his grasp and faced me in the broken moonlight  i had you under and i let you go said he and now you strike me coward  you are the coward i retorted did she wish your kisses while she was still sensible of what she wanted not she and now she may be dying and you waste this precious time and abuse her helplessness stand aside and let me help her  he confronted me for a moment white and menacing then suddenly he stepped aside  help her then said he  i threw myself on my knees beside her and loosened as well as i was able her dress and corset but while i was thus engaged a grasp descended on my shoulder  keep your hands off her said northmour fiercely do you think i have no blood in my veins  northmour i cried if you will neither help her yourself nor let me do so do you know that i shall have to kill you  that is better he cried let her die alsowheres the harm step aside from that girl and stand up to fight  you will observe said i halfrising that i have not kissed her yet  i dare you to he cried  i do not know what possessed me it was one of the things i am most ashamed of in my life though as my wife used to say i knew that my kisses would be always welcome were she dead or living down i fell again upon my knees parted the hair from her forehead and with the dearest respect laid my lips for a moment on that cold brow it was such a caress as a father might have given it was such a one as was not unbecoming from a man soon to die to a woman already dead  and now said i i am at your service mr northmour  but i saw to my surprise that he had turned his back upon me  do you hear i asked  yes said he i do if you wish to fight i am ready if not go on and save clara all is one to me  i did not wait to be twice bidden but stooping again over clara continued my efforts to revive her she still lay white and lifeless i began to fear that her sweet spirit had indeed fled beyond recall and horror and a sense of utter desolation seized upon my heart i called her by name with the most endearing inflections i chafed and beat her hands now i laid her head low now supported it against my knee but all seemed to be in vain and the lids still lay heavy on her eyes  northmour i said there is my hat for gods sake bring some water from the spring  almost in a moment he was by my side with the water  i have brought it in my own he said you do not grudge me the privilege  northmour i was beginning to say as i laved her head and breast but he interrupted me savagely  oh you hush up he said the best thing you can do is to say nothing  i had certainly no desire to talk my mind being swallowed up in concern for my dear love and her condition so i continued in silence to do my best towards her recovery and when the hat was empty returned it to him with one wordmore he had perhaps gone several times upon this errand when clara reopened her eyes  now said he since she is better you can spare me can you not i wish you a goodnight mr cassilis  and with that he was gone among the thicket i made a fire for i had now no fear of the italians who had even spared all the little possessions left in my encampment and broken as she was by the excitement and the hideous catastrophe of the evening i managed in one way or anotherby persuasion encouragement warmth and such simple remedies as i could lay my hand onto bring her back to some composure of mind and strength of body  day had already come when a sharp hist sounded from the thicket i started from the ground but the voice of northmour was heard adding in the most tranquil tones come here cassilis and alone i want to show you something  i consulted clara with my eyes and receiving her tacit permission left her alone and clambered out of the den at some distance off i saw northmour leaning against an elder and as soon as he perceived me he began walking seaward i had almost overtaken him as he reached the outskirts of the wood  look said he pausing  a couple of steps more brought me out of the foliage the light of the morning lay cold and clear over that wellknown scene the pavilion was but a blackened wreck the roof had fallen in one of the gables had fallen out and far and near the face of the links was cicatrised with little patches of burnt furze thick smoke still went straight upwards in the windless air of the morning and a great pile of ardent cinders filled the bare walls of the house like coals in an open grate close by the islet a schooner yacht layto and a wellmanned boat was pulling vigorously for the shore  the red earl i cried the red earl twelve hours too late  feel in your pocket frank are you armed asked northmour  i obeyed him and i think i must have become deadly pale my revolver had been taken from me  you see i have you in my power he continued i disarmed you last night while you were nursing clara but this morningheretake your pistol no thanks he cried holding up his hand i do not like them that is the only way you can annoy me now  he began to walk forward across the links to meet the boat and i followed a step or two behind in front of the pavilion i paused to see where mr huddlestone had fallen but there was no sign of him nor so much as a trace of blood  graden floe said northmour  he continued to advance till we had come to the head of the beach  no farther please said he would you like to take her to graden house  thank you i replied i shall try to get her to the ministers at gradenwester  the prow of the boat here grated on the beach and a sailor jumped ashore with a line in his hand  wait a minute lads cried northmour and then lower and to my private ear you had better say nothing of all this to her he added  on the contrary i broke out she shall know everything that i can tell  you do not understand he returned with an air of great dignity it will be nothing to her she expects it of me goodbye he added with a nod  i offered him my hand  excuse me said he its small i know but i cant push things quite so far as that i dont wish any sentimental business to sit by your hearth a whitehaired wanderer and all that quite the contrary i hope to god i shall never again clap eyes on either one of you  well god bless you northmour i said heartily  oh yes he returned  he walked down the beach and the man who was ashore gave him an arm on board and then shoved off and leaped into the bows himself northmour took the tiller the boat rose to the waves and the oars between the tholepins sounded crisp and measured in the morning air  they were not yet halfway to the red earl and i was still watching their progress when the sun rose out of the sea  one word more and my story is done years after northmour was killed fighting under the colours of garibaldi for the liberation of the tyrol     a lodging for the night  a story of francis villon   it was late in november 1456 the snow fell over paris with rigorous relentless persistence sometimes the wind made a sally and scattered it in flying vortices sometimes there was a lull and flake after flake descended out of the black night air silent circuitous interminable to poor people looking up under moist eyebrows it seemed a wonder where it all came from master francis villon had propounded an alternative that afternoon at a tavern window was it only pagan jupiter plucking geese upon olympus or were the holy angels moulting he was only a poor master of arts he went on and as the question somewhat touched upon divinity he durst not venture to conclude a silly old priest from montargis who was among the company treated the young rascal to a bottle of wine in honour of the jest and the grimaces with which it was accompanied and swore on his own white beard that he had been just such another irreverent dog when he was villons age  the air was raw and pointed but not far below freezing and the flakes were large damp and adhesive the whole city was sheeted up an army might have marched from end to end and not a footfall given the alarm if there were any belated birds in heaven they saw the island like a large white patch and the bridges like slim white spars on the black ground of the river high up overhead the snow settled among the tracery of the cathedral towers many a niche was drifted full many a statue wore a long white bonnet on its grotesque or sainted head the gargoyles had been transformed into great false noses drooping towards the point the crockets were like upright pillows swollen on one side in the intervals of the wind there was a dull sound of dripping about the precincts of the church  the cemetery of st john had taken its own share of the snow all the graves were decently covered tall white housetops stood around in grave array worthy burghers were long ago in bed benightcapped like their domiciles there was no light in all the neighbourhood but a little peep from a lamp that hung swinging in the church choir and tossed the shadows to and fro in time to its oscillations the clock was hard on ten when the patrol went by with halberds and a lantern beating their hands and they saw nothing suspicious about the cemetery of st john  yet there was a small house backed up against the cemetery wall which was still awake and awake to evil purpose in that snoring district there was not much to betray it from without only a stream of warm vapour from the chimneytop a patch where the snow melted on the roof and a few halfobliterated footprints at the door but within behind the shuttered windows master francis villon the poet and some of the thievish crew with whom he consorted were keeping the night alive and passing round the bottle  a great pile of living embers diffused a strong and ruddy glow from the arched chimney before this straddled dom nicolas the picardy monk with his skirts picked up and his fat legs bared to the comfortable warmth his dilated shadow cut the room in half and the firelight only escaped on either side of his broad person and in a little pool between his outspread feet his face had the beery bruised appearance of the continual drinkers it was covered with a network of congested veins purple in ordinary circumstances but now pale violet for even with his back to the fire the cold pinched him on the other side his cowl had halffallen back and made a strange excrescence on either side of his bullneck so he straddled grumbling and cut the room in half with the shadow of his portly frame  on the right villon and guy tabary were huddled together over a scrap of parchment villon making a ballade which he was to call the ballade of roast fish and tabary spluttering admiration at his shoulder the poet was a rag of a man dark little and lean with hollow cheeks and thin black locks he carried his fourandtwenty years with feverish animation greed had made folds about his eyes evil smiles had puckered his mouth the wolf and pig struggled together in his face it was an eloquent sharp ugly earthly countenance his hands were small and prehensile with fingers knotted like a cord and they were continually flickering in front of him in violent and expressive pantomime as for tabary a broad complacent admiring imbecility breathed from his squash nose and slobbering lips he had become a thief just as he might have become the most decent of burgesses by the imperious chance that rules the lives of human geese and human donkeys  at the monks other hand montigny and thevenin pensete played a game of chance about the first there clung some flavour of good birth and training as about a fallen angel something long lithe and courtly in the person something aquiline and darkling in the face thevenin poor soul was in great feather he had done a good stroke of knavery that afternoon in the faubourg st jacques and all night he had been gaining from montigny a flat smile illuminated his face his bald head shone rosily in a garland of red curls his little protuberant stomach shook with silent chucklings as he swept in his gains  doubles or quits said thevenin  montigny nodded grimly  some may prefer to dine in state wrote villon on bread and cheese on silver plate ororhelp me out guido  tabary giggled  or parsley on a golden dish scribbled the poet  the wind was freshening without it drove the snow before it and sometimes raised its voice in a victorious whoop and made sepulchral grumblings in the chimney the cold was growing sharper as the night went on villon protruding his lips imitated the gust with something between a whistle and a groan it was an eerie uncomfortable talent of the poets much detested by the picardy monk  cant you hear it rattle in the gibbet said villon they are all dancing the devils jig on nothing up there you may dance my gallants youll be none the warmer whew what a gust down went somebody just now a medlar the fewer on the threelegged medlartreei say dom nicolas itll be cold tonight on the st denis road he asked  dom nicolas winked both his big eyes and seemed to choke upon his adams apple montfaucon the great grisly paris gibbet stood hard by the st denis road and the pleasantry touched him on the raw as for tabary he laughed immoderately over the medlars he had never heard anything more lighthearted and he held his sides and crowed villon fetched him a fillip on the nose which turned his mirth into an attack of coughing  oh stop that row said villon and think of rhymes to fish  doubles or quits said montigny doggedly  with all my heart quoth thevenin  is there any more in that bottle asked the monk  open another said villon how do you ever hope to fill that big hogshead your body with little things like bottles and how do you expect to get to heaven how many angels do you fancy can be spared to carry up a single monk from picardy or do you think yourself another eliasand theyll send the coach for you  hominibus impossibile replied the monk as he filled his glass  tabary was in ecstasies  villon filliped his nose again  laugh at my jokes if you like he said  it was very good objected tabary  villon made a face at him think of rhymes to fish he said what have you to do with latin youll wish you knew none of it at the great assizes when the devil calls for guido tabary clericusthe devil with the humpback and redhot fingernails talking of the devil he added in a whisper look at montigny  all three peered covertly at the gamester he did not seem to be enjoying his luck his mouth was a little to a side one nostril nearly shut and the other much inflated the black dog was on his back as people say in terrifying nursery metaphor and he breathed hard under the gruesome burden  he looks as if he could knife him whispered tabary with round eyes  the monk shuddered and turned his face and spread his open hands to the red embers it was the cold that thus affected dom nicolas and not any excess of moral sensibility  come now said villonabout this ballade how does it run so far and beating time with his hand he read it aloud to tabary  they were interrupted at the fourth rhyme by a brief and fatal movement among the gamesters the round was completed and thevenin was just opening his mouth to claim another victory when montigny leaped up swift as an adder and stabbed him to the heart the blow took effect before he had time to utter a cry before he had time to move a tremor or two convulsed his frame his hands opened and shut his heels rattled on the floor then his head rolled backwards over one shoulder with the eyes wide open and thevenin pensetes spirit had returned to him who made it  every one sprang to his feet but the business was over in two twos the four living fellows looked at each other in rather a ghastly fashion the dead man contemplating a corner of the roof with a singular and ugly leer  my god said tabary and he began to pray in latin  villon broke out into hysterical laughter he came a step forward and ducked a ridiculous bow at thevenin and laughed still louder then he sat down suddenly all of a heap upon a stool and continued laughing bitterly as though he would shake himself to pieces  montigny recovered his composure first  lets see what he has about him he remarked and he picked the dead mans pockets with a practised hand and divided the money into four equal portions on the table theres for you he said  the monk received his share with a deep sigh and a single stealthy glance at the dead thevenin who was beginning to sink into himself and topple sideways off the chair  were all in for it cried villon swallowing his mirth its a hanging job for every man jack of us thats herenot to speak of those who arent he made a shocking gesture in the air with his raised right hand and put out his tongue and threw his head on one side so as to counterfeit the appearance of one who has been hanged then he pocketed his share of the spoil and executed a shuffle with his feet as if to restore the circulation  tabary was the last to help himself he made a dash at the money and retired to the other end of the apartment  montigny stuck thevenin upright in the chair and drew out the dagger which was followed by a jet of blood  you fellows had better be moving he said as he wiped the blade on his victims doublet  i think we had returned villon with a gulp damn his fat head he broke out it sticks in my throat like phlegm what right has a man to have red hair when he is dead and he fell all of a heap again upon the stool and fairly covered his face with his hands  montigny and dom nicolas laughed aloud even tabary feebly chiming in  cry baby said the monk  i always said he was a woman added montigny with a sneer sit up cant you he went on giving another shake to the murdered body tread out that fire nick  but nick was better employed he was quietly taking villons purse as the poet sat limp and trembling on the stool where he had been making a ballade not three minutes before montigny and tabary dumbly demanded a share of the booty which the monk silently promised as he passed the little bag into the bosom of his gown in many ways an artistic nature unfits a man for practical existence  no sooner had the theft been accomplished than villon shook himself jumped to his feet and began helping to scatter and extinguish the embers meanwhile montigny opened the door and cautiously peered into the street the coast was clear there was no meddlesome patrol in sight still it was judged wiser to slip out severally and as villon was himself in a hurry to escape from the neighbourhood of the dead thevenin and the rest were in a still greater hurry to get rid of him before he should discover the loss of his money he was the first by general consent to issue forth into the street  the wind had triumphed and swept all the clouds from heaven only a few vapours as thin as moonlight fleeted rapidly across the stars it was bitter cold and by a common optical effect things seemed almost more definite than in the broadest daylight the sleeping city was absolutely still a company of white hoods a field full of little alps below the twinkling stars villon cursed his fortune would it were still snowing now wherever he went he left an indelible trail behind him on the glittering streets wherever he went he was still tethered to the house by the cemetery of st john wherever he went he must weave with his own plodding feet the rope that bound him to the crime and would bind him to the gallows the leer of the dead man came back to him with a new significance he snapped his fingers as if to pluck up his own spirits and choosing a street at random stepped boldly forward in the snow  two things preoccupied him as he went the aspect of the gallows at montfaucon in this bright windy phase of the nights existence for one and for another the look of the dead man with his bald head and garland of red curls both struck cold upon his heart and he kept quickening his pace as if he could escape from unpleasant thoughts by mere fleetness of foot sometimes he looked back over his shoulder with a sudden nervous jerk but he was the only moving thing in the white streets except when the wind swooped round a corner and threw up the snow which was beginning to freeze in spouts of glittering dust  suddenly he saw a long way before him a black clump and a couple of lanterns the clump was in motion and the lanterns swung as though carried by men walking it was a patrol and though it was merely crossing his line of march he judged it wiser to get out of eyeshot as speedily as he could he was not in the humour to be challenged and he was conscious of making a very conspicuous mark upon the snow just on his left hand there stood a great hotel with some turrets and a large porch before the door it was halfruinous he remembered and had long stood empty and so he made three steps of it and jumped into the shelter of the porch it was pretty dark inside after the glimmer of the snowy streets and he was groping forward with outspread hands when he stumbled over some substance which offered an indescribable mixture of resistances hard and soft firm and loose his heart gave a leap and he sprang two steps back and stared dreadfully at the obstacle then he gave a little laugh of relief it was only a woman and she dead he knelt beside her to make sure upon this latter point she was freezing cold and rigid like a stick a little ragged finery fluttered in the wind about her hair and her cheeks had been heavily rouged that same afternoon her pockets were quite empty but in her stocking underneath the garter villon found two of the small coins that went by the name of whites it was little enough but it was always something and the poet was moved with a deep sense of pathos that she should have died before she had spent her money that seemed to him a dark and pitiable mystery and he looked from the coins in his hand to the dead woman and back again to the coins shaking his head over the riddle of mans life henry v of england dying at vincennes just after he had conquered france and this poor jade cut off by a cold draught in a great mans doorway before she had time to spend her couple of whitesit seemed a cruel way to carry on the world two whites would have taken such a little while to squander and yet it would have been one more good taste in the mouth one more smack of the lips before the devil got the soul and the body was left to birds and vermin he would like to use all his tallow before the light was blown out and the lantern broken  while these thoughts were passing through his mind he was feeling half mechanically for his purse suddenly his heart stopped beating a feeling of cold scales passed up the back of his legs and a cold blow seemed to fall upon his scalp he stood petrified for a moment then he felt again with one feverish movement and then his loss burst upon him and he was covered at once with perspiration to spendthrifts money is so living and actualit is such a thin veil between them and their pleasures there is only one limit to their fortunethat of time and a spendthrift with only a few crowns is the emperor of rome until they are spent for such a person to lose his money is to suffer the most shocking reverse and fall from heaven to hell from all to nothing in a breath and all the more if he has put his head in the halter for it if he may be hanged tomorrow for that same purse so dearly earned so foolishly departed villon stood and cursed he threw the two whites into the street he shook his fist at heaven he stamped and was not horrified to find himself trampling the poor corpse then he began rapidly to retrace his steps towards the house beside the cemetery he had forgotten all fear of the patrol which was long gone by at any rate and had no idea but that of his lost purse it was in vain that he looked right and left upon the snow nothing was to be seen he had not dropped it in the streets had it fallen in the house he would have liked dearly to go in and see but the idea of the grisly occupant unmanned him and he saw besides as he drew near that their efforts to put out the fire had been unsuccessful on the contrary it had broken into a blaze and a changeful light played in the chinks of door and window and revived his terror for the authorities and paris gibbet  he returned to the hotel with the porch and groped about upon the snow for the money he had thrown away in his childish passion but he could only find one white the other had probably struck sideways and sunk deeply in with a single white in his pocket all his projects for a rousing night in some wild tavern vanished utterly away and it was not only pleasure that fled laughing from his grasp positive discomfort positive pain attacked him as he stood ruefully before the porch his perspiration had dried upon him and though the wind had now fallen a binding frost was setting in stronger with every hour and he felt benumbed and sick at heart what was to be done late as was the hour improbable as was success he would try the house of his adopted father the chaplain of st beno√Æt  he ran there all the way and knocked timidly there was no answer he knocked again and again taking heart with every stroke and at last steps were heard approaching from within a barred wicket fell open in the ironstudded door and emitted a gush of yellow light  hold up your face to the wicket said the chaplain from within  its only me whimpered villon  oh its only you is it returned the chaplain and he cursed him with foul unpriestly oaths for disturbing him at such an hour and bade him be off to hell where he came from  my hands are blue to the wrist pleaded villon my feet are dead and full of twinges my nose aches with the sharp air the cold lies at my heart i may be dead before morning only this once father and before god i will never ask again  you should have come earlier said the ecclesiastic coolly young men require a lesson now and then he shut the wicket and retired deliberately into the interior of the house  villon was beside himself he beat upon the door with his hands and feet and shouted hoarsely after the chaplain  wormy old fox he cried if i had my hand under your twist i would send you flying headlong into the bottomless pit  a door shut in the interior faintly audible to the poet down long passages he passed his hand over his mouth with an oath and then the humour of the situation struck him and he laughed and looked lightly up to heaven where the stars seemed to be winking over his discomfiture  what was to be done it looked very like a night in the frosty streets the idea of the dead woman popped into his imagination and gave him a hearty fright what had happened to her in the early night might very well happen to him before morning and he so young and with such immense possibilities of disorderly amusement before him he felt quite pathetic over the notion of his own fate as if it had been some one elses and made a little imaginative vignette of the scene in the morning when they should find his body  he passed all his chances under review turning the white between his thumb and forefinger unfortunately he was on bad terms with some old friends who would once have taken pity on him in such a plight he had lampooned them in verses he had beaten and cheated them and yet now when he was in so close a pinch he thought there was at least one who might perhaps relent it was a chance it was worth trying at least and he would go and see  on the way two little accidents happened to him which coloured his musings in a very different manner for first he fell in with the track of a patrol and walked in it for some hundred yards although it lay out of his direction and this spirited him up at least he had confused his trail for he was still possessed with the idea of people tracking him all about paris over the snow and collaring him next morning before he was awake the other matter affected him very differently he passed a street corner where not so long before a woman and her child had been devoured by wolves this was just the kind of weather he reflected when wolves might take it into their heads to enter paris again and a lone man in these deserted streets would run the chance of something worse than a mere scare he stopped and looked upon the place with an unpleasant interestit was a centre where several lanes intersected each other and he looked down them all one after another and held his breath to listen lest he should detect some galloping black things on the snow or hear the sound of howling between him and the river he remembered his mother telling him the story and pointing out the spot while he was yet a child his mother if he only knew where she lived he might make sure at least of shelter he determined he would inquire upon the morrow nay he would go and see her too poor old girl so thinking he arrived at his destinationhis last hope for the night  the house was quite dark like its neighbours and yet after a few taps he heard a movement overhead a door opening and a cautious voice asking who was there the poet named himself in a loud whisper and waited not without some trepidation the result nor had he to wait long a window was suddenly opened and a pailful of slops splashed down upon the doorstep villon had not been unprepared for something of the sort and had put himself as much in shelter as the nature of the porch admitted but for all that he was deplorably drenched below the waist his hose began to freeze almost at once death from cold and exposure stared him in the face he remembered he was of phthisical tendency and began coughing tentatively but the gravity of the danger steadied his nerves he stopped a few hundred yards from the door where he had been so rudely used and reflected with his finger to his nose he could only see one way of getting a lodging and that was to take it he had noticed a house not far away which looked as if it might be easily broken into and thither he betook himself promptly entertaining himself on the way with the idea of a room still hot with a table still loaded with the remains of supper where he might pass the rest of the black hours and whence he should issue on the morrow with an armful of valuable plate he even considered on what viands and what wines he should prefer and as he was calling the roll of his favourite dainties roast fish presented itself to his mind with an odd mixture of amusement and horror  i shall never finish that ballade he thought to himself and then with another shudder at the recollection oh damn his fat head he repeated fervently and spat upon the snow  the house in question looked dark at first sight but as villon made a preliminary inspection in search of the handiest point of attack a little twinkle of light caught his eye from behind a curtained window  the devil he thought people awake some student or some saint confound the crew cant they get drunk and lie in bed snoring like their neighbours whats the good of curfew and poor devils of bellringers jumping at a ropesend in belltowers whats the use of day if people sit up all night the gripes to them he grinned as he saw where his logic was leading him every man to his business after all added he and if theyre awake by the lord i may come by a supper honestly for this once and cheat the devil  he went boldly to the door and knocked with an assured hand on both previous occasions he had knocked timidly and with some dread of attracting notice but now when he had just discarded the thought of a burglarious entry knocking at a door seemed a mighty simple and innocent proceeding the sound of his blows echoed through the house with thin phantasmal reverberations as though it were quite empty but these had scarcely died away before a measured tread drew near a couple of bolts were withdrawn and one wing was opened broadly as though no guile or fear of guile were known to those within a tall figure of a man muscular and spare but a little bent confronted villon the head was in massive bulk but finely sculptured the nose blunt at the bottom but refining upward to where it joined a pair of strong and honest eyebrows the mouth and eyes surrounded with delicate markings and the whole face based upon a thick white beard boldly and squarely trimmed seen as it was by the light of a flickering handlamp it looked perhaps nobler than it had a right to do but it was a fine face honourable rather than intelligent strong simple and righteous  you knock late sir said the old man in resonant courteous tones  villon cringed and brought up many servile words of apology at a crisis of this sort the beggar was uppermost in him and the man of genius hid his head with confusion  you are cold repeated the old man and hungry well step in and he ordered him into the house with a noble enough gesture  some great seigneur thought villon as his host setting down the lamp on the flagged pavement of the entry shot the bolts once more into their places  you will pardon me if i go in front he said when this was done and he preceded the poet upstairs into a large apartment warmed with a pan of charcoal and lit by a great lamp hanging from the roof it was very bare of furniture only some gold plate on a sideboard some folios and a stand of armour between the windows some smart tapestry hung upon the walls representing the crucifixion of our lord in one piece and in another a scene of shepherds and shepherdesses by a running stream over the chimney was a shield of arms  will you seat yourself said the old man and forgive me if i leave you i am alone in my house tonight and if you are to eat i must forage for you myself  no sooner was his host gone than villon leaped from the chair on which he had just seated himself and began examining the room with the stealth and passion of a cat he weighed the gold flagons in his hand opened all the folios and investigated the arms upon the shield and the stuff with which the seats were lined he raised the window curtains and saw that the windows were set with rich stained glass in figures so far as he could see of martial import then he stood in the middle of the room drew a long breath and retaining it with puffed cheeks looked round and round him turning on his heels as if to impress every feature of the apartment on his memory  seven pieces of plate he said if there had been ten i would have risked it a fine house and a fine old master so help me all the saints  and just then hearing the old mans tread returning along the corridor he stole back to his chair and began humbly toasting his wet legs before the charcoal pan  his entertainer had a plate of meat in one hand and a jug of wine in the other he set down the plate upon the table motioning villon to draw in his chair and going to the sideboard brought back two goblets which he filled  i drink to your better fortune he said gravely touching villons cup with his own  to our better acquaintance said the poet growing bold a mere man of the people would have been awed by the courtesy of the old seigneur but villon was hardened in that matter he had made mirth for great lords before now and found them as black rascals as himself and so he devoted himself to the viands with a ravenous gusto while the old man leaning backward watched him with steady curious eyes  you have blood on your shoulder my man he said  montigny must have laid his wet right hand upon him as he left the house he cursed montigny in his heart  it was none of my shedding he stammered  i had not supposed so returned his host quietly a brawl  well something of that sort villon admitted with a quaver  perhaps a fellow murdered  oh nonot murdered said the poet more and more confused it was all fair playmurdered by accident i had no hand in it god strike me dead he added fervently  one rogue the fewer i daresay observed the master of the house  you may dare to say that agreed villon infinitely relieved as big a rogue as there is between here and jerusalem he turned up his toes like a lamb but it was a nasty thing to look at i daresay youve seen dead men in your time my lord he added glancing at the armour  many said the old man i have followed the wars as you imagine  villon laid down his knife and fork which he had just taken up again  were any of them bald he asked  oh yes and with hair as white as mine  i dont think i should mind the white so much said villon his was red and he had a return of his shuddering and tendency to laughter which he drowned with a great draught of wine im a little put out when i think of it he went on i knew himdamn him and then the cold gives a man fanciesor the fancies give a man cold i dont know which  have you any money asked the old man  i have one white returned the poet laughing i got it out of a dead jades stocking in a porch she was as dead as c√¶sar poor wench and as cold as a church with bits of ribbon sticking in her hair this is a hard world in winter for wolves and wenches and poor rogues like me  i said the old man am enguerrand de la feuill√©e seigneur de brisetout bailly du patatrac who and what may you be  villon rose and made a suitable reverence i am called francis villon he said a poor master of arts of this university i know some latin and a deal of vice i can make chansons ballades lais virelais and roundels and i am very fond of wine i was born in a garret and i shall not improbably die upon the gallows i may add my lord that from this night forward i am your lordships very obsequious servant to command  no servant of mine said the knight my guest for this evening and no more  a very grateful guest said villon politely and he drank in dumb show to his entertainer  you are shrewd began the old man tapping his forehead very shrewd you have learning you are a clerk and yet you take a small piece of money off a dead woman in the street is it not a kind of theft  it is a kind of theft much practised in the wars my lord  the wars are the field of honour returned the old man proudly there a man plays his life upon the cast he fights in the name of his lord the king his lord god and all their lordships the holy saints and angels  put it said villon that i were really a thief should i not play my life also and against heavier odds  for gain but not for honour  gain repeated villon with a shrug gain the poor fellow wants supper and takes it so does the soldier in a campaign why what are all these requisitions we hear so much about if they are not gain to those who take them they are loss enough to the others the menatarms drink by a good fire while the burgher bites his nails to buy them wine and wood i have seen a good many ploughmen swinging on trees about the country ay i have seen thirty on one elm and a very poor figure they made and when i asked some one how all these came to be hanged i was told it was because they could not scrape together enough crowns to satisfy the menatarms  these things are a necessity of war which the lowborn must endure with constancy it is true that some captains drive overhard there are spirits in every rank not easily moved by pity and indeed many follow arms who are no better than brigands  you see said the poet you cannot separate the soldier from the brigand and what is a thief but an isolated brigand with circumspect manners i steal a couple of mutton chops without so much as disturbing peoples sleep the farmer grumbles a bit but sups none the less wholesomely on what remains you come up blowing gloriously on a trumpet take away the whole sheep and beat the farmer pitifully into the bargain i have no trumpet i am only tom dick or harry i am a rogue and a dog and hangings too good for mewith all my heart but just you ask the farmer which of us he prefers just find out which of us he lies awake to curse on cold nights  look at us two said his lordship i am old strong and honoured if i were turned from my house tomorrow hundreds would be proud to shelter me poor people would go out and pass the night in the streets with their children if i merely hinted that i wished to be alone and i find you up wandering homeless and picking farthings off dead women by the wayside i fear no man and nothing i have seen you tremble and lose countenance at a word i wait gods summons contentedly in my own house or if it please the king to call me out again upon the field of battle you look for the gallows a rough swift death without hope or honour is there no difference between these two  as far as to the moon villon acquiesced but if i had been born lord of brisetout and you had been the poor scholar francis would the difference have been any the less should not i have been warming my knees at this charcoal pan and would not you have been groping for farthings in the snow should not i have been the soldier and you the thief  a thief cried the old man i a thief if you understood your words you would repent them  villon turned out his hands with a gesture of inimitable impudence if your lordship had done me the honour to follow my argument he said  i do you too much honour in submitting to your presence said the knight learn to curb your tongue when you speak with old and honourable men or some one hastier than i may reprove you in a sharper fashion and he rose and paced the lower end of the apartment struggling with anger and antipathy villon surreptitiously refilled his cup and settled himself more comfortably in the chair crossing his knees and leaning his head upon one hand and the elbow against the back of the chair he was now replete and warm and he was in nowise frightened for his host having gauged him as justly as was possible between two such different characters the night was far spent and in a very comfortable fashion after all and he felt morally certain of a safe departure on the morrow  tell me one thing said the old man pausing in his walk are you really a thief  i claim the sacred rights of hospitality returned the poet my lord i am  you are very young the knight continued  i should never have been so old replied villon showing his fingers if i had not helped myself with these ten talents they have been my nursingmothers and my nursingfathers  you may still repent and change  i repent daily said the poet there are few people more given to repentance than poor francis as for change let somebody change my circumstances a man must continue to eat if it were only that he may continue to repent  the change must begin in the heart returned the old man solemnly  my dear lord answered villon do you really fancy that i steal for pleasure i hate stealing like any other piece of work or of danger my teeth chatter when i see a gallows but i must eat i must drink i must mix in society of some sort what the devil man is not a solitary animalcui deus foeminam tradit make me kings pantlermake me abbot of st denis make me bailly of the patatrac and then i shall be changed indeed but as long as you leave me the poor scholar francis villon without a farthing why of course i remain the same  the grace of god is allpowerful  i should be a heretic to question it said francis it has made you lord of brisetout and bailly of the patatrac it has given me nothing but the quick wits under my hat and these ten toes upon my hands may i help myself to wine i thank you respectfully by gods grace you have a very superior vintage  the lord of brisetout walked to and fro with his hands behind his back perhaps he was not yet quite settled in his mind about the parallel between thieves and soldiers perhaps villon had interested him by some crossthread of sympathy perhaps his wits were simply muddled by so much unfamiliar reasoning but whatever the cause he somehow yearned to convert the young man to a better way of thinking and could not make up his mind to drive him forth again into the street  there is something more than i can understand in this he said at length your mouth is full of subtleties and the devil has led you very far astray but the devil is only a very weak spirit before gods truth and all his subtleties vanish at a word of true honour like darkness at morning listen to me once more i learned long ago that a gentleman should live chivalrously and lovingly to god and the king and his lady and though i have seen many strange things done i have still striven to command my ways upon that rule it is not only written in all noble histories but in every mans heart if he will take care to read you speak of food and wine and i know very well that hunger is a difficult trial to endure but you do not speak of other wants you say nothing of honour of faith to god and other men of courtesy of love without reproach it may be that i am not very wiseand yet i think i ambut you seem to me like one who has lost his way and made a great error in life you are attending to the little wants and you have totally forgotten the great and only real ones like a man who should be doctoring a toothache on the judgment day for such things as honour and love and faith are not only nobler than food and drink but indeed i think that we desire them more and suffer more sharply for their absence i speak to you as i think you will most easily understand me are you not while careful to fill your belly disregarding another appetite in your heart which spoils the pleasure of your life and keeps you continually wretched  villon was sensibly nettled under all this sermonising you think i have no sense of honour he cried im poor enough god knows its hard to see rich people with their gloves and you blowing in your hands an empty belly is a bitter thing although you speak so lightly of it if you had had as many as i perhaps you would change your tune any way im a thiefmake the most of thatbut im not a devil from hell god strike me dead i would have you to know ive an honour of my own as good as yours though i dont prate about it all day long as if it was a gods miracle to have any it seems quite natural to me i keep it in its box till its wanted why now look you here how long have i been in this room with you did you not tell me you were alone in the house look at your gold plate youre strong if you like but youre old and unarmed and i have my knife what did i want but a jerk of the elbow and here would have been you with the cold steel in your bowels and there would have been me linking in the streets with an armful of gold cups did you suppose i hadnt wit enough to see that and i scorned the action there are your damned goblets as safe as in a church there are you with your heart ticking as good as new and here am i ready to go out again as poor as i came in with my one white that you threw in my teeth and you think i have no sense of honourgod strike me dead  the old man stretched out his right arm i will tell you what you are he said you are a rogue my man an impudent and a blackhearted rogue and vagabond i have passed an hour with you oh believe me i feel myself disgraced and you have eaten and drunk at my table but now i am sick at your presence the day has come and the nightbird should be off to his roost will you go before or after  which you please returned the poet rising i believe you to be strictly honourable he thoughtfully emptied his cup i wish i could add you were intelligent he went on knocking on his head with his knuckles age age the brains stiff and rheumatic  the old man preceded him from a point of selfrespect villon followed whistling with his thumbs in his girdle  god pity you said the lord of brisetout at the door  goodbye papa returned villon with a yawn many thanks for the cold mutton  the door closed behind him the dawn was breaking over the white roofs a chill uncomfortable morning ushered in the day villon stood and heartily stretched himself in the middle of the road  a very dull old gentleman he thought i wonder what his goblets may be worth     the sire de mal√âtroits door   denis de beaulieu was not yet twoandtwenty but he counted himself a grown man and a very accomplished cavalier into the bargain lads were early formed in that rough warfaring epoch and when one has been in a pitched battle and a dozen raids has killed ones man in an honourable fashion and knows a thing or two of strategy and mankind a certain swagger in the gait is surely to be pardoned he had put up his horse with due care and supped with due deliberation and then in a very agreeable frame of mind went out to pay a visit in the grey of the evening it was not a very wise proceeding on the young mans part he would have done better to remain beside the fire or go decently to bed for the town was full of the troops of burgundy and england under a mixed command and though denis was there on safeconduct his safeconduct was like to serve him little on a chance encounter  it was september 1429 the weather had fallen sharp a flighty piping wind laden with showers beat about the township and the dead leaves ran riot along the streets here and there a window was already lighted up and the noise of menatarms making merry over supper within came forth in fits and was swallowed up and carried away by the wind the night fell swiftly the flag of england fluttering on the spiretop grew ever fainter and fainter against the flying cloudsa black speck like a swallow in the tumultuous leaden chaos of the sky as the night fell the wind rose and began to hoot under archways and roar amid the treetops in the valley below the town  denis de beaulieu walked fast and was soon knocking at his friends door but though he promised himself to stay only a little while and make an early return his welcome was so pleasant and he found so much to delay him that it was already long past midnight before he said goodbye upon the threshold the wind had fallen again in the meanwhile the night was as black as the grave not a star nor a glimmer of moonshine slipped through the canopy of cloud denis was illacquainted with the intricate lanes of ch√¢teau landon even by daylight he had found some trouble in picking his way and in this absolute darkness he soon lost it altogether he was certain of one thing onlyto keep mounting the hill for his friends house lay at the lower end or tail of ch√¢teau landon while the inn was up at the head under the great church spire with this clue to go upon he stumbled and groped forward now breathing more freely in open places where there was a good slice of sky overhead now feeling along the wall in stifling closes it is an eerie and mysterious position to be thus submerged in opaque blackness in an almost unknown town the silence is terrifying in its possibilities the touch of cold windowbars to the exploring hand startles the man like the touch of a toad the inequalities of the pavement shake his heart into his mouth a piece of denser darkness threatens an ambuscade or a chasm in the pathway and where the air is brighter the houses put on strange and bewildering appearances as if to lead him farther from his way for denis who had to regain his inn without attracting notice there was real danger as well as mere discomfort in the walk and he went warily and boldly at once and at every corner paused to make an observation  he had been for some time threading a lane so narrow that he could touch a wall with either hand when it began to open out and go sharply downward plainly this lay no longer in the direction of his inn but the hope of a little more light tempted him forward to reconnoitre the lane ended in a terrace with a bartizan wall which gave an outlook between high houses as out of an embrasure into the valley lying dark and formless several hundred feet below denis looked down and could discern a few treetops waving and a single speck of brightness where the river ran across a weir the weather was clearing up and the sky had lightened so as to show the outline of the heavier clouds and the dark margin of the hills by the uncertain glimmer the house on his left hand should be a place of some pretensions it was surmounted by several pinnacles and turrettops the round stern of a chapel with a fringe of flying buttresses projected boldly from the main block and the door was sheltered under a deep porch carved with figures and overhung by two long gargoyles the windows of the chapel gleamed through their intricate tracery with a light as of many tapers and threw out the buttresses and the peaked roof in a more intense blackness against the sky it was plainly the hotel of some great family of the neighbourhood and as it reminded denis of a townhouse of his own at bourges he stood for some time gazing up at it and mentally gauging the skill of the architects and the consideration of the two families  there seemed to be no issue to the terrace but the lane by which he had reached it he could only retrace his steps but he had gained some notion of his whereabouts and hoped by this means to hit the main thoroughfare and speedily regain the inn he was reckoning without that chapter of accidents which was to make this night memorable above all others in his career for he had not gone back above a hundred yards before he saw a light coming to meet him and heard loud voices speaking together in the echoing narrows of the lane it was a party of menatarms going the nightround with torches denis assured himself that they had all been making free with the winebowl and were in no mood to be particular about safeconducts or the niceties of chivalrous war it was as like as not that they would kill him like a dog and leave him where he fell the situation was inspiriting but nervous their own torches would conceal him from sight he reflected and he hoped that they would drown the noise of his footsteps with their own empty voices if he were but fleet and silent he might evade their notice altogether  unfortunately as he turned to beat a retreat his foot rolled upon a pebble he fell against the wall with an ejaculation and his sword rang loudly on the stones two or three voices demanded who went theresome in french some in english but denis made no reply and ran the faster down the lane once upon the terrace he paused to look back they still kept calling after him and just then began to double the pace in pursuit with a considerable clank of armour and great tossing of the torchlight to and fro in the narrow jaws of the passage  denis cast a look around and darted into the porch there he might escape observation orif that were too much to expectwas in a capital posture whether for parley or defence so thinking he drew his sword and tried to set his back against the door to his surprise it yielded behind his weight and though he turned in a moment continued to swing back on oiled and noiseless hinges until it stood wide open on a black interior when things fall out opportunely for the person concerned he is not apt to be critical about the how or why his own immediate personal convenience seeming a sufficient reason for the strangest oddities and revolutions in our sublunary things and so denis without a moments hesitation stepped within and partly closed the door behind him to conceal his place of refuge nothing was further from his thoughts than to close it altogether but for some inexplicable reasonperhaps by a spring or a weightthe ponderous mass of oak whipped itself out of his fingers and clanked to with a formidable rumble and noise like the falling of an automatic bar  the round at that very moment debouched upon the terrace and proceeded to summon him with shouts and curses he heard them ferreting in the dark corners the stock of a lance even rattled along the outer surface of the door behind which he stood but these gentlemen were in too high a humour to be long delayed and soon made off down a corkscrew pathway which had escaped deniss observation and passed out of sight and hearing along the battlements of the town  denis breathed again he gave them a few minutes grace for fear of accidents and then groped about for some means of opening the door and slipping forth again the inner surface was quite smooth not a handle not a moulding not a projection of any sort he got his fingernails round the edges and pulled but the mass was immovable he shook it it was as firm as a rock denis de beaulieu frowned and gave vent to a little noiseless whistle what ailed the door he wondered why was it open how came it to shut so easily and so effectually after him there was something obscure and underhand about all this that was little to the young mans fancy it looked like a snare and yet who could suppose a snare in such a quiet bystreet and in a house of so prosperous and even noble an exterior and yetsnare or no snare intentionally or unintentionallyhere he was prettily trapped and for the life of him he could see no way out of it again the darkness began to weigh upon him he gave ear all was silent without but within and close by he seemed to catch a faint sighing a faint sobbing rustle a little stealthy creakas though many persons were at his side holding themselves quite still and governing even their respiration with the extreme of slyness the idea went to his vitals with a shock and he faced about suddenly as if to defend his life then for the first time he became aware of a light about the level of his eyes and at some distance in the interior of the housea vertical thread of light widening towards the bottom such as might escape between two wings of arras over a doorway to see anything was a relief to denis it was like a piece of solid ground to a man labouring in a morass his mind seized upon it with avidity and he stood staring at it and trying to piece together some logical conception of his surroundings plainly there was a flight of steps ascending from his own level to that of this illuminated doorway and indeed he thought he could make out another thread of light as fine as a needle and as faint as phosphorescence which might very well be reflected along the polished wood of a handrail since he had begun to suspect that he was not alone his heart had continued to beat with smothering violence and an intolerable desire for action of any sort had possessed itself of his spirit he was in deadly peril he believed what could be more natural than to mount the staircase lift the curtain and confront his difficulty at once at least he would be dealing with something tangible at least he would be no longer in the dark he stepped slowly forward with outstretched hands until his foot struck the bottom step then he rapidly scaled the stairs stood for a moment to compose his expression lifted the arras and went in  he found himself in a large apartment of polished stone there were three doors one on each of three sides all similarly curtained with tapestry the fourth side was occupied by two large windows and a great stone chimneypiece carved with the arms of the mal√©troits denis recognised the bearings and was gratified to find himself in such good hands the room was strongly illuminated but it contained little furniture except a heavy table and a chair or two the hearth was innocent of fire and the pavement was but sparsely strewn with rushes clearly many days old  on a high chair beside the chimney and directly facing denis as he entered sat a little old gentleman in a fur tippet he sat with his legs crossed and his hands folded and a cup of spiced wine stood by his elbow on a bracket on the wall his countenance had a strongly masculine cast not properly human but such as we see in the bull the goat or the domestic boar something equivocal and wheedling something greedy brutal and dangerous the upper lip was inordinately full as though swollen by a blow or a toothache and the smile the peaked eyebrows and the small strong eyes were quaintly and almost comically evil in expression beautiful white hair hung straight all round his head like a saints and fell in a single curl upon the tippet his beard and moustache were the pink of venerable sweetness age probably in consequence of inordinate precautions had left no mark upon his hands and the mal√©troit hand was famous it would be difficult to imagine anything at once so fleshy and so delicate in design the taper sensual fingers were like those of one of leonardos women the fork of the thumb made a dimple protuberance when closed the nails were perfectly shaped and of a dead surprising whiteness it rendered his aspect tenfold more redoubtable that a man with hands like these should keep them devoutly folded in his lap like a virgin martyrthat a man with so intense and startling an expression of face should sit patiently on his seat and contemplate people with an unwinking stare like a god or a gods statue his quiescence seemed ironical and treacherous it fitted so poorly with his looks  such was alain sire de mal√©troit  denis and he looked silently at each other for a second or two  pray step in said the sire de mal√©troit i have been expecting you all the evening  he had not risen but he accompanied his words with a smile and a slight but courteous inclination of the head partly from the smile partly from the strange musical murmur with which the sire prefaced his observation denis felt a strong shudder of disgust go through his marrow and what with disgust and honest confusion of mind he could scarcely get words together in reply  i fear he said that this is a double accident i am not the person you suppose me it seems you were looking for a visit but for my part nothing was further from my thoughtsnothing could be more contrary to my wishesthan this intrusion  well well replied the old gentleman indulgently here you are which is the main point seat yourself my friend and put yourself entirely at your ease we shall arrange our little affairs presently  denis perceived that the matter was still complicated with some misconception and he hastened to continue his explanations  your door  he began  about my door asked the other raising his peaked eyebrows a little piece of ingenuity and he shrugged his shoulders a hospitable fancy by your own account you were not desirous of making my acquaintance we old people look for such reluctance now and then and when it touches our honour we cast about until we find some way of overcoming it you arrive uninvited but believe me very welcome  you persist in error sir said denis there can be no question between you and me i am a stranger in this countryside my name is denis damoiseau de beaulieu if you see me in your house it is only   my young friend interrupted the other you will permit me to have my own ideas on that subject they probably differ from yours at the present moment he added with a leer but time will show which of us is in the right  denis was convinced he had to do with a lunatic he seated himself with a shrug content to wait the upshot and a pause ensued during which he thought he could distinguish a hurried gabbling as of prayer from behind the arras immediately opposite him sometimes there seemed to be but one person engaged sometimes two and the vehemence of the voice low as it was seemed to indicate either haste or an agony of spirit it occurred to him that this piece of tapestry covered the entrance to the chapel he had noticed from without  the old gentleman meanwhile surveyed denis from head to foot with a smile and from time to time emitted little noises like a bird or a mouse which seemed to indicate a high degree of satisfaction this state of matters became rapidly insupportable and denis to put an end to it remarked politely that the wind had gone down  the old gentleman fell into a fit of silent laughter so prolonged and violent that he became quite red in the face denis got upon his feet at once and put on his hat with a flourish  sir he said if you are in your wits you have affronted me grossly if you are out of them i flatter myself i can find better employment for my brains than to talk with lunatics my conscience is clear you have made a fool of me from the first moment you have refused to hear my explanations and now there is no power under god will make me stay here any longer and if i cannot make my way out in a more decent fashion i will hack your door in pieces with my sword  the sire de mal√©troit raised his right hand and wagged it at denis with the fore and little fingers extended  my dear nephew he said sit down  nephew retorted denis you lie in your throat and he snapped his fingers in his face  sit down you rogue cried the old gentleman in a sudden harsh voice like the barking of a dog do you fancy he went on that when i made my little contrivance for the door i had stopped short with that if you prefer to be bound hand and foot till your bones ache rise and try to go away if you choose to remain a free young buck agreeably conversing with an old gentlemanwhy sit where you are in peace and god be with you  do you mean i am a prisoner demanded denis  i state the facts replied the other i would rather leave the conclusion to yourself  denis sat down again externally he managed to keep pretty calm but within he was now boiling with anger now chilled with apprehension he no longer felt convinced that he was dealing with a madman and if the old gentleman was sane what in gods name had he to look for what absurd or tragical adventure had befallen him what countenance was he to assume  while he was thus unpleasantly reflecting the arras that overhung the chapel door was raised and a tall priest in his robes came forth and giving a long keen stare at denis said something in an undertone to sire de mal√©troit  she is in a better frame of spirit asked the latter  she is more resigned messire replied the priest  now the lord help her she is hard to please sneered the old gentleman a likely striplingnot illbornand of her own choosing too why what more would the jade have  the situation is not usual for a young damsel said the other and somewhat trying to her blushes  she should have thought of that before she began the dance it was none of my choosing god knows that but since she is in it by our lady she shall carry it to the end and then addressing denis monsieur de beaulieu he asked may i present you to my niece she has been waiting your arrival i may say with even greater impatience than myself  denis had resigned himself with a good graceall he desired was to know the worst of it as speedily as possible so he rose at once and bowed in acquiescence the sire de mal√©troit followed his example and limped with the assistance of the chaplains arm towards the chapel door the priest pulled aside the arras and all three entered the building had considerable architectural pretensions a light groining sprang from six stout columns and hung down in two rich pendants from the centre of the vault the place terminated behind the altar in a round end embossed and honeycombed with a superfluity of ornament in relief and pierced by many little windows shaped like stars trefoils or wheels these windows were imperfectly glazed so that the nightair circulated freely in the chapel the tapers of which there must have been half a hundred burning on the altar were unmercifully blown about and the light went through many different phases of brilliancy and semieclipse on the steps in front of the altar knelt a young girl richly attired as a bride a chill settled over denis as he observed her costume he fought with desperate energy against the conclusion that was being thrust upon his mind it could notit should notbe as he feared  blanche said the sire in his most flutelike tones i have brought a friend to see you my little girl turn round and give him your pretty hand it is good to be devout but it is necessary to be polite my niece  the girl rose to her feet and turned towards the newcomers she moved all of a piece and shame and exhaustion were expressed in every line of her fresh young body and she held her head down and kept her eyes upon the pavement as she came slowly forward in the course of her advance her eyes fell upon denis de beaulieus feetfeet of which he was justly vain be it remarked and wore in the most elegant accoutrement even while travelling she pausedstarted as if his yellow boots had conveyed some shocking meaningand glanced suddenly up into the wearers countenance their eyes met shame gave place to horror and terror in her looks the blood left her lips with a piercing scream she covered her face with her hands and sank upon the chapel floor  that is not the man she cried my uncle that is not the man  the sire de mal√©troit chirped agreeably of course not he said i expected as much it was so unfortunate you could not remember his name  indeed she cried indeed i have never seen this person till this momenti have never so much as set eyes upon himi never wish to see him again sir she said turning to denis if you are a gentleman you will bear me out have i ever seen youhave you ever seen mebefore this accursed hour  to speak for myself i have never had that pleasure answered the young man this is the first time messire that i have met with your engaging niece  the old gentleman shrugged his shoulders  i am distressed to hear it he said but it is never too late to begin i had little more acquaintance with my own late lady ere i married her which proves he added with a grimace that these impromptu marriages may often produce an excellent understanding in the longrun as the bridegroom is to have a voice in the matter i will give him two hours to make up for lost time before we proceed with the ceremony and he turned towards the door followed by the clergyman  the girl was on her feet in a moment my uncle you cannot be in earnest she said i declare before god i will stab myself rather than be forced on that young man the heart rises at it god forbids such marriages you dishonour your white hair oh my uncle pity me there is not a woman in all the world but would prefer death to such a nuptial is it possible she added falteringis it possible that you do not believe methat you still think thisand she pointed at denis with a tremor of anger and contemptthat you still think this to be the man  frankly said the old gentleman pausing on the threshold i do but let me explain to you once for all blanche de mal√©troit my way of thinking about this affair when you took it into your head to dishonour my family and the name that i have borne in peace and war for more than threescore years you forfeited not only the right to question my designs but that of looking me in the face if your father had been alive he would have spat on you and turned you out of doors his was the hand of iron you may bless your god you have only to deal with the hand of velvet mademoiselle it was my duty to get you married without delay out of pure goodwill i have tried to find your own gallant for you and i believe i have succeeded but before god and all the holy angels blanche de mal√©troit if i have not i care not one jackstraw so let me recommend you to be polite to our young friend for upon my word your next groom may be less appetising  and with that he went out with the chaplain at his heels and the arras fell behind the pair  the girl turned upon denis with flashing eyes  and what sir she demanded may be the meaning of all this  god knows returned denis gloomily i am a prisoner in this house which seems full of mad people more i know not and nothing do i understand  and pray how came you here she asked  he told her as briefly as he could for the rest he added perhaps you will follow my example and tell me the answer to all these riddles and what in gods name is like to be the end of it  she stood silent for a little and he could see her lips tremble and her tearless eyes burn with a feverish lustre then she pressed her forehead in both hands  alas how my head aches she said wearilyto say nothing of my poor heart but it is due to you to know my story unmaidenly as it must seem i am called blanche de mal√©troit i have been without father or mother foroh for as long as i can recollect and indeed i have been most unhappy all my life three months ago a young captain began to stand near me every day in church i could see that i pleased him i am much to blame but i was so glad that any one should love me and when he passed me a letter i took it home with me and read it with great pleasure since that time he has written many he was so anxious to speak with me poor fellow and kept asking me to leave the door open some evening that we might have two words upon the stair for he knew how much my uncle trusted me she gave something like a sob at that and it was a moment before she could go on my uncle is a hard man but he is very shrewd she said at last he has performed many feats in war and was a great person at court and much trusted by queen isabeau in old days how he came to suspect me i cannot tell but it is hard to keep anything from his knowledge and this morning as we came from mass he took my hand in his forced it open and read my little billet walking by my side all the while when he had finished he gave it back to me with great politeness it contained another request to have the door left open and this has been the ruin of us all my uncle kept me strictly in my room until evening and then ordered me to dress myself as you see mea hard mockery for a young girl do you not think so i suppose when he could not prevail with me to tell him the young captains name he must have laid a trap for him into which alas you have fallen in the anger of god i looked for much confusion for how could i tell whether he was willing to take me for his wife on these sharp terms he might have been trifling with me from the first or i might have made myself too cheap in his eyes but truly i had not looked for such a shameful punishment as this i could not think that god would let a girl be so disgraced before a young man and now i have told you all and i can scarcely hope that you will not despise me  denis made her a respectful inclination  madam he said you have honoured me by your confidence it remains for me to prove that i am not unworthy of the honour is messire de mal√©troit at hand  i believe he is writing in the salle without she answered  may i lead you thither madam asked denis offering his hand with his most courtly bearing  she accepted it and the pair passed out of the chapel blanche in a very drooping and shamefaced condition but denis strutting and ruffling in the consciousness of a mission and a boyish certainty of accomplishing it with honour  the sire de mal√©troit rose to meet them with an ironical obeisance  sir said denis with the grandest possible air i believe i am to have some say in the matter of this marriage and let me tell you at once i will be no party to forcing the inclination of this young lady had it been freely offered to me i should have been proud to accept her hand for i perceive she is as good as she is beautiful but as things are i have now the honour messire of refusing  blanche looked at him with gratitude in her eyes but the old gentleman only smiled and smiled until his smile grew positively sickening to denis  i am afraid he said monsieur de beaulieu that you do not perfectly understand the choice i have to offer you follow me i beseech you to this window and he led the way to one of the large windows which stood open on the night you observe he went on there is an iron ring in the upper masonry and reeved through that a very efficacious rope now mark my words if you should find your disinclination to my nieces person insurmountable i shall have you hanged out of this window before sunrise i shall only proceed to such an extremity with the greatest regret you may believe me for it is not at all your death that i desire but my nieces establishment in life at the same time it must come to that if you prove obstinate your family monsieur de beaulieu is very well in its way but if you sprang from charlemagne you should not refuse the hand of a mal√©troit with impunitynot if she had been as common as the paris roadnot if she were as hideous as the gargoyle over my door neither my niece nor you nor my own private feelings move me at all in this matter the honour of my house has been compromised i believe you to be the guilty person at least you are now in the secret and you can hardly wonder if i request you to wipe out the stain if you will not your blood be on your own head it will be no great satisfaction to me to have your interesting relics kicking their heels in the breeze below my windows but half a loaf is better than no bread and if i cannot cure the dishonour i shall at least stop the scandal  there was a pause  i believe there are other ways of settling such imbroglios among gentlemen said denis you wear a sword and i hear you have used it with distinction  the sire de mal√©troit made a signal to the chaplain who crossed the room with long silent strides and raised the arras over the third of the three doors it was only a moment before he let it fall again but denis had time to see a dusky passage full of armed men  when i was a little younger i should have been delighted to honour you monsieur de beaulieu said sire alain but i am now too old faithful retainers are the sinews of age and i must employ the strength i have this is one of the hardest things to swallow as a man grows up in years but with a little patience even this becomes habitual you and the lady seem to prefer the salle for what remains of your two hours and as i have no desire to cross your preference i shall resign it to your use with all the pleasure in the world no haste he added holding up his hand as he saw a dangerous look come into denis de beaulieus face if your mind revolts against hanging it will be time enough two hours hence to throw yourself out of the window or upon the pikes of my retainers two hours of life are always two hours a great many things may turn up in even as little a while as that and besides if i understand her appearance my niece has still something to say to you you will not disfigure your last hours by a want of politeness to a lady  denis looked at blanche and she made him an imploring gesture  it is likely that the old gentleman was hugely pleased at this symptom of an understanding for he smiled on both and added sweetly if you will give me your word of honour monsieur de beaulieu to await my return at the end of the two hours before attempting anything desperate i shall withdraw my retainers and let you speak in greater privacy with mademoiselle  denis again glanced at the girl who seemed to beseech him to agree  i give you my word of honour he said  messire de mal√©troit bowed and proceeded to limp about the apartment clearing his throat the while with that odd musical chirp which had already grown so irritating in the ears of denis de beaulieu he first possessed himself of some papers which lay upon the table then he went to the mouth of the passage and appeared to give an order to the men behind the arras and lastly he hobbled out through the door by which denis had come in turning upon the threshold to address a last smiling bow to the young couple and followed by the chaplain with a handlamp  no sooner were they alone than blanche advanced towards denis with her hands extended her face was flushed and excited and her eyes shone with tears  you shall not die she cried you shall marry me after all  you seem to think madam replied denis that i stand much in fear of death  oh no no she said i see you are no poltroon it is for my own sakei could not bear to have you slain for such a scruple  i am afraid returned denis that you underrate the difficulty madam what you may be too generous to refuse i may be too proud to accept in a moment of noble feeling towards me you forget what you perhaps owe to others  he had the decency to keep his eyes upon the floor as he said this and after he had finished so as not to spy upon her confusion she stood silent for a moment then walked suddenly away and falling on her uncles chair fairly burst out sobbing denis was in the acme of embarrassment he looked round as if to seek for inspiration and seeing a stool plumped down upon it for something to do there he sat playing with the guard of his rapier and wishing himself dead a thousand times over and buried in the nastiest kitchenheap in france his eyes wandered round the apartment but found nothing to arrest them there were such wide spaces between the furniture the light fell so baldly and cheerlessly over all the dark outside air looked in so coldly through the windows that he thought he had never seen a church so vast nor a tomb so melancholy the regular sobs of blanche de mal√©troit measured out the time like the ticking of a clock he read the device upon the shield over and over again until his eyes became obscured he stared into shadowy corners until he imagined they were swarming with horrible animals and every now and again he awoke with a start to remember that his last two hours were running and death was on the march  oftener and oftener as the time went on did his glance settle on the girl herself her face was bowed forward and covered with her hands and she was shaken at intervals by the convulsive hiccup of grief even thus she was not an unpleasant object to dwell upon so plump and yet so fine with a warm brown skin and the most beautiful hair denis thought in the whole world of womankind her hands were like her uncles but they were more in place at the end of her young arms and looked infinitely soft and caressing he remembered how her blue eyes had shone upon him full of anger pity and innocence and the more he dwelt on her perfections the uglier death looked and the more deeply was he smitten with penitence at her continued tears now he felt that no man could have the courage to leave a world which contained so beautiful a creature and now he would have given forty minutes of his last hour to have unsaid his cruel speech  suddenly a hoarse and ragged peal of cockcrow rose to their ears from the dark valley below the windows and this shattering noise in the silence of all around was like a light in a dark place and shook them both out of their reflections  alas can i do nothing to help you she said looking up  madam replied denis with a fine irrelevancy if i have said anything to wound you believe me it was for your own sake and not for mine  she thanked him with a tearful look  i feel your position cruelly he went on the world has been bitter hard on you your uncle is a disgrace to mankind believe me madam there is no young gentleman in all france but would be glad of my opportunity to die in doing you a momentary service  i know already that you can be very brave and generous she answered what i want to know is whether i can serve younow or afterwards she added with a quaver  most certainly he answered with a smile let me sit beside you as if i were a friend instead of a foolish intruder try to forget how awkwardly we are placed to one another make my last moments go pleasantly and you will do me the chief service possible  you are very gallant she added with a yet deeper sadness very gallantand it somehow pains me but draw nearer if you please and if you find anything to say to me you will at least make certain of a very friendly listener ah monsieur de beaulieu she broke forthah monsieur de beaulieu how can i look you in the face and she fell to weeping again with a renewed effusion  madam said denis taking her hand in both of his reflect on the little time i have before me and the great bitterness into which i am cast by the sight of your distress spare me in my last moments the spectacle of what i cannot cure even with the sacrifice of my life  i am very selfish answered blanche i will be braver monsieur de beaulieu for your sake but think if i can do you no kindness in the futureif you have no friends to whom i could carry your adieux charge me as heavily as you can every burden will lighten by so little the invaluable gratitude i owe you put it in my power to do something more for you than weep  my mother is married again and has a young family to care for my brother guichard will inherit my fiefs and if i am not in error that will content him amply for my death life is a little vapour that passeth away as we are told by those in holy orders when a man is in a fair way and sees all life open in front of him he seems to himself to make a very important figure in the world his horse whinnies to him the trumpets blow and the girls look out of window as he rides into town before his company he receives many assurances of trust and regardsometimes by express in a lettersometimes face to face with persons of great consequence falling on his neck it is not wonderful if his head is turned for a time but once he is dead were he as brave as hercules or as wise as solomon he is soon forgotten it is not ten years since my father fell with many other knights around him in a very fierce encounter and i do not think that any one of them nor so much as the name of the fight is now remembered no no madam the nearer you come to it you see that death is a dark and dusty corner where a man gets into his tomb and has the door shut after him till the judgmentday i have few friends just now and once i am dead i shall have none  ah monsieur de beaulieu she exclaimed you forget blanche de mal√©troit  you have a sweet nature madam and you are pleased to estimate a little service far beyond its worth  it is not that she answered you mistake me if you think i am so easily touched by my own concerns i say so because you are the noblest man i have ever met because i recognise in you a spirit that would have made even a common person famous in the land  and yet here i die in a mousetrapwith no more noise about it than my own squeaking answered he  a look of pain crossed her face and she was silent for a little while then a light came into her eyes and with a smile she spoke again  i cannot have my champion think meanly of himself any one who gives his life for another will be met in paradise by all the heralds and angels of the lord god and you have no cause to hang your head forpray do you think me beautiful she asked with a deep flush  indeed madam i do he said  i am glad of that she answered heartily do you think there are many men in france who have been asked in marriage by a beautiful maidenwith her own lipsand who have refused her to her face i know you men would halfdespise such a triumph but believe me we women know more of what is precious in love there is nothing that should set a person higher in his own esteem and we women would prize nothing more dearly  you are very good he said but you cannot make me forget that i was asked in pity and not for love  i am not so sure of that she replied holding down her head hear me to an end monsieur de beaulieu i know how you must despise me i feel you are right to do so i am too poor a creature to occupy one thought of your mind although alas you must die for me this morning but when i asked you to marry me indeed and indeed it was because i respected and admired you and loved you with my whole soul from the very moment that you took my part against my uncle if you had seen yourself and how noble you looked you would pity rather than despise me and now she went on hurriedly checking him with her hand although i have laid aside all reserve and told you so much remember that i know your sentiments towards me already i would not believe me being nobly born weary you with importunities into consent i too have a pride of my own and i declare before the holy mother of god if you should now go back from your word already given i would no more marry you than i would marry my uncles groom  denis smiled a little bitterly  it is a small love he said that shies at a little pride  she made no answer although she probably had her own thoughts  come hither to the window he said with a sigh here is the dawn  and indeed the dawn was already beginning the hollow of the sky was full of essential daylight colourless and clean and the valley underneath was flooded with a grey reflection a few thin vapours clung in the coves of the forest or lay along the winding course of the river the scene disengaged a surprising effect of stillness which was hardly interrupted when the cocks began once more to crow among the steadings perhaps the same fellow who had made so horrid a clangour in the darkness not half an hour before now sent up the merriest cheer to greet the coming day a little wind went bustling and eddying among the treetops underneath the windows and still the daylight kept flooding insensibly out of the east which was soon to grow incandescent and cast up that redhot cannonball the rising sun  denis looked out over all this with a bit of a shiver he had taken her hand and retained it in his almost unconsciously  has the day begun already she said and then illogically enough the night has been so long alas what shall we say to my uncle when he returns  what you will said denis and he pressed her fingers in his  she was silent  blanche he said with a swift uncertain passionate utterance you have seen whether i fear death you must know well enough that i would as gladly leap out of that window into the empty air as lay a finger on you without your free and full consent but if you care for me at all do not let me lose my life in a misapprehension for i love you better than the whole world and though i will die for you blithely it would be like all the joys of paradise to live on and spend my life in your service  as he stopped speaking a bell began to ring loudly in the interior of the house and a clatter of armour in the corridor showed that the retainers were returning to their post and the two hours were at an end  after all that you have heard she whispered leaning towards him with her lips and eyes  i have heard nothing he replied  the captains name was florimond de champdivers she said in his ear  i did not hear it he answered taking her supple body in his arms and covered her wet face with kisses  a melodious chirping was audible behind followed by a beautiful chuckle and the voice of messire de mal√©troit wished his new nephew a good morning     providence and the guitar     chapter i   monsieur l√©on berthelini had a great care of his appearance and sedulously suited his deportment to the costume of the hour he affected something spanish in his air and something of the bandit with a flavour of rembrandt at home in person he was decidedly small and inclined to be stout his face was the picture of goodhumour his dark eyes which were very expressive told of a kind heart a brisk merry nature and the most indefatigable spirits if he had worn the clothes of the period you would have set him down for a hitherto undiscovered hybrid between the barber the innkeeper and the affable dispensing chemist but in the outrageous bravery of velvet jacket and flapped hat with trousers that were more accurately described as fleshings a white handkerchief cavalierly knotted at his neck a shock of olympian curls upon his brow and his feet shod through all weathers in the slenderest of moli√®re shoesyou had but to look at him and you knew you were in the presence of a great creature when he wore an overcoat he scorned to pass the sleeves a single button held it round his shoulders it was tossed backwards after the manner of a cloak and carried with the gait and presence of an almaviva i am of opinion that m berthelini was nearing forty but he had a boys heart gloried in his finery and walked through life like a child in a perpetual dramatic performance if he were not almaviva after all it was not for lack of making believe and he enjoyed the artists compensation if he were not really almaviva he was sometimes just as happy as though he were  i have seen him at moments when he has fancied himself alone with his maker adopt so gay and chivalrous a bearing and represent his own part with so much warmth and conscience that the illusion became catching and i believed implicitly in the great creatures pose  but alas life cannot be entirely conducted on these principles man cannot live by almavivery alone and the great creature having failed upon several theatres was obliged to step down every evening from his heights and sing from half a dozen to a dozen comic songs twang a guitar keep a country audience in good humour and preside finally over the mysteries of a tombola  madame berthelini who was art and part with him in these undignified labours had perhaps a higher position in the scale of beings and enjoyed a natural dignity of her own but her heart was not any more rightly placed for that would have been impossible and she had acquired a little air of melancholy attractive enough in its way but not good to see like the wholesome skyscraping boyish spirits of her lord  he indeed swam like a kite on a fair wind high above earthly troubles detonations of temper were not unfrequent in the zones he travelled but sulky fogs and tearful depressions were there alike unknown a welldelivered blow upon a table or a noble attitude imitated from m√©lingue or fr√©d√©ric relieved his irritation like a vengeance though the heaven had fallen if he had played his part with propriety berthelini had been content and the mans atmosphere if not his example reacted on his wife for the couple doated on each other and although you would have thought they walked in different worlds yet continued to walk hand in hand  it chanced one day that monsieur and madame berthelini descended with two boxes and a guitar in a fat case at the station of the little town of castelleg√¢chis and the omnibus carried them with their effects to the hotel of the black head this was a dismal conventual building in a narrow street capable of standing siege when once the gates were shut and smelling strangely in the interior of straw and chocolate and old feminine apparel berthelini paused upon the threshold with a painful premonition in some former state it seemed to him he had visited a hostelry that smelt not otherwise and been ill received  the landlord a tragic person in a large felt hat rose from a businesstable under the keyrack and came forward removing his hat with both hands as he did so  sir i salute you may i inquire what is your charge for artists inquired berthelini with a courtesy at once splendid and insinuating  for artists said the landlord his countenance fell and the smile of welcome disappeared oh artists he added brutally four francs a day and he turned his back upon these inconsiderable customers  a commercial traveller is received he also upon a reductionyet is he welcome yet can he command the fatted calf but an artist had he the manners of an almaviva were he dressed like solomon in all his glory is received like a dog and served like a timid lady travelling alone  accustomed as he was to the rubs of his profession berthelini was unpleasantly affected by the landlords manner  elvira said he to his wife mark my words castelleg√¢chis is a tragic folly  wait till we see what we take replied elvira  we shall take nothing replied berthelini we shall feed upon insults i have an eye elvira i have a spirit of divination and this place is accursed the landlord has been discourteous the commissary will be brutal the audience will be sordid and uproarious and you will take a cold upon your throat we have been besotted enough to come the die is castit will be a second sedan  sedan was a town hateful to the berthelinis not only from patriotism for they were french and answered after the flesh to the somewhat homely name of duval but because it had been the scene of their most sad reverses in that place they had lain three weeks in pawn for their hotel bill and had it not been for a surprising stroke of fortune they might have been lying there in pawn until this day to mention the name of sedan was for the berthelinis to dip the brush in earthquake and eclipse count almaviva slouched his hat with a gesture expressive of despair and even elvira felt as if illfortune had been personally evoked  let us ask for breakfast said she with a womans tact  the commissary of police of castelleg√¢chis was a large red commissary pimpled and subject to a strong cutaneous transpiration i have repeated the name of his office because he was so very much more a commissary than a man the spirit of his dignity had entered into him he carried his corporation as if it were something official whenever he insulted a common citizen it seemed to him as if he were adroitly flattering the government by a sidewind in default of dignity he was brutal from an overweening sense of duty his office was a den whence passersby could hear rude accents laying down not the law but the good pleasure of the commissary  six several times in the course of the day did m berthelini hurry thither in quest of the requisite permission for his evenings entertainment six several times he found the official was abroad l√©on berthelini began to grow quite a familiar figure in the streets of castelleg√¢chis he became a local celebrity and was pointed out as the man who was looking for the commissary idle children attached themselves to his footsteps and trotted after him back and forward between the hotel and the office l√©on might try as he liked he might roll cigarettes he might straddle he might cock his hat at a dozen different jaunty inclinationsthe part of almaviva was under the circumstances difficult to play  as he passed the marketplace upon the seventh excursion the commissary was pointed out to him where he stood with his waistcoat unbuttoned and his hands behind his back to superintend the sale and measurement of butter berthelini threaded his way through the marketstalls and baskets and accosted the dignitary with a bow which was a triumph of the histrionic art  i have the honour he asked of meeting m le commissaire  the commissary was affected by the nobility of his address he excelled l√©on in the depth if not in the airy grace of his salutation  the honour said he is mine  i am continued the strolling player i am sir an artist and i have permitted myself to interrupt you on an affair of business tonight i give a trifling musical entertainment at the caf√© of the triumphs of the ploughpermit me to offer you this little programmeand i have come to ask you for the necessary authorisation  at the word artist the commissary had replaced his hat with the air of a person who having condescended too far should suddenly remember the duties of his rank  go go said he i am busy i am measuring butter  heathen jew thought l√©on permit me sir he resumed aloud i have gone six times already  put up your bills if you choose interrupted the commissary in an hour or so i will examine your papers at the office but now go i am busy  measuring butter thought berthelini o france and it is for this that we made 93  the preparations were soon made the bills posted programmes laid on the dinnertable of every hotel in the town and a stage erected at one end of the caf√© of the triumphs of the plough but when l√©on returned to the office the commissary was once more abroad  he is like madame beno√Æton thought l√©on fichu commissaire  and just then he met the man face to face  here sir said he are my papers will you be pleased to verify  but the commissary was now intent upon dinner  no use he replied no use i am busy i am quite satisfied give your entertainment  and he hurried on  fichu commissaire thought l√©on     chapter ii   the audience was pretty large and the proprietor of the caf√© made a good thing of it in beer but the berthelinis exerted themselves in vain  l√©on was radiant in velveteen he had a rakish way of smoking a cigarette between his songs that was worth money in itself he underlined his comic points so that the dullest numskull in castelleg√¢chis had a notion when to laugh and he handled his guitar in a manner worthy of himself indeed his play with that instrument was as good as a whole romantic drama it was so dashing so florid and so cavalier  elvira on the other hand sang her patriotic and romantic songs with more than usual expression her voice had charm and plangency and as l√©on looked at her in her lowbodied maroon dress with her arms bare to the shoulder and a red flower set provocatively in her corset he repeated to himself for the many hundredth time that she was one of the loveliest creatures in the world of women  alas when she went round with the tambourine the golden youth of castelleg√¢chis turned from her coldly here and there a single halfpenny was forthcoming the net result of a collection never exceeded half a franc and the maire himself after seven different applications had contributed exactly twopence a certain chill began to settle upon the artists themselves it seemed as if they were singing to slugs apollo himself might have lost heart with such an audience the berthelinis struggled against the impression they put their back into their work they sang louder and louder the guitar twanged like a living thing and at last l√©on arose in his might and burst with inimitable conviction into his great song y a des honn√™tes gens partout never had he given more proof of his artistic mastery it was his intimate indefeasible conviction that castelleg√¢chis formed an exception to the law he was now lyrically proclaiming and was peopled exclusively by thieves and bullies and yet as i say he flung it down like a challenge he trolled it forth like an article of faith and his face so beamed the while that you would have thought he must make converts of the benches  he was at the top of his register with his head thrown back and his mouth open when the door was thrown violently open and a pair of newcomers marched noisily into the caf√© it was the commissary followed by the garde champ√™tre  the undaunted berthelini still continued to proclaim y a des honn√™tes gens partout but now the sentiment produced an audible titter among the audience berthelini wondered why he did not know the antecedents of the garde champ√™tre he had never heard of a little story about postagestamps but the public knew all about the postagestamps and enjoyed the coincidence hugely  the commissary planted himself upon a vacant chair with somewhat the air of cromwell visiting the rump and spoke in occasional whispers to the garde champ√™tre who remained respectfully standing at his back the eyes of both were directed upon berthelini who persisted in his statement  y a des honn√™tes gens partout he was just chanting for the twentieth time when up got the commissary upon his feet and waved brutally to the singer with his cane  is it me you want inquired l√©on stopping in his song  it is you replied the potentate  fichu commissaire thought l√©on and he descended from the stage and made his way to the functionary  how does it happen sir said the commissary swelling in person that i find you mountebanking in a public caf√© without my permission  without cried the indignant l√©on permit me to remind you  come come sir said the commissary i desire no explanations  i care nothing about what you desire returned the singer i choose to give them and i will not be gagged i am an artist sir a distinction that you cannot comprehend i received your permission and stand here upon the strength of it interfere with me who dare  you have not got my signature i tell you cried the commissary show me my signature where is my signature  that was just the question where was his signature l√©on recognised that he was in a hole but his spirit rose with the occasion and he blustered nobly tossing back his curls the commissary played up to him in the character of tyrant and as the one leaned farther forward the other leaned farther backmajesty confronting fury the audience had transferred their attention to this new performance and listened with that silent gravity common to all frenchmen in the neighbourhood of the police elvira had sat down she was used to these distractions and it was rather melancholy than fear that now oppressed her  another word cried the commissary and i arrest you  arrest me shouted l√©on i defy you  i am the commissary of police said the official  l√©on commanded his feelings and replied with great delicacy of innuendo  so it would appear  the point was too refined for castelleg√¢chis it did not raise a smile and as for the commissary he simply bade the singer follow him to his office and directed his proud footsteps towards the door there was nothing for it but to obey l√©on did so with a proper pantomime of indifference but it was a leek to eat and there was no denying it  the maire had slipped out and was already waiting at the commissarys door now the maire in france is the refuge of the oppressed he stands between his people and the boisterous rigours of the police he can sometimes understand what is said to him he is not always puffed up beyond measure by his dignity tis a thing worth the knowledge of travellers when all seems over and a man has made up his mind to injustice he has still like the heroes of romance a little bugle at his belt whereon to blow and the maire a comfortable deus ex machin√¢ may still descend to deliver him from the minions of the law the maire of castelleg√¢chis although inaccessible to the charms of music as retailed by the berthelinis had no hesitation whatever as to the rights of the matter he instantly fell foul of the commissary in very high terms and the commissary pricked by this humiliation accepted battle on the point of fact the argument lasted some little while with varying success until at length victory inclined so plainly to the commissarys side that the maire was fain to reassert himself by an exercise of authority he had been outargued but he was still the maire and so turning from his interlocutor he briefly but kindly recommended l√©on to get back instanter to his concert  it is already growing late he added  l√©on did not wait to be told twice he returned to the caf√© of the triumphs of the plough with all expedition alas the audience had melted away during his absence elvira was sitting in a very disconsolate attitude on the guitarbox she had watched the company dispersing by twos and threes and the prolonged spectacle had somewhat overwhelmed her spirits each man she reflected retired with a certain proportion of her earnings in his pocket and she saw tonights board and tomorrows railway expenses and finally even tomorrows dinner walk one after another out of the caf√©door and disappear into the night  what was it she asked languidly  but l√©on did not answer he was looking round him on the scene of defeat scarce a score of listeners remained and these of the least promising sort the minutehand of the clock was already climbing upward towards eleven  its a lost battle said he and then taking up the moneybox he turned it out three francs seventyfive he cried as against four of board and six of railway fares and no time for the tombola elvira this is waterloo and he sat down and passed both hands desperately among his curls o fichu commissaire he cried fichu commissaire  let us get the things together and be off returned elvira we might try another song but there is not six halfpence in the room  six halfpence cried l√©on six hundred thousand devils there is not a human creature in the townnothing but pigs and dogs and commissaries pray heaven we get safe to bed  dont imagine things exclaimed elvira with a shudder  and with that they set to work on their preparations the tobaccojar the cigaretteholder the three papers of shirtstuds which were to have been the prizes of the tombola had the tombola come off were made into a bundle with the music the guitar was stowed into the fat guitarcase and elvira having thrown a thin shawl about her neck and shoulders the pair issued from the caf√© and set off for the black head  as they crossed the marketplace the church bell rang out eleven it was a dark mild night and there was no one in the streets  it is all very fine said l√©on but i have a presentiment the night is not yet done     chapter iii   the black head presented not a single chink of light upon the street and the carriage gate was closed  this is unprecedented observed l√©on an inn closed by five minutes after eleven and there were several commercial travellers in the caf√© up to a late hour elvira my heart misgives me let us ring the bell  the bell had a potent note and being swung under the arch it filled the house from top to bottom with surly clanging reverberations the sound accentuated the conventual appearance of the building a wintry sentiment a thought of prayer and mortification took hold upon elviras mind and as for l√©on he seemed to be reading the stage directions for a lugubrious fifth act  this is your fault said elvira this is what comes of fancying things  again l√©on pulled the bellrope again the solemn tocsin awoke the echoes of the inn and ere they had died away a light glimmered in the carriage entrance and a powerful voice was heard upraised and tremulous with wrath  whats all this cried the tragic host through the spars of the gate hard upon twelve and you come clamouring like prussians at the door of a respectable hotel oh he cried i know you now common singers people in trouble with the police and you present yourselves at midnight like lords and ladies be off with you  you will permit me to remind you replied l√©on in thrilling tones that i am a guest in your house that i am properly inscribed and that i have deposited baggage to the value of four hundred francs  you cannot get in at this hour returned the man this is no thieves tavern for mohocks and nightrakes and organgrinders  brute cried elvira for the organgrinders touched her home  then i demand my baggage said l√©on with unabated dignity  i know nothing of your baggage replied the landlord  you detain my baggage you dare to detain my baggage cried the singer  who are you returned the landlord it is darki cannot recognise you  very well thenyou detain my baggage concluded l√©on you shall smart for this i will weary out your life with persecutions i will drag you from court to court if there is justice to be had in france it shall be rendered between you and me and i will make you a bywordi will put you in a songa scurrilous songan indecent songa popular songwhich the boys shall sing to you in the street and come and howl through these spars at midnight  he had gone on raising his voice at every phrase for all the while the landlord was very placidly retiring and now when the last glimmer of light had vanished from the arch and the last footstep died away in the interior l√©on turned to his wife with a heroic countenance  elvira said he i have now a duty in life i shall destroy that man as eug√®ne sue destroyed the concierge let us come at once to the gendarmerie and begin our vengeance  he picked up the guitarcase which had been propped against the wall and they set forth through the silent and illlighted town with burning hearts  the gendarmerie was concealed beside the telegraphoffice at the bottom of a vast court which was partly laid out in gardens and here all the shepherds of the public lay locked in grateful sleep it took a deal of knocking to waken one and he when he came at last to the door could find no other remark but that it was none of his business l√©on reasoned with him threatened him besought him here he said was madame berthelini in evening dressa delicate womanin an interesting conditionthe last was thrown in i fancy for effect and to all this the manatarms made the same answer  it is none of my business said he  very well said l√©on then we shall go to the commissary thither they went the office was closed and dark but the house was close by and l√©on was soon swinging the bell like a madman the commissarys wife appeared at the window she was a threadpaper creature and informed them that the commissary had not yet come home  is he at the maires demanded l√©on  she thought that was not unlikely  where is the maires house he asked  and she gave him some rather vague information on that point  stay you here elvira said l√©on lest i should miss him by the way if when i return i find you here no longer i shall follow at once to the black head  and he set out to find the maires it took him some ten minutes wandering among blind lanes and when he arrived it was already half an hour past midnight a long white garden wall overhung by some thick chestnuts a door with a letterbox and an iron bellpullthat was all that could be seen of the maires domicile l√©on took the bellpull in both hands and danced furiously upon the sidewalk the bell itself was just upon the other side of the wall it responded to his activity and scattered an alarming clangour far and wide into the night  a window was thrown open in a house across the street and a voice inquired the cause of this untimely uproar  i wish the maire said l√©on  he has been in bed this hour returned the voice  he must get up again retorted l√©on and he was for tackling the bellpull once more  you will never make him hear responded the voice the garden is of great extent the house is at the farther end and both the maire and his housekeeper are deaf  aha said l√©on pausing the maire is deaf is he that explains and he thought of the evenings concert with a momentary feeling of relief ah he continued and so the maire is deaf and the garden vast and the house at the far end  and you might ring all night added the voice and be none the better for it you would only keep me awake  thank you neighbour replied the singer you shall sleep  and he made off again at his best pace for the commissarys elvira was still walking to and fro before the door  he has not come asked l√©on  not he she replied  good returned l√©on i am sure our mans inside let me see the guitarcase i shall lay this siege in form elvira i am angry i am indignant i am truculently inclined but i thank my maker i have still a sense of fun the unjust judge shall be importuned in a serenade elvira set him upand set him up  he had the case opened by this time struck a few chords and fell into an attitude which was irresistibly spanish  now he continued feel your voice are you ready follow me  the guitar twanged and the two voices upraised in harmony and with a startling loudness the chorus of a song of old b√©rangers    commissaire commissaire    colin bat sa m√©nag√®re  the stones of castelleg√¢chis thrilled at this audacious innovation hitherto had the night been sacred to repose and nightcaps and now what was this window after window was opened matches scratched and candles began to flicker swollen sleepy faces peered forth into the starlight there were the two figures before the commissarys house each bolt upright with head thrown back and eyes interrogating the starry heavens the guitar wailed shouted and reverberated like half an orchestra and the voices with a crisp and spirited delivery hurled the appropriate burden at the commissarys window all the echoes repeated the functionarys name it was more like an entracte in a farce of moli√®res than a passage of real life in castelleg√¢chis  the commissary if he was not the first was not the last of the neighbours to yield to the influence of music and furiously threw open the window of his bedroom he was beside himself with rage he leaned far over the windowsill raving and gesticulating the tassel of his white nightcap danced like a thing of life he opened his mouth to dimensions hitherto unprecedented and yet his voice instead of escaping from it in a roar came forth shrill and choked and tottering a little more serenading and it was clear he would be better acquainted with the apoplexy  i scorn to reproduce his language he touched upon too many serious topics by the way for a quiet storyteller although he was known for a man who was prompt with his tongue and had a power of strong expression at command he excelled himself so remarkably this night that one maiden lady who had got out of bed like the rest to hear the serenade was obliged to shut her window at the second clause even what she had heard disquieted her conscience and next day she said she scarcely reckoned as a maiden lady any longer  l√©on tried to explain his predicament but he received nothing but threats of arrest by way of answer  if i come down to you cried the commissary  ay said l√©on do  i will not cried the commissary  you dare not answered l√©on  at that the commissary closed his window  all is over said the singer the serenade was perhaps illjudged these boors have no sense of humour  let us get away from here said elvira with a shiver all these people lookingit is so rude and so brutal and then giving way once more to passionbrutes she cried aloud to the candlelit spectatorsbrutes brutes brutes  sauve qui peut said l√©on you have done it now  and taking the guitar in one hand and the case in the other he led the way with something too precipitate to be merely called precipitation from the scene of this absurd adventure     chapter iv   to the west of castelleg√¢chis four rows of venerable limetrees formed in this starry night a twilit avenue with two side aisles of pitch darkness here and there stone benches were disposed between the trunks there was not a breath of wind a heavy atmosphere of perfume hung about the alleys and every leaf stood stockstill upon its twig hither after vainly knocking at an inn or two the berthelinis came at length to pass the night after an amiable contention l√©on insisted on giving his coat to elvira and they sat down together on the first bench in silence l√©on made a cigarette which he smoked to an end looking up into the trees and beyond them at the constellations of which he tried vainly to recall the names the silence was broken by the church bell it rang the four quarters on a light and tinkling measure then followed a single deep stroke that died slowly away with a thrill and stillness resumed its empire  one said l√©on four hours till daylight it is warm it is starry i have matches and tobacco do not let us exaggerate elvirathe experience is positively charming i feel a glow within me i am born again this is the poetry of life think of coopers novels my dear  l√©on she said fiercely how can you talk such wicked infamous nonsense to pass all night out of doorsit is like a nightmare we shall die  you suffer yourself to be led away he replied soothingly it is not unpleasant here only you brood come now let us repeat a scene shall we try alceste and c√©lim√®ne no or a passage from the two orphans come now it will occupy your mind i will play up to you as i never have played before i feel art moving in my bones  hold your tongue she cried or you will drive me mad will nothing solemnise younot even this hideous situation  oh hideous objected l√©on hideous is not the word why where would you be dites la jeune belle o√π voulezvous aller he carolled well now he went on opening the guitarcase theres another idea for yousing sing dites la jeune belle it will compose your spirits elvira i am sure  and without waiting an answer he began to strum the symphony the first chords awoke a young man who was lying asleep upon a neighbouring bench  hullo cried the young man who are you  under which king bezonian declaimed the artist speak or die  or if it was not exactly that it was something to much the same purpose from a french tragedy  the young man drew near in the twilight he was a tall powerful gentlemanly fellow with a somewhat puffy face dressed in a grey tweed suit with a deerstalker hat of the same material and as he now came forward he carried a knapsack slung upon one arm  are you camping out here too he asked with a strong english accent im not sorry for company  l√©on explained their misadventure and the other told them that he was a cambridge undergraduate on a walking tour that he had run short of money could no longer pay for his nights lodging had already been camping out for two nights and feared he should require to continue the same manoeuvre for at least two nights more  luckily its jolly weather he concluded  you hear that elvira said l√©onmadame berthelini he went on is ridiculously affected by this trifling occurrence for my part i find it romantic and far from uncomfortable or at least he added shifting on the stone bench not quite so uncomfortable as might have been expected but pray be seated  yes returned the undergraduate sitting down its rather nice than otherwise when once youre used to it only its devilish difficult to get washed i like the fresh air and these stars and things  aha said l√©on monsieur is an artist  an artist returned the other with a blank stare not if i know it  pardon me said the actor what you said this moment about the orbs of heaven  oh nonsense cried the englishman a fellow may admire the stars and be anything he likes  you have an artists nature however mr  i beg your pardon may i without indiscretion inquire your name asked l√©on  my name is stubbs replied the englishman  i thank you returned l√©on mine is berthelinil√©on berthelini exartist of the theatres of montrouge belleville and montmartre humble as you see me i have created with applause more than one important r√¥le the press were unanimous in praise of my howling devil of the mountains in the piece of the same name madame whom i now present to you is herself an artist and i must not omit to state a better artist than her husband she also is a creator she created nearly twenty successful songs at one of the principal parisian musichalls but to continue i was saying you had an artists nature monsieur stubbs and you must permit me to be a judge in such a question i trust you will not falsify your instincts let me beseech you to follow the career of an artist  thank you returned stubbs with a chuckle im going to be a banker  no said l√©on do not say so not that a man with such a nature as yours should not derogate so far what are a few privations here and there so long as you are working for a high and noble goal  this fellows mad thought stubbs but the womans rather pretty and hes not bad fun himself if you come to that what he said was different i thought you said you were an actor  i certainly did so replied l√©on i am one or alas i was  and so you want me to be an actor do you continued the undergraduate why man i could never so much as learn the stuff my memorys like a sieve and as for acting ive no more idea than a cat  the stage is not the only course said l√©on be a sculptor be a dancer be a poet or a novelist follow your heart in short and do some thorough work before you die  and do you call all these things art inquired stubbs  why certainly returned l√©on are they not all branches  oh i didnt know replied the englishman i thought an artist meant a fellow who painted  the singer stared at him in some surprise  it is the difference of language he said at last this tower of babel when shall we have paid for it if i could speak english you would follow me more readily  between you and me i dont believe i should replied the other you seem to have thought a devil of a lot about this business for my part i admire the stars and like to have them shiningits so cheerybut hang me if i had an idea it had anything to do with art its not in my line you see im not intellectual i have no end of trouble to scrape through my exams i can tell you but im not a bad sort at bottom he added seeing his interlocutor looked distressed even in the dim starshine and i rather like the play and music and guitars and things  l√©on had a perception that the understanding was incomplete he changed the subject  and so you travel on foot he continued how romantic how courageous and how are you pleased with my land how does the scenery affect you among these wild hills of ours  well the fact is began stubbshe was about to say that he didnt care for scenery which was not at all true being on the contrary only an athletic undergraduate pretension but he had begun to suspect that berthelini liked a different sort of meat and substituted something else the fact is i think it jolly they told me it was no good up here even the guidebook said so but i dont know what they meant i think it is deuced prettyupon my word i do  at this moment in the most unexpected manner elvira burst into tears  my voice she cried l√©on if i stay here longer i shall lose my voice  you shall not stay another moment cried the actor  if i have to beat in a door if i have to burn the town i shall find you shelter  with that he replaced the guitar and comforting her with some caresses drew her arm through his  monsieur stubbs said he taking off his hat the reception i offer you is rather problematical but let me beseech you to give us the pleasure of your society you are a little embarrassed for the moment you must indeed permit me to advance what may be necessary i ask it as a favour we must not part so soon after having met so strangely  oh come you know said stubbs i cant let a fellow like you and there he paused feeling somehow or other on a wrong tack  i do not wish to employ menaces continued l√©on with a smile but if you refuse indeed i shall not take it kindly  i dont quite see my way out of it thought the undergraduate and then after a pause he said aloud and ungraciously enough all right iim very much obliged of course and he proceeded to follow them thinking in his heart but its bad form all the same to force an obligation on a fellow     chapter v   l√©on strode ahead as if he knew exactly where he was going the sobs of madame were still faintly audible and no one uttered a word a dog barked furiously in a courtyard as they went by then the church clock struck two and many domestic clocks followed or preceded it in piping tones and just then berthelini spied a light it burned in a small house on the outskirts of the town and thither the party now directed their steps  it is always a chance said l√©on  the house in question stood back from the street behind an open space part garden part turnipfield and several outhouses stood forward from either wing at right angles to the front one of these had recently undergone some change an enormous window looking towards the north had been effected in the wall and roof and l√©on began to hope it was a studio  if its only a painter he said with a chuckle ten to one we get as good a welcome as we want  i thought painters were principally poor said stubbs  ah cried l√©on you do not know the world as i do the poorer the better for us  and the trio advanced into the turnipfield  the light was in the ground floor as one window was brightly illuminated and two others more faintly it might be supposed that there was a single lamp in one corner of a large apartment and a certain tremulousness and temporary dwindling showed that a live fire contributed to the effect the sound of a voice now became audible and the trespassers paused to listen it was pitched in a high angry key but had still a good full and masculine note in it the utterance was voluble too voluble even to be quite distinct a stream of words rising and falling with ever and again a phrase thrown out by itself as if the speaker reckoned on its virtue  suddenly another voice joined in this time it was a womans and if the man were angry the woman was incensed to the degree of fury there was that absolutely blank composure known to suffering males that colourless unnatural speech which shows a spirit accurately balanced between homicide and hysterics the tone in which the best of women sometimes utter words worse than death to those most dear to them if abstract bonesandsepulchre were to be endowed with the gift of speech thus and not otherwise would it discourse l√©on was a brave man and i fear he was somewhat sceptically given he had been educated in a papistical country but the habit of childhood prevailed and he crossed himself devoutly he had met several women in his career it was obvious that his instinct had not deceived him for the male voice broke forth instantly in a towering passion  the undergraduate who had not understood the significance of the womans contribution pricked up his ears at the change upon the man  theres going to be a free fight he opined  there was another retort from the woman still calm but a little higher  hysterics asked l√©on of his wife is that the stage direction  how should i know returned elvira somewhat tartly  oh woman woman said l√©on beginning to open the guitarcase it is one of the burdens of my life monsieur stubbs they support each other they always pretend there is no system they say its nature even madame berthelini who is a dramatic artist  you are heartless l√©on said elvira that woman is in trouble  and the man my angel inquired berthelini passing the ribbon of his guitar and the man mamour  he is a man she answered  you hear that said l√©on to stubbs it is not too late for you mark the intonation and now he continued what are we to give them  are you going to sing asked stubbs  i am a troubadour replied l√©on i claim a welcome by and for my art if i were a banker could i do as much  well you wouldnt need you know answered the undergraduate  egad said l√©on but thats true elvira that is true  of course it is she replied did you not know it  my dear answered l√©on impressively i know nothing but what is agreeable even my knowledge of life is a work of art superiorly composed but what are we to give them it should be something appropriate  visions of let dogs delight passed through the undergraduates mind but it occurred to him that the poetry was english and that he did not know the air hence he contributed no suggestion  something about our houselessness said elvira  i have it cried l√©on and he broke forth into a song of pierre duponts    savezvous o√π gite    mai ce joli mois  elvira joined in so did stubbs with a good ear and voice but an imperfect acquaintance with the music l√©on and the guitar were equal to the situation the actor dispensed his throatnotes with prodigality and enthusiasm and as he looked up to heaven in his heroic way tossing the black ringlets it seemed to him that the very stars contributed a dumb applause to his efforts and the universe lent him its silence for a chorus that is one of the best features of the heavenly bodies that they belong to everybody in particular and a man like l√©on a chronic endymion who managed to get along without encouragement is always the worlds centre for himself  he aloneand it is to be noted he was the worst singer of the threetook the music seriously to heart and judged the serenade from a high artistic point of view elvira on the other hand was preoccupied about their reception and as for stubbs he considered the whole affair in the light of a broad joke  know you the lair of may the lovely month went the three voices in the turnipfield  the inhabitants were plainly fluttered the light moved to and fro strengthening in one window paling in another and then the door was thrown open and a man in a blouse appeared on the threshold carrying a lamp he was a powerful young fellow with bewildered hair and beard wearing his neck open his blouse was stained with oilcolours in a harlequinesque disorder and there was something rural in the droop and bagginess of his belted trousers  from immediately behind him and indeed over his shoulder a womans face looked out into the darkness it was pale and a little weary although still young it wore a dwindling disappearing prettiness soon to be quite gone and the expression was both gentle and sour and reminded one faintly of the taste of certain drugs for all that it was not a face to dislike when the prettiness had vanished it seemed as if a certain pale beauty might step in to take its place and as both the mildness and the asperity were characters of youth it might be hoped that with years both would merge into a constant brave and not unkindly temper  what is all this cried the man     chapter vi   l√©on had his hat in his hand at once he came forward with his customary grace it was a moment which would have earned him a round of cheering on the stage elvira and stubbs advanced behind him like a couple of admetuss sheep following the god apollo  sir said l√©on the hour is unpardonably late and our little serenade has the air of an impertinence believe me sir it is an appeal monsieur is an artist i perceive we are here three artists benighted and without shelter one a womana delicate womanin evening dressin an interesting situation this will not fail to touch the womans heart of madame whom i perceive indistinctly behind monsieur her husband and whose face speaks eloquently of a wellregulated mind ah monsieur madameone generous movement and you make three people happy two or three hours beside your firei ask it of monsieur in the name of arti ask it of madame by the sanctity of womanhood  the two as by a tacit consent drew back from the door  come in said the man  entrez madame said the woman  the door opened directly upon the kitchen of the house which was to all appearance the only sittingroom the furniture was both plain and scanty but there were one or two landscapes on the wall handsomely framed as if they had already visited the committeerooms of an exhibition and been thence extruded l√©on walked up to the pictures and represented the part of a connoisseur before each in turn with his usual dramatic insight and force the master of the house as if irresistibly attracted followed him from canvas to canvas with the lamp elvira was led directly to the fire where she proceeded to warm herself while stubbs stood in the middle of the floor and followed the proceedings of l√©on with mild astonishment in his eyes  you should see them by daylight said the artist  i promise myself that pleasure said l√©on you possess sir if you will permit me an observation the art of composition to a t  you are very good returned the other but should you not draw nearer to the fire  with all my heart said l√©on  and the whole party was soon gathered at the table over a hasty and not an elegant cold supper washed down with the least of small wines nobody liked the meal but nobody complained they put a good face upon it one and all and made a great clattering of knives and forks to see l√©on eating a single cold sausage was to see a triumph by the time he had done he had got through as much pantomime as would have sufficed for a baron of beef and he had the relaxed expression of the overeaten  as elvira had naturally taken a place by the side of l√©on and stubbs as naturally although i believe unconsciously by the side of elvira the host and hostess were left together yet it was to be noted that they never addressed a word to each other nor so much as suffered their eyes to meet the interrupted skirmish still survived in illfeeling and the instant the guests departed it would break forth again as bitterly as ever the talk wandered from this to that subjectfor with one accord the party had declared it was too late to go to bed but those two never relaxed towards each other goneril and regan in a sisterly tiff were not more bent on enmity  it chanced that elvira was so much tired by all the little excitements of the night that for once she laid aside her company manners which were both easy and correct and in the most natural manner in the world leaned her head on l√©ons shoulder at the same time fatigue suggesting tenderness she locked the fingers of her right hand into those of her husbands left and halfclosing her eyes dozed off into a golden borderland between sleep and waking but all the time she was not unaware of what was passing and saw the painters wife studying her with looks between contempt and envy  it occurred to l√©on that his constitution demanded the use of some tobacco and he undid his fingers from elviras in order to roll a cigarette it was gently done and he took care that his indulgence should in no other way disturb his wifes position but it seemed to catch the eye of the painters wife with a special significancy she looked straight before her for an instant and then with a swift and stealthy movement took hold of her husbands hand below the table alas she might have spared herself the dexterity for the poor fellow was so overcome by this caress that he stopped with his mouth open in the middle of a word and by the expression of his face plainly declared to all the company that his thoughts had been diverted into softer channels  if it had not been rather amiable it would have been absurdly droll his wife at once withdrew her touch but it was plain she had to exert some force thereupon the young man coloured and looked for a moment beautiful  l√©on and elvira both observed the byplay and a shock passed from one to the other for they were inveterate matchmakers especially between those who were already married  i beg your pardon said l√©on suddenly i see no use in pretending before we came in here we heard sounds indicatingif i may so express myselfan imperfect harmony  sir began the man  but the woman was beforehand  it is quite true she said i see no cause to be ashamed if my husband is mad i shall at least do my utmost to prevent the consequences picture to yourself monsieur and madame she went on for she passed stubbs over that this wretched persona dauber an incompetent not fit to be a signpainterreceives this morning an admirable offer from an unclean uncle of my own my mothers brother and tenderly belovedof a clerkship with nearly a hundred and fifty pounds a year and that hepicture to yourselfhe refuses it why for the sake of art he says look at his art i saylook at it is it fit to be seen ask himis it fit to be sold and it is for this monsieur and madame that he condemns me to the most deplorable existence without luxuries without comforts in a vile suburb of a country town o non she cried nonje ne me tairai pascest plus fort que moi i take these gentlemen and this lady for judgesis this kind is it decent is it manly do i not deserve better at his hands after having married him anda visible hitchdone everything in the world to please him  i doubt if there ever were a more embarrassed company at a table every one looked like a fool and the husband like the biggest  the art of monsieur however said elvira breaking the silence is not wanting in distinction  it has this distinction said the wife that nobody will buy it  i should have supposed a clerkship began stubbs  art is art swept in l√©on i salute art it is the beautiful the divine it is the spirit of the world and the pride of life but and the actor paused  a clerkship began stubbs  ill tell you what it is said the painter i am an artist and as this gentleman says art is this and the other but of course if my wife is going to make my life a piece of perdition all day long i prefer to go and drown myself out of hand  go said his wife i should like to see you  i was going to say resumed stubbs that a fellow may be a clerk and paint almost as much as he likes i know a fellow in a bank who makes capital watercolour sketches he even sold one for sevenandsix  to both the women this seemed a plank of safety each hopefully interrogated the countenance of her lord even elvira an artist herselfbut indeed there must be something permanently mercantile in the female nature the two men exchanged a glance it was tragic not otherwise might two philosophers salute as at the end of a laborious life each recognised that he was still a mystery to his disciples  l√©on arose  art is art he repeated sadly it is not watercolour sketches nor practising on a piano it is a life to be lived  and in the meantime people starve observed the woman of the house if thats a life it is not one for me  ill tell you what burst forth l√©on you madame go into another room and talk it over with my wife and ill stay here and talk it over with your husband it may come to nothing but lets try  i am very willing replied the young woman and she proceeded to light a candle this way if you please and she led elvira upstairs into a bedroom the fact is said she sitting down that my husband cannot paint  no more can mine act replied elvira  i should have thought he could returned the other he seems clever  he is so and the best of men besides said elvira but he cannot act  at least he is not a sheer humbug like mine he can at least sing  you mistake l√©on returned his wife warmly he does not even pretend to sing he has too fine a taste he does so for a living and believe me neither of the men are humbugs they are people with a missionwhich they cannot carry out  humbug or not replied the other you came very near passing the night in the fields and for my part i live in terror of starvation i should think it was a mans mission to think twice about his wife but it appears not nothing is their mission but to play the fool oh she broke out is it not something dreary to think of that man of mine if he could only do it who would care but nonot heno more than i can  have you any children asked elvira  no but then i may  children change so much said elvira with a sigh  and just then from the room below there flew up a sudden snapping chord on the guitar one followed after another then the voice of l√©on joined in and there was an air being played and sung that stopped the speech of the two women the wife of the painter stood like a person transfixed elvira looking into her eyes could see all manner of beautiful memories and kind thoughts that were passing in and out of her soul with every note it was a piece of her youth that went before her a green french plain the smell of appleflowers the far and shining ringlets of a river and the words and presence of love  l√©on has hit the nail thought elvira to herself i wonder how  the how was plain enough l√©on had asked the painter if there were no air connected with courtship and pleasant times and having learned what he wished and allowed an interval to pass he had soared forth into    o mon amante      o mon d√©sir      sachons cueillir    lheure charmante  pardon me madame said the painters wife your husband sings admirably well  he sings that with some feeling replied elvira critically although she was a little moved herself for the song cut both ways in the upper chamber but it is as an actor and not as a musician  life is very sad said the other it so wastes away under ones fingers  i have not found it so replied elvira i think the good parts of it last and grow greater every day  frankly how would you advise me  frankly i would let my husband do what he wished he is obviously a very loving painter you have not yet tried him as a clerk and you knowif it were only as the possible father of your childrenit is as well to keep him at his best  he is an excellent fellow said the wife   they kept it up till sunrise with music and all manner of goodfellowship and at sunrise while the sky was still temperate and clear they separated on the threshold with a thousand excellent wishes for each others welfare castelleg√¢chis was beginning to send up its smoke against the golden east and the church bell was ringing six  my guitar is a familiar spirit said l√©on as he and elvira took the nearest way towards the inn it resuscitated a commissary created an english tourist and reconciled a man and wife  stubbs on his part went off into the morning with reflections of his own  they are all mad thought he all madbut wonderfully decent     end of vol iv   printed by cassell and company limited la belle sauvage london ec
