78154466	our old home  a series of english sketches  by  nathaniel hawthorne   to franklin pierce  as a slight memorial of a college friendship prolonged through manhood and retaining all its vitality in our autumnal years  this volume is inscribed by  nathaniel hawthorne    to a friend   i have not asked your consent my dear general to the foregoing inscription because it would have been no inconsiderable disappointment to me had you withheld it for i have long desired to connect your name with some book of mine in commemoration of an early friendship that has grown old between two individuals of widely dissimilar pursuits and fortunes  i only wish that the offering were a worthier one than this volume of sketches which certainly are not of a kind likely to prove interesting to a statesman in retirement inasmuch as they meddle with no matters of policy or government and have very little to say about the deeper traits of national character  in their humble way they belong entirely to aesthetic literature and can achieve no higher success than to represent to the american reader a few of the external aspects of english scenery and life especially those that are touched with the antique charm to which our countrymen are more susceptible than are the people among whom it is of native growth  i once hoped indeed that so slight a volume would not be all that i might write  these and other sketches with which in a somewhat rougher form than i have given them here my journal was copiously filled were intended for the sidescenes and backgrounds and exterior adornment of a work of fiction of which the plan had imperfectly developed itself in my mind and into which i ambitiously proposed to convey more of various modes of truth than i could have grasped by a direct effort  of course i should not mention this abortive project only that it has been utterly thrown aside and will never now be accomplished  the present the immediate the actual has proved too potent for me  it takes away not only my scanty faculty but even my desire for imaginative composition and leaves me sadly content to scatter a thousand peaceful fantasies upon the hurricane that is sweeping us all along with it possibly into a limbo where our nation and its polity may be as literally the fragments of a shattered dream as my unwritten romance  but i have far better hopes for our dear country and for my individual share of the catastrophe i afflict myself little or not at all and shall easily find room for the abortive work on a certain ideal shelf where are reposited many other shadowy volumes of mine more in number and very much superior in quality to those which i have succeeded in rendering actual  to return to these poor sketches some of my friends have told me that they evince an asperity of sentiment towards the english people which i ought not to feel and which it is highly inexpedient to express  the charge surprises me because if it be true i have written from a shallower mood than i supposed  i seldom came into personal relations with an englishman without beginning to like him and feeling my favorable impression wax stronger with the progress of the acquaintance i never stood in an english crowd without being conscious of hereditary sympathies  nevertheless it is undeniable that an american is continually thrown upon his national antagonism by some acrid quality in the moral atmosphere of england  these people think so loftily of themselves and so contemptuously of everybody else that it requires more generosity than i possess to keep always in perfectly goodhumor with them  jotting down the little acrimonies of the moment in my journal and transferring them thence when they happened to be tolerably well expressed to these pages it is very possible that i may have said things which a profound observer of national character would hesitate to sanction though never any i verily believe that had not more or less of truth  if they be true there is no reason in the world why they should not be said  not an englishman of them all ever spared america for courtesys sake or kindness nor in my opinion would it contribute in the least to our mutual advantage and comfort if we were to besmear one another all over with butter and honey  at any rate we must not judge of an englishmans susceptibilities by our own which likewise i trust are of a far less sensitive texture than formerly  and now farewell my dear friend and excuse if you think it needs any excuse the freedom with which i thus publicly assert a personal friendship between a private individual and a statesman who has filled what was then the most august position in the world  but i dedicate my book to the friend and shall defer a colloquy with the statesman till some calmer and sunnier hour  only this let me say that with the record of your life in my memory and with a sense of your character in my deeper consciousness as among the few things that time has left as it found them i need no assurance that you continue faithful forever to that grand idea of an irrevocable union which as you once told me was the earliest that your brave father taught you  for other men there may be a choice of pathsfor you but one and it rests among my certainties that no mans loyalty is more steadfast no mans hopes or apprehensions on behalf of our national existence more deeply heartfelt or more closely intertwined with his possibilities of personal happiness than those of franklin pierce  the wayside july 2 1863    contents  consular

glimpses of english poverty civic banquets      our old home     consular experiences   the consulate of the united states in my day was located in washington buildings a shabby and smokestained edifice of four stories high thus illustriously named in honor of our national establishment at the lower corner of brunswick street contiguous to the gorec arcade and in the neighborhood of scone of the oldest docks  this was by no means a polite or elegant portion of englands great commercial city nor were the apartments of the american official so splendid as to indicate the assumption of much consular pomp on his part  a narrow and illlighted staircase gave access to an equally narrow and illlighted passageway on the first floor at the extremity of which surmounting a doorframe appeared an exceedingly stiff pictorial representation of the goose and gridiron according to the english idea of those evertobehonored symbols  the staircase and passageway were often thronged of a morning with a set of beggarly and piraticallooking scoundrels i do no wrong to our own countrymen in styling them so for not one in twenty was a genuine american purporting to belong to our mercantile marine and chiefly composed of liverpool blackballers and the scum of every maritime nation on earth such being the seamen by whose assistance we then disputed the navigation of the world with england  these specimens of a most unfortunate class of people were shipwrecked crews in quest of bed board and clothing invalids asking permits for the hospital bruised and bloody wretches complaining of illtreatment by their officers drunkards desperadoes vagabonds and cheats perplexingly intermingled with an uncertain proportion of reasonably honest men  all of them save here and there a poor devil of a kidnapped landsman in his shoregoing rags wore red flannel shirts in which they had sweltered or shivered throughout the voyage and all required consular assistance in one form or another  any respectable visitor if he could make up his mind to elbow a passage among these seamonsters was admitted into an outer office where he found more of the same species explaining their respective wants or grievances to the viceconsul and clerks while their shipmates awaited their turn outside the door  passing through this exterior court the stranger was ushered into an inner privacy where sat the consul himself ready to give personal attention to such peculiarly difficult and more important cases as might demand the exercise of what we will courteously suppose to be his own higher judicial or administrative sagacity  it was an apartment of very moderate size painted in imitation of oak and duskily lighted by two windows looking across a bystreet at the rough brickside of an immense cotton warehouse a plainer and uglier structure than ever was built in america  on the walls of the room hung a large map of the united states as they were twenty years ago but seem little likely to be twenty years hence and a similar one of great britain with its territory so provokingly compact that we may expect it to sink sooner than sunder  farther adornments were some rude engravings of our naval victories in the war of 1812 together with the tennessee state house and a hudson river steamer and a colored lifesize lithograph of general taylor with an honest hideousness of aspect occupying the place of honor above the mantelpiece  on the top of a bookcase stood a fierce and terrible bust of general jackson pilloried in a military collar which rose above his ears and frowning forth immitigably at any englishman who might happen to cross the threshold  i am afraid however that the truculence of the old generals expression was utterly thrown away on this stolid and obdurate race of men for when they occasionally inquired whom this work of art represented i was mortified to find that the younger ones had never heard of the battle of new orleans and that their elders had either forgotten it altogether or contrived to misremember and twist it wrong end foremost into something like an english victory  they have caught from the old romans whom they resemble in so many other characteristics this excellent method of keeping the national glory intact by sweeping all defeats and humiliations clean out of their memory  nevertheless my patriotism forbade me to take down either the bust or the pictures both because it seemed no more than right that an american consulate being a little patch of our nationality imbedded into the soil and institutions of england should fairly represent the american taste in the fine arts and because these decorations reminded me so delightfully of an oldfashioned american barbers shop  one truly english object was a barometer hanging on the wall generally indicating one or another degree of disagreeable weather and so seldom pointing to fair that i began to consider that portion of its circle as made superfluously  the deep chimney with its grate of bituminous coal was english too as was also the chill temperature that sometimes called for a fire at midsummer and the foggy or smoky atmosphere which often between november and march compelled me to set the gas aflame at noonday  i am not aware of omitting anything important in the above descriptive inventory unless it be some bookshelves filled with octavo volumes of the american statutes and a good many pigeonholes stuffed with dusty communications from former secretaries of state and other official documents of similar value constituting part of the archives of the consulate which i might have done my successor a favor by flinging into the coalgrate  yes there was one other article demanding prominent notice the consular copy of the new testament bound in black morocco and greasy i fear with a daily succession of perjured kisses at least i can hardly hope that all the ten thousand oaths administered by me between two breaths to all sorts of people and on all manner of worldly business were reckoned by the swearer as if taken at his souls peril  such in short was the dusky and stifled chamber in which i spent wearily a considerable portion of more than four good years of my existence  at first to be quite frank with the reader i looked upon it as not altogether fit to be tenanted by the commercial representative of so great and prosperous a country as the united states then were and i should speedily have transferred my headquarters to airier and loftier apartments except for the prudent consideration that my government would have left me thus to support its dignity at my own personal expense besides a long line of distinguished predecessors of whom the latest is now a gallant general under the union banner had found the locality good enough for them it might certainly be tolerated therefore by an individual so little ambitious of external magnificence as myself  so i settled quietly down striking some of my roots into such soil as i could find adapting myself to circumstances and with so much success that though from first to last i hated the very sight of the little room i should yet have felt a singular kind of reluctance in changing it for a better  hither in the course of my incumbency came a great variety of visitors principally americans but including almost every other nationality on earth especially the distressed and downfallen ones like those of poland and hungary  italian bandits for so they looked proscribed conspirators from old spain spanishamericans cubans who processed to have stood by lopez and narrowly escaped his fate scarred french soldiers of the second republicin a word all sufferers or pretended ones in the cause of liberty all people homeless in the widest sense those who never had a country or had lost it those whom their native land had impatiently flung off for planning a better system of things than they were born toa multitude of these and doubtless an equal number of jailbirds outwardly of the same feather sought the american consulate in hopes of at least a bit of bread and perhaps to beg a passage to the blessed shores of freedom  in most cases there was nothing and in any case distressingly little to be done for them neither was i of a proselyting disposition nor desired to make my consulate a nucleus for the vagrant discontents of other lands  and yet it was a proud thought a forcible appeal to the sympathies of an american that these unfortunates claimed the privileges of citizenship in our republic on the strength of the very same noble misdemeanors that had rendered them outlaws to their native despotisms  so i gave them what small help i could  methinks the true patriots and martyrspirits of the whole world should have been conscious of a pang near the heart when a deadly blow was aimed at the vitality of a country which they have felt to be their own in the last resort  as for my countrymen i grew better acquainted with many of our national characteristics during those four years than in all my preceding life whether brought more strikingly out by the contrast with english manners or that my yankee friends assumed an extra peculiarity from a sense of defiant patriotism so it was that their tones sentiments and behavior even their figures and cast of countenance all seemed chiselled in sharper angles than ever i had imagined them to be at home  it impressed me with an odd idea of having somehow lost the property of my own person when i occasionally heard one of them speaking of me as my consul they often came to the consulate in parties of half a dozen or more on no business whatever but merely to subject their public servant to a rigid examination and see how he was getting on with his duties  these interviews were rather formidable being characterized by a certain stiffness which i felt to be sufficiently irksome at the moment though it looks laughable enough in the retrospect  it is my firm belief that these fellowcitizens possessing a native tendency to organization generally halted outside of the door to elect a speaker chairman or moderator and thus approached me with all the formalities of a deputation from the american people  after salutations on both sides abrupt awful and severe on their part and deprecatory on mineand the national ceremony of shaking hands being duly gone through with the interview proceeded by a series of calm and wellconsidered questions or remarks from the spokesman no other of the guests vouchsafing to utter a word and diplomatic responses from the consul who sometimes found the investigation a little more searching than he liked  i flatter myself however that by much practice i attained considerable skill in this kind of intercourse the art of which lies in passing off commonplaces for new and valuable truths and talking trash and emptiness in such a way that a pretty acute auditor might mistake it for something solid  if there be any better method of dealing with such junctureswhen talk is to be created out of nothing and within the scope of several minds at once so that you cannot apply yourself to your interlocutors individualityi have not learned it  sitting as it were in the gateway between the old world and the new where the steamers and packets landed the greater part of our wandering countrymen and received them again when their wanderings were done i saw that no people on earth have such vagabond habits as ourselves  the continental races never travel at all if they can help it nor does an englishman ever think of stirring abroad unless he has the money to spare or proposes to himself some definite advantage from the journey but it seemed to me that nothing was more common than for a young american deliberately to spend all his resources in an aesthetic peregrination about europe returning with pockets nearly empty to begin the world in earnest  it happened indeed much oftener than was at all agreeable to myself that their funds held out just long enough to bring them to the door of my consulate where they entered as if with an undeniable right to its shelter and protection and required at my hands to be sent home again  in my first simplicityfinding them gentlemanly in manners passably educated and only tempted a little beyond their means by a laudable desire of improving and refining themselves or perhaps for the sake of getting better artistic instruction in music painting or sculpture than our country could supplyi sometimes took charge of them on my private responsibility since our government gives itself no trouble about its stray children except the seafaring class but after a few such experiments discovering that none of these estimable and ingenuous young men however trustworthy they might appear ever dreamed of reimbursing the consul i deemed it expedient to take another course with them  applying myself to some friendly shipmaster i engaged homeward passages on their behalf with the understanding that they were to make themselves serviceable on shipboard and i remember several very pathetic appeals from painters and musicians touching the damage which their artistic fingers were likely to incur from handling the ropes  but my observation of so many heavier troubles left me very little tenderness for their fingerends  in time i grew to be reasonably hardhearted though it never was quite possible to leave a countryman with no shelter save an english poorhouse when as he invariably averred he had only to set foot on his native soil to be possessed of ample funds  it was my ultimate conclusion however that american ingenuity may be pretty safely left to itself and that one way or another a yankee vagabond is certain to turn up at his own threshold if he has any without help of a consul and perhaps be taught a lesson of foresight that may profit him hereafter  among these stray americans i met with no other case so remarkable as that of an old man who was in the habit of visiting me once in a few months and soberly affirmed that he had been wandering about england more than a quarter of a century precisely twentyseven years i think and all the while doing his utmost to get home again  herman melville in his excellent novel or biography of israel potter has an idea somewhat similar to this  the individual now in question was a mild and patient but very ragged and pitiable old fellow shabby beyond description lean and hungrylooking but with a large and somewhat red nose  he made no complaint of his illfortune but only repeated in a quiet voice with a pathos of which he was himself evidently unconscious i want to get home to ninetysecond street philadelphia  he described himself as a printer by trade and said that he had come over when he was a younger man in the hope of bettering himself and for the sake of seeing the old country but had never since been rich enough to pay his homeward passage  his manner and accent did not quite convince me that he was an american and i told him so but he steadfastly affirmed sir i was born and have lived in ninetysecond street philadelphia and then went on to describe some public edifices and other local objects with which he used to be familiar adding with a simplicity that touched me very closely sir i had rather be there than here  though i still manifested a lingering doubt he took no offence replying with the same mild depression as at first and insisting again and again on ninetysecond street  up to the time when i saw him he still got a little occasional jobwork at his trade but subsisted mainly on such charity as he met with in his wanderings shifting from place to place continually and asking assistance to convey him to his native land possibly he was an impostor one of the multitudinous shapes of english vagabondism and told his falsehood with such powerful simplicity because by many repetitions he had convinced himself of its truth  but if as i believe the tale was fact how very strange and sad was this old mans fate  homeless on a foreign shore looking always towards his country coming again and again to the point whence so many were setting sail for itso many who would soon tread in ninetysecond street losing in this long series of years some of the distinctive characteristics of an american and at last dying and surrendering his clay to be a portion of the soil whence he could not escape in his lifetime  he appeared to see that he had moved me but did not attempt to press his advantage with any new argument or any varied form of entreaty  he had but scanty and scattered thoughts in his gray head and in the intervals of those like the refrain of an old ballad came in the monotonous burden of his appeal if i could only find myself in ninetysecond street philadelphia  but even his desire of getting home had ceased to be an ardent one if indeed it had not always partaken of the dreamy sluggishness of his character although it remained his only locomotive impulse and perhaps the sole principle of life that kept his blood from actual torpor  the poor old fellows story seemed to me almost as worthy of being chanted in immortal song as that of odysseus or evangeline  i took his case into deep consideration but dared not incur the moral responsibility of sending him across the sea at his age after so many years of exile when the very tradition of him had passed away to find his friends dead or forgetful or irretrievably vanished and the whole country become more truly a foreign land to him than england was now and even ninetysecond street in the weedlike decay and growth of our localities made over anew and grown unrecognizable by his old eyes that street so patiently longed for had transferred itself to the new jerusalem and he must seek it there contenting his slow heart meanwhile with the smokebegrimed thoroughfares of english towns or the green country lanes and bypaths with which his wanderings had made him familiar for doubtless he had a beaten track and was the longremembered beggar now with food and a roughly hospitable greeting ready for him at many a farmhouse door and his choice of lodging under a score of haystacks  in america nothing awaited him but that worst form of disappointment which comes under the guise of a longcherished and lateaccomplished purpose and then a year or two of dry and barren sojourn in an almshouse and death among strangers at last where he had imagined a circle of familiar faces  so i contented myself with giving him alms which he thankfully accepted and went away with bent shoulders and an aspect of gentle forlornness returning upon his orbit however after a few months to tell the same sad and quiet story of his abode in england for more than twentyseven years in all which time he had been endeavoring and still endeavored as patiently as ever to find his way home to ninetysecond street philadelphia  i recollect another case of a more ridiculous order but still with a foolish kind of pathos entangled in it which impresses me now more forcibly than it did at the moment  one day a queer stupid goodnatured fatfaced individual came into my private room dressed in a skyblue cutaway coat and mixed trousers both garments worn and shabby and rather too small for his overgrown bulk  after a little preliminary talk he turned out to be a country shopkeeper from connecticut i think who had left a flourishing business and come over to england purposely and solely to have an interview with the queen some years before he had named his two children one for her majesty and the other for prince albert and had transmitted photographs of the little people as well as of his wife and himself to the illustrious godmother  the queen had gratefully acknowledged the favor in a letter under the hand of her private secretary  now the shopkeeper like a great many other americans had long cherished a fantastic notion that he was one of the rightful heirs of a rich english estate and on the strength of her majestys letter and the hopes of royal patronage which it inspired he had shut up his little countrystore and come over to claim his inheritance  on the voyage a german fellowpassenger had relieved him of his money on pretence of getting it favorably exchanged and had disappeared immediately on the ships arrival so that the poor fellow was compelled to pawn all his clothes except the remarkably shabby ones in which i beheld him and in which as he himself hinted with a melancholy yet goodnatured smile he did not look altogether fit to see the queen  i agreed with him that the bobtailed coat and mixed trousers constituted a very oddlooking courtdress and suggested that it was doubtless his present purpose to get back to connecticut as fast as possible  but no  the resolve to see the queen was as strong in him as ever and it was marvellous the pertinacity with which he clung to it amid raggedness and starvation and the earnestness of his supplication that i would supply him with funds for a suitable appearance at windsor castle  i never had so satisfactory a perception of a complete booby before in my life and it caused me to feel kindly towards him and yet impatient and exasperated on behalf of commonsense which could not possibly tolerate that such an unimaginable donkey should exist  i laid his absurdity before him in the very plainest terms but without either exciting his anger or shaking his resolution  o my dear man quoth he with goodnatured placid simple and tearful stubbornness if you could but enter into my feelings and see the matter from beginning to end as i see it  to confess the truth i have since felt that i was hardhearted to the poor simpleton and that there was more weight in his remonstrance than i chose to be sensible of at the time for like many men who have been in the habit of making playthings or tools of their imagination and sensibility i was too rigidly tenacious of what was reasonable in the affairs of real life  and even absurdity has its rights when as in this case it has absorbed a human beings entire nature and purposes  i ought to have transmitted him to mr buchanan in london who being a goodnatured old gentleman and anxious just then to gratify the universal yankee nation might for the jokes sake have got him admittance to the queen who had fairly laid herself open to his visit and has received hundreds of our countrymen on infinitely slighter grounds  but i was inexorable being turned to flint by the insufferable proximity of a fool and refused to interfere with his business in any way except to procure him a passage home  i can see his face of mild ridiculous despair at this moment and appreciate better than i could then how awfully cruel he must have felt my obduracy to be  for years and years the idea of an interview with queen victoria had haunted his poor foolish mind and now when he really stood on english ground and the palacedoor was hanging ajar for him he was expected to turn brick a penniless and bamboozled simpleton merely because an ironhearted consul refused to lend him thirty shillings so low had his demand ultimately sunk to buy a secondclass ticket on the rail for london  he visited the consulate several times afterwards subsisting on a pittance that i allowed him in the hope of gradually starving him back to connecticut assailing me with the old petition at every opportunity looking shabbier at every visit but still thoroughly goodtempered mildly stubborn and smiling through his tears not without a perception of the ludicrousness of his own position  finally he disappeared altogether and whither he had wandered and whether he ever saw the queen or wasted quite away in the endeavor i never knew but i remember unfolding the times about that period with a daily dread of reading an account of a ragged yankees attempt to steal into buckingham palace and how he smiled tearfully at his captors and besought them to introduce him to her majesty  i submit to mr secretary seward that he ought to make diplomatic remonstrances to the british ministry and require them to take such order that the queen shall not any longer bewilder the wits of our poor compatriots by responding to their epistles and thanking them for their photographs  one circumstance in the foregoing incidenti mean the unhappy storekeepers notion of establishing his claim to an english estatewas common to a great many other applications personal or by letter with which i was favored by my countrymen  the cause of this peculiar insanity lies deep in the angloamerican heart  after all these bloody wars and vindictive animosities we have still an unspeakable yearning towards england  when our forefathers left the old home they pulled up many of their roots but trailed along with them others which were never snapt asunder by the tug of such a lengthening distance nor have been torn out of the original soil by the violence of subsequent struggles nor severed by the edge of the sword  even so late as these days they remain entangled with our heartstrings and might often have influenced our national cause like the tillerropes of a ship if the rough gripe of england had been capable of managing so sensitive a kind of machinery it has required nothing less than the boorishness the stolidity the selfsufficiency the contemptuous jealousy the halfsagacity invariably blind of one eye and often distorted of the other that characterize this strange people to compel us to be a great nation in our own right instead of continuing virtually if not in name a province of their small island  what pains did they take to shake us off and have ever since taken to keep us wide apart from them  it might seem their folly but was really their fate or rather the providence of god who has doubtless a work for us to do in which the massive materiality of the english character would have been too ponderous a deadweight upon our progress  and besides if england had been wise enough to twine our new vigor round about her ancient strength her power would have been too firmly established ever to yield in its due season to the otherwise immutable law of imperial vicissitude  the earth might then have beheld the intolerable spectacle of a sovereignty and institutions imperfect but indestructible  nationally there has ceased to be any peril of so inauspicious and yet outwardly attractive an amalgamation  but as an individual the american is often conscious of the deeprooted sympathies that belong more fitly to times gone by and feels a blind pathetic tendency to wander back again which makes itself evident in such wild dreams as i have alluded to above about english inheritances  a mere coincidence of names the yankee one perhaps having been assumed by legislative permission a supposititious pedigree a silver mug on which an anciently engraved coatofarms has been half scrubbed out a seal with an uncertain crest an old yellow letter or document in faded ink the more scantily legible the betterrubbish of this kind found in a neglected drawer has been potent enough to turn the brain of many an honest republican especially if assisted by an advertisement for lost heirs cut out of a british newspaper  there is no estimating or believing till we come into a position to know it what foolery lurks latent in the breasts of very sensible people  remembering such sober extravagances i should not be at all surprised to find that i am myself guilty of some unsuspected absurdity that may appear to me the most substantial trait in my character  i might fill many pages with instances of this diseased american appetite for english soil  a respectablelooking woman well advanced in life of sour aspect exceedingly homely but decidedly newenglandish in figure and manners came to my office with a great bundle of documents at the very first glimpse of which i apprehended something terrible  nor was i mistaken  the bundle contained evidences of her indubitable claim to the site on which castle street the town hall the exchange and all the principal business part of liverpool have long been situated and with considerable peremptoriness the good lady signified her expectation that i should take charge of her suit and prosecute it to judgment not however on the equitable condition of receiving half the value of the property recovered which in case of complete success would have made both of us ten or twenty fold millionaires but without recompense or reimbursement of legal expenses solely as an incident of my official duty  another time came two ladies bearing a letter of emphatic introduction from his excellency the governor of their native state who testified in most satisfactory terms to their social respectability they were claimants of a great estate in cheshire and announced themselves as bloodrelatives of queen victoriaa point however which they deemed it expedient to keep in the background until their territorial rights should be established apprehending that the lord high chancellor might otherwise be less likely to come to a fair decision in respect to them from a probable disinclination to admit new members into the royal kin  upon my honor i imagine that they had an eye to the possibility of the eventual succession of one or both of them to the crown of great britain through superiority of title over the brunswick line although being maiden ladies like their predecessor elizabeth they could hardly have hoped to establish a lasting dynasty upon the throne  it proves i trust a certain disinterestedness on my part that encountering them thus in the dawn of their fortunes i forbore to put in a plea for a future dukedom  another visitor of the same class was a gentleman of refined manners handsome figure and remarkably intellectual aspect  like many men of an adventurous cast he had so quiet a deportment and such an apparent disinclination to general sociability that you would have fancied him moving always along some peaceful and secluded walk of life  yet literally from his first hour he had been tossed upon the surges of a most varied and tumultuous existence having been born at sea of american parentage but on board of a spanish vessel and spending many of the subsequent years in voyages travels and outlandish incidents and vicissitudes which methought had hardly been paralleled since the days of gulliver or de foe  when his dignified reserve was overcome he had the faculty of narrating these adventures with wonderful eloquence working up his descriptive sketches with such intuitive perception of the picturesque points that the whole was thrown forward with a positively illusive effect like matters of your own visual experience  in fact they were so admirably done that i could never more than half believe them because the genuine affairs of life are not apt to transact themselves so artistically  many of his scenes were laid in the east and among those seldomvisited archipelagoes of the indian ocean so that there was an oriental fragrance breathing through his talk and an odor of the spice islands still lingering in his garments  he had much to say of the delightful qualities of the malay pirates who indeed carry on a predatory warfare against the ships of all civilized nations and cut every christian throat among their prisoners but except for deeds of that character which are the rule and habit of their life and matter of religion and conscience with them they are a gentlenatured people of primitive innocence and integrity  but his best story was about a race of men if men they were who seemed so fully to realize swifts wicked fable of the yahoos that my friend was much exercised with psychological speculations whether or no they had any souls  they dwelt in the wilds of ceylon like other savage beasts hairy and spotted with tufts of fur filthy shameless weaponless though warlike in their individual bent toolless houseless languageless except for a few guttural sounds hideously dissonant whereby they held some rudest kind of communication among themselves they lacked both memory and foresight and were wholly destitute of government social institutions or law or rulership of any description except the immediate tyranny of the strongest radically untamable moreover save that the people of the country managed to subject a few of the less ferocious and stupid ones to outdoor servitude among their other cattle  they were beastly in almost all their attributes and that to such a degree that the observer losing sight of any link betwixt them and manhood could generally witness their brutalities without greater horror than at those of some disagreeable quadruped in a menagerie  and yet at times comparing what were the lowest general traits in his own race with what was highest in these abominable monsters he found a ghastly similitude that half compelled him to recognize them as human brethren  after these gulliverian researches my agreeable acquaintance had fallen under the ban of the dutch government and had suffered this at least being matter of fact nearly two years imprisonment with confiscation of a large amount of property for which mr belmont our minister at the hague had just made a peremptory demand of reimbursement and damages meanwhile since arriving in england on his way to the united states he had been providentially led to inquire into the circumstances of his birth on shipboard and had discovered that not himself alone but another baby had come into the world during the same voyage of the prolific vessel and that there were almost irrefragable reasons for believing that these two children had been assigned to the wrong mothers many reminiscences of his early days confirmed him in the idea that his nominal parents were aware of the exchange  the family to which he felt authorized to attribute his lineage was that of a nobleman in the picturegallery of whose countryseat whence if i mistake not our adventurous friend had just returned he had discovered a portrait bearing a striking resemblance to himself  as soon as he should have reported the outrageous action of the dutch government to president pierce and the secretary of state and recovered the confiscated property he purposed to return to england and establish his claim to the noblemans title and estate  i had accepted his oriental fantasies which indeed to do him justice have been recorded by scientific societies among the genuine phenomena of natural history not as matters of indubitable credence but as allowable specimens of an imaginative travellers vivid coloring and rich embroidery on the coarse texture and dull neutral tints of truth  the english romance was among the latest communications that he intrusted to my private ear and as soon as i heard the first chapterso wonderfully akin to what i might have wrought out of my own head not unpractised in such figmentsi began to repent having made myself responsible for the future noblemans passage homeward in the next collins steamer nevertheless should his english rentroll fall a little behindhand his dutch claim for a hundred thousand dollars was certainly in the hands of our government and might at least be valuable to the extent of thirty pounds which i had engaged to pay on his behalf  but i have reason to fear that his dutch riches turned out to be dutch gilt or fairy gold and his english countryseat a mere castle in the airwhich i exceedingly regret for he was a delightful companion and a very gentlemanly man  a consul in his position of universal responsibility the general adviser and helper sometimes finds himself compelled to assume the guardianship of personages who in their own sphere are supposed capable of superintending the highest interests of whole communities  an elderly irishman a naturalized citizen once put the desire and expectation of all our penniless vagabonds into a very suitable phrase by pathetically entreating me to be a father to him and simple as i sit scribbling here i have acted a fathers part not only by scores of such unthrifty old children as himself but by a progeny of far loftier pretensions  it may be well for persons who are conscious of any radical weakness in their character any besetting sin any unlawful propensity any unhallowed impulse which while surrounded with the manifold restraints that protect a man from that treacherous and lifelong enemy his lower self in the circle of society where he is at home they may have succeeded in keeping under the lock and key of strictest proprietyit may be well for them before seeking the perilous freedom of a distant land released from the watchful eyes of neighborhoods and coteries lightened of that wearisome burden an immaculate name and blissfully obscure after years of local prominenceit may be well for such individuals to know that when they set foot on a foreign shore the longimprisoned evil scenting a wild license in the unaccustomed atmosphere is apt to grow riotous in its iron cage  it rattles the rusty barriers with gigantic turbulence and if there be an infirm joint anywhere in the framework it breaks madly forth compressing the mischief of a lifetime into a little space  a parcel of letters had been accumulating at the consulate for two or three weeks directed to a certain doctor of divinity who had left america by a sailingpacket and was still upon the sea  in due time the vessel arrived and the reverend doctor paid me a visit  he was a finelooking middleaged gentleman a perfect model of clerical propriety scholarlike yet with the air of a man of the world rather than a student though overspread with the graceful sanctity of a popular metropolitan divine a part of whose duty it might be to exemplify the natural accordance between christianity and goodbreeding  he seemed a little excited as an american is apt to be on first arriving in england but conversed with intelligence as well as animation making himself so agreeable that his visit stood out in considerable relief from the monotony of my daily commonplace  as i learned from authentic sources he was somewhat distinguished in his own region for fervor and eloquence in the pulpit but was now compelled to relinquish it temporarily for the purpose of renovating his impaired health by an extensive tour in europe promising to dine with me he took up his bundle of letters and went away  the doctor however failed to make his appearance at dinnertime or to apologize the next day for his absence and in the course of a day or two more i forgot all about him concluding that he must have set forth on his continental travels the plan of which he had sketched out at our interview  but by and by i received a call from the master of the vessel in which he had arrived  he was in some alarm about his passenger whose luggage remained on shipboard but of whom nothing had been heard or seen since the moment of his departure from the consulate we conferred together the captain and i about the expediency of setting the police on the traces if any were to be found of our vanished friend but it struck me that the good captain was singularly reticent and that there was something a little mysterious in a few points that he hinted at rather than expressed so that scrutinizing the affair carefully i surmised that the intimacy of life on shipboard might have taught him more about the reverend gentleman than for some reason or other he deemed it prudent to reveal  at home in our native country i would have looked to the doctors personal safety and left his reputation to take care of itself knowing that the good fame of a thousand saintly clergymen would amply dazzle out any lamentable spot on a single brothers character  but in scornful and invidious england on the idea that the credit of the sacred office was measurably intrusted to my discretion i could not endure for the sake of american doctors of divinity generally that this particular doctor should cut an ignoble figure in the police reports of the english newspapers except at the last necessity  the clerical body i flatter myself will acknowledge that i acted on their own principle  besides it was now too late the mischief and violence if any had been impending were not of a kind which it requires the better part of a week to perpetrate and to sum up the entire matter i felt certain from a good deal of somewhat similar experience that if the missing doctor still breathed this vital air he would turn up at the consulate as soon as his money should be stolen or spent  precisely a week after this reverend persons disappearance there came to my office a tall middleaged gentleman in a blue military surtout braided at the seams but out at elbows and as shabby as if the wearer had been bivouacking in it throughout a crimean campaign  it was buttoned up to the very chin except where three or four of the buttons were lost nor was there any glimpse of a white shirtcollar illuminating the rusty black cravat  a grisly mustache was just beginning to roughen the strangers upper lip  he looked disreputable to the last degree but still had a ruined air of good society glimmering about him like a few specks of polish on a swordblade that has lain corroding in a mudpuddle i took him to be some american marine officer of dissipated habits or perhaps a cashiered british major stumbling into the wrong quarters through the unrectified bewilderment of last nights debauch  he greeted me however with polite familiarity as though we had been previously acquainted whereupon i drew coldly back as sensible people naturally do whether from strangers or former friends when too evidently at odds with fortune and requested to know who my visitor might be and what was his business at the consulate  am i then so changed he exclaimed with a vast depth of tragic intonation and after a little blind and bewildered talk behold the truth flashed upon me  it was the doctor of divinity  if i had meditated a scene or a coup de theatre i could not have contrived a more effectual one than by this simple and genuine difficulty of recognition  the poor divine must have felt that he had lost his personal identity through the misadventures of one little week and to say the truth he did look as if like job on account of his especial sanctity he had been delivered over to the direst temptations of satan and proving weaker than the man of uz the arch enemy had been empowered to drag him through tophet transforming him in the process from the most decorous of metropolitan clergymen into the rowdiest and dirtiest of disbanded officers  i never fathomed the mystery of his military costume but conjectured that a lurking sense of fitness had induced him to exchange his clerical garments for this habit of a sinner nor can i tell precisely into what pitfall not more of vice than terrible calamity he had precipitated himselfbeing more than satisfied to know that the outcasts of society can sink no lower than this poor desecrated wretch had sunk  the opportunity i presume does not often happen to a layman of administering moral and religious reproof to a doctor of divinity but finding the occasion thrust upon me and the hereditary puritan waxing strong in my breast i deemed it a matter of conscience not to let it pass entirely unimproved  the truth is i was unspeakably shocked and disgusted  not however that i was then to learn that clergymen are made of the same flesh and blood as other people and perhaps lack one small safeguard which the rest of us possess because they are aware of their own peccability and therefore cannot look up to the clerical class for the proof of the possibility of a pure life on earth with such reverential confidence as we are prone to do  but i remembered the innocent faith of my boyhood and the good old silverheaded clergyman who seemed to me as much a saint then on earth as he is now in heaven and partly for whose sake through all these darkening years i retain a devout though not intact nor unwavering respect for the entire fraternity  what a hideous wrong therefore had the backslider inflicted on his brethren and still more on me who much needed whatever fragments of broken reverence broken not as concerned religion but its earthly institutions and professors it might yet be possible to patch into a sacred image  should all pulpits and communiontables have thenceforth a stain upon them and the guilty one go unrebuked for it so i spoke to the unhappy man as i never thought myself warranted in speaking to any other mortal hitting him hard doing my utmost to find out his vulnerable part and prick him into the depths of it  and not without more effect than i had dreamed of or desired  no doubt the novelty of the doctors reversed position thus standing up to receive such a fulmination as the clergy have heretofore arrogated the exclusive right of inflicting might give additional weight and sting to the words which i found utterance for  but there was another reason which had i in the least suspected it would have closed my lips at once for his feeling morbidly sensitive to the cruel rebuke that i administered  the unfortunate man had come to me laboring under one of the consequences of his riotous outbreak in the shape of delirium tremens he bore a hell within the compass of his own breast all the torments of which blazed up with tenfold inveteracy when i thus took upon myself the devils office of stirring up the redhot embers  his emotions as well as the external movement and expression of them by voice countenance and gesture were terribly exaggerated by the tremendous vibration of nerves resulting from the disease  it was the deepest tragedy i ever witnessed  i know sufficiently from that one experience how a condemned soul would manifest its agonies and for the future if i have anything to do with sinners i mean to operate upon them through sympathy and not rebuke  what had i to do with rebuking him  the disease long latent in his heart had shown itself in a frightful eruption on the surface of his life  that was all  is it a thing to scold the sufferer for  to conclude this wretched story the poor doctor of divinity having been robbed of all his money in this little airing beyond the limits of propriety was easily persuaded to give up the intended tour and return to his bereaved flock who very probably were thereafter conscious of an increased unction in his soulstirring eloquence without suspecting the awful depths into which their pastor had dived in quest of it  his voice is now silent  i leave it to members of his own profession to decide whether it was better for him thus to sin outright and so to be let into the miserable secret what manner of man he was or to have gone through life outwardly unspotted making the first discovery of his latent evil at the judgmentseat  it has occurred to me that his dire calamity as both he and i regarded it might have been the only method by which precisely such a man as himself and so situated could be redeemed  he has learned ere now how that matter stood  for a man with a natural tendency to meddle with other peoples business there could not possibly be a more congenial sphere than the liverpool consulate  for myself i had never been in the habit of feeling that i could sufficiently comprehend any particular conjunction of circumstances with human character to justify me in thrusting in my awkward agency among the intricate and unintelligible machinery of providence  i have always hated to give advice especially when there is a prospect of its being taken  it is only oneeyed people who love to advise or have any spontaneous promptitude of action  when a man opens both his eyes he generally sees about as many reasons for acting in any one way as in any other and quite as many for acting in neither and is therefore likely to leave his friends to regulate their own conduct and also to remain quiet as regards his especial affairs till necessity shall prick him onward  nevertheless the world and individuals flourish upon a constant succession of blunders  the secret of english practical success lies in their characteristic faculty of shutting one eye whereby they get so distinct and decided a view of what immediately concerns them that they go stumbling towards it over a hundred insurmountable obstacles and achieve a magnificent triumph without ever being aware of half its difficulties  if general mcclellan could but have shut his left eye the right one would long ago have guided us into richmond meanwhile i have strayed far away from the consulate where as i was about to say i was compelled in spite of my disinclination to impart both advice and assistance in multifarious affairs that did not personally concern me and presume that i effected about as little mischief as other men in similar contingencies  the duties of the office carried me to prisons policecourts hospitals lunatic asylums coroners inquests deathbeds funerals and brought me in contact with insane people criminals ruined speculators wild adventurers diplomatists brotherconsuls and all manner of simpletons and unfortunates in greater number and variety than i had ever dreamed of as pertaining to america in addition to whom there was an equivalent multitude of english rogues dexterously counterfeiting the genuine yankee article  it required great discrimination not to be taken in by these lastmentioned scoundrels for they knew how to imitate our national traits had been at great pains to instruct themselves as regarded american localities and were not readily to be caught by a crossexamination as to the topographical features public institutions or prominent inhabitants of the places where they pretended to belong the best shibboleth i ever hit upon lay in the pronunciation of the word been which the english invariably make to rhyme with green and we northerners at least in accordance i think with the custom of shakespeares time universally pronounce bin  all the matters that i have been treating of however were merely incidental and quite distinct from the real business of the office  a great part of the wear and tear of mind and temper resulted from the bad relations between the seamen and officers of american ships  scarcely a morning passed but that some sailor came to show the marks of his illusage on shipboard  often it was a whole crew of them each with his broken head or livid bruise and all testifying with one voice to a constant series of savage outrages during the voyage or it might be they laid an accusation of actual murder perpetrated by the first or second officers with many blows of steelknuckles a ropes end or a marlinespike or by the captain in the twinkling of an eye with a shot of his pistol  taking the seamens view of the case you would suppose that the gibbet was hungry for the murderers  listening to the captains defence you would seem to discover that he and his officers were the humanest of mortals but were driven to a wholesome severity by the mutinous conduct of the crew who moreover had themselves slain their comrade in the drunken riot and confusion of the first day or two after they were shipped  looked at judicially there appeared to be no right side to the matter nor any right side possible in so thoroughly vicious a system as that of the american mercantile marine  the consul could do little except to take depositions hold forth the greasy testament to be profaned anew with perjured kisses and in a few instances of murder or manslaughter carry the case before an english magistrate who generally decided that the evidence was too contradictory to authorize the transmission of the accused for trial in america  the newspapers all over england contained paragraphs inveighing against the cruelties of american shipmasters  the british parliament took up the matter for nobody is so humane as john bull when his benevolent propensities are to be gratified by finding fault with his neighbor and caused lord john russell to remonstrate with our government on the outrages for which it was responsible before the world and which it failed to prevent or punish  the american secretary of state old general cass responded with perfectly astounding ignorance of the subject to the effect that the statements of outrages had probably been exaggerated that the present laws of the united states were quite adequate to deal with them and that the interference of the british minister was uncalled for  the truth is that the state of affairs was really very horrible and could be met by no laws at that time or i presume now in existence  i once thought of writing a pamphlet on the subject but quitted the consulate before finding time to effect my purpose and all that phase of my life immediately assumed so dreamlike a consistency that i despaired of making it seem solid or tangible to the public  and now it looks distant and dim like troubles of a century ago  the origin of the evil lay in the character of the seamen scarcely any of whom were american but the offscourings and refuse of all the seaports of the world such stuff as piracy is made of together with a considerable intermixture of returning emigrants and a sprinkling of absolutely kidnapped american citizens  even with such material the ships were very inadequately manned  the shipmaster found himself upon the deep with a vast responsibility of property and human life upon his hands and no means of salvation except by compelling his inefficient and demoralized crew to heavier exertions than could reasonably be required of the same number of able seamen  by law he had been intrusted with no discretion of judicious punishment he therefore habitually left the whole matter of discipline to his irresponsible mates men often of scarcely a superior quality to the crew  hence ensued a great mass of petty outrages unjustifiable assaults shameful indignities and nameless cruelty demoralizing alike to the perpetrators and the sufferers these enormities fell into the ocean between the two countries and could be punished in neither  many miserable stories come back upon my memory as i write wrongs that were immense but for which nobody could be held responsible and which indeed the closer you looked into them the more they lost the aspect of wilful misdoing and assumed that of an inevitable calamity  it was the fault of a system the misfortune of an individual be that as it may however there will be no possibility of dealing effectually with these troubles as long as we deem it inconsistent with our national dignity or interests to allow the english courts under such restrictions as may seem fit a jurisdiction over offences perpetrated on board our vessels in midocean  in such a life as this the american shipmaster develops himself into a man of iron energies dauntless courage and inexhaustible resource at the expense it must be acknowledged of some of the higher and gentler traits which might do him excellent service in maintaining his authority the class has deteriorated of late years on account of the narrower field of selection owing chiefly to the diminution of that excellent body of respectably educated new england seamen from the flower of whom the officers used to be recruited  yet i found them in many cases very agreeable and intelligent companions with less nonsense about them than landsmen usually have eschewers of finespun theories delighting in square and tangible ideas but occasionally infested with prejudices that stuck to their brains like barnacles to a ships bottom  i never could flatter myself that i was a general favorite with them  one or two perhaps even now would scarcely meet me on amicable terms  endowed universally with a great pertinacity of will they especially disliked the interference of a consul with their management on shipboard notwithstanding which i thrust in my very limited authority at every available opening and did the utmost that lay in my power though with lamentably small effect towards enforcing a better kind of discipline they thought no doubt and on plausible grounds enough but scarcely appreciating just that one little grain of hard new england sense oddly thrown in among the flimsier composition of the consuls character that he a landsman a bookman and as people said of him a fanciful recluse could not possibly understand anything of the difficulties or the necessities of a shipmasters position  but their cold regards were rather acceptable than otherwise for it is exceedingly awkward to assume a judicial austerity in the morning towards a man with whom you have been hobnobbing over night  with the technical details of the business of that great consulate for great it then was though now i fear wofully fallen off and perhaps never to be revived in anything like its former extent i did not much interfere  they could safely be left to the treatment of two as faithful upright and competent subordinates both englishmen as ever a man was fortunate enough to meet with in a line of life altogether new and strange to him  i had come over with instructions to supply both their places with americans but possessing a happy faculty of knowing my own interest and the publics i quietly kept hold of them being little inclined to open the consular doors to a spy of the state department or an intriguer for my own office  the venerable viceconsul mr pearce had witnessed the successive arrivals of a score of newly appointed consuls shadowy and shortlived dignitaries and carried his reminiscences back to the epoch of consul maury who was appointed by washington and has acquired almost the grandeur of a mythical personage in the annals of the consulate  the principal clerk mr wilding who has since succeeded to the viceconsulship was a man of english integritynot that the english are more honest than ourselves but only there is a certain sturdy reliableness common among them which we do not quite so invariably manifest in just these subordinate positionsof english integrity combined with american acuteness of intellect quickwittedness and diversity of talent  it seemed an immense pity that he should wear out his life at a desk without a step in advance from years end to years end when had it been his luck to be born on our side of the water his bright faculties and clear probity would have insured him eminent success in whatever path he night adopt  meanwhile it would have been a sore mischance to me had any better fortune on his part deprived me of mr wildings services  a fair amount of commonsense some acquaintance with the united states statutes an insight into character a tact of management a general knowledge of the world and a reasonable but not too inveterately decided preference for his own will and judgment over those of interested peoplethese natural attributes and moderate acquirements will enable a consul to perform many of his duties respectably but not to dispense with a great variety of other qualifications only attainable by long experience  yet i think few consuls are so well accomplished  an appointment of whatever grade in the diplomatic or consular service of america is too often what the english call a job that is to say it is made on private and personal grounds without a paramount eye to the public good or the gentlemans especial fitness for the position  it is not too much to say of course allowing for a brilliant exception here and there that an american never is thoroughly qualified for a foreign post nor has time to make himself so before the revolution of the political wheel discards him from his office  our country wrongs itself by permitting such a system of unsuitable appointments and still more of removals for no cause just when the incumbent might be beginning to ripen into usefulness  mere ignorance of official detail is of comparatively small moment though it is considered indispensable i presume that a man in any private capacity shall be thoroughly acquainted with the machinery and operation of his business and shall not necessarily lose his position on having attained such knowledge  but there are so many more important things to be thought of in the qualifications of a foreign resident that his technical dexterity or clumsiness is hardly worth mentioning  one great part of a consuls duty for example should consist in building up for himself a recognized position in the society where he resides so that his local influence might be felt in behalf of his own country and so far as they are compatible as they generally are to the utmost extent for the interests of both nations  the foreign city should know that it has a permanent inhabitant and a hearty wellwisher in him  there are many conjunctures and one of them is now upon us where a longestablished honored and trusted american citizen holding a public position under our government in such a town as liverpool might go far towards swaying and directing the sympathies of the inhabitants he might throw his own weight into the balance against mischief makers he might have set his foot on the first little spark of malignant purpose which the next wind may blow into a national war  but we wilfully give up all advantages of this kind  the position is totally beyond the attainment of an american there today bristling all over with the porcupine quills of our republic and gone tomorrow just as he is becoming sensible of the broader and more generous patriotism which might almost amalgamate with that of england without losing an atom of its native force and flavor  in the changes that appear to await us and some of which at least can hardly fail to be for good let us hope for a reform in this matter  for myself as the gentle reader would spare me the trouble of saying i was not at all the kind of man to grow into such an ideal consul as i have here suggested  i never in my life desired to be burdened with public influence  i disliked my office from the first and never came into any good accordance with it  its dignity so far as it had any was an encumbrance the attentions it drew upon me such as invitations to mayors banquets and public celebrations of all kinds where to my horror i found myself expected to stand up and speak wereas i may say without incivility or ingratitude because there is nothing personal in that sort of hospitalitya bore  the official business was irksome and often painful  there was nothing pleasant about the whole affair except the emoluments and even those never too bountifully reaped were diminished by more than half in the second or third year of my incumbency  all this being true i was quite prepared in advance of the inauguration of mr buchanan to send in my resignation  when my successor arrived i drew the long delightful breath which first made me thoroughly sensible what an unnatural life i had been leading and compelled me to admire myself for having battled with it so sturdily the newcomer proved to be a very genial and agreeable gentleman an f f v and as he pleasantly acknowledged a southern fire eater an announcement to which i responded with similar goodhumor and selfcomplacency by parading my descent from an ancient line of massachusetts puritans  since our brief acquaintanceship my fireeating friend has had ample opportunities to banquet on his favorite diet hot and hot in the confederate service  for myself as soon as i was out of office the retrospect began to look unreal  i could scarcely believe that it was ithat figure whom they called a consulbut a sort of double ganger who had been permitted to assume my aspect under which he went through his shadowy duties with a tolerable show of efficiency while my real self had lain as regarded my proper mode of being and acting in a state of suspended animation  the same sense of illusion still pursues me  there is some mistake in this matter  i have been writing about another mans consular experiences with which through some mysterious medium of transmitted ideas i find myself intimately acquainted but in which i cannot possibly have had a personal interest  is it not a dream altogether the figure of that poor doctor of divinity looks wonderfully lifelike so do those of the oriental adventurer with the visionary coronet above his brow and the moonstruck visitor of the queen and the poor old wanderer seeking his native country through english highways and byways for almost thirty years and so would a hundred others that i might summon up with similar distinctness  but were they more than shadows  surely i think not  nor are these present pages a bit of intrusive autobiography let not the reader wrong me by supposing it  i never should have written with half such unreserve had it been a portion of this life congenial with my nature which i am living now instead of a series of incidents and characters entirely apart from my own concerns and on which the qualities personally proper to me could have had no bearing  almost the only real incidents as i see them now were the visits of a young english friend a scholar and a literary amateur between whom and myself there sprung up an affectionate and i trust not transitory regard  he used to come and sit or stand by my fireside talking vivaciously and eloquently with me about literature and life his own national characteristics and mine with such kindly endurance of the many rough republicanisms wherewith i assailed him and such frank and amiable assertion of all sorts of english prejudices and mistakes that i understood his countrymen infinitely the better for him and was almost prepared to love the intensest englishman of them all for his sake  it would gratify my cherished remembrance of this dear friend if i could manage without offending him or letting the public know it to introduce his name upon my page  bright was the illumination of my dusky little apartment as often as he made his appearance there  the english sketches which i have been offering to the public comprise a few of the more external and therefore more readily manageable things that i took note of in many escapes from the imprisonment of my consular servitude  liverpool though not very delightful as a place of residence is a most convenient and admirable point to get away from london is only five hours off by the fast train  chester the most curious town in england with its encompassing wall its ancient rows and its venerable cathedral is close at hand  north wales with all its hills and ponds its noble seascenery its multitude of gray castles and strange old villages may be glanced at in a summer day or two  the lakes and mountains of cumberland and westmoreland may be reached before dinnertime  the haunted and legendary isle of man a little kingdom by itself lies within the scope of an afternoons voyage  edinburgh or glasgow are attainable over night and loch lomond betimes in the morning  visiting these famous localities and a great many others i hope that i do not compromise my american patriotism by acknowledging that i was often conscious of a fervent hereditary attachment to the native soil of our forefathers and felt it to be our own old home     leamington spa   in the course of several visits and stays of considerable length we acquired a homelike feeling towards leamington and came back thither again and again chiefly because we had been there before  wandering and wayside people such as we had long since become retain a few of the instincts that belong to a more settled way of life and often prefer familiar and commonplace objects for the very reason that they are so to the dreary strangeness of scenes that might be thought much better worth the seeing  there is a small nest of a place in leamingtonat no 10 lansdowne circusupon which to this day my reminiscences are apt to settle as one of the coziest nooks in england or in the world not that it had any special charm of its own but only that we stayed long enough to know it well and even to grow a little tired of it  in my opinion the very tediousness of home and friends makes a part of what we love them for if it be not mixed in sufficiently with the other elements of life there may be mad enjoyment but no happiness  the modest abode to which i have alluded forms one of a circular range of pretty moderatesized twostory houses all built on nearly the same plan and each provided with its little grassplot its flowers its tufts of box trimmed into globes and other fantastic shapes and its verdant hedges shutting the house in from the common drive and dividing it from its equally cosey neighbors  coming out of the door and taking a turn round the circle of sisterdwellings it is difficult to find your way back by any distinguishing individuality of your own habitation  in the centre of the circus is a space fenced in with iron railing a small playplace and sylvan retreat for the children of the precinct permeated by brief paths through the fresh english grass and shadowed by various shrubbery amid which if you like you may fancy yourself in a deep seclusion though probably the mark of eyeshot from the windows of all the surrounding houses  but in truth with regard to the rest of the town and the world at large all abode here is a genuine seclusion for the ordinary stream of life does not run through this little quiet pool and few or none of the inhabitants seem to be troubled with any business or outside activities  i used to set them down as halfpay officers dowagers of narrow income elderly maiden ladies and other people of respectability but small account such as hang on the worlds skirts rather than actually belong to it  the quiet of the place was seldom disturbed except by the grocer and butcher who came to receive orders or by the cabs hackneycoaches and bathchairs in which the ladies took an infrequent airing or the liverysteed which the retired captain sometimes bestrode for a morning ride or by the redcoated postman who went his rounds twice a day to deliver letters and again in the evening ringing a handbell to take letters for the mail  in merely mentioning these slight interruptions of its sluggish stillness i seem to myself to disturb too much the atmosphere of quiet that brooded over the spot whereas its impression upon me was that the world had never found the way hither or had forgotten it and that the fortunate inhabitants were the only ones who possessed the spellword of admittance  nothing could have suited me better at the time for i had been holding a position of public servitude which imposed upon me among a great many lighter duties the ponderous necessity of being universally civil and sociable  nevertheless if a man were seeking the bustle of society he might find it more readily in leamington than in most other english towns  it is a permanent wateringplace a sort of institution to which i do not know any close parallel in american life for such places as saratoga bloom only for the summerseason and offer a thousand dissimilitudes even then while leamington seems to be always in flower and serves as a home to the homeless all the year round  its original nucleus the plausible excuse for the towns coming into prosperous existence lies in the fiction of a chalybeate well which indeed is so far a reality that out of its magical depths have gushed streets groves gardens mansions shops and churches and spread themselves along the banks of the little river leam  this miracle accomplished the beneficent fountain has retired beneath a pumproom and appears to have given up all pretensions to the remedial virtues formerly attributed to it  i know not whether its waters are ever tasted nowadays but not the less does leamingtonin pleasant warwickshire at the very midmost point of england in a good hunting neighborhood and surrounded by countryseats and castles continue to be a resort of transient visitors and the more permanent abode of a class of genteel unoccupied welltodo but not very wealthy people such as are hardly known among ourselves  persons who have no countryhouses and whose fortunes are inadequate to a london expenditure find here i suppose a sort of town and country life in one  in its present aspect the town is of no great age  in contrast with the antiquity of many places in its neighborhood it has a bright new face and seems almost to smile even amid the sombreness of an english autumn nevertheless it is hundreds upon hundreds of years old if we reckon up that sleepy lapse of time during which it existed as a small village of thatched houses clustered round a priory and it would still have been precisely such a rural village but for a certain dr jephson who lived within the memory of man and who found out the magic well and foresaw what fairy wealth might be made to flow from it  a public garden has been laid out along the margin of the leam and called the jephson garden in honor of him who created the prosperity of his native spot  a little way within the gardengate there is a circular temple of grecian architecture beneath the dome of which stands a marble statue of the good doctor very well executed and representing him with a face of fussy activity and benevolence just the kind of man if luck favored him to build up the fortunes of those about him or quite as probably to blight his whole neighborhood by some disastrous speculation  the jephson garden is very beautiful like most other english pleasuregrounds for aided by their moist climate and not too fervid sun the landscapegardeners excel in converting flat or tame surfaces into attractive scenery chiefly through the skilful arrangement of trees and shrubbery  an englishman aims at this effect even in the little patches under the windows of a suburban villa and achieves it on a larger scale in a tract of many acres  the garden is shadowed with trees of a fine growth standing alone or in dusky groves and dense entanglements pervaded by woodland paths and emerging from these pleasant glooms we come upon a breadth of sunshine where the greenswardso vividly green that it has a kind of lustre in itis spotted with beds of gemlike flowers  rustic chairs and benches are scattered about some of them ponderously fashioned out of the stumps of obtruncated trees and others more artfully made with intertwining branches or perhaps an imitation of such frail handiwork in iron  in a central part of the garden is an archeryground where laughing maidens practise at the butts generally missing their ostensible mark but by the mere grace of their action sending an unseen shaft into some young mans heart  there is space moreover within these precincts for an artificial lake with a little green island in the midst of it both lake and island being the haunt of swans whose aspect and movement in the water are most beautiful and statelymost infirm disjointed and decrepit when unadvisedly they see fit to emerge and try to walk upon dry land  in the latter case they look like a breed of uncommonly illcontrived geese and i record the matter here for the sake of the moralthat we should never pass judgment on the merits of any person or thing unless we behold them in the sphere and circumstances to which they are specially adapted  in still another part of the garden there is a labyrinthine maze formed of an intricacy of hedgebordered walks involving himself in which a man might wander for hours inextricably within a circuit of only a few yards  it seemed to me a sad emblem of the mental and moral perplexities in which we sometimes go astray petty in scope yet large enough to entangle a lifetime and bewilder us with a weary movement but no genuine progress  the leamthe high complectioned leam as drayton calls itafter drowsing across the principal street of the town beneath a handsome bridge skirts along the margin of the garden without any perceptible flow  heretofore i had fancied the concord the laziest river in the world but now assign that amiable distinction to the little english stream  its water is by no means transparent but has a greenish goosepuddly hue which however accords well with the other coloring and characteristics of the scene and is disagreeable neither to sight nor smell  certainly this river is a perfect feature of that gentle picturesqueness in which england is so rich sleeping as it does beneath a margin of willows that droop into its bosom and other trees of deeper verdure than our own country can boast inclining lovingly over it  on the gardenside it is bordered by a shadowy secluded grove with winding paths among its boskiness affording many a peep at the rivers imperceptible lapse and tranquil gleam and on the opposite shore stands the priorychurch with its churchyard full of shrubbery and tombstones  the business portion of the town clusters about the banks of the leam and is naturally densest around the well to which the modern settlement owes its existence  here are the commercial inns the postoffice the furnituredealers the ironmongers and all the heavy and homely establishments that connect themselves even with the airiest modes of human life while upward from the river by a long and gentle ascent rises the principal street which is very bright and cheerful in its physiognomy and adorned with shopfronts almost as splendid as those of london though on a diminutive scale  there are likewise sidestreets and crossstreets many of which are bordered with the beautiful warwickshire elm a most unusual kind of adornment for an english town and spacious avenues wide enough to afford room for stately groves with footpaths running beneath the lofty shade and rooks cawing and chattering so high in the treetops that their voices get musical before reaching the earth  the houses are mostly built in blocks and ranges in which every separate tenement is a repetition of its fellow though the architecture of the different ranges is sufficiently various  some of them are almost palatial in size and sumptuousness of arrangement  then on the outskirts of the town there are detached villas enclosed within that separate domain of high stone fence and embowered shrubbery which an englishman so loves to build and plant around his abode presenting to the public only an iron gate with a gravelled carriagedrive winding away towards the halfhidden mansion  whether in street or suburb leamington may fairly be called beautiful and at some points magnificent but by and by you become doubtfully suspicious of a somewhat unreal finery it is pretentious though not glaringly so it has been built with malice aforethought as a place of gentility and enjoyment moreover splendid as the houses look and comfortable as they often are there is a nameless something about them betokening that they have not grown out of human hearts but are the creations of a skilfully applied human intellect no man has reared any one of them whether stately or humble to be his lifelong residence wherein to bring up his children who are to inherit it as a home  they are nicely contrived lodginghouses one and allthe best as well as the shabbiest of them and therefore inevitably lack some nameless property that a home should have  this was the case with our own little snuggery in lansdowne circus as with all the rest it had not grown out of anybodys individual need but was built to let or sell and was therefore like a readymade garmenta tolerable fit but only tolerable  all these blocks ranges and detached villas are adorned with the finest and most aristocratic manes that i have found anywhere in england except perhaps in bath which is the great metropolis of that secondclass gentility with which wateringplaces are chiefly populated lansdowne crescent lansdowne circus lansdowne terrace regent street warwick street clarendon street the upper and lower parade such are a few of the designations  parade indeed is a wellchosen name for the principal street along which the population of the idle town draws itself out for daily review and display  i only wish that my descriptive powers would enable me to throw off a picture of the scene at a sunny noontide individualizing each character with a touch the great people alighting from their carriages at the principal shopdoors the elderly ladies and infirm indian officers drawn along in bathchairs the comely rather than pretty english girls with their deep healthy bloom which an american taste is apt to deem fitter for a milkmaid than for a lady the mustached gentlemen with frogged surtouts and a military air the nursemaids and chubby children but no chubbier than our own and scampering on slenderer legs the sturdy figure of john bull in all varieties and of all ages but ever with the stamp of authenticity somewhere about him  to say the truth i have been holding the pen over my paper purposing to write a descriptive paragraph or two about the throng on the principal parade of leamington so arranging it as to present a sketch of the british outofdoor aspect on a morning walk of gentility but i find no personages quite sufficiently distinct and individual in my memory to supply the materials of such a panorama  oddly enough the only figure that comes fairly forth to my minds eye is that of a dowager one of hundreds whom i used to marvel at all over england but who have scarcely a representative among our own ladies of autumnal life so thin careworn and frail as age usually makes the latter  i have heard a good deal of the tenacity with which english ladies retain their personal beauty to a late period of life but not to suggest that an american eye needs use and cultivation before it can quite appreciate the charm of english beauty at any age it strikes me that an english lady of fifty is apt to become a creature less refined and delicate so far as her physique goes than anything that we western people class under the name of woman  she has an awful ponderosity of frame not pulpy like the looser development of our few fat women but massive with solid beef and streaky tallow so that though struggling manfully against the idea you inevitably think of her as made up of steaks and sirloins  when she walks her advance is elephantine  when she sits down it is on a great round space of her makers footstool where she looks as if nothing could ever move her  she imposes awe and respect by the muchness of her personality to such a degree that you probably credit her with far greater moral and intellectual force than she can fairly claim  her visage is usually grim and stern seldom positively forbidding yet calmly terrible not merely by its breadth and weight of feature but because it seems to express so much wellfounded selfreliance such acquaintance with the world its toils troubles and dangers and such sturdy capacity for trampling down a foe  without anything positively salient or actively offensive or indeed unjustly formidable to her neighbors she has the effect of a seventyfour gunship in time of peace for while you assure yourself that there is no real danger you cannot help thinking how tremendous would be her onset if pugnaciously inclined and how futile the effort to inflict any counterinjury  she certainly looks tenfoldnay a hundredfoldbetter able to take care of herself than our slenderframed and haggard womankind but i have not found reason to suppose that the english dowager of fifty has actually greater courage fortitude and strength of character than our women of similar age or even a tougher physical endurance than they  morally she is strong i suspect only in society and in the common routine of social affairs and would be found powerless and timid in any exceptional strait that might call for energy outside of the conventionalities amid which she has grown up  you can meet this figure in the street and live and even smile at the recollection  but conceive of her in a ballroom with the bare brawny arms that she invariably displays there and all the other corresponding development such as is beautiful in the maiden blossom but a spectacle to howl at in such an overblown cabbagerose as this  yet somewhere in this enormous bulk there must be hidden the modest slender violetnature of a girl whom an alien mass of earthliness has unkindly overgrown for an english maiden in her teens though very seldom so pretty as our own damsels possesses to say the truth a certain charm of halfblossom and delicately folded leaves and tender womanhood shielded by maidenly reserves with which somehow or other our american girls often fail to adorn themselves during an appreciable moment  it is a pity that the english violet should grow into such an outrageously developed peony as i have attempted to describe  i wonder whether a middleaged husband ought to be considered as legally married to all the accretions that have overgrown the slenderness of his bride since he led her to the altar and which make her so much more than he ever bargained for  is it not a sounder view of the case that the matrimonial bond cannot be held to include the three fourths of the wife that had no existence when the ceremony was performed  and as a matter of conscience and good morals ought not an english married pair to insist upon the celebration of a silverwedding at the end of twentyfive years in order to legalize and mutually appropriate that corporeal growth of which both parties have individually come into possession since they were pronounced one flesh  the chief enjoyment of my several visits to leamington lay in rural walks about the neighborhood and in jaunts to places of note and interest which are particularly abundant in that region  the highroads are made pleasant to the traveller by a border of trees and often afford him the hospitality of a wayside bench beneath a comfortable shade  but a fresher delight is to be found in the footpaths which go wandering away from stile to stile along hedges and across broad fields and through wooded parks leading you to little hamlets of thatched cottages ancient solitary farmhouses picturesque old mills streamlets pools and all those quiet secret unexpected yet strangely familiar features of english scenery that tennyson shows us in his idyls and eclogues these bypaths admit the wayfarer into the very heart of rural life and yet do not burden him with a sense of intrusiveness  he has a right to go whithersoever they lead him for with all their shaded privacy they are as much the property of the public as the dusty highroad itself and even by an older tenure  their antiquity probably exceeds that of the roman ways the footsteps of the aboriginal britons first wore away the grass and the natural flow of intercourse between village and village has kept the track bare ever since  an american farmer would plough across any such path and obliterate it with his hills of potatoes and indian corn but here it is protected by law and still more by the sacredness that inevitably springs up in this soil along the welldefined footprints of centuries  old associations are sure to be fragrant herbs in english nostrils we pull them up as weeds  i remember such a path the access to which is from lovers grove a range of tall old oaks and elms on a high hilltop whence there is a view of warwick castle and a wide extent of landscape beautiful though bedimmed with english mist  this particular footpath however is not a remarkably good specimen of its kind since it leads into no hollows and seclusions and soon terminates in a highroad  it connects leamington by a short cut with the small neighboring village of lillington a place which impresses an american observer with its many points of contrast to the rural aspects of his own country  the village consists chiefly of one row of contiguous dwellings separated only by partywalls but illmatched among themselves being of different heights and apparently of various ages though all are of an antiquity which we should call venerable  some of the windows are leadenframed lattices opening on hinges  these houses are mostly built of gray stone but others in the same range are of brick and one or two are in a very old fashion elizabethan or still olderhaving a ponderous framework of oak painted black and filled in with plastered stone or bricks  judging by the patches of repair the oak seems to be the more durable part of the structure  some of the roofs are covered with earthen tiles others more decayed and povertystricken with thatch out of which sprouts a luxurious vegetation of grass houseleeks and yellow flowers  what especially strikes an american is the lack of that insulated space the intervening gardens grassplots orchards broadspreading shadetrees which occur between our own villagehouses  these english dwellings have no such separate surroundings they all grow together like the cells of a honeycomb  beyond the first row of houses and hidden from it by a turn of the road there was another row or block as we should call it of small old cottages stuck one against another with their thatched roofs forming a single contiguity  these i presume were the habitations of the poorest order of rustic laborers and the narrow precincts of each cottage as well as the close neighborhood of the whole gave the impression of a stifled unhealthy atmosphere among the occupants  it seemed impossible that there should be a cleanly reserve a proper selfrespect among individuals or a wholesome unfamiliarity between families where human life was crowded and massed into such intimate communities as these nevertheless not to look beyond the outside i never saw a prettier rural scene than was presented by this range of contiguous huts  for in front of the whole row was a luxuriant and welltrimmed hawthorn hedge and belonging to each cottage was a little square of gardenground separated from its neighbors by a line of the same verdant fence  the gardens were chockfull not of esculent vegetables but of flowers familiar ones but very brightcolored and shrubs of box some of which were trimmed into artistic shapes and i remember before one door a representation of warwick castle made of oystershells  the cottagers evidently loved the little nests in which they dwelt and did their best to make them beautiful and succeeded more than tolerably wellso kindly did nature help their humble efforts with its verdure flowers moss lichens and the green things that grew out of the thatch  through some of the open doorways we saw plump children rolling about on the stone floors and their mothers by no means very pretty but as happylooking as mothers generally are and while we gazed at these domestic matters an old woman rushed wildly out of one of the gates upholding a shovel on which she clanged and clattered with a key  at first we fancied that she intended an onslaught against ourselves but soon discovered that a more dangerous enemy was abroad for the old ladys bees had swarmed and the air was full of them whizzing by our heads like bullets  not far from these two rows of houses and cottages a green lane overshadowed with trees turned aside from the main road and tended towards a square gray tower the battlements of which were just high enough to be visible above the foliage  wending our way thitherward we found the very picture and ideal of a country church and churchyard  the tower seemed to be of norman architecture low massive and crowned with battlements  the body of the church was of very modest dimensions and the eaves so low that i could touch them with my walkingstick  we looked into the windows and beheld the dim and quiet interior a narrow space but venerable with the consecration of many centuries and keeping its sanctity as entire and inviolate as that of a vast cathedral  the nave was divided from the side aisles of the church by pointed arches resting on very sturdy pillars it was good to see how solemnly they held themselves to their agelong task of supporting that lowly roof  there was a small organ suited in size to the vaulted hollow which it weekly filled with religious sound  on the opposite wall of the church between two windows was a mural tablet of white marble with an inscription in black lettersthe only such memorial that i could discern although many dead people doubtless lay beneath the floor and had paved it with their ancient tombstones as is customary in old english churches  there were no modern painted windows flaring with raw colors nor other gorgeous adornments such as the present taste for mediaeval restoration often patches upon the decorous simplicity of the gray villagechurch it is probably the worshippingplace of no more distinguished a congregation than the farmers and peasantry who inhabit the houses and cottages which i have just described  had the lord of the manor been one of the parishioners there would have been an eminent pew near the chancel walled high about curtained and softly cushioned warmed by a fireplace of its own and distinguished by hereditary tablets and escutcheons on the enclosed stone pillar  a welltrodden path led across the churchyard and the gate being on the latch we entered and walked round among the graves and monuments  the latter were chiefly headstones none of which were very old so far as was discoverable by the dates some indeed in so ancient a cemetery were disagreeably new with inscriptions glittering like sunshine in gold letters  the ground must have been dug over and over again innumerable times until the soil is made up of what was once human clay out of which have sprung successive crops of gravestones that flourish their allotted time and disappear like the weeds and flowers in their briefer period  the english climate is very unfavorable to the endurance of memorials in the open air  twenty years of it suffice to give as much antiquity of aspect whether to tombstone or edifice as a hundred years of our own drier atmosphereso soon do the drizzly rains and constant moisture corrode the surface of marble or freestone  sculptured edges loose their sharpness in a year or two yellow lichens overspread a beloved name and obliterate it while it is yet fresh upon some survivors heart  time gnaws an english gravestone with wonderful appetite and when the inscription is quite illegible the sexton takes the useless slab away and perhaps makes a hearthstone of it and digs up the unripe bones which it ineffectually tried to memorialize and gives the bed to another sleeper  in the charter street burialground at salem and in the old graveyard on the hill at ipswich i have seen more ancient gravestones with legible inscriptions on them than in any english churchyard  and yet this same ungenial climate hostile as it generally is to the long remembrance of departed people has sometimes a lovely way of dealing with the records on certain monuments that lie horizontally in the open air  the rain falls into the deep incisions of the letters and has scarcely time to be dried away before another shower sprinkles the flat stone again and replenishes those little reservoirs  the unseen mysterious seeds of mosses find their way into the lettered furrows and are made to germinate by the continual moisture and watery sunshine of the english sky and by and by in a year or two years or many years behold the complete inscription       here lieth the body  and all the rest of the tender falsehoodbeautifully embossed in raised letters of living green a basrelief of velvet moss on the marble slab it becomes more legible under the skyey influences after the world has forgotten the deceased than when it was fresh from the stonecutters hands  it outlives the grief of friends  i first saw an example of this in bebbington churchyard in cheshire and thought that nature must needs have had a special tenderness for the person no noted man however in the worlds history so long ago laid beneath that stone since she took such wonderful pains to keep his memory green  perhaps the proverbial phrase just quoted may have had its origin in the natural phenomenon here described  while we rested ourselves on a horizontal monument which was elevated just high enough to be a convenient seat i observed that one of the gravestones lay very close to the churchso close that the droppings of the eaves would fall upon it  it seemed as if the inmate of that grave had desired to creep under the churchwall  on closer inspection we found an almost illegible epitaph on the stone and with difficulty made out this forlorn verse      poorly lived      and poorly died      poorly buried      and no one cried  it would be hard to compress the story of a cold and luckless life death and burial into fewer words or more impressive ones at least we found them impressive perhaps because we had to recreate the inscription by scraping away the lichens from the faintly traced letters the grave was on the shady and damp side of the church endwise towards it the headstone being within about three feet of the foundationwall so that unless the poor man was a dwarf he must have been doubled up to fit him into his final restingplace  no wonder that his epitaph murmured against so poor a burial as this  his name as well as i could make it out was treeojohn treeo i thinkand he died in 1810 at the age of seventyfour  the gravestone is so overgrown with grass and weeds so covered with unsightly lichens and so crumbly with time and foul weather that it is questionable whether anybody will ever be at the trouble of deciphering it again  but there is a quaint and sad kind of enjoyment in defeating to such slight degree as my pen may do it the probabilities of oblivion for poor john treeo and asking a little sympathy for him half a century after his death and making him better and more widely known at least than any other slumberer in lillington churchyard he having been as appearances go the outcast of them all  you find similar old churches and villages in all the neighboring country at the distance of every two or three miles and i describe them not as being rare but because they are so common and characteristic  the village of whitnash within twenty minutes walk of leamington looks as secluded as rural and as little disturbed by the fashions of today as if dr jephson had never developed all those parades and crescents out of his magic well  i used to wonder whether the inhabitants had ever yet heard of railways or at their slow rate of progress had even reached the epoch of stagecoaches  as you approach the village while it is yet unseen you observe a tall overshadowing canopy of elmtree tops beneath which you almost hesitate to follow the public road on account of the remoteness that seems to exist between the precincts of this oldworld community and the thronged modern street out of which you have so recently emerged  venturing onward however you soon find yourself in the heart of whitnash and see an irregular ring of ancient rustic dwellings surrounding the villagegreen on one side of which stands the church with its square norman tower and battlements while close adjoining is the vicarage made picturesque by peaks and gables  at first glimpse none of the houses appear to be less than two or three centuries old and they are of the ancient woodenframed fashion with thatched roofs which give them the air of birds nests thereby assimilating them closely to the simplicity of nature  the churchtower is mossy and much gnawed by time it has narrow loopholes up and down its front and sides and an arched window over the low portal set with small panes of glass cracked dim and irregular through which a bygone age is peeping out into the daylight  some of those old grotesque faces called gargoyles are seen on the projections of the architecture  the churchyard is very small and is encompassed by a gray stone fence that looks as ancient as the church itself  in front of the tower on the villagegreen is a yewtree of incalculable age with a vast circumference of trunk but a very scanty head of foliage though its boughs still keep some of the vitality which perhaps was in its early prime when the saxon invaders founded whitnash  a thousand years is no extraordinary antiquity in the lifetime of a yew  we were pleasantly startled however by discovering an exuberance of more youthful life than we had thought possible in so old a tree for the faces of two children laughed at us out of an opening in the trunk which had become hollow with long decay  on one side of the yew stood a framework of wormeaten timber the use and meaning of which puzzled me exceedingly till i made it out to be the villagestocks a public institution that in its day had doubtless hampered many a pair of shankbones now crumbling in the adjacent churchyard  it is not to be supposed however that this oldfashioned mode of punishment is still in vogue among the good people of whitnash  the vicar of the parish has antiquarian propensities and had probably dragged the stocks out of some dusty hidingplace and set them up on their former site as a curiosity  i disquiet myself in vain with the effort to hit upon some characteristic feature or assemblage of features that shall convey to the reader the influence of hoar antiquity lingering into the present daylight as i so often felt it in these old english scenes  it is only an american who can feel it and even he begins to find himself growing insensible to its effect after a long residence in england  but while you are still new in the old country it thrills you with strange emotion to think that this little church of whitnash humble as it seems stood for ages under the catholic faith and has not materially changed since wickcliffes days and that it looked as gray as now in bloody marys time and that cromwells troopers broke off the stone noses of those same gargoyles that are now grinning in your face  so too with the immemorial yewtree you see its great roots grasping hold of the earth like gigantic claws clinging so sturdily that no effort of time can wrench them away and there being life in the old tree you feel all the more as if a contemporary witness were telling you of the things that have been it has lived among men and been a familiar object to them and seen them brought to be christened and married and buried in the neighboring church and churchyard through so many centuries that it knows all about our race so far as fifty generations of the whitnash people can supply such knowledge  and after all what a weary life it must have been for the old tree tedious beyond imagination  such i think is the final impression on the mind of an american visitor when his delight at finding something permanent begins to yield to his western love of change and he becomes sensible of the heavy air of a spot where the forefathers and foremothers have grown up together intermarried and died through a long succession of lives without any intermixture of new elements till family features and character are all run in the same inevitable mould  life is there fossilized in its greenest leaf  the man who died yesterday or ever so long ago walks the villagestreet to day and chooses the same wife that he married a hundred years since and must be buried again tomorrow under the same kindred dust that has already covered him half a score of times  the stone threshold of his cottage is worn away with his hobnailed footsteps shuffling over it from the reign of the first plantagenet to that of victoria  better than this is the lot of our restless countrymen whose modern instinct bids them tend always towards fresh woods and pastures new  rather than such monotony of sluggish ages loitering on a villagegreen toiling in hereditary fields listening to the parsons drone lengthened through centuries in the gray norman church let us welcome whatever change may comechange of place social customs political institutions modes of worshiptrusting that if all present things shall vanish they will but make room for better systems and for a higher type of man to clothe his life in them and to fling them off in turn  nevertheless while an american willingly accepts growth and change as the law of his own national and private existence he has a singular tenderness for the stoneincrusted institutions of the mothercountry the reason may be though i should prefer a more generous explanation that he recognizes the tendency of these hardened forms to stiffen her joints and fetter her ankles in the race and rivalry of improvement  i hated to see so much as a twig of ivy wrenched away from an old wall in england  yet change is at work even in such a village as whitnash  at a subsequent visit looking more critically at the irregular circle of dwellings that surround the yewtree and confront the church i perceived that some of the houses must have been built within no long time although the thatch the quaint gables and the old oaken framework of the others diffused an air of antiquity over the whole assemblage  the church itself was undergoing repair and restoration which is but another name for change  masons were making patchwork on the front of the tower and were sawing a slab of stone and piling up bricks to strengthen the sidewall or possibly to enlarge the ancient edifice by an additional aisle  moreover they had dug an immense pit in the churchyard long and broad and fifteen feet deep two thirds of which profundity were discolored by human decay and mixed up with crumbly bones  what this excavation was intended for i could nowise imagine unless it were the very pit in which longfellow bids the dead past bury its dead and whitnash of all places in the world were going to avail itself of our poets suggestion  if so it must needs be confessed that many picturesque and delightful things would be thrown into the hole and covered out of sight forever  the article which i am writing has taken its own course and occupied itself almost wholly with country churches whereas i had purposed to attempt a description of some of the many old townswarwick coventry kenilworth stratfordonavonwhich lie within an easy scope of leamington  and still another church presents itself to my remembrance it is that of hatton on which i stumbled in the course of a forenoons ramble and paused a little while to look at it for the sake of old dr parr who was once its vicar  hatton so far as i could discover has no publichouse no shop no contiguity of roofs as in most english villages however small but is merely an ancient neighborhood of farmhouses spacious and standing wide apart each within its own precincts and offering a most comfortable aspect of orchards harvestfields barns stacks and all manner of rural plenty  it seemed to be a community of old settlers among whom everything had been going on prosperously since an epoch beyond the memory of man and they kept a certain privacy among themselves and dwelt on a crossroad at the entrance of which was a barred gate hospitably open but still impressing me with a sense of scarcely warrantable intrusion  after all in some shady nook of those gentle warwickshire slopes there may have been a denser and more populous settlement styled hatton which i never reached  emerging from the byroad and entering upon one that crossed it at right angles and led to warwick i espied the church of dr parr  like the others which i have described it had a low stone tower square and battlemented at its summit for all these little churches seem to have been built on the same model and nearly at the same measurement and have even a greater familylikeness than the cathedrals  as i approached the bell of the tower a remarkably deeptoned bell considering how small it was flung its voice abroad and told me that it was noon  the church stands among its graves a little removed from the wayside quite apart from any collection of houses and with no signs of vicarage it is a good deal shadowed by trees and not wholly destitute of ivy  the body of the edifice unfortunately and it is an outrage which the english churchwardens are fond of perpetrating has been newly covered with a yellowish plaster or wash so as quite to destroy the aspect of antiquity except upon the tower which wears the dark gray hue of many centuries  the chancelwindow is painted with a representation of christ upon the cross and all the other windows are full of painted or stained glass but none of it ancient nor if it be fair to judge from without of what ought to be seen within possessing any of the tender glory that should be the inheritance of this branch of art revived from mediaeval times  i stepped over the graves and peeped in at two or three of the windows and saw the snug interior of the church glimmering through the manycolored panes like a show of commonplace objects under the fantastic influence of a dream for the floor was covered with modern pews very like what we may see in a new england meetinghouse though i think a little more favorable than those would be to the quiet slumbers of the hatton farmers and their families  those who slept under dr parrs preaching now prolong their nap i suppose in the churchyard round about and can scarcely have drawn much spiritual benefit from any truths that he contrived to tell them in their lifetime  it struck me as a rare example even where examples are numerous of a man utterly misplaced that this enormous scholar great in the classic tongues and inevitably converting his own simplest vernacular into a learned language should have been set up in this homely pulpit and ordained to preach salvation to a rustic audience to whom it is difficult to imagine how he could ever have spoken one available word  almost always in visiting such scenes as i have been attempting to describe i had a singular sense of having been there before  the ivygrown english churches even that of bebbington the first that i beheld were quite as familiar to me when fresh from home as the old wooden meetinghouse in salem which used on wintry sabbaths to be the frozen purgatory of my childhood  this was a bewildering yet very delightful emotion fluttering about me like a faint summer wind and filling my imagination with a thousand halfremembrances which looked as vivid as sunshine at a sideglance but faded quite away whenever i attempted to grasp and define them  of course the explanation of the mystery was that history poetry and fiction books of travel and the talk of tourists had given me pretty accurate preconceptions of the common objects of english scenery and these being long ago vivified by a youthful fancy had insensibly taken their places among the images of things actually seen  yet the illusion was often so powerful that i almost doubted whether such airy remembrances might not be a sort of innate idea the print of a recollection in some ancestral mind transmitted with fainter and fainter impress through several descents to my own  i felt indeed like the stalwart progenitor in person returning to the hereditary haunts after more than two hundred years and finding the church the hall the farmhouse the cottage hardly changed during his long absencethe same shady bypaths and hedgelanes the same veiled sky and green lustre of the lawns and fieldswhile his own affinities for these things a little obscured by disuse were reviving at every step  an american is not very apt to love the english people as a whole on whatever length of acquaintance  i fancy that they would value our regard and even reciprocate it in their ungracious way if we could give it to them in spite of all rebuffs but they are beset by a curious and inevitable infelicity which compels them as it were to keep up what they seem to consider a wholesome bitterness of feeling between themselves and all other nationalities especially that of america  they will never confess it nevertheless it is as essential a tonic to them as their bitter ale  thereforeand possibly too from a similar narrowness in his own characteran american seldom feels quite as if he were at home among the english people  if he do so he has ceased to be an american  but it requires no long residence to make him love their island and appreciate it as thoroughly as they themselves do  for my part i used to wish that we could annex it transferring their thirty millions of inhabitants to some convenient wilderness in the great west and putting half or a quarter as many of ourselves into their places the change would be beneficial to both parties  we in our dry atmosphere are getting too nervous haggard dyspeptic extenuated unsubstantial theoretic and need to be made grosser  john bull on the other hand has grown bulbous longbodied shortlegged heavywitted material and in a word too intensely english  in a few more centuries he will be the earthliest creature that ever the earth saw  heretofore providence has obviated such a result by timely intermixtures of alien races with the old english stock so that each successive conquest of england has proved a victory by the revivification and improvement of its native manhood  cannot america and england hit upon some scheme to secure even greater advantages to both nations     about warwick   between bright new leamington the growth of the present century and rusty warwick founded by king cymbeline in the twilight ages a thousand years before the mediaeval darkness there are two roads either of which may be measured by a soberpaced pedestrian in less than half an hour  one of these avenues flows out of the midst of the smart parades and crescents of the former townalong by hedges and beneath the shadow of great elms past stuccoed elizabethan villas and wayside alehouses and through a hamlet of modern aspectand runs straight into the principal thoroughfare of warwick  the battlemented turrets of the castle embowered halfway up in foliage and the tall slender tower of st marys church rising from among clustered roofs have been visible almost from the commencement of the walk  near the entrance of the town stands st johns schoolhouse a picturesque old edifice of stone with four peaked gables in a row alternately plain and ornamented and wide projecting windows and a spacious and venerable porch all overgrown with moss and ivy and shut in from the world by a high stone fence not less mossy than the gabled front  there is an iron gate through the rusty openwork of which you see a grassy lawn and almost expect to meet the shy curious eyes of the little boys of past generations peeping forth from their infantile antiquity into the strangeness of our present life  i find a peculiar charm in these longestablished english schools where the schoolboy of today sits side by side as it were with his greatgrandsire on the same old benches and often i believe thumbs a later but unimproved edition of the same old grammar or arithmetic  the newfangled notions of a yankee schoolcommittee would madden many a pedagogue and shake down the roof of many a timehonored seat of learning in the mothercountry  at this point however we will turn back in order to follow up the other road from leamington which was the one that i loved best to take it pursues a straight and level course bordered by wide gravelwalks and overhung by the frequent elm with here a cottage and there a villa on one side a wooded plantation and on the other a rich field of grass or grain until turning at right angles it brings you to an arched bridge over the avon  its parapet is a balustrade carved out of freestone into the soft substance of which a multitude of persons have engraved their names or initials many of them now illegible while others more deeply cut are illuminated with fresh green moss  these tokens indicate a famous spot and casting our eyes along the smooth gleam and shadow of the quiet stream through a vista of willows that droop on either side into the water we behold the gray magnificence of warwick castle uplifting itself among stately trees and rearing its turrets high above their loftiest branches  we can scarcely think the scene real so completely do those machicolated towers the long line of battlements the massive buttresses the highwindowed walls shape out our indistinct ideas of the antique time  it might rather seem as if the sleepy river being shakespeares avon and often no doubt the mirror of his gorgeous visions were dreaming now of a lordly residence that stood here many centuries ago and this fantasy is strengthened when you observe that the image in the tranquil water has all the distinctness of the actual structure  either might be the reflection of the other  wherever time has gnawed one of the stones you see the mark of his tooth just as plainly in the sunken reflection  each is so perfect that the upper vision seems a castle in the air and the lower one an old stronghold of feudalism miraculously kept from decay in an enchanted river  a ruinous and ivygrown bridge that projects from the bank a little on the hither side of the castle has the effect of making the scene appear more entirely apart from the everyday world for it ends abruptly in the middle of the streamso that if a cavalcade of the knights and ladies of romance should issue from the old walls they could never tread on earthly ground any more than we approaching from the side of modern realism can overleap the gulf between our domain and theirs  yet if we seek to disenchant ourselves it may readily be done  crossing the bridge on which we stand and passing a little farther on we come to the entrance of the castle abutting on the highway and hospitably open at certain hours to all curious pilgrims who choose to disburse half a crown or so toward the support of the earls domestics  the sight of that long series of historic rooms full of such splendors and rarities as a great english family necessarily gathers about itself in its hereditary abode and in the lapse of ages is well worth the money or ten times as much if indeed the value of the spectacle could be reckoned in moneysworth but after the attendant has hurried you from end to end of the edifice repeating a guidebook by rote and exorcising each successive hall of its poetic glamour and witchcraft by the mere tone in which he talks about it you will make the doleful discovery that warwick castle has ceased to be a dream  it is better methinks to linger on the bridge gazing at caesars tower and guys tower in the dim english sunshine above and in the placid avon below and still keep them as thoughts in your own mind than climb to their summits or touch even a stone of their actual substance  they will have all the more reality for you as stalwart relics of immemorial time if you are reverent enough to leave them in the intangible sanctity of a poetic vision  from the bridge over the avon the road passes in front of the castlegate and soon enters the principal street of warwick a little beyond st johns schoolhouse already described  chester itself most antique of english towns can hardly show quainter architectural shapes than many of the buildings that border this street  they are mostly of the timberandplaster kind with bowed and decrepit ridgepoles and a whole chronology of various patchwork in their walls their lowbrowed doorways open upon a sunken floor their projecting stories peep as it were over one anothers shoulders and rise into a multiplicity of peaked gables they have curious windows breaking out irregularly all over the house some even in the roof set in their own little peaks opening latticewise and furnished with twenty small panes of lozengeshaped glass  the architecture of these edifices a visible oaken framework showing the whole skeleton of the houseas if a mans bones should be arranged on his outside and his flesh seen through the interstices is often imitated by modern builders and with sufficiently picturesque effect  the objection is that such houses like all imitations of bygone styles have an air of affectation they do not seem to be built in earnest they are no better than playthings or overgrown babyhouses in which nobody should be expected to encounter the serious realities of either birth or death  besides originating nothing we leave no fashions for another age to copy when we ourselves shall have grown antique  old as it looks all this portion of warwick has overbrimmed as it were from the original settlement being outside of the ancient wall  the street soon runs under an arched gateway with a church or some other venerable structure above it and admits us into the heart of the town at one of my first visits i witnessed a military display  a regiment of warwickshire militia probably commanded by the earl was going through its drill in the marketplace and on the collar of one of the officers was embroidered the bear and ragged staff which has been the cognizance of the warwick earldom from time immemorial  the soldiers were sturdy young men with the simple stolid yet kindly faces of english rustics looking exceedingly well in a body but slouching into a yeomanlike carriage and appearance the moment they were dismissed from drill squads of them were distributed everywhere about the streets and sentinels were posted at various points and i saw a sergeant with a great key in his hand big enough to have been the key of the castles main entrance when the gate was thickest and heaviest apparently setting a guard  thus centuries after feudal times are past we find warriors still gathering under the old castlewalls and commanded by a feudal lord just as in the days of the kingmaker who no doubt often mustered his retainers in the same marketplace where i beheld this modern regiment  the interior of the town wears a less oldfashioned aspect than the suburbs through which we approach it and the high street has shops with modern plateglass and buildings with stuccoed fronts exhibiting as few projections to hang a thought or sentiment upon as if an architect of today had planned them  and indeed so far as their surface goes they are perhaps new enough to stand unabashed in an american street but behind these renovated faces with their monotonous lack of expression there is probably the substance of the same old town that wore a gothic exterior in the middle ages  the street is an emblem of england itself what seems new in it is chiefly a skilful and fortunate adaptation of what such a people as ourselves would destroy  the new things are based and supported on sturdy old things and derive a massive strength from their deep and immemorial foundations though with such limitations and impediments as only an englishman could endure  but he likes to feel the weight of all the past upon his back and moreover the antiquity that overburdens him has taken root in his being and has grown to be rather a hump than a pack so that there is no getting rid of it without tearing his whole structure to pieces  in my judgment as he appears to be sufficiently comfortable under the mouldy accretion he had better stumble on with it as long as he can  he presents a spectacle which is by no means without its charm for a disinterested and unencumbered observer  when the old edifice or the antiquated custom or institution appears in its pristine form without any attempt at intermarrying it with modern fashions an american cannot but admire the picturesque effect produced by the sudden cropping up of an apparently deadandburied state of society into the actual present of which he is himself a part  we need not go far in warwick without encountering an instance of the kind proceeding westward through the town we find ourselves confronted by a huge mass of natural rock hewn into something like architectural shape and penetrated by a vaulted passage which may well have been one of king cymbelines original gateways and on the top of the rock over the archway sits a small old church communicating with an ancient edifice or assemblage of edifices that look down from a similar elevation on the side of the street  a range of trees half hides the latter establishment from the sun  it presents a curious and venerable specimen of the timberandplaster style of building in which some of the finest old houses in england are constructed the front projects into porticos and vestibules and rises into many gables some in a row and others crowning semidetached portions of the structure the windows mostly open on hinges but show a delightful irregularity of shape and position a multiplicity of chimneys break through the roof at their own will or at least without any settled purpose of the architect  the whole affair looks very oldso old indeed that the front bulges forth as if the timber framework were a little weary at last of standing erect so long but the state of repair is so perfect and there is such an indescribable aspect of continuous vitality within the system of this aged house that you feel confident that there may be safe shelter yet and perhaps for centuries to come under its timehonored roof  and on a bench sluggishly enjoying the sunshine and looking into the street of warwick as from a life apart a few old men are generally to be seen wrapped in long cloaks on which you may detect the glistening of a silver badge representing the bear and ragged staff  these decorated worthies are some of the twelve brethren of leicesters hospitala community which subsists today under the identical modes that were established for it in the reign of queen elizabeth and of course retains many features of a social life that has vanished almost everywhere else  the edifice itself dates from a much older period than the charitable institution of which it is now the home  it was the seat of a religious fraternity far back in the middle ages and continued so till henry viii turned all the priesthood of england out of doors and put the most unscrupulous of his favorites into their vacant abodes  in many instances the old monks had chosen the sites of their domiciles so well and built them on such a broad system of beauty and convenience that their layoccupants found it easy to convert them into stately and comfortable homes and as such they still exist with something of the antique reverence lingering about them  the structure now before us seems to have been first granted to sir nicholas lestrange who perhaps intended like other men to establish his household gods in the niches whence he had thrown down the images of saints and to lay his hearth where an altar had stood  but there was probably a natural reluctance in those days when catholicism so lately repudiated must needs have retained an influence over all but the most obdurate characters to bring ones hopes of domestic prosperity and a fortunate lineage into direct hostility with the awful claims of the ancient religion  at all events there is still a superstitious idea betwixt a fantasy and a belief that the possession of former churchproperty has drawn a curse along with it not only among the posterity of those to whom it was originally granted but wherever it has subsequently been transferred even if honestly bought and paid for  there are families now inhabiting some of the beautiful old abbeys who appear to indulge a species of pride in recording the strange deaths and ugly shapes of misfortune that have occurred among their predecessors and may be supposed likely to dog their own pathway down the ages of futurity  whether sir nicholas lestrange in the beefeating days of old harry and elizabeth was a nervous man and subject to apprehensions of this kind i cannot tell but it is certain that he speedily rid himself of the spoils of the church and that within twenty years afterwards the edifice became the property of the famous dudley earl of leicester brother of the earl of warwick  he devoted the ancient religious precinct to a charitable use endowing it with an ample revenue and making it the perpetual home of twelve poor honest and warbroken soldiers mostly his own retainers and natives either of warwickshire or gloucestershire  these veterans or others wonderfully like them still occupy their monkish dormitories and haunt the timedarkened corridors and galleries of the hospital leading a life of oldfashioned comfort wearing the oldfashioned cloaks and burnishing the identical silver badges which the earl of leicester gave to the original twelve  he is said to have been a bad man in his day but he has succeeded in prolonging one good deed into what was to him a distant future  on the projecting story over the arched entrance there is the date 1571 and several coatsofarms either the earls or those of his kindred and immediately above the doorway a stone sculpture of the bear and ragged staff  passing through the arch we find ourselves in a quadrangle or enclosed court such as always formed the central part of a great family residence in queen elizabeths time and earlier  there can hardly be a more perfect specimen of such an establishment than leicesters hospital  the quadrangle is a sort of skyroofed hall to which there is convenient access from all parts of the house  the four inner fronts with their high steep roofs and sharp gables look into it from antique windows and through open corridors and galleries along the sides and there seems to be a richer display of architectural devices and ornaments quainter carvings in oak and more fantastic shapes of the timber framework than on the side toward the street  on the wall opposite the arched entrance are the following inscriptions comprising such moral rules i presume as were deemed most essential for the daily observance of the community honor all menfear godhonor the kinglove the brotherhood and again as if this latter injunction needed emphasis and repetition among a household of aged people soured with the hard fortune of their previous livesbe kindly affectioned one to another  one sentence over a door communicating with the masters side of the house is addressed to that dignitaryhe that ruleth over men must be just all these are charactered in old english letters and form part of the elaborate ornamentation of the house  everywhereon the walls over windows and doors and at all points where there is room to place them appear escutcheons of arms cognizances and crests emblazoned in their proper colors and illuminating the ancient quadrangle with their splendor  one of these devices is a large image of a porcupine on an heraldic wreath being the crest of the lords de lisle  but especially is the cognizance of the bear and ragged staff repeated over and over and over again and again in a great variety of attitudes at fulllength and halflength in paint and in oaken sculpture in basrelief and rounded image  the founder of the hospital was certainly disposed to reckon his own beneficence as among the hereditary glories of his race and had he lived and died a halfcentury earlier he would have kept up an old catholic custom by enjoining the twelve bedesmen to pray for the welfare of his soul  at my first visit some of the brethren were seated on the bench outside of the edifice looking down into the street but they did not vouchsafe me a word and seemed so estranged from modern life so enveloped in antique customs and oldfashioned cloaks that to converse with them would have been like shouting across the gulf between our age and queen elizabeths  so i passed into the quadrangle and found it quite solitary except that a plain and neat old woman happened to be crossing it with an aspect of business and carefulness that bespoke her a woman of this world and not merely a shadow of the past  asking her if i could come in she answered very readily and civilly that i might and said that i was free to look about me hinting a hope however that i would not open the private doors of the brotherhood as some visitors were in the habit of doing  under her guidance i went into what was formerly the great hall of the establishment where king james i had once been feasted by an earl of warwick as is commemorated by an inscription on the cobwebbed and dingy wall  it is a very spacious and barnlike apartment with a brick floor and a vaulted roof the rafters of which are oaken beams wonderfully carved but hardly visible in the duskiness that broods aloft  the hall may have made a splendid appearance when it was decorated with rich tapestry and illuminated with chandeliers cressets and torches glistening upon silver dishes where king james sat at supper among his brilliantly dressed nobles but it has come to base uses in these latter daysbeing improved in yankee phrase as a brewery and washroom and as a cellar for the brethrens separate allotments of coal  the old lady here left me to myself and i returned into the quadrangle it was very quiet very handsome in its own obsolete style and must be an exceedingly comfortable place for the old people to lounge in when the inclement winds render it inexpedient to walk abroad  there are shrubs against the wall on one side and on another is a cloistered walk adorned with stags heads and antlers and running beneath a covered gallery up to which ascends a balustraded staircase  in the portion of the edifice opposite the entrancearch are the apartments of the master and looking into the window as the old woman at no request of mine had specially informed me that i might i saw a low but vastly comfortable parlor very handsomely furnished and altogether a luxurious place  it had a fireplace with an immense arch the antique breadth of which extended almost from wall to wall of the room though now fitted up in such a way that the modern coalgrate looked very diminutive in the midst  gazing into this pleasant interior it seemed to me that among these venerable surroundings availing himself of whatever was good in former things and eking out their imperfection with the results of modern ingenuity the master might lead a not unenviable life  on the cloistered side of the quadrangle where the dark oak panels made the enclosed space dusky i beheld a curtained window reddened by a great blaze from within and heard the bubbling and squeaking of something doubtless very nice and succulentthat was being cooked at the kitchenfire  i think indeed that a whiff or two of the savory fragrance reached my nostrils at all events the impression grew upon me that leicesters hospital is one of the jolliest old domiciles in england  i was about to depart when another old woman very plainly dressed but fat comfortable and with a cheerful twinkle in her eyes came in through the arch and looked curiously at me  this repeated apparition of the gentle sex though by no means under its loveliest guise had still an agreeable effect in modifying my ideas of an institution which i had supposed to be of a stern and monastic character  she asked whether i wished to see the hospital and said that the porter whose office it was to attend to visitors was dead and would be buried that very day so that the whole establishment could not conveniently be shown me  she kindly invited me however to visit the apartment occupied by her husband and herself so i followed her up the antique staircase along the gallery and into a small oakpanelled parlor where sat an old man in a long blue garment who arose and saluted me with much courtesy  he seemed a very quiet person and yet had a look of travel and adventure and gray experience such as i could have fancied in a palmer of ancient times who might likewise have worn a similar costume  the little room was carpeted and neatly furnished a portrait of its occupant was hanging on the wall and on a table were two swords crossedone probably his own battleweapon and the other which i drew half out of the scabbard had an inscription on the blade purporting that it had been taken from the field of waterloo  my kind old hostess was anxious to exhibit all the particulars of their housekeeping and led me into the bedroom which was in the nicest order with a snowwhite quilt upon the bed and in a little intervening room was a washing and bathing apparatus a convenience judging from the personal aspect and atmosphere of such parties seldom to be met with in the humbler ranks of british life  the old soldier and his wife both seemed glad of somebody to talk with but the good woman availed herself of the privilege far more copiously than the veteran himself insomuch that he felt it expedient to give her an occasional nudge with his elbow in her wellpadded ribs  dont you be so talkative quoth he and indeed he could hardly find space for a word and quite as little after his admonition as before  her nimble tongue ran over the whole system of life in the hospital  the brethren she said had a yearly stipend the amount of which she did not mention and such decent lodgings as i saw and some other advantages free and instead of being pestered with a great many rules and made to dine together at a great table they could manage their little household matters as they liked buying their own dinners and having them cooked in the general kitchen and eating them snugly in their own parlors  and added she rightly deeming this the crowning privilege with the masters permission they can have their wives to take care of them and no harm comes of it and what more can an old man desire  it was evident enough that the good dame found herself in what she considered very rich clover and moreover had plenty of small occupations to keep her from getting rusty and dull but the veteran impressed me as deriving far less enjoyment from the monotonous ease without fear of change or hope of improvement that had followed upon thirty years of peril and vicissitude  i fancied too that while pleased with the novelty of a strangers visit he was still a little shy of becoming a spectacle for the strangers curiosity for if he chose to be morbid about the matter the establishment was but an almshouse in spite of its oldfashioned magnificence and his fine blue cloak only a paupers garment with a silver badge on it that perhaps galled his shoulder  in truth the badge and the peculiar garb though quite in accordance with the manners of the earl of leicesters age are repugnant to modern prejudices and might fitly and humanely be abolished  a year or two afterwards i paid another visit to the hospital and found a new porter established in office and already capable of talking like a guidebook about the history antiquities and present condition of the charity  he informed me that the twelve brethren are selected from among old soldiers of good character whose other resources must not exceed an income of five pounds thus excluding all commissioned officers whose halfpay would of course be more than that amount  they receive from the hospital an annuity of eighty pounds each besides their apartments a garment of fine blue cloth an annual abundance of ale and a privilege at the kitchenfire so that considering the class from which they are taken they may well reckon themselves among the fortunate of the earth furthermore they are invested with political rights acquiring a vote for member of parliament in virtue either of their income or brotherhood on the other hand as regards their personal freedom or conduct they are subject to a supervision which the master of the hospital might render extremely annoying were he so inclined but the military restraint under which they have spent the active portion of their lives makes it easier for them to endure the domestic discipline here imposed upon their age the porter bore his testimony whatever were its value to their being as contented and happy as such a set of old people could possibly be and affirmed that they spent much time in burnishing their silver badges and were as proud of them as a nobleman of his star  these badges by the by except one that was stolen and replaced in queen annes time are the very same that decorated the original twelve brethren  i have seldom met with a better guide than my friend the porter  he appeared to take a genuine interest in the peculiarities of the establishment and yet had an existence apart from them so that he could the better estimate what those peculiarities were  to be sure his knowledge and observation were confined to external things but so far had a sufficiently extensive scope  he led me up the staircase and exhibited portions of the timber framework of the edifice that are reckoned to be eight or nine hundred years old and are still neither wormeaten nor decayed and traced out what had been a great hall in the days of the catholic fraternity though its area is now filled up with the apartments of the twelve brethren and pointed to ornaments of sculptured oak done in an ancient religious style of art but hardly visible amid the vaulted dimness of the roof  thence we went to the chapelthe gothic church which i noted several pages backsurmounting the gateway that stretches half across the street  here the brethren attend daily prayer and have each a prayerbook of the finest paper with a fair large type for their old eyes  the interior of the chapel is very plain with a picture of no merit for an altarpiece and a single old pane of painted glass in the great eastern window representingno saint nor angel as is customary in such casesbut that grim sinner the earl of leicester  nevertheless amid so many tangible proofs of his human sympathy one comes to doubt whether the earl could have been such a hardened reprobate after all  we ascended the tower of the chapel and looked down between its battlements into the street a hundred feet below us while clambering halfway up were foxgloveflowers weeds small shrubs and tufts of grass that had rooted themselves into the roughnesses of the stone foundation  far around us lay a rich and lovely english landscape with many a churchspire and noble countryseat and several objects of high historic interest  edge hill where the puritans defeated charles i is in sight on the edge of the horizon and much nearer stands the house where cromwell lodged on the night before the battle  right under our eyes and half enveloping the town with its highshouldering wall so that all the closely compacted streets seemed but a precinct of the estate was the earl of warwicks delightful park a wide extent of sunny lawns interspersed with broad contiguities of forestshade  some of the cedars of lebanon were therea growth of trees in which the warwick family take an hereditary pride  the two highest towers of the castle heave themselves up out of a mass of foliage and look down in a lordly manner upon the plebeian roofs of the town a part of which are slatecovered these are the modern houses and a part are coated with old red tiles denoting the more ancient edifices  a hundred and sixty or seventy years ago a great fire destroyed a considerable portion of the town and doubtless annihilated many structures of a remote antiquity at least there was a possibility of very old houses in the long past of warwick which king cymbeline is said to have founded in the year one of the christian era  and this historic fact or poetic fiction whichever it may be brings to mind a more indestructible reality than anything else that has occurred within the present field of our vision though this includes the scene of guy of warwicks legendary exploits and some of those of the round table to say nothing of the battle of edge hill  for perhaps it was in the landscape now under our eyes that posthumus wandered with the kings daughter the sweet chaste faithful and courageous imogen the tenderest and womanliest woman that shakespeare ever made immortal in the world  the silver avon which we see flowing so quietly by the gray castle may have held their images in its bosom  the day though it began brightly had long been overcast and the clouds now spat down a few spiteful drops upon us besides that the eastwind was very chill so we descended the winding towerstair and went next into the garden one side of which is shut in by almost the only remaining portion of the old citywall  a part of the gardenground is devoted to grass and shrubbery and permeated by gravelwalks in the centre of one of which is a beautiful stone vase of egyptian sculpture that formerly stood on the top of a nilometer or graduated pillar for measuring the rise and fall of the river nile  on the pedestal is a latin inscription by dr parr who his vicarage of hatton being so close at hand was probably often the masters guest and smoked his interminable pipe along these gardenwalks  of the vegetablegarden which lies adjacent the lions share is appropriated to the master and twelve small separate patches to the individual brethren who cultivate them at their own judgment and by their own labor and their beans and cauliflowers have a better flavor i doubt not than if they had received them directly from the dead hand of the earl of leicester like the rest of their food  in the farther part of the garden is an arbor for the old mens pleasure and convenience and i should like well to sit down among them there and find out what is really the bitter and the sweet of such a sort of life  as for the old gentlemen themselves they put me queerly in mind of the salem customhouse and the venerable personages whom i found so quietly at anchor there  the masters residence forming one entire side of the quadrangle fronts on the garden and wears an aspect at once stately and homely  it can hardly have undergone any perceptible change within three centuries but the garden into which its old windows look has probably put off a great many eccentricities and quaintnesses in the way of cunningly clipped shrubbery since the gardener of queen elizabeths reign threw down his rusty shears and took his departure  the present masters name is harris he is a descendant of the founders family a gentleman of independent fortune and a clergyman of the established church as the regulations of the hospital require him to be  i know not what are his official emoluments but according to an english precedent an ancient charitable fund is certain to be held directly for the behoof of those who administer it and perhaps incidentally in a moderate way for the nominal beneficiaries and in the case before us the twelve brethren being so comfortably provided for the master is likely to be at least as comfortable as all the twelve together  yet i ought not even in a distant land to fling an idle gibe against a gentleman of whom i really know nothing except that the people under his charge bear all possible tokens of being tended and cared for as sedulously as if each of them sat by a warm fireside of his own with a daughter bustling round the hearth to make ready his porridge and his titbits  it is delightful to think of the good life which a suitable man in the masters position has an opportunity to leadlinked to timehonored customs welded in with an ancient system never dreaming of radical change and bringing all the mellowness and richness of the past down into these railwaydays which do not compel him or his community to move a whit quicker than of yore everybody can appreciate the advantages of going ahead it might be well sometimes to think whether there is not a word or two to be said in favor of standing still or going to sleep  from the garden we went into the kitchen where the fire was burning hospitably and diffused a genial warmth far and wide together with the fragrance of some old english roastbeef which i think must at that moment have been done nearly to a turn  the kitchen is a lofty spacious and noble room partitioned off round the fireplace by a sort of semicircular oaken screen or rather an arrangement of heavy and highbacked settles with an everopen entrance between them on either side of which is the omnipresent image of the bear and ragged staff three feet high and excellently carved in oak now black with time and unctuous kitchensmoke  the ponderous mantelpiece likewise of carved oak towers high towards the dusky ceiling and extends its mighty breadth to take in a vast area of hearth the arch of the fireplace being positively so immense that i could compare it to nothing but the city gateway  above its cavernous opening were crossed two ancient halberds the weapons possibly of soldiers who had fought under leicester in the low countries and elsewhere on the walls were displayed several muskets which some of the present inmates of the hospital may have levelled against the french  another ornament of the mantelpiece was a square of silken needlework or embroidery faded nearly white but dimly representing that wearisome bear and ragged staff which we should hardly look twice at only that it was wrought by the fair fingers of poor amy robsart and beautifully framed in oak from kenilworth castle at the expense of a mr conner a countryman of our own  certainly no englishman would be capable of this little bit of enthusiasm  finally the kitchenfirelight glistens on a splendid display of copper flagons all of generous capacity and one of them about as big as a halfbarrel the smaller vessels contain the customary allowance of ale and the larger one is filled with that foaming liquor on four festive occasions of the year and emptied amain by the jolly brotherhood  i should be glad to see them do it but it would be an exploit fitter for queen elizabeths age than these degenerate times  the kitchen is the social hall of the twelve brethren  in the daytime they bring their little messes to be cooked here and eat them in their own parlors but after a certain hour the great hearth is cleared and swept and the old men assemble round its blaze each with his tankard and his pipe and hold high converse through the evening  if the master be a fit man for his office methinks he will sometimes sit down sociably among them for there is an elbowchair by the fireside which it would not demean his dignity to fill since it was occupied by king james at the great festival of nearly three centuries ago  a sip of the ale and a whiff of the tobaccopipe would put him in friendly relations with his venerable household and then we can fancy him instructing them by pithy apothegms and religious texts which were first uttered here by some catholic priest and have impregnated the atmosphere ever since  if a joke goes round it shall be of an elder coinage than joe millers as old as lord bacons collection or as the jestbook that master slender asked for when he lacked smalltalk for sweet anne page  no news shall be spoken of later than the drifting ashore on the northern coast of some sternpost or figurehead a barnacled fragment of one of the great galleons of the spanish armada  what a tremor would pass through the antique group if a damp newspaper should suddenly be spread to dry before the fire  they would feel as if either that printed sheet or they themselves must be an unreality  what a mysterious awe if the shriek of the railwaytrain as it reaches the warwick station should ever so faintly invade their ears  movement of any kind seems inconsistent with the stability of such an institution  nevertheless i trust that the ages will carry it along with them because it is such a pleasant kind of dream for an american to find his way thither and behold a piece of the sixteenth century set into our prosaic times and then to depart and think of its arched doorway as a spellguarded entrance which will never be accessible or visible to him any more  not far from the marketplace of warwick stands the great church of st marys a vast edifice indeed and almost worthy to be a cathedral people who pretend to skill in such matters say that it is in a poor style of architecture though designed or at least extensively restored by sir christopher wren but i thought it very striking with its wide high and elaborate windows its tall towers its immense length and for it was long before i outgrew this americanism the love of an old thing merely for the sake of its age the tinge of gray antiquity over the whole  once while i stood gazing up at the tower the clock struck twelve with a very deep intonation and immediately some chivies began to play and kept up their resounding music for five minutes as measured by the hand upon the dial  it was a very delightful harmony as airy as the notes of birds and seemed a not unbecoming freak of halfsportive fancy in the huge ancient and solemn church although i have seen an oldfashioned parlorclock that did precisely the same thing in its small way  the great attraction of this edifice is the beauchamp or as the english who delight in vulgarizing their fine old norman names call it the beechum chapel where the earls of warwick and their kindred have been buried from four hundred years back till within a recent period it is a stately and very elaborate chapel with a large window of ancient painted glass as perfectly preserved as any that i remember seeing in england and remarkably vivid in its colors  here are several monuments with marble figures recumbent upon them representing the earls in their knightly armor and their dames in the ruffs and courtfinery of their day looking hardly stiffer in stone than they must needs have been in their starched linen and embroidery  the renowned earl of leicester of queen elizabeths time the benefactor of the hospital reclines at full length on the tablet of one of these tombs side by side with his countessnot amy robsart but a lady who unless i have confused the story with some other mouldy scandal is said to have avenged poor amys murder by poisoning the earl himself  be that as it may both figures and especially the earl look like the very types of ancient honor and conjugal faith  in consideration of his longenduring kindness to the twelve brethren i cannot consent to believe him as wicked as he is usually depicted and it seems a marvel now that so many wellestablished historical verdicts have been reversed why some enterprising writer does not make out leicester to have been the pattern nobleman of his age  in the centre of the chapel is the magnificent memorial of its founder richard beauchamp earl of warwick in the time of henry vi  on a richly ornamented altartomb of gray marble lies the bronze figure of a knight in gilded armor most admirably executed for the sculptors of those days had wonderful skill in their own style and could make so lifelike an image of a warrior in brass or marble that if a trumpet were sounded over his tomb you would expect him to start up and handle his sword the earl whom we now speak of however has slept soundly in spite of a more serious disturbance than any blast of a trumpet unless it were the final one  some centuries after his death the floor of the chapel fell down and broke open the stone coffin in which he was buried and among the fragments appeared the anciently entombed earl of warwick with the color scarcely faded out of his cheeks his eyes a little sunken but in other respects looking as natural as if he had died yesterday  but exposure to the atmosphere appeared to begin and finish the longdelayed process of decay in a moment causing him to vanish like a bubble so that almost before there had been time to wonder at him there was nothing left of the stalwart earl save his hair  this sole relic the ladies of warwick made prize of and braided it into rings and brooches for their own adornment and thus with a chapel and a ponderous tomb built on purpose to protect his remains this great nobleman could not help being brought untimely to the light of day nor even keep his lovelocks on his skull after he had so long done with love  there seems to be a fatality that disturbs people in their sepulchres when they have been overcareful to render them magnificent and impregnableas witness the builders of the pyramids and hadrian augustus and the scipios and most other personages whose mausoleums have been conspicuous enough to attract the violator and as for dead mens hair i have seen a lock of king edward the fourths of a reddishbrown color which perhaps was once twisted round the delicate forefinger of mistress shore  the direct lineage of the renowned characters that lie buried in this splendid chapel has long been extinct  the earldom is now held by the grevilles descendants of the lord brooke who was slain in the parliamentary war and they have recently that is to say within a century built a burialvault on the other side of the church calculated as the sexton assured me with a nod as if he were pleased to afford suitable and respectful accommodation to as many as fourscore coffins thank heaven the old man did not call them casketsa vile modern phrase which compels a person of sense and good taste to shrink more disgustfully than ever before from the idea of being buried at all  but as regards those eighty coffins only sixteen have as yet been contributed and it may be a question with some minds not merely whether the grevilles will hold the earldom of warwick until the full number shall be made up but whether earldoms and all manner of lordships will not have faded out of england long before those many generations shall have passed from the castle to the vault  i hope not  a titled and landed aristocracy if anywise an evil and an encumbrance is so only to the nation which is doomed to bear it on its shoulders and an american whose sole relation to it is to admire its picturesque effect upon society ought to be the last man to quarrel with what affords him so much gratuitous enjoyment  nevertheless conservative as england is and though i scarce ever found an englishman who seemed really to desire change there was continually a dull sound in my ears as if the old foundations of things were crumbling away  some time or otherby no irreverent effort of violence but rather in spite of all pious efforts to uphold a heterogeneous pile of institutions that will have outlasted their vitalityat some unexpected moment there must come a terrible crash  the sole reason why i should desire it to happen in my day is that i might be there to see  but the ruin of my own country is perhaps all that i am destined to witness and that immense catastrophe though i am strong in the faith that there is a national lifetime of a thousand years in us yet would serve any man well enough as his final spectacle on earth  if the visitor is inclined to carry away any little memorial of warwick he had better go to an old curiosity shop in the high street where there is a vast quantity of obsolete gewgaws great and small and many of them so pretty and ingenious that you wonder how they came to be thrown aside and forgotten  as regards its minor tastes the world changes but does not improve it appears to me indeed that there have been epochs of far more exquisite fancy than the present one in matters of personal ornament and such delicate trifles as we put upon a drawingroom table a mantelpiece or a whatnot  the shop in question is near the east gate but is hardly to be found without careful search being denoted only by the name of redfern painted not very conspicuously in the toplight of the door  immediately on entering we find ourselves among a confusion of old rubbish and valuables ancient armor historic portraits ebony cabinets inlaid with pearl tall ghostly clocks hideous old china dim lookingglasses in frames of tarnished magnificencea thousand objects of strange aspect and others that almost frighten you by their likeness in unlikeness to things now in use it is impossible to give an idea of the variety of articles so thickly strewn about that we can scarcely move without overthrowing some great curiosity with a crash or sweeping away some small one hitched to our sleeves  three stories of the entire house are crowded in like manner the collection even as we see it exposed to view must have been got together at great cost but the real treasures of the establishment lie in secret repositories whence they are not likely to be drawn forth at an ordinary summons though if a gentleman with a competently long purse should call for them i doubt not that the signetring of josephs friend pharaoh or the duke of alvas leadingstaff or the dagger that killed the duke of buckingham all of which i have seen or any other almost incredible thing might make its appearance  gold snuffboxes antique gems jewelled goblets venetian wineglasses which burst when poison is poured into them and therefore must not be used for modern winedrinking jasperhandled knives painted sevres teacupsin short there are all sorts of things that a virtuoso ransacks the world to discover  it would be easier to spend a hundred pounds in mr redferns shop than to keep the money in ones pocket but for my part i contented myself with buying a little old spoon of silvergilt and fantastically shaped and got it at all the more reasonable rate because there happened to be no legend attached to it  i could supply any deficiency of that kind at much less expense than regilding the spoon     recollections of a gifted woman   from leamington to stratfordonavon the distance is eight or nine miles over a road that seemed to me most beautiful  not that i can recall any memorable peculiarities for the country most of the way is a succession of the gentlest swells and subsidences affording wide and far glimpses of champaign scenery here and there and sinking almost to a dead level as we draw near stratford  any landscape in new england even the tamest has a more striking outline and besides would have its blue eyes open in those lakelets that we encounter almost from mile to mile at home but of which the old country is utterly destitute or it would smile in our faces through the medium of the wayside brooks that vanish under a low stone arch on one side of the road and sparkle out again on the other  neither of these pretty features is often to be found in an english scene  the charm of the latter consists in the rich verdure of the fields in the stately wayside trees and carefully kept plantations of wood and in the old and high cultivation that has humanized the very sods by mingling so much of mans toil and care among them  to an american there is a kind of sanctity even in an english turnipfield when he thinks how long that small square of ground has been known and recognized as a possession transmitted from father to son trodden often by memorable feet and utterly redeemed from savagery by old acquaintanceship with civilized eyes  the wildest things in england are more than half tame  the trees for instance whether in hedgerow park or what they call forest have nothing wild about them  they are never ragged there is a certain decorous restraint in the freest outspread of their branches though they spread wider than any selfnurturing tree they are tall vigorous bulky with a look of agelong life and a promise of more years to come all of which will bring them into closer kindred with the race of man  somebody or other has known them from the sapling upward and if they endure long enough they grow to be traditionally observed and honored and connected with the fortunes of old families till like tennysons talking oak they babble with a thousand leafy tongues to ears that can understand them  an american tree however if it could grow in fair competition with an english one of similar species would probably be the more picturesque object of the two  the warwickshire elm has not so beautiful a shape as those that overhang our village street and as for the redoubtable english oak there is a certain john bullism in its figure a compact rotundity of foliage a lack of irregular and various outline that make it look wonderfully like a gigantic cauliflower  its leaf too is much smaller than that of most varieties of american oak nor do i mean to doubt that the latter with free leave to grow reverent care and cultivation and immunity from the axe would live out its centuries as sturdily as its english brother and prove far the nobler and more majestic specimen of a tree at the end of them  still however ones yankee patriotism may struggle against the admission it must be owned that the trees and other objects of an english landscape take hold of the observer by numberless minute tendrils as it were which look as closely as we choose we never find in an american scene  the parasitic growth is so luxuriant that the trunk of the tree so gray and dry in our climate is better worth observing than the boughs and foliage a verdant messiness coats it all over so that it looks almost as green as the leaves and often moreover the stately stem is clustered about high upward with creeping and twining shrubs the ivy and sometimes the mistletoe closeclinging friends nurtured by the moisture and never too fervid sunshine and supporting themselves by the old trees abundant strength  we call it a parasitical vegetation but if the phrase imply any reproach it is unkind to bestow it on this beautiful affection and relationship which exist in england between one order of plants and another the strong tree being always ready to give support to the trailing shrub lift it to the sun and feed it out of its own heart if it crave such food and the shrub on its part repaying its fosterfather with an ample luxuriance of beauty and adding corinthian grace to the trees lofty strength  no bitter winter nips these tender little sympathies no hot sun burns the life out of them and therefore they outlast the longevity of the oak and if the woodman permitted would bury it in a green grave when all is over  should there be nothing else along the road to look at an english hedge might well suffice to occupy the eyes and to a depth beyond what he would suppose the heart of an american  we often set out hedges in our own soil but might as well set out figs or pineapples and expect to gather fruit of them  something grows to be sure which we choose to call a hedge but it lacks the dense luxuriant variety of vegetation that is accumulated into the english original in which a botanist would find a thousand shrubs and gracious herbs that the hedgemaker never thought of planting there  among them growing wild are many of the kindred blossoms of the very flowers which our pilgrim fathers brought from england for the sake of their simple beauty and homelike associations and which we have ever since been cultivating in gardens there is not a softer trait to be found in the character of those stern men than that they should have been sensible of these flowerroots clinging among the fibres of their rugged hearts and have felt the necessity of bringing them over sea and making them hereditary in the new land instead of trusting to what rarer beauty the wilderness might have in store for them  or if the roadside has no hedge the ugliest stone fence such as in america would keep itself bare and unsympathizing till the end of time is sure to be covered with the small handiwork of nature that careful mother lets nothing go naked there and if she cannot provide clothing gives at least embroidery  no sooner is the fence built than she adopts and adorns it as a part of her original plan treating the hard uncomely construction as if it had all along been a favorite idea of her own  a little sprig of ivy may be seen creeping up the side of the low wall and clinging fast with its many feet to the rough surface a tuft of grass roots itself between two of the stones where a pinch or two of wayside dust has been moistened into nutritious soil for it a small bunch of fern grows in another crevice a deep soft verdant moss spreads itself along the top and over all the available inequalities of the fence and where nothing else will grow lichens stick tenaciously to the bare stones and variegate the monotonous gray with hues of yellow and red finally a great deal of shrubbery clusters along the base of the stone wall and takes away the hardness of its outline and in due time as the upshot of these apparently aimless or sportive touches we recognize that the beneficent creator of all things working through his handmaiden whom we call nature has deigned to mingle a charm of divine gracefulness even with so earthly an institution as a boundary fence  the clown who wrought at it little dreamed what fellowlaborer he had  the english should send us photographs of portions of the trunks of trees the tangled and various products of a hedge and a square foot of an old wall  they can hardly send anything else so characteristic their artists especially of the later school sometimes toil to depict such subjects but are apt to stiffen the lithe tendrils in the process the poets succeed better with tennyson at their head and often produce ravishing effects by dint of a tender minuteness of touch to which the genius of the soil and climate artfully impels them for as regards grandeur there are loftier scenes in many countries than the best that england can show but for the picturesqueness of the smallest object that lies under its gentle gloom and sunshine there is no scenery like it anywhere  in the foregoing paragraphs i have strayed away to a long distance from the road to stratfordonavon for i remember no such stone fences as i have been speaking of in warwickshire nor elsewhere in england except among the lakes or in yorkshire and the rough and hilly countries to the north of it  hedges there were along my road however and broad level fields rustic hamlets and cottages of ancient datefrom the roof of one of which the occupant was tearing away the thatch and showing what an accumulation of dust dirt mouldiness roots of weeds families of mice swallows nests and hordes of insects had been deposited there since that old straw was new  estimating its antiquity from these tokens shakespeare himself in one of his morning rambles out of his native town might have seen the thatch laid on at all events the cottagewalls were old enough to have known him as a guest  a few modern villas were also to be seen and perhaps there were mansions of old gentility at no great distance but hidden among trees for it is a point of english pride that such houses seldom allow themselves to be visible from the highroad  in short i recollect nothing specially remarkable along the way nor in the immediate approach to stratford and yet the picture of that june morning has a glory in my memory owing chiefly i believe to the charm of the english summerweather the really good days of which are the most delightful that mortal man can ever hope to be favored with  such a genial warmth  a little too warm it might be yet only to such a degree as to assure an american a certainty to which he seldom attains till attempered to the customary austerity of an english summerday that he was quite warm enough  and after all there was an unconquerable freshness in the atmosphere which every little movement of a breeze shook over me like a dash of the oceanspray  such days need bring us no other happiness than their own light and temperature  no doubt i could not have enjoyed it so exquisitely except that there must be still latent in us western wanderers even after an absence of two centuries and more an adaptation to the english climate which makes us sensible of a motherly kindness in its scantiest sunshine and overflows us with delight at its more lavish smiles  the spire of shakespeares churchthe church of the holy trinitybegins to show itself among the trees at a little distance from stratford  next we see the shabby old dwellings intermixed with meanlooking houses of modern date and the streets being quite level you are struck and surprised by nothing so much as the tameness of the general scene as if shakespeares genius were vivid enough to have wrought pictorial splendors in the town where he was born  here and there however a queer edifice meets your eye endowed with the individuality that belongs only to the domestic architecture of times gone by the house seems to have grown out of some odd quality in its inhabitant as a seashell is moulded from within by the character of its innate and having been built in a strange fashion generations ago it has ever since been growing stranger and quainter as old humorists are apt to do  here too as so often impressed me in decayed english towns there appeared to be a greater abundance of aged people wearing smallclothes and leaning on sticks than you could assemble on our side of the water by sounding a trumpet and proclaiming a reward for the most venerable  i tried to account for this phenomenon by several theories as for example that our new towns are unwholesome for age and kill it off unseasonably or that our old men have a subtile sense of fitness and die of their own accord rather than live in an unseemly contrast with youth and novelty but the secret may be after all that hairdyes false teeth modern arts of dress and other contrivances of a skindeep youthfulness have not crept into these antiquated english towns and so people grow old without the weary necessity of seeming younger than they are  after wandering through two or three streets i found my way to shakespeares birthplace which is almost a smaller and humbler house than any description can prepare the visitor to expect so inevitably does an august inhabitant make his abode palatial to our imaginations receiving his guests indeed in a castle in the air until we unwisely insist on meeting him among the sordid lanes and alleys of lower earth the portion of the edifice with which shakespeare had anything to do is hardly large enough in the basement to contain the butchers stall that one of his descendants kept and that still remains there windowless with the cleavercuts in its hacked counter which projects into the street under a little penthouseroof as if waiting for a new occupant  the upper half of the door was open and on my rapping at it a young person in black made her appearance and admitted me she was not a menial but remarkably genteel an american characteristic for an english girl and was probably the daughter of the old gentlewoman who takes care of the house  this lower room has a pavement of gray slabs of stone which may have been rudely squared when the house was new but are now all cracked broken and disarranged in a most unaccountable way one does not see how any ordinary usage for whatever length of time should have so smashed these heavy stones it is as if an earthquake had burst up through the floor which afterwards had been imperfectly trodden down again  the room is whitewashed and very clean but wofully shabby and dingy coarsely built and such as the most poetical imagination would find it difficult to idealize  in the rear of this apartment is the kitchen a still smaller room of a similar rude aspect it has a great rough fireplace with space for a large family under the blackened opening of the chimney and an immense passageway for the smoke through which shakespeare may have seen the blue sky by day and the stars glimmering down at him by night  it is now a dreary spot where the longextinguished embers used to be  a glowing fire even if it covered only a quarter part of the hearth might still do much towards making the old kitchen cheerful  but we get a depressing idea of the stifled poor sombre kind of life that could have been lived in such a dwelling where this room seems to have been the gatheringplace of the family with no breadth or scope no good retirement but old and young huddling together cheek by jowl  what a hardy plant was shakespeares genius how fatal its development since it could not be blighted in such an atmosphere it only brought human nature the closer to him and put more unctuous earth about his roots  thence i was ushered up stairs to the room in which shakespeare is supposed to have been born though if you peep too curiously into the matter you may find the shadow of an ugly doubt on this as well as most other points of his mysterious life  it is the chamber over the butchers shop and is lighted by one broad window containing a great many small irregular panes of glass  the floor is made of planks very rudely hewn and fitting together with little neatness the naked beams and rafters at the sides of the room and overhead bear the original marks of the builders broadaxe with no evidence of an attempt to smooth off the job  again we have to reconcile ourselves to the smallness of the space enclosed by these illustrious wallsa circumstance more difficult to accept as regards places that we have heard read thought and dreamed much about than any other disenchanting particular of a mistaken ideal  a few pacesperhaps seven or eighttake us from end to end of it  so low it is that i could easily touch the ceiling and might have done so without a tiptoestretch had it been a good deal higher and this humility of the chamber has tempted a vast multitude of people to write their names overhead in pencil  every inch of the sidewalls even into the obscurest nooks and corners is covered with a similar record all the windowpanes moreover are scrawled with diamond signatures among which is said to be that of walter scott but so many persons have sought to immortalize themselves in close vicinity to his name that i really could not trace him out  methinks it is strange that people do not strive to forget their forlorn little identities in such situations instead of thrusting them forward into the dazzle of a great renown where if noticed they cannot but be deemed impertinent  this room and the entire house so far as i saw it are whitewashed and exceedingly clean nor is there the aged musty smell with which old chester first made me acquainted and which goes far to cure an american of his excessive predilection for antique residences  an old lady who took charge of me up stairs had the manners and aspect of a gentlewoman and talked with somewhat formidable knowledge and appreciative intelligence about shakespeare  arranged on a table and in chairs were various prints views of houses and scenes connected with shakespeares memory together with editions of his works and local publications about his home and haunts from the sale of which this respectable lady perhaps realizes a handsome profit  at any rate i bought a good many of them conceiving that it might be the civillest way of requiting her for her instructive conversation and the trouble she took in showing me the house  it cost me a pang not a curmudgeonly but a gentlemanly one to offer a downright fee to the ladylike girl who had admitted me but i swallowed my delicate scruples with some little difficulty and she digested hers so far as i could observe with no difficulty at all  in fact nobody need fear to hold out half a crown to any person with whom he has occasion to speak a word in england  i should consider it unfair to quit shakespeares house without the frank acknowledgment that i was conscious of not the slightest emotion while viewing it nor any quickening of the imagination  this has often happened to me in my visits to memorable places  whatever pretty and apposite reflections i may have made upon the subject had either occurred to me before i ever saw stratford or have been elaborated since  it is pleasant nevertheless to think that i have seen the place and i believe that i can form a more sensible and vivid idea of shakespeare as a fleshandblood individual now that i have stood on the kitchenhearth and in the birthchamber but i am not quite certain that this power of realization is altogether desirable in reference to a great poet  the shakespeare whom i met there took various guises but had not his laurel on  he was successively the roguish boythe youthful deerstealer the comrade of playersthe too familiar friend of davenants mother the careful thrifty thriven man of property who came back from london to lend money on bond and occupy the best house in stratfordthe mellow rednosed autumnal booncompanion of john a combeand finally or else the stratford gossips belied him the victim of convivial habits who met his death by tumbling into a ditch on his way home from a drinkingbout and left his secondbest bed to his poor wife  i feel as sensibly as the reader can what horrible impiety it is to remember these things be they true or false  in either case they ought to vanish out of sight on the distant oceanline of the past leaving a pure white memory even as a sail though perhaps darkened with many stains looks snowy white on the far horizon  but i draw a moral from these unworthy reminiscences and this embodiment of the poet as suggested by some of the grimy actualities of his life  it is for the high interests of the world not to insist upon finding out that its greatest men are in a certain lower sense very much the same kind of men as the rest of us and often a little worse because a common mind cannot properly digest such a discovery nor ever know the true proportion of the great mans good and evil nor how small a part of him it was that touched our muddy or dusty earth  thence comes moral bewilderment and even intellectual loss in regard to what is best of him  when shakespeare invoked a curse on the man who should stir his bones he perhaps meant the larger share of it for him or them who should pry into his perishing earthliness the defects or even the merits of the character that he wore in stratford when he had left mankind so much to muse upon that was imperishable and divine  heaven keep me from incurring any part of the anathema in requital for the irreverent sentences above written  from shakespeares house the next step of course is to visit his burialplace  the appearance of the church is most venerable and beautiful standing amid a great green shadow of limetrees above which rises the spire while the gothic battlements and buttresses and vast arched windows are obscurely seen through the boughs  the avon loiters past the churchyard an exceedingly sluggish river which might seem to have been considering which way it should flow ever since shakespeare left off paddling in it and gathering the large forgetmenots that grow among its flags and waterweeds  an old man in smallclothes was waiting at the gate and inquiring whether i wished to go in he preceded me to the churchporch and rapped  i could have done it quite as effectually for myself but it seems the old people of the neighborhood haunt about the churchyard in spite of the frowns and remonstrances of the sexton who grudges them the halfeleemosynary sixpence which they sometimes get from visitors  i was admitted into the church by a respectablelooking and intelligent man in black the parishclerk i suppose and probably holding a richer incumbency than his vicar if all the fees which he handles remain in his own pocket  he was already exhibiting the shakespeare monuments to two or three visitors and several other parties came in while i was there  the poet and his family are in possession of what may be considered the very best burialplaces that the church affords  they lie in a row right across the breadth of the chancel the foot of each gravestone being close to the elevated floor on which the altar stands  nearest to the sidewall beneath shakespeares bust is a slab bearing a latin inscription addressed to his wife and covering her remains then his own slab with the old anathematizing stanza upon it then that of thomas nash who married his granddaughter then that of dr hall the husband of his daughter susannah and lastly susannahs own  shakespeares is the commonestlooking slab of all being just such a flagstone as essex street in salem used to be paved with when i was a boy  moreover unless my eyes or recollection deceive me there is a crack across it as if it had already undergone some such violence as the inscription deprecates  unlike the other monuments of the family it bears no name nor am i acquainted with the grounds or authority on which it is absolutely determined to be shakespeares although being in a range with those of his wife and children it might naturally be attributed to him  but then why does his wife who died afterwards take precedence of him and occupy the place next his bust  and where are the graves of another daughter and a son who have a better right in the family row than thomas nash his grandsoninlaw  might not one or both of them have been laid under the nameless stone  but it is dangerous trifling with shakespeares dust so i forbear to meddle further with the grave though the prohibition makes it tempting and shall let whatever bones be in it rest in peace  yet i must needs add that the inscription on the bust seems to imply that shakespeares grave was directly underneath it  the poets bust is affixed to the northern wall of the church the base of it being about a mans height or rather more above the floor of the chancel  the features of this piece of sculpture are entirely unlike any portrait of shakespeare that i have ever seen and compel me to take down the beautiful loftybrowed and noble picture of him which has hitherto hung in my mental portraitgallery  the bust cannot be said to represent a beautiful face or an eminently noble head but it clutches firmly hold of ones sense of reality and insists upon your accepting it if not as shakespeare the poet yet as the wealthy burgher of stratford the friend of john a combe who lies yonder in the corner  i know not what the phrenologists say to the bust  the forehead is but moderately developed and retreats somewhat the upper part of the skull rising pyramidally the eyes are prominent almost beyond the penthouse of the brow the upper lip is so long that it must have been almost a deformity unless the sculptor artistically exaggerated its length in consideration that on the pedestal it must be foreshortened by being looked at from below  on the whole shakespeare must have had a singular rather than a prepossessing face and it is wonderful how with this bust before its eyes the world has persisted in maintaining an erroneous notion of his appearance allowing painters and sculptors to foist their idealized nonsense on its all instead of the genuine man  for my part the shakespeare of my minds eye is henceforth to be a personage of a ruddy english complexion with a reasonably capacious brow intelligent and quickly observant eyes a nose curved slightly outward a long queer upper lip with the mouth a little unclosed beneath it and cheeks considerably developed in the lower part and beneath the chin  but when shakespeare was himself for nine tenths of the time according to all appearances he was but the burgher of stratford he doubtless shone through this dull mask and transfigured it into the face of an angel  fifteen or twenty feet behind the row of shakespeare gravestones is the great eastwindow of the church now brilliant with stained glass of recent manufacture  on one side of this window under a sculptured arch of marble lies a fulllength marble figure of john a combe clad in what i take to be a robe of municipal dignity and holding its hands devoutly clasped  it is a sturdy english figure with coarse features a type of ordinary man whom we smile to see immortalized in the sculpturesque material of poets and heroes but the prayerful attitude encourages us to believe that the old usurer may not after all have had that grim reception in the other world which shakespeares squib foreboded for him  by the by till i grew somewhat familiar with warwickshire pronunciation i never understood that the point of those illnatured lines was a pun  oho quoth the devil t is my john a combethat is my john has come  close to the poets bust is a nameless oblong cubic tomb supposed to be that of a clerical dignitary of the fourteenth century  the church has other mural monuments and altartombs one or two of the latter upholding the recumbent figures of knights in armor and their dames very eminent and worshipful personages in their day no doubt but doomed to appear forever intrusive and impertinent within the precincts which shakespeare has made his own  his renown is tyrannous and suffers nothing else to be recognized within the scope of its material presence unless illuminated by some sideray from himself  the clerk informed me that interments no longer take place in any part of the church  and it is better so for methinks a person of delicate individuality curious about his burialplace and desirous of six feet of earth for himself alone could never endure to be buried near shakespeare but would rise up at midnight and grope his way out of the churchdoor rather than sleep in the shadow of so stupendous a memory  i should hardly have dared to add another to the innumerable descriptions of stratfordonavon if it had not seemed to me that this would form a fitting framework to some reminiscences of a very remarkable woman  her labor while she lived was of a nature and purpose outwardly irreverent to the name of shakespeare yet by its actual tendency entitling her to the distinction of being that one of all his worshippers who sought though she knew it not to place the richest and stateliest diadem upon his brow  we americans at least in the scanty annals of our literature cannot afford to forget her high and conscientious exercise of noble faculties which indeed if you look at the matter in one way evolved only a miserable error but more fairly considered produced a result worth almost what it cost her  her faith in her own ideas was so genuine that erroneous as they were it transmuted them to gold or at all events interfused a large proportion of that precious and indestructible substance among the waste material from which it can readily be sifted  the only time i ever saw miss bacon was in london where she had lodgings in spring street sussex gardens at the house of a grocer a portly middleaged civil and friendly man who as well as his wife appeared to feel a personal kindness towards their lodger  i was ushered up two and i rather believe three pair of stairs into a parlor somewhat humbly furnished and told that miss bacon would come soon  there were a number of books on the table and looking into them i found that every one had some reference more or less immediate to her shakespearian theorya volume of raleighs history of the world a volume of montaigne a volume of lord bacons letters a volume of shakespeares plays and on another table lay a large roll of manuscript which i presume to have been a portion of her work  to be sure there was a pocketbible among the books but everything else referred to the one despotic idea that had got possession of her mind and as it had engrossed her whole soul as well as her intellect i have no doubt that she had established subtile connections between it and the bible likewise  as is apt to be the case with solitary students miss bacon probably read late and rose late for i took up montaigne it was hazlitts translation and had been reading his journey to italy a good while before she appeared  i had expected the more shame for me having no other ground of such expectation than that she was a literary woman to see a very homely uncouth elderly personage and was quite agreeably disappointed by her aspect  she was rather uncommonly tall and had a striking and expressive face dark hair dark eyes which shone with an inward light as soon as she began to speak and by and by a color came into her cheeks and made her look almost young  not that she really was so she must have been beyond middle age and there was no unkindness in coming to that conclusion because making allowance for years and illhealth i could suppose her to have been handsome and exceedingly attractive once though wholly estranged from society there was little or no restraint or embarrassment in her manner lonely people are generally glad to give utterance to their pentup ideas and often bubble over with them as freely as children with their newfound syllables  i cannot tell how it came about but we immediately found ourselves taking a friendly and familiar tone together and began to talk as if we had known one another a very long while  a little preliminary correspondence had indeed smoothed the way and we had a definite topic in the contemplated publication of her book  she was very communicative about her theory and would have been much more so had i desired it but being conscious within myself of a sturdy unbelief i deemed it fair and honest rather to repress than draw her out upon the subject  unquestionably she was a monomaniac these overmastering ideas about the authorship of shakespeares plays and the deep political philosophy concealed beneath the surface of them had completely thrown her off her balance but at the same time they had wonderfully developed her intellect and made her what she could not otherwise have become  it was a very singular phenomenon a system of philosophy growing up in thus womans mind without her volition contrary in fact to the determined resistance of her volitionand substituting itself in the place of everything that originally grew there  to have based such a system on fancy and unconsciously elaborated it for herself was almost as wonderful as really to have found it in the plays  but in a certain sense she did actually find it there  shakespeare has surface beneath surface to an immeasurable depth adapted to the plummetline of every reader his works present many phases of truth each with scope large enough to fill a contemplative mind  whatever you seek in him you will surely discover provided you seek truth  there is no exhausting the various interpretation of his symbols and a thousand years hence a world of new readers will possess a whole library of new books as we ourselves do in these volumes old already  i had half a mind to suggest to miss bacon this explanation of her theory but forbore because as i could readily perceive she had as princely a spirit as queen elizabeth herself and would at once have motioned me from the room  i had heard long ago that she believed that the material evidences of her dogma as to the authorship together with the key of the new philosophy would be found buried in shakespeares grave  recently as i understood her this notion had been somewhat modified and was now accurately defined and fully developed in her mind with a result of perfect certainty  in lord bacons letters on which she laid her finger as she spoke she had discovered the key and clew to the whole mystery there were definite and minute instructions how to find a will and other documents relating to the conclave of elizabethan philosophers which were concealed when and by whom she did not inform me in a hollow space in the under surface of shakespeares gravestone  thus the terrible prohibition to remove the stone was accounted for  the directions she intimated went completely and precisely to the point obviating all difficulties in the way of coming at the treasure and even if i remember right were so contrived as to ward off any troublesome consequences likely to ensue from the interference of the parishofficers  all that miss bacon now remained in england for indeed the object for which she had come hither and which had kept her here for three years pastwas to obtain possession of these material and unquestionable proofs of the authenticity of her theory  she communicated all this strange matter in a low quiet tone while on my part i listened as quietly and without any expression of dissent controversy against a faith so settled would have shut her up at once and that too without in the least weakening her belief in the existence of those treasures of the tomb and had it been possible to convince her of their intangible nature i apprehend that there would have been nothing left for the poor enthusiast save to collapse and die  she frankly confessed that she could no longer bear the society of those who did not at least lend a certain sympathy to her views if not fully share in them and meeting little sympathy or none she had now entirely secluded herself from the world  in all these years she had seen mrs farrar a few times but had long ago given her upcarlyle once or twice but not of late although he had received her kindly mr buchanan while minister in england had once called on her and general campbell our consul in london had met her two or three times on business  with these exceptions which she marked so scrupulously that it was perceptible what epochs they were in the monotonous passage of her days she had lived in the profoundest solitude  she never walked out she suffered much from illhealth and yet she assured me she was perfectly happy  i could well conceive it for miss bacon imagined herself to have received what is certainly the greatest boon ever assigned to mortals a high mission in the world with adequate powers for its accomplishment and lest even these should prove insufficient she had faith that special interpositions of providence were forwarding her human efforts  this idea was continually coming to the surface during our interview  she believed for example that she had been providentially led to her lodginghouse and put in relations with the goodnatured grocer and his family and to say the truth considering what a savage and stealthy tribe the london lodginghouse keepers usually are the honest kindness of this man and his household appeared to have been little less than miraculous  evidently too she thought that providence had brought me forwarda man somewhat connected with literatureat the critical juncture when she needed a negotiator with the booksellers and on my part though little accustomed to regard myself as a divine minister and though i might even have preferred that providence should select some other instrument i had no scruple in undertaking to do what i could for her  her book as i could see by turning it over was a very remarkable one and worthy of being offered to the public which if wise enough to appreciate it would be thankful for what was good in it and merciful to its faults  it was founded on a prodigious error but was built up from that foundation with a good many prodigious truths  and at all events whether i could aid her literary views or no it would have been both rash and impertinent in me to attempt drawing poor miss bacon out of her delusions which were the condition on which she lived in comfort and joy and in the exercise of great intellectual power  so i left her to dream as she pleased about the treasures of shakespeares tombstone and to form whatever designs might seem good to herself for obtaining possession of them  i was sensible of a ladylike feeling of propriety in miss bacon and a new england orderliness in her character and in spite of her bewilderment a sturdy commonsense which i trusted would begin to operate at the right time and keep her from any actual extravagance and as regarded this matter of the tombstone so it proved  the interview lasted above an hour during which she flowed out freely as to the sole auditor capable of any degree of intelligent sympathy whom she had met with in a very long while  her conversation was remarkably suggestive alluring forth ones own ideas and fantasies from the shy places where they usually haunt  she was indeed an admirable talker considering how long she had held her tongue for lack of a listenerpleasant sunny and shadowy often piquant and giving glimpses of all a womans various and readily changeable moods and humors and beneath them all there ran a deep and powerful undercurrent of earnestness which did not fail to produce in the listeners mind something like a temporary faith in what she herself believed so fervently  but the streets of london are not favorable to enthusiasms of this kind nor in fact are they likely to flourish anywhere in the english atmosphere so that long before reaching paternoster row i felt that it would be a difficult and doubtful matter to advocate the publication of miss bacons book  nevertheless it did finally get published  months before that happened however miss bacon had taken up her residence at stratfordonavon drawn thither by the magnetism of those rich secrets which she supposed to have been hidden by raleigh or bacon or i know not whom in shakespeares grave and protected there by a curse as pirates used to bury their gold in the guardianship of a fiend she took a humble lodging and began to haunt the church like a ghost but she did not condescend to any stratagem or underhand attempt to violate the grave which had she been capable of admitting such an idea might possibly have been accomplished by the aid of a resurrectionman as her first step she made acquaintance with the clerk and began to sound him as to the feasibility of her enterprise and his own willingness to engage in it  the clerk apparently listened with not unfavorable ears but as his situation which the fees of pilgrims more numerous than at any catholic shrine render lucrative would have been forfeited by any malfeasance in office he stipulated for liberty to consult the vicar  miss bacon requested to tell her own story to the reverend gentleman and seems to have been received by him with the utmost kindness and even to have succeeded in making a certain impression on his mind as to the desirability of the search  as their interview had been under the seal of secrecy he asked permission to consult a friend who as miss bacon either found out or surmised was a practitioner of the law  what the legal friend advised she did not learn but the negotiation continued and certainly was never broken off by an absolute refusal on the vicars part  he perhaps was kindly temporizing with our poor countrywoman whom an englishman of ordinary mould would have sent to a lunatic asylum at once  i cannot help fancying however that her familiarity with the events of shakespeares life and of his death and burial of which she would speak as if she had been present at the edge of the grave and all the history literature and personalities of the elizabethan age together with the prevailing power of her own belief and the eloquence with which she knew how to enforce it had really gone some little way toward making a convert of the good clergyman  if so i honor him above all the hierarchy of england  the affair certainly looked very hopeful  however erroneously miss bacon had understood from the vicar that no obstacles would be interposed to the investigation and that he himself would sanction it with his presence  it was to take place after nightfall and all preliminary arrangements being made the vicar and clerk professed to wait only her word in order to set about lifting the awful stone from the sepulchre so at least miss bacon believed and as her bewilderment was entirely in her own thoughts and never disturbed her perception or accurate remembrance of external things i see no reason to doubt it except it be the tinge of absurdity in the fact  but in this apparently prosperous state of things her own convictions began to falter  a doubt stole into her mind whether she might not have mistaken the depository and mode of concealment of those historic treasures and after once admitting the doubt she was afraid to hazard the shock of uplifting the stone and finding nothing  she examined the surface of the gravestone and endeavored without stirring it to estimate whether it were of such thickness as to be capable of containing the archives of the elizabethan club  she went over anew the proofs the clews the enigmas the pregnant sentences which she had discovered in bacons letters and elsewhere and now was frightened to perceive that they did not point so definitely to shakespeares tomb as she had heretofore supposed  there was an unmistakably distinct reference to a tomb but it might be bacons or raleighs or spensers and instead of the old player as she profanely called him it might be either of those three illustrious dead poet warrior or statesman whose ashes in westminster abbey or the tower burialground or wherever they sleep it was her mission to disturb  it is very possible moreover that her acute mind may always have had a lurking and deeply latent distrust of its own fantasies and that this now became strong enough to restrain her from a decisive step  but she continued to hover around the church and seems to have had full freedom of entrance in the daytime and special license on one occasion at least at a late hour of the night  she went thither with a darklantern which could but twinkle like a glowworm through the volume of obscurity that filled the great dusky edifice  groping her way up the aisle and towards the chancel she sat down on the elevated part of the pavement above shakespeares grave  if the divine poet really wrote the inscription there and cared as much about the quiet of his bones as its deprecatory earnestness would imply it was time for those crumbling relics to bestir themselves under her sacrilegious feet  but they were safe  she made no attempt to disturb them though i believe she looked narrowly into the crevices between shakespeares and the two adjacent stones and in some way satisfied herself that her single strength would suffice to lift the former in case of need  she threw the feeble ray of her lantern up towards the bust but could not make it visible beneath the darkness of the vaulted roof  had she been subject to superstitious terrors it is impossible to conceive of a situation that could better entitle her to feel them for if shakespeares ghost would rise at any provocation it must have shown itself then but it is my sincere belief that if his figure had appeared within the scope of her darklantern in his slashed doublet and gown and with his eyes bent on her beneath the high bald forehead just as we see him in the bust she would have met him fearlessly and controverted his claims to the authorship of the plays to his very face  she had taught herself to contemn lord leicesters groom it was one of her disdainful epithets for the worlds incomparable poet so thoroughly that even his disembodied spirit would hardly have found civil treatment at miss bacons hands  her vigil though it appears to have had no definite object continued far into the night  several times she heard a low movement in the aisles a stealthy dubious footfall prowling about in the darkness now here now there among the pillars and ancient tombs as if some restless inhabitant of the latter had crept forth to peep at the intruder  by and by the clerk made his appearance and confessed that he had been watching her ever since she entered the church  about this time it was that a strange sort of weariness seems to have fallen upon her her toil was all but done her great purpose as she believed on the very point of accomplishment when she began to regret that so stupendous a mission had been imposed on the fragility of a woman  her faith in the new philosophy was as mighty as ever and so was her confidence in her own adequate development of it now about to be given to the world yet she wished or fancied so that it might never have been her duty to achieve this unparalleled task and to stagger feebly forward under her immense burden of responsibility and renown  so far as her personal concern in the matter went she would gladly have forfeited the reward of her patient study and labor for so many years her exile from her country and estrangement from her family and friends her sacrifice of health and all other interests to this one pursuit if she could only find herself free to dwell in stratford and be forgotten she liked the old slumberous town and awarded the only praise that ever i knew her to bestow on shakespeare the individual man by acknowledging that his taste in a residence was good and that he knew how to choose a suitable retirement for a person of shy but genial temperament  and at this point i cease to possess the means of tracing her vicissitudes of feeling any further  in consequence of some advice which i fancied it my duty to tender as being the only confidant whom she now had in the world i fell under miss bacons most severe and passionate displeasure and was cast off by her in the twinkling of an eye  it was a misfortune to which her friends were always particularly liable but i think that none of them ever loved or even respected her most ingenuous and noble but likewise most sensitive and tumultuous character the less for it  at that time her book was passing through the press  without prejudice to her literary ability it must be allowed that miss bacon was wholly unfit to prepare her own work for publication because among many other reasons she was too thoroughly in earnest to know what to leave out every leaf and line was sacred for all had been written under so deep a conviction of truth as to assume in her eyes the aspect of inspiration a practised bookmaker with entire control of her materials would have shaped out a duodecimo volume full of eloquent and ingenious dissertationcriticisms which quite take the color and pungency out of other peoples critical remarks on shakespearephilosophic truths which she imagined herself to have found at the roots of his conceptions and which certainly come from no inconsiderable depth somewhere  there was a great amount of rubbish which any competent editor would have shovelled out of the way  but miss bacon thrust the whole bulk of inspiration and nonsense into the press in a lump and there tumbled out a ponderous octavo volume which fell with a dead thump at the feet of the public and has never been picked up  a few persons turned over one or two of the leaves as it lay there and essayed to kick the volume deeper into the mud for they were the hack critics of the minor periodical press in london than whom i suppose though excellent fellows in their way there are no gentlemen in the world less sensible of any sanctity in a book or less likely to recognize an authors heart in it or more utterly careless about bruising if they do recognize it  it is their trade  they could not do otherwise  i never thought of blaming them it was not for such an englishman as one of these to get beyond the idea that an assault was meditated on englands greatest poet  from the scholars and critics of her own country indeed miss bacon might have looked for a worthier appreciation because many of the best of them have higher cultivation and finer and deeper literary sensibilities than all but the very profoundest and brightest of englishmen  but they are not a courageous body of men they dare not think a truth that has an odor of absurdity lest they should feel themselves bound to speak it out  if any american ever wrote a word in her behalf miss bacon never knew it nor did i  our journalists at once republished some of the most brutal vituperations of the english press thus pelting their poor countrywoman with stolen mud without even waiting to know whether the ignominy was deserved  and they never have known it to this day nor ever will  the next intelligence that i had of miss bacon was by a letter from the mayor of stratfordonavon  he was a medical man and wrote both in his official and professional character telling me that an american lady who had recently published what the mayor called a shakespeare book was afflicted with insanity  in a lucid interval she had referred to me as a person who had some knowledge of her family and affairs  what she may have suffered before her intellect gave way we had better not try to imagine  no author had ever hoped so confidently as she none ever failed more utterly  a superstitious fancy might suggest that the anathema on shakespeares tombstone had fallen heavily on her head in requital of even the unaccomplished purpose of disturbing the dust beneath and that the old player had kept so quietly in his grave on the night of her vigil because he foresaw how soon and terribly he would be avenged  but if that benign spirit takes any care or cognizance of such things now he has surely requited the injustice that she sought to do himthe high justice that she really didby a tenderness of love and pity of which only he could be capable  what matters it though she called him by some other name  he had wrought a greater miracle on her than on all the world besides  this bewildered enthusiast had recognized a depth in the man whom she decried which scholars critics and learned societies devoted to the elucidation of his unrivalled scenes had never imagined to exist there  she had paid him the loftiest honor that all these ages of renown have been able to accumulate upon his memory  and when not many months after the outward failure of her lifelong object she passed into the better world i know not why we should hesitate to believe that the immortal poet may have met her on the threshold and led her in reassuring her with friendly and comfortable words and thanking her yet with a smile of gentle humor in his eyes at the thought of certain mistaken speculations for having interpreted him to mankind so well  i believe that it has been the fate of this remarkable book never to have had more than a single reader  i myself am acquainted with it only in insulated chapters and scattered pages and paragraphs  but since my return to america a young man of genius and enthusiasm has assured me that he has positively read the book from beginning to end and is completely a convert to its doctrines  it belongs to him therefore and not to me whom in almost the last letter that i received from her she declared unworthy to meddle with her workit belongs surely to this one individual who has done her so much justice as to know what she wrote to place miss bacon in her due position before the public and posterity  this has been too sad a story  to lighten the recollection of it i will think of my stroll homeward past charlecote park where i beheld the most stately elms singly in clumps and in groves scattered all about in the sunniest shadiest sleepiest fashion so that i could not but believe in a lengthened loitering drowsy enjoyment which these trees must have in their existence  diffused over slowpaced centuries it need not be keen nor bubble into thrills and ecstasies like the momentary delights of shortlived human beings  they were civilized trees known to man and befriended by him for ages past  there is an indescribable differenceas i believe i have heretofore endeavored to expressbetween the tamed but by no means effete on the contrary the richer and more luxuriant nature of england and the rude shaggy barbarous nature which offers as its racier companionship in america  no less a change has been wrought among the wildest creatures that inhabit what the english call their forests  by and by among those refined and venerable trees i saw a large herd of deer mostly reclining but some standing in picturesque groups while the stags threw their large antlers aloft as if they had been taught to make themselves tributary to the scenic effect  some were running fleetly about vanishing from light into shadow and glancing forth again with here and there a little fawn careering at its mothers heels  these deer are almost in the same relation to the wild natural state of their kind that the trees of an english park hold to the rugged growth of an american forest  they have held a certain intercourse with man for immemorial years and most probably the stag that shakespeare killed was one of the progenitors of this very herd and may himself have been a partly civilized and humanized deer though in a less degree than these remote posterity they are a little wilder than sheep but they do not snuff the air at the approach of human beings nor evince much alarm at their pretty close proximity although if you continue to advance they toss their heads and take to their heels in a kind of mimic terror or something akin to feminine skittishness with a dim remembrance or tradition as it were of their having come of a wild stock  they have so long been fed and protected by man that they must have lost many of their native instincts and i suppose could not live comfortably through even an english winter without human help  one is sensible of a gentle scorn at them for such dependency but feels none the less kindly disposed towards the halfdomesticated race and it may have been his observation of these tamer characteristics in the charlecote herd that suggested to shakespeare the tender and pitiful description of a wounded stag in as you like it  at a distance of some hundreds of yards from charlecote hall and almost hidden by the trees between it and the roadside is an old brick archway and porters lodge  in connection with this entrance there appears to have been a wall and an ancient moat the latter of which is still visible a shallow grassy scoop along the base of an embankment of the lawn  about fifty yards within the gateway stands the house forming three sides of a square with three gables in a row on the front and on each of the two wings and there are several towers and turrets at the angles together with projecting windows antique balconies and other quaint ornaments suitable to the halfgothic taste in which the edifice was built  over the gateway is the lucy coatofarms emblazoned in its proper colors  the mansion dates from the early days of elizabeth and probably looked very much the same as now when shakespeare was brought before sir thomas lucy for outrages among his deer  the impression is not that of gray antiquity but of stable and timehonored gentility still as vital as ever  it is a most delightful place  all about the house and domain there is a perfection of comfort and domestic taste an amplitude of convenience which could have been brought about only by the slow ingenuity and labor of many successive generations intent upon adding all possible improvement to the home where years gone by and years to come give a sort of permanence to the intangible present  an american is sometimes tempted to fancy that only by this long process can real homes be produced  one mans lifetime is not enough for the accomplishment of such a work of art and nature almost the greatest merely temporary one that is confided to him too little at any rateyet perhaps too long when he is discouraged by the idea that he must make his house warm and delightful for a miscellaneous race of successors of whom the one thing certain is that his own grandchildren will not be among them  such repinings as are here suggested however come only from the fact that bred in english habits of thought as most of us are we have not yet modified our instincts to the necessities of our new forms of life  a lodging in a wigwam or under a tent has really as many advantages when we come to know them as a home beneath the rooftree of charlecote hall but alas our philosophers have not yet taught us what is best nor have our poets sung us what is beautifulest in the kind of life that we must lead and therefore we still read the old english wisdom and harp upon the ancient strings  and thence it happens that when we look at a timehonored hall it seems more possible for men who inherit such a home than for ourselves to lead noble and graceful lives quietly doing good and lovely things as their daily work and achieving deeds of simple greatness when circumstances require them  i sometimes apprehend that our institutions may perish before we shall have discovered the most precious of the possibilities which they involve     lichfield and uttoxeter   after my first visit to leamington spa i went by an indirect route to lichfield and put up at the black swan  had i known where to find it i would much rather have established myself at the inn formerly kept by the worthy mr boniface so famous for his ale in farquhars time  the black swan is an oldfashioned hotel its streetfront being penetrated by an arched passage in either side of which is an entrance door to the different parts of the house and through which and over the large stones of its pavement all vehicles and horsemen rumble and clatter into an enclosed courtyard with a thunderous uproar among the contiguous rooms and chambers  i appeared to be the only guest of the spacious establishment but may have had a few fellowlodgers hidden in their separate parlors and utterly eschewing that community of interests which is the characteristic feature of life in an american hotel  at any rate i had the great dull dingy and dreary coffeeroom with its heavy old mahogany chairs and tables all to myself and not a soul to exchange a word with except the waiter who like most of his class in england had evidently left his conversational abilities uncultivated  no former practice of solitary living nor habits of reticence nor welltested selfdependence for occupation of mind and amusement can quite avail as i now proved to dissipate the ponderous gloom of an english coffeeroom under such circumstances as these with no book at hand save the countydirectory nor any newspaper but a torn local journal of five days ago  so i buried myself betimes in a huge heap of ancient feathers there is no other kind of bed in these old inns let my head sink into an unsubstantial pillow and slept a stifled sleep infested with such a fragmentary confusion of dreams that i took them to be a medley compounded of the nighttroubles of all my predecessors in that same unrestful couch  and when i awoke the musty odor of a bygone century was in my nostrilsa faint elusive smell of which i never had any conception before crossing the atlantic  in the morning after a muttonchop and a cup of chiccory in the dusky coffeeroom i went forth and bewildered myself a little while among the crooked streets in quest of one or two objects that had chiefly attracted me to the spot  the city is of very ancient date and its name in the old saxon tongue has a dismal import that would apply well in these days and forever henceforward to many an unhappy locality in our native land  lichfield signifies the field of the dead bodiesan epithet however which the town did not assume in remembrance of a battle but which probably sprung up by a natural process like a sprig of rue or other funereal weed out of the graves of two princely brothers sons of a pagan king of mercia who were converted by st chad and afterwards martyred for their christian faith  nevertheless i was but little interested in the legends of the remote antiquity of lichfield being drawn thither partly to see its beautiful cathedral and still more i believe because it was the birthplace of dr johnson with whose sturdy english character i became acquainted at a very early period of my life through the good offices of mr boswell  in truth he seems as familiar to my recollection and almost as vivid in his personal aspect to my minds eye as the kindly figure of my own grandfather  it is only a solitary childleft much to such wild modes of culture as he chooses for himself while yet ignorant what culture means standing on tiptoe to pull down books from no very lofty shelf and then shutting himself up as it were between the leaves going astray through the volume at his own pleasure and comprehending it rather by his sensibilities and affections than his intellectthat child is the only student that ever gets the sort of intimacy which i am now thinking of with a literary personage  i do not remember indeed ever caring much about any of the stalwart doctors grandiloquent productions except his two stern and masculine poems london and the vanity of human wishes it was as a man a talker and a humorist that i knew and loved him appreciating many of his qualities perhaps more thoroughly than i do now though never seeking to put my instinctive perception of his character into language  beyond all question i might have had a wiser friend than he  the atmosphere in which alone he breathed was dense his awful dread of death showed how much muddy imperfection was to be cleansed out of him before he could be capable of spiritual existence he meddled only with the surface of life and never cared to penetrate further than to ploughshare depth his very sense and sagacity were but a oneeyed clearsightedness i laughed at him sometimes standing beside his knee  and yet considering that my native propensities were towards fairy land and also how much yeast is generally mixed up with the mental sustenance of a newenglander it may not have been altogether amiss in those childish and boyish days to keep pace with this heavyfooted traveller and feed on the gross diet that he carried in his knapsack  it is wholesome food even now  and then how english  many of the latent sympathies that enabled me to enjoy the old country so well and that so readily amalgamated themselves with the american ideas that seemed most adverse to them may have been derived from or fostered and kept alive by the great english moralist  never was a descriptive epithet more nicely appropriate than that  dr johnsons morality was as english an article as a beefsteak  the city of lichfield only the cathedraltowns are called cities in england stands on an ascending site  it has not so many old gabled houses as coventry for example but still enough to gratify an american appetite for the antiquities of domestic architecture  the people too have an oldfashioned way with them and stare at the passing visitor as if the railway had not yet quite accustomed them to the novelty of strange faces moving along their ancient sidewalks  the old women whom i met in several instances dropt me a courtesy and as they were of decent and comfortable exterior and kept quietly on their way without pause or further greeting it certainly was not allowable to interpret their little act of respect as a modest method of asking for sixpence so that i had the pleasure of considering it a remnant of the reverential and hospitable manners of elder times when the rare presence of a stranger might be deemed worth a general acknowledgment  positively coming from such humble sources i took it all the more as a welcome on behalf of the inhabitants and would not have exchanged it for an invitation from the mayor and magistrates to a public dinner  yet i wish merely for the experiments sake that i could have emboldened myself to hold out the aforesaid sixpence to at least one of the old ladies  in my wanderings about town i came to an artificial piece of water called the minster pool  it fills the immense cavity in a ledge of rock whence the buildingmaterials of the cathedral were quarried out a great many centuries ago  i should never have guessed the little lake to be of mans creation so very pretty and quietly picturesque an object has it grown to be with its green banks and the old trees hanging over its glassy surface in which you may see reflected some of the battlements of the majestic structure that once lay here in unshaped stone  some little children stood on the edge of the pool angling with pinhooks and the scene reminded me though really to be quite fair with the reader the gist of the analogy has now escaped me of that mysterious lake in the arabian nights which had once been a palace and a city and where a fisherman used to pull out the former inhabitants in the guise of enchanted fishes  there is no need of fanciful associations to make the spot interesting  it was in the porch of one of the houses in the street that runs beside the minster pool that lord brooke was slain in the time of the parliamentary war by a shot from the battlements of the cathedral which was then held by the royalists as a fortress  the incident is commemorated by an inscription on a stone inlaid into the wall of the house  i know not what rank the cathedral of lichfield holds among its sister edifices in england as a piece of magnificent architecture  except that of chester the grim and simple nave of which stands yet unrivalled in my memory and one or two small ones in north wales hardly worthy of the name of cathedrals it was the first that i had seen  to my uninstructed vision it seemed the object best worth gazing at in the whole world and now after beholding a great many more i remember it with less prodigal admiration only because others are as magnificent as itself  the traces remaining in my memory represent it as airy rather than massive  a multitude of beautiful shapes appeared to be comprehended within its single outline it was a kind of kaleidoscopic mystery so rich a variety of aspects did it assume from each altered point of view through the presentation of a different face and the rearrangement of its peaks and pinnacles and the three battlemented towers with the spires that shot heavenward from all three but one loftier than its fellows  thus it impressed you at every change as a newly created structure of the passing moment in which yet you lovingly recognized the halfvanished structure of the instant before and felt moreover a joyful faith in the indestructible existence of all this cloudlike vicissitude  a gothic cathedral is surely the most wonderful work which mortal man has yet achieved so vast so intricate and so profoundly simple with such strange delightful recesses in its grand figure so difficult to comprehend within one idea and yet all so consonant that it ultimately draws the beholder and his universe into its harmony  it is the only thing in the world that is vast enough and rich enough  not that i felt or was worthy to feel an unmingled enjoyment in gazing at this wonder  i could not elevate myself to its spiritual height any more than i could have climbed from the ground to the summit of one of its pinnacles  ascending but a little way i continually fell back and lay in a kind of despair conscious that a flood of uncomprehended beauty was pouring down upon me of which i could appropriate only the minutest portion  after a hundred years incalculably as my higher sympathies might be invigorated by so divine an employment i should still be a gazer from below and at an awful distance as yet remotely excluded from the interior mystery  but it was something gained even to have that painful sense of my own limitations and that halfsmothered yearning to soar beyond them  the cathedral showed me how earthly i was but yet whispered deeply of immortality  after all this was probably the best lesson that it could bestow and taking it as thoroughly as possible home to my heart i was fain to be content  if the truth must be told my illtrained enthusiasm soon flagged and i began to lose the vision of a spiritual or ideal edifice behind the timeworn and weatherstained front of the actual structure  whenever that is the case it is most reverential to look another way but the mood disposes one to minute investigation and i took advantage of it to examine the intricate and multitudinous adornment that was lavished on the exterior wall of this great church  everywhere there were empty niches where statues had been thrown down and here and there a statue still lingered in its niche and over the chief entrance and extending across the whole breadth of the building was a row of angels sainted personages martyrs and kings sculptured in reddish stone  being much corroded by the moist english atmosphere during four or five hundred winters that they had stood there these benign and majestic figures perversely put me in mind of the appearance of a sugar image after a child has been holding it in his mouth  the venerable infant time has evidently found them sweet morsels  inside of the minster there is a long and lofty nave transepts of the same height and sideaisles and chapels dim nooks of holiness where in catholic times the lamps were continually burning before the richly decorated shrines of saints  in the audacity of my ignorance as i humbly acknowledge it to have been i criticised this great interior as too much broken into compartments and shorn of half its rightful impressiveness by the interposition of a screen betwixt the nave and chancel  it did not spread itself in breadth but ascended to the roof in lofty narrowness  one large body of worshippers might have knelt down in the nave others in each of the transepts and smaller ones in the sideaisles besides an indefinite number of esoteric enthusiasts in the mysterious sanctities beyond the screen  thus it seemed to typify the exclusiveness of sects rather than the worldwide hospitality of genuine religion  i had imagined a cathedral with a scope more vast  these gothic aisles with their groined arches overhead supported by clustered pillars in long vistas up and down were venerable and magnificent but included too much of the twilight of that monkish gloom out of which they grew  it is no matter whether i ever came to a more satisfactory appreciation of this kind of architecture the only value of my strictures being to show the folly of looking at noble objects in the wrong mood and the absurdity of a new visitant pretending to hold any opinion whatever on such subjects instead of surrendering himself to the old builders influence with childlike simplicity  a great deal of white marble decorates the old stonework of the aisles in the shape of altars obelisks sarcophagi and busts  most of these memorials are commemorative of people locally distinguished especially the deans and canons of the cathedral with their relatives and families and i found but two monuments of personages whom i had ever heard of one being gilbert wahnesley and the other lady mary wortley montagu a literary acquaintance of my boyhood  it was really pleasant to meet her there for after a friend has lain in the grave far into the second century she would be unreasonable to require any melancholy emotions in a chance interview at her tombstone  it adds a rich charm to sacred edifices this timehonored custom of burial in churches after a few years at least when the mortal remains have turned to dust beneath the pavement and the quaint devices and inscriptions still speak to you above  the statues that stood or reclined in several recesses of the cathedral had a kind of life and i regarded them with an odd sort of deference as if they were privileged denizens of the precinct  it was singular too how the memorial of the latest buried person the man whose features went familiar in the streets of lichfield only yesterday seemed precisely as much at home here as his mediaeval predecessors henceforward he belonged in the cathedral like one of its original pillars  methought this impression in my fancy might be the shadow of a spiritual fact  the dying melt into the great multitude of the departed as quietly as a drop of water into the ocean and it may be are conscious of no unfamiliarity with their new circumstances but immediately become aware of an insufferable strangeness in the world which they have quitted  death has not taken them away but brought them home  the vicissitudes and mischances of sublunary affairs however have not ceased to attend upon these marble inhabitants for i saw the upper fragment of a sculptured lady in a very oldfashioned garb the lower half of whom had doubtless been demolished by cromwells soldiers when they took the minster by storm  and there lies the remnant of this devout lady on her slab ever since the outrage as for centuries before with a countenance of divine serenity and her hands clasped in prayer symbolizing a depth of religious faith which no earthly turmoil or calamity could disturb  another piece of sculpture apparently a favorite subject in the middle ages for i have seen several like it in other cathedrals was a reclining skeleton as faithfully representing an openwork of bones as could well be expected in a solid block of marble and at a period moreover when the mysteries of the human frame were rather to be guessed at than revealed  whatever the anatomical defects of his production the old sculptor had succeeded in making it ghastly beyond measure  how much mischief has been wrought upon us by this invariable gloom of the gothic imagination flinging itself like a deathscented pall over our conceptions of the future state smothering our hopes hiding our sky and inducing dismal efforts to raise the harvest of immortality out of what is most opposite to itthe grave  the cathedral service is performed twice every day at ten oclock and at four  when i first entered the choristers young and old but mostly i think boys with voices inexpressibly sweet and clear and as fresh as birdnotes were just winding up their harmonious labors and soon came thronging through a sidedoor from the chancel into the nave  they were all dressed in long white robes and looked like a peculiar order of beings created on purpose to hover between the roof and pavement of that dim consecrated edifice and illuminate it with divine melodies reposing themselves meanwhile on the heavy grandeur of the organtones like cherubs on a golden cloud  all at once however one of the cherubic multitude pulled off his white gown thus transforming himself before my very eyes into a commonplace youth of the day in modern frockcoat and trousers of a decidedly provincial cut  this absurd little incident i verily believe had a sinister effect in putting me at odds with the proper influences of the cathedral nor could i quite recover a suitable frame of mind during my stay there  but emerging into the open air i began to be sensible that i had left a magnificent interior behind me and i have never quite lost the perception and enjoyment of it in these intervening years  a large space in the immediate neighborhood of the cathedral is called the close and comprises beautifully kept lawns and a shadowy walk bordered by the dwellings of the ecclesiastical dignitaries of the diocese  all this row of episcopal canonical and clerical residences has an air of the deepest quiet repose and wellprotected though not inaccessible seclusion  they seemed capable of including everything that a saint could desire and a great many more things than most of us sinners generally succeed in acquiring  their most marked feature is a dignified comfort looking as if no disturbance or vulgar intrusiveness could ever cross their thresholds encroach upon their ornamented lawns or straggle into the beautiful gardens that surround them with flowerbeds and rich clumps of shrubbery  the episcopal palace is a stately mansion of stone built somewhat in the italian style and bearing on its front the figures 1637 as the date of its erection  a large edifice of brick which if i remember stood next to the palace i took to be the residence of the second dignitary of the cathedral and in that case it must have been the youthful home of addison whose father was dean of lichfield  i tried to fancy his figure on the delightful walk that extends in front of those priestly abodes from which and the interior lawns it is separated by an openwork iron fence lined with rich old shrubbery and overarched by a minsteraisle of venerable trees  this path is haunted by the shades of famous personages who have formerly trodden it  johnson must have been familiar with it both as a boy and in his subsequent visits to lichfield an illustrious old man  miss seward connected with so many literary reminiscences lived in one of the adjacent houses  tradition says that it was a favorite spot of major andre who used to pace to and fro under these trees waiting perhaps to catch a last angelglimpse of honoria sueyd before he crossed the ocean to encounter his dismal doom from an american courtmartial  david garrick no doubt scampered along the path in his boyish days and if he was an early student of the drama must often have thought of those two airy characters of the beaux stratagem archer and aimwell who on this very ground after attending service at the cathedral contrive to make acquaintance with the ladies of the comedy  these creatures of mere fiction have as positive a substance now as the sturdy old figure of johnson himself  they live while realities have died  the shadowy walk still glistens with their goldembroidered memories  seeking for johnsons birthplace i found it in st marys square which is not so much a square as the mere widening of a street  the house is tall and thin of three stories with a square front and a roof rising steep and high  on a sideview the building looks as if it had been cut in two in the midst there being no slope of the roof on that side  a ladder slanted against the wall and a painter was giving a livelier line to the plaster  in a cornerroom of the basement where old michael johnson may be supposed to have sold books is now what we should call a drygoods store or according to the english phrase a mercers and haberdashers shop  the house has a private entrance on a crossstreet the door being accessible by several muchworn stone steps which are bordered by an iron balustrade  i set my foot on the steps and laid my hand on the balustrade where johnsons hand and foot must many a time have been and ascending to the door i knocked once and again and again and got no admittance  going round to the shopentrance i tried to open it but found it as fast bolted as the gate of paradise  it is mortifying to be so balked in ones little enthusiasms but looking round in quest of somebody to make inquiries of i was a good deal consoled by the sight of dr johnson himself who happened just at that moment to be sitting at his case nearly in the middle of st marys square with his face turned towards his fathers house  of course it being almost fourscore years since the doctor laid aside his weary bulk of flesh together with the ponderous melancholy that had so long weighed him down the intelligent reader will at once comprehend that he was marble in his substance and seated in a marble chair on an elevated stone pedestal  in short it was a statue sculptured by lucas and placed here in 1838 at the expense of dr law the reverend chancellor of the diocese  the figure is colossal though perhaps not much more so than the mountainous doctor himself and looks down upon the spectator from its pedestal of ten or twelve feet high with a broad and heavy benignity of aspect very like in feature to sir joshua reynoldss portrait of johnson but calmer and sweeter in expression  several big books are piled up beneath his chair and if i mistake not he holds a volume in his hand thus blinking forth at the world out of his learned abstraction owllike yet benevolent at heart  the statue is immensely massive a vast ponderosity of stone not finely spiritualized nor indeed fully humanized but rather resembling a great stonebowlder than a man  you must look with the eyes of faith and sympathy or possibly you might lose the human being altogether and find only a big stone within your mental grasp  on the pedestal are three basreliefs  in the first johnson is represented as hardly more than a baby bestriding an old mans shoulders resting his chin on the bald head which he embraces with his little arms and listening earnestly to the highchurch eloquence of dr sacheverell  in the second tablet he is seen riding to school on the shoulders of two of his comrades while another boy supports him in the rear  the third basrelief possesses to my mind a great deal of pathos to which my appreciative faculty is probably the more alive because i have always been profoundly impressed by the incident here commemorated and long ago tried to tell it for the behoof of childish readers  it shows johnson in the marketplace of uttoxeter doing penance for an act of disobedience to his father committed fifty years before  he stands bareheaded a venerable figure and a countenance extremely sad and woebegone with the wind and rain driving hard against him and thus helping to suggest to the spectator the gloom of his inward state  some marketpeople and children gaze awestricken into his face and an aged man and woman with clasped and uplifted hands seem to be praying for him  these latter personages whose introduction by the artist is none the less effective because in queer proximity there are some commodities of marketday in the shape of living ducks and dead poultry i interpreted to represent the spirits of johnsons father and mother lending what aid they could to lighten his halfcenturys burden of remorse  i had never heard of the abovedescribed piece of sculpture before it appears to have no reputation as a work of art nor am i at all positive that it deserves any  for me however it did as much as sculpture could under the circumstances even if the artist of the libyan sibyl had wrought it by reviving my interest in the sturdy old englishman and particularly by freshening my perception of a wonderful beauty and pathetic tenderness in the incident of the penance  so the next day i left lichfield for uttoxeter on one of the few purely sentimental pilgrimages that i ever undertook to see the very spot where johnson had stood  boswell i think speaks of the town its name is pronounced yuteoxeter as being about nine miles off from lichfield but the countymap would indicate a greater distance and by rail passing from one line to another it is as much as eighteen miles  i have always had an idea of old michael johnson sending his literary merchandise by carriers wagon journeying to uttoxeter afoot on marketday morning selling books through the busy hours and returning to lichfield at night  this could not possibly have been the case  arriving at the uttoxeter station the first objects that i saw with a green field or two between them and me were the tower and gray steeple of a church rising among redtiled roofs and a few scattered trees  a very short walk takes you from the station up into the town  it had been my previous impression that the marketplace of uttoxeter lay immediately roundabout the church and if i remember the narrative aright johnson or boswell in his behalf describes his fathers bookstall as standing in the marketplace close beside the sacred edifice  it is impossible for me to say what changes may have occurred in the topography of the town during almost a century and a half since michael johnson retired from business and ninety years at least since his sons penance was performed  but the church has now merely a street of ordinary width passing around it while the marketplace though near at hand neither forms a part of it nor is really contiguous nor would its throng and bustle be apt to overflow their boundaries and surge against the churchyard and the old gray tower  nevertheless a walk of a minute or two brings a person from the centre of the marketplace to the churchdoor and michael johnson might very conveniently have located his stall and laid out his literary ware in the corner at the towers base better there indeed than in the busy centre of an agricultural market but the picturesque arrangement and full impressiveness of the story absolutely require that johnson shall not have done his penance in a corner ever so little retired but shall have been the very nucleus of the crowdthe midmost man of the marketplacea central image of memory and remorse contrasting with and overpowering the petty materialism around him  he himself having the force to throw vitality and truth into what persons differently constituted might reckon a mere external ceremony and an absurd one could not have failed to see this necessity  i am resolved therefore that the true site of dr johnsons penance was in the middle of the marketplace  that important portion of the town is a rather spacious and irregularly shaped vacuity surrounded by houses and shops some of them old with redtiled roofs others wearing a pretence of newness but probably as old in their inner substance as the rest  the people of uttoxeter seemed very idle in the warm summerday and were scattered in little groups along the sidewalks leisurely chatting with one another and often turning about to take a deliberate stare at my humble self insomuch that i felt as if my genuine sympathy for the illustrious penitent and my many reflections about him must have imbued me with some of his own singularity of mien  if their greatgrandfathers were such redoubtable starers in the doctors day his penance was no light one  this curiosity indicates a paucity of visitors to the little town except for market purposes and i question if uttoxeter ever saw an american before the only other thing that greatly impressed me was the abundance of publichouses one at every step or two red lions white harts bulls heads mitres cross keys and i know not what besides  these are probably for the accommodation of the farmers and peasantry of the neighborhood on marketday and content themselves with a very meagre business on other days of the week  at any rate i was the only guest in uttoxeter at the period of my visit and had but an infinitesimal portion of patronage to distribute among such a multitude of inns  the reader however will possibly be scandalized to learn what was the first and indeed the only important affair that i attended to after coming so far to indulge a solemn and high emotion and standing now on the very spot where my pious errand should have been consummated  i stepped into one of the rustic hostelries and got my dinnerbacon and greens some muttonchops juicier and more delectable than all america could serve up at the presidents table and a gooseberry pudding a sufficient meal for six yeomen and good enough for a prince besides a pitcher of foaming ale the whole at the pitiful small charge of eighteenpence  dr johnson would have forgiven me for nobody had a heartier faith in beef and mutton than himself  and as regards my lack of sentiment in eating my dinnerit was the wisest thing i had done that day  a sensible man had better not let himself be betrayed into these attempts to realize the things which he has dreamed about and which when they cease to be purely ideal in his mind will have lost the truest of their truth the loftiest and profoundest part of their power over his sympathies  facts as we really find them whatever poetry they may involve are covered with a stony excrescence of prose resembling the crust on a beautiful seashell and they never show their most delicate and divinest colors until we shall have dissolved away their grosser actualities by steeping them long in a powerful menstruum of thought and seeking to actualize them again we do but renew the crust  if this were otherwiseif the moral sublimity of a great fact depended in any degree on its garb of external circumstances things which change and decayit could not itself be immortal and ubiquitous and only a brief point of time and a little neighborhood would be spiritually nourished by its grandeur and beauty  such were a few of the reflections which i mingled with my ale as i remember to have seen an old quaffer of that excellent liquor stir up his cup with a sprig of some bitter and fragrant herb  meanwhile i found myself still haunted by a desire to get a definite result out of my visit to uttoxeter  the hospitable inn was called the nags head and standing beside the marketplace was as likely as any other to have entertained old michael johnson in the days when he used to come hither to sell books  he perhaps had dined on bacon and greens and drunk his ale and smoked his pipe in the very room where i now sat which was a low ancient room certainly much older than queen annes time with a redbrick floor and a whitewashed ceiling traversed by bare rough beams the whole in the rudest fashion but extremely neat  neither did it lack ornament the walls being hung with colored engravings of prize oxen and other pretty prints and the mantelpiece adorned with earthenware figures of shepherdesses in the arcadian taste of long ago michael johnsons eyes might have rested on that selfsame earthen image to examine which more closely i had just crossed the brick pavement of the room  and sitting down again still as i sipped my ale i glanced through the open window into the sunny marketplace and wished that i could honestly fix on one spot rather than another as likely to have been the holy site where johnson stood to do his penance  how strange and stupid it is that tradition should not have marked and kept in mind the very place  how shameful nothing less than that that there should be no local memorial of this incident as beautiful and touching a passage as can be cited out of any human life  no inscription of it almost as sacred as a verse of scripture on the wall of the church  no statue of the venerable and illustrious penitent in the marketplace to throw a wholesome awe over its earthliness its frauds and petty wrongs of which the benumbed fingers of conscience can make no record its selfish competition of each man with his brother or his neighbor its traffic of soulsubstance for a little worldly gain  such a statue if the piety of the people did not raise it might almost have been expected to grow up out of the pavement of its own accord on the spot that had been watered by the rain that dripped from johnsons garments mingled with his remorseful tears  long after my visit to uttoxeter i was told that there were individuals in the town who could have shown me the exact indubitable spot where johnson performed his penance  i was assured moreover that sufficient interest was felt in the subject to have induced certain local discussions as to the expediency of erecting a memorial  with all deference to my polite informant i surmise that there is a mistake and decline without further and precise evidence giving credit to either of the above statements  the inhabitants know nothing as a matter of general interest about the penance and care nothing for the scene of it  if the clergyman of the parish for example had ever heard of it would he not have used the theme time and again wherewith to work tenderly and profoundly on the souls committed to his charge  if parents were familiar with it would they not teach it to their young ones at the fireside both to insure reverence to their own gray hairs and to protect the children from such unavailing regrets as johnson bore upon his heart for fifty years  if the site were ascertained would not the pavement thereabouts be worn with reverential footsteps  would not every townborn child be able to direct the pilgrim thither  while waiting at the station before my departure i asked a boy who stood near mean intelligent and gentlemanly lad twelve or thirteen years old whom i should take to be a clergymans soni asked him if he had ever heard the story of dr johnson how he stood an hour doing penance near that church the spire of which rose before us  the boy stared and answered  no  were you born in uttoxeter  yes  i inquired if no circumstance such as i had mentioned was known or talked about among the inhabitants  no said the boy not that i ever heard of  just think of the absurd little town knowing nothing of the only memorable incident which ever happened within its boundaries since the old britons built it this sad and lovely story which consecrates the spot for i found it holy to my contemplation again as soon as it lay behind me in the heart of a stranger from three thousand miles over the sea  it but confirms what i have been saying that sublime and beautiful facts are best understood when etherealized by distance     pilgrimage to old boston   we set out at a little past eleven and made our first stage to manchester  we were by this time sufficiently anglicized to reckon the morning a bright and sunny one although the may sunshine was mingled with water as it were and distempered with a very bitter eastwind  lancashire is a dreary county all at least except its hilly portions and i have never passed through it without wishing myself anywhere but in that particular spot where i then happened to be  a few places along our route were historically interesting as for example bolton which was the scene of many remarkable events in the parliamentary war and in the marketsquare of which one of the earls of derby was beheaded  we saw along the wayside the neverfailing green fields hedges and other monotonous features of an ordinary english landscape  there were little factory villages too or larger towns with their tall chimneys and their pennons of black smoke their ugliness of brickwork and their heaps of refuse matter from the furnace which seems to be the only kind of stuff which nature cannot take back to herself and resolve into the elements when man has thrown it aside  these hillocks of waste and effete mineral always disfigure the neighborhood of ironmongering towns and even after a considerable antiquity are hardly made decent with a little grass  at a quarter to two we left manchester by the sheffield and lincoln railway  the scenery grew rather better than that through which we had hitherto passed though still by no means very striking for except in the showdistricts such as the lake country or derbyshire english scenery is not particularly well worth looking at considered as a spectacle or a picture  it has a real homely charm of its own no doubt and the rich verdure and the thorough finish added by human art are perhaps as attractive to an american eye as any stronger feature could be  our journey however between manchester and sheffield was not through a rich tract of country but along a valley walled in by bleak ridgy hills extending straight as a rampart and across black moorlands with here and there a plantation of trees  sometimes there were long and gradual ascents bleak windy and desolate conveying the very impression which the reader gets from many passages of miss brontes novels and still more from those of her two sisters  old stone or brick farmhouses and once in a while an old churchtower were visible but these are almost too common objects to be noticed in an english landscape  on a railway i suspect what little we do see of the country is seen quite amiss because it was never intended to be looked at from any point of view in that straight line so that it is like looking at the wrong side of a piece of tapestry  the old highways and footpaths were as natural as brooks and rivulets and adapted themselves by an inevitable impulse to the physiognomy of the country and furthermore every object within view of them had some subtile reference to their curves and undulations but the line of a railway is perfectly artificial and puts all precedent things at sixesandsevens  at any rate be the cause what it may there is seldom anything worth seeing within the scope of a railway travellers eye and if there were it requires an alert marksman to take a flying shot at the picturesque  at one of the stations it was near a village of ancient aspect nestling round a church on a wide yorkshire moor i saw a tall old lady in black who seemed to have just alighted from the train  she caught my attention by a singular movement of the head not once only but continually repeated and at regular intervals as if she were making a stern and solemn protest against some action that developed itself before her eyes and were foreboding terrible disaster if it should be persisted in  of course it was nothing more than a paralytic or nervous affection yet one might fancy that it had its origin in some unspeakable wrong perpetrated half a lifetime ago in this old gentlewomans presence either against herself or somebody whom she loved still better  her features had a wonderful sternness which i presume was caused by her habitual effort to compose and keep them quiet and thereby counteract the tendency to paralytic movement  the slow regular and inexorable character of the motionher look of force and selfcontrol which had the appearance of rendering it voluntary while yet it was so fateful have stamped this poor ladys face and gesture into my memory so that some dark day or other i am afraid she will reproduce herself in a dismal romance  the train stopped a minute or two to allow the tickets to be taken just before entering the sheffield station and thence i had a glimpse of the famous town of razors and penknives enveloped in a cloud of its own diffusing  my impressions of it are extremely vague and mistyor rather smoky for sheffield seems to me smokier than manchester liverpool or birminghamsmokier than all england besides unless newcastle be the exception  it might have been plutos own metropolis shrouded in sulphurous vapor and indeed our approach to it had been by the valley of the shadow of death through a tunnel three miles in length quite traversing the breadth and depth of a mountainous hill  after passing sheffield the scenery became softer gentler yet more picturesque  at one point we saw what i believe to be the utmost northern verge of sherwood forestnot consisting however of thousandyear oaks extant from robin hoods days but of young and thriving plantations which will require a century or two of slow english growth to give them much breadth of shade  earl fitzwilliams property lies in this neighborhood and probably his castle was hidden among some soft depth of foliage not far off  farther onward the country grew quite level around us whereby i judged that we must now be in lincolnshire and shortly after six oclock we caught the first glimpse of the cathedral towers though they loomed scarcely huge enough for our preconceived idea of them  but as we drew nearer the great edifice began to assert itself making us acknowledge it to be larger than our receptivity could take in  at the railwaystation we found no cab it being an unknown vehicle in lincoln but only an omnibus belonging to the saracens head which the driver recommended as the best hotel in the city and took us thither accordingly  it received us hospitably and looked comfortable enough though like the hotels of most old english towns it had a musty fragrance of antiquity such as i have smelt in a seldomopened london church where the broadaisle is paved with tombstones  the house was of an ancient fashion the entrance into its interior courtyard being through an arch in the side of which is the door of the hotel  there are long corridors an intricate arrangement of passages and an upanddown meandering of staircases amid which it would be no marvel to encounter some forgotten guest who had gone astray a hundred years ago and was still seeking for his bedroom while the rest of his generation were in their graves  there is no exaggerating the confusion of mind that seizes upon a stranger in the bewildering geography of a great oldfashioned english inn  this hotel stands in the principal street of lincoln and within a very short distance of one of the ancient citygates which is arched across the public way with a smaller arch for footpassengers on either side the whole a gray timegnawn ponderous shadowy structure through the dark vista of which you look into the middle ages  the street is narrow and retains many antique peculiarities though unquestionably english domestic architecture has lost its most impressive features in the course of the last century  in this respect there are finer old towns than lincoln chester for instance and shrewsburywhich last is unusually rich in those quaint and stately edifices where the gentry of the shire used to make their winter abodes in a provincial metropolis almost everywhere nowadays there is a monotony of modern brick or stuccoed fronts hiding houses that are older than ever but obliterating the picturesque antiquity of the street  between seven and eight oclock it being still broad daylight in these long english days we set out to pay a preliminary visit to the exterior of the cathedral  passing through the stone bow as the citygate close by is called we ascended a street which grew steeper and narrower as we advanced till at last it got to be the steepest street i ever climbed so steep that any carriage if left to itself would rattle downward much faster than it could possibly be drawn up  being almost the only hill in lincolnshire the inhabitants seem disposed to make the most of it  the houses on each side had no very remarkable aspect except one with a stone portal and carved ornaments which is now a dwellingplace for povertystricken people but may have been an aristocratic abode in the days of the norman kings to whom its style of architecture dates back this is called the jewesss house having been inhabited by a woman of that faith who was hanged six hundred years ago  and still the street grew steeper and steeper  certainly the bishop and clergy of lincoln ought not to be fat men but of very spiritual saintlike almost angelic habit if it be a frequent part of their ecclesiastical duty to climb this hill for it is a real penance and was probably performed as such and groaned over accordingly in monkish times  formerly on the day of his installation the bishop used to ascend the hill barefoot and was doubtless cheered and invigorated by looking upward to the grandeur that was to console him for the humility of his approach  we likewise were beckoned onward by glimpses of the cathedral towers and finally attaining an open square on the summit we saw an old gothic gateway to the left hand and another to the right the latter had apparently been a part of the exterior defences of the cathedral at a time when the edifice was fortified  the west front rose behind  we passed through one of the sidearches of the gothic portal and found ourselves in the cathedral close a wide level space where the great old minster has fair room to sit looking down on the ancient structures that surround it all of which in former days were the habitations of its dignitaries and officers  some of them are still occupied as such though others are in too neglected and dilapidated a state to seem worthy of so splendid an establishment  unless it be salisbury close however which is incomparably rich as regards the old residences that belong to it i remember no more comfortably picturesque precincts round any other cathedral  but in truth almost every cathedral close in turn has seemed to me the loveliest cosiest safest least windshaken most decorous and most enjoyable shelter that ever the thrift and selfishness of mortal man contrived for himself  how delightful to combine all this with the service of the temple  lincoln cathedral is built of a yellowish brownstone which appears either to have been largely restored or else does not assume the hoary crumbly surface that gives such a venerable aspect to most of the ancient churches and castles in england  in many parts the recent restorations are quite evident but other and much the larger portions can scarcely have been touched for centuries for there are still the gargoyles perfect or with broken noses as the case may be but showing that variety and fertility of grotesque extravagance which no modern imitation can effect  there are innumerable niches too up the whole height of the towers above and around the entrance and all over the walls most of them empty but a few containing the lamentable remnants of headless saints and angels  it is singular what a native animosity lives in the human heart against carved images insomuch that whether they represent christian saint or pagan deity all unsophisticated men seize the first safe opportunity to knock off their heads  in spite of all dilapidations however the effect of the west front of the cathedral is still exceedingly rich being covered from massive base to airy summit with the minutest details of sculpture and carving at least it was so once and even now the spiritual impression of its beauty remains so strong that we have to look twice to see that much of it has been obliterated  i have seen a cherrystone carved all over by a monk so minutely that it must have cost him half a lifetime of labor and this cathedralfront seems to have been elaborated in a monkish spirit like that cherrystone  not that the result is in the least petty but miraculously grand and all the more so for the faithful beauty of the smallest details  an elderly maid seeing us looking up at the west front came to the door of an adjacent house and called to inquire if we wished to go into the cathedral but as there would have been a dusky twilight beneath its roof like the antiquity that has sheltered itself within we declined for the present  so we merely walked round the exterior and thought it more beautiful than that of york though on recollection i hardly deem it so majestic and mighty as that  it is vain to attempt a description or seek even to record the feeling which the edifice inspires  it does not impress the beholder as an inanimate object but as something that has a vast quiet longenduring life of its owna creation which man did not build though in some way or other it is connected with him and kindred to human nature  in short i fall straightway to talking nonsense when i try to express my inner sense of this and other cathedrals  while we stood in the close at the eastern end of the minster the clock chimed the quarters and then great tom who hangs in the rood tower told us it was eight oclock in far the sweetest and mightiest accents that i ever heard from any bellslow and solemn and allowing the profound reverberations of each stroke to die away before the next one fell  it was still broad daylight in that upper region of the town and would be so for some time longer but the evening atmosphere was getting sharp and cool  we therefore descended the steep streetour younger companion running before us and gathering such headway that i fully expected him to break his head against some projecting wall  in the morning we took a fly an english term for an exceedingly sluggish vehicle and drove up to the minster by a road rather less steep and abrupt than the one we had previously climbed  we alighted before the west front and sent our charioteer in quest of the verger but as he was not immediately to be found a young girl let us into the nave  we found it very grand it is needless to say but not so grand methought as the vast nave of york cathedral especially beneath the great central tower of the latter  unless a writer intends a professedly architectural description there is but one set of phrases in which to talk of all the cathedrals in england and elsewhere  they are alike in their great features an acre or two of stone flags for a pavement rows of vast columns supporting a vaulted roof at a dusky height great windows sometimes richly bedimmed with ancient or modern stained glass and an elaborately carved screen between the nave and chancel breaking the vista that might else be of such glorious length and which is further choked up by a massive organin spite of which obstructions you catch the broad variegated glimmer of the painted east window where a hundred saints wear their robes of transfiguration  behind the screen are the carved oaken stalls of the chapter and prebendaries the bishops throne the pulpit the altar and whatever else may furnish out the holy of holies  nor must we forget the range of chapels once dedicated to catholic saints but which have now lost their individual consecration nor the old monuments of kings warriors and prelates in the sideaisles of the chancel  in close contiguity to the main body of the cathedral is the chapterhouse which here at lincoln as at salisbury is supported by one central pillar rising from the floor and putting forth branches like a tree to hold up the roof  adjacent to the chapterhouse are the cloisters extending round a quadrangle and paved with lettered tombstones the more antique of which have had their inscriptions half obliterated by the feet of monks taking their noontide exercise in these sheltered walks five hundred years ago  some of these old burialstones although with ancient crosses engraved upon them have been made to serve as memorials to dead people of very recent date  in the chancel among the tombs of forgotten bishops and knights we saw an immense slab of stone purporting to be the monument of catherine swynford wife of john of gaunt also here was the shrine of the little saint hugh that christian child who was fabled to have been crucified by the jews of lincoln  the cathedral is not particularly rich in monuments for it suffered grievous outrage and dilapidation both at the reformation and in cromwells time  this latter iconoclast is in especially bad odor with the sextons and vergers of most of the old churches which i have visited  his soldiers stabled their steeds in the nave of lincoln cathedral and hacked and hewed the monkish sculptures and the ancestral memorials of great families quite at their wicked and plebeian pleasure  nevertheless there are some most exquisite and marvellous specimens of flowers foliage and grapevines and miracles of stonework twined about arches as if the material had been as soft as wax in the cunning sculptors handsthe leaves being represented with all their veins so that you would almost think it petrified nature for which he sought to steal the praise of art  here too were those grotesque faces which always grin at you from the projections of monkish architecture as if the builders had gone mad with their own deep solemnity or dreaded such a catastrophe unless permitted to throw in something ineffably absurd  originally it is supposed all the pillars of this great edifice and all these magic sculptures were polished to the utmost degree of lustre nor is it unreasonable to think that the artists would have taken these further pains when they had already bestowed so much labor in working out their conceptions to the extremest point  but at present the whole interior of the cathedral is smeared over with a yellowish wash the very meanest hue imaginable and for which somebodys soul has a bitter reckoning to undergo  in the centre of the grassy quadrangle about which the cloisters perambulate is a small mean brick building with a locked door  our guidei forgot to say that we had been captured by a verger in black and with a white tie but of a lusty and jolly aspectour guide unlocked this door and disclosed a flight of steps  at the bottom appeared what i should have taken to be a large square of dim worn and faded oilcarpeting which might originally have been painted of a rather gaudy pattern  this was a roman tessellated pavement made of small colored bricks or pieces of burnt clay  it was accidentally discovered here and has not been meddled with further than by removing the superincumbent earth and rubbish  nothing else occurs to me just now to be recorded about the interior of the cathedral except that we saw a place where the stone pavement had been worn away by the feet of ancient pilgrims scraping upon it as they knelt down before a shrine of the virgin  leaving the minster we now went along a street of more venerable appearance than we had heretofore seen bordered with houses the high peaked roofs of which were covered with red earthen tiles  it led us to a roman arch which was once the gateway of a fortification and has been striding across the english street ever since the latter was a faint villagepath and for centuries before  the arch is about four hundred yards from the cathedral and it is to be noticed that there are roman remains in all this neighborhood some above ground and doubtless innumerable more beneath it for as in ancient rome itself an inundation of accumulated soil seems to have swept over what was the surface of that earlier day  the gateway which i am speaking about is probably buried to a third of its height and perhaps has as perfect a roman pavement if sought for at the original depth as that which runs beneath the arch of titus  it is a rude and massive structure and seems as stalwart now as it could have been two thousand years ago and though time has gnawed it externally he has made what amends he could by crowning its rough and broken summit with grass and weeds and planting tufts of yellow flowers on the projections up and down the sides  there are the ruins of a norman castle built by the conqueror in pretty close proximity to the cathedral but the old gateway is obstructed by a modern door of wood and we were denied admittance because some part of the precincts are used as a prison  we now rambled about on the broad back of the hill which besides the minster and ruined castle is the site of some stately and queer old houses and of many mean little hovels  i suspect that all or most of the life of the present day has subsided into the lower town and that only priests poor people and prisoners dwell in these upper regions  in the wide dry moat at the base of the castlewall are clustered whole colonies of small houses some of brick but the larger portion built of old stones which once made part of the norman keep or of roman structures that existed before the conquerors castle was ever dreamed about  they are like toadstools that spring up from the mould of a decaying tree  ugly as they are they add wonderfully to the picturesqueness of the scene being quite as valuable in that respect as the great broad ponderous ruin of the castlekeep which rose high above our heads heaving its huge gray mass out of a bank of green foliage and ornamental shrubbery such as lilacs and other flowering plants in which its foundations were completely hidden  after walking quite round the castle i made an excursion through the roman gateway along a pleasant and level road bordered with dwellings of various character  one or two were houses of gentility with delightful and shadowy lawns before them many had those high redtiled roofs ascending into acutely pointed gables which seem to belong to the same epoch as some of the edifices in our own earlier towns and there were pleasantlooking cottages very sylvan and rural with hedges so dense and high fencing them in as almost to hide them up to the eaves of their thatched roofs  in front of one of these i saw various images crosses and relics of antiquity among which were fragments of old catholic tombstones disposed by way of ornament  we now went home to the saracens head and as the weather was very unpropitious and it sprinkled a little now and then i would gladly have felt myself released from further thraldom to the cathedral  but it had taken possession of me and would not let me be at rest so at length i found myself compelled to climb the hill again between daylight and dusk  a mist was now hovering about the upper height of the great central tower so as to dim and half obliterate its battlements and pinnacles even while i stood in the close beneath it  it was the most impressive view that i had had  the whole lower part of the structure was seen with perfect distinctness but at the very summit the mist was so dense as to form an actual cloud as well defined as ever i saw resting on a mountaintop  really and literally here was a cloudcapt tower  the entire cathedral too transfigured itself into a richer beauty and more imposing majesty than ever  the longer i looked the better i loved it  its exterior is certainly far more beautiful than that of york minster and its finer effect is due i think to the many peaks in which the structure ascends and to the pinnacles which as it were repeat and reecho them into the sky  york cathedral is comparatively square and angular in its general effect but in this at lincoln there is a continual mystery of variety so that at every glance you are aware of a change and a disclosure of something new yet working an harmonious development of what you have heretofore seen  the west front is unspeakably grand and may be read over and over again forever and still show undetected meanings like a great broad page of marvellous writing in blackletterso many sculptured ornaments there are blossoming out before your eyes and gray statues that have grown there since you looked last and empty niches and a hundred airy canopies beneath which carved images used to be and where they will show themselves again if you gaze long enoughbut i will not say another word about the cathedral  we spent the rest of the day within the sombre precincts of the saracens head reading yesterdays times the guidebook of lincoln and the directory of the eastern counties  dismal as the weather was the street beneath our window was enlivened with a great bustle and turmoil of people all the evening because it was saturday night and they had accomplished their weeks toil received their wages and were making their small purchases against sunday and enjoying themselves as well as they knew how  a band of music passed to and fro several times with the raindrops falling into the mouth of the brazen trumpet and pattering on the bassdrum a spiritshop opposite the hotel had a vast run of custom and a coffeedealer in the open air found occasional vent for his commodity in spite of the cold water that dripped into the cups the whole breadth of the street between the stone bow and the bridge across the witham was thronged to overflowing and humming with human life  observing in the guidebook that a steamer runs on the river witham between lincoln and boston i inquired of the waiter and learned that she was to start on monday at ten oclock  thinking it might be an interesting trip and a pleasant variation of our customary mode of travel we determined to make the voyage  the witham flows through lincoln crossing the main street under an arched bridge of gothic construction a little below the saracens head  it has more the appearance of a canal than of a river in its passage through the town being bordered with hewnstone masonwork on each side and provided with one or two locks  the steamer proved to be small dirty and altogether inconvenient  the early morning had been bright but the sky now lowered upon us with a sulky english temper and we had not long put off before we felt an ugly wind from the german ocean blowing right in our teeth there were a number of passengers on board countrypeople such as travel by thirdclass on the railway for i suppose nobody but ourselves ever dreamt of voyaging by the steamer for the sake of what he might happen upon in the way of riverscenery  we bothered a good while about getting through a preliminary lock nor when fairly under way did we ever accomplish i think six miles an hour  constant delays were caused moreover by stopping to take up passengers and freightnot at regular landingplaces but anywhere along the green banks  the scenery was identical with that of the railway because the latter runs along by the riverside through the whole distance or nowhere departs from it except to make a short cut across some sinuosity so that our only advantage lay in the drawling snaillike slothfulness of our progress which allowed us time enough and to spare for the objects along the shore  unfortunately there was nothing or next to nothing to be seenthe country being one unvaried level over the whole thirty miles of our voyagenot a hill in sight either near or far except that solitary one on the summit of which we had left lincoln cathedral  and the cathedral was our landmark for four hours or more and at last rather faded out than was hidden by any intervening object  it would have been a pleasantly lazy day enough if the rough and bitter wind had not blown directly in our faces and chilled us through in spite of the sunshine that soon succeeded a sprinkle or two of rain these english eastwinds which prevail from february till june are greater nuisances than the eastwind of our own atlantic coast although they do not bring mist and storm as with us but some of the sunniest weather that england sees  under their influence the sky smiles and is villanous  the landscape was tame to the last degree but had an english character that was abundantly worth our looking at  a green luxuriance of early grass old highroofed farmhouses surrounded by their stone barns and ricks of hay and grain ancient villages with the square gray tower of a church seen afar over the level country amid the cluster of red roofs here and there a shadowy grove of venerable trees surrounding what was perhaps an elizabethan hall though it looked more like the abode of some rich yeoman  once too we saw the tower of a mediaeval castle that of tattershall built by a cromwell but whether of the protectors family i cannot tell  but the gentry do not appear to have settled multitudinously in this tract of country nor is it to be wondered at since a lover of the picturesque would as soon think of settling in holland  the river retains its canallike aspect all along and only in the latter part of its course does it become more than wide enough for the little steamer to turn itself roundat broadest not more than twice that width  the only memorable incident of our voyage happened when a motherduck was leading her little fleet of five ducklings across the river just as our steamer went swaggering by stirring the quiet stream into great waves that lashed the banks on either side  i saw the imminence of the catastrophe and hurried to the stern of the boat to witness its consummation since i could not possibly avert it  the poor ducklings had uttered their babyquacks and striven with all their tiny might to escape four of them i believe were washed aside and thrown off unhurt from the steamers prow but the fifth must have gone under the whole length of the keel and never could have come up alive  at last in midafternoon we beheld the tall tower of saint botolphs church three hundred feet high the same elevation as the tallest tower of lincoln cathedral looming in the distance  at about half past four we reached boston which name has been shortened in the course of ages by the quick and slovenly english pronunciation from botolphs town and were taken by a cab to the peacock in the marketplace  it was the best hotel in town though a poor one enough and we were shown into a small stifled parlor dingy musty and scented with stale tobaccosmoketobaccosmoke two days old for the waiter assured us that the room had not more recently been fumigated  an exceedingly grim waiter he was apparently a genuine descendant of the old puritans of this english boston and quite as sour as those who people the daughtercity in new england  our parlor had the one recommendation of looking into the marketplace and affording a sidelong glimpse of the tall spire and noble old church  in my first ramble about the town chance led me to the riverside at that quarter where the port is situated  here were long buildings of an oldfashioned aspect seemingly warehouses with windows in the high steep roofs  the customhouse found ample accommodation within an ordinary dwellinghouse  two or three large schooners were moored along the rivers brink which had here a stone margin another large and handsome schooner was evidently just finished rigged and equipped for her first voyage the rudiments of another were on the stocks in a shipyard bordering on the river  still another while i was looking on came up the stream and lowered her mainsail from a foreign voyage  an old man on the bank hailed her and inquired about her cargo but the lincolnshire people have such a queer way of talking english that i could not understand the reply  farther down the river i saw a brig approaching rapidly under sail  the whole scene made an odd impression of bustle and sluggishness and decay and a remnant of wholesome life and i could not but contrast it with the mighty and populous activity of our own boston which was once the feeble infant of this old english townthe latter perhaps almost stationary ever since that day as if the birth of such an offspring had taken away its own principle of growth  i thought of long wharf and faneuil hall and washington street and the great elm and the state house and exulted lustilybut yet began to feel at home in this good old town for its very names sake as i never had before felt in england  the next morning we came out in the early sunshine the sun must have been shining nearly four hours however for it was after eight oclock and strolled about the streets like people who had a right to be there the marketplace of boston is an irregular square into one end of which the chancel of the church slightly projects  the gates of the churchyard were open and free to all passengers and the common footway of the townspeople seems to lie to and fro across it  it is paved according to english custom with flat tombstones and there are also raised or altar tombs some of which have armorial hearings on them  one clergyman has caused himself and his wife to be buried right in the middle of the stonebordered path that traverses the churchyard so that not an individual of the thousands who pass along this public way can help trampling over him or her  the scene nevertheless was very cheerful in the morning sun people going about their business in the days primal freshness which was just as fresh here as in younger villages children with milkpails loitering over the burialstones schoolboys playing leapfrog with the altartombs the simple old town preparing itself for the day which would be like myriads of other days that had passed over it but yet would be worth living through  and down on the churchyard where were buried many generations whom it remembered in their time looked the stately tower of saint botolph and it was good to see and think of such an agelong giant intermarrying the present epoch with a distant past and getting quite imbued with human nature by being so immemorially connected with mens familiar knowledge and homely interests  it is a noble tower and the jackdaws evidently have pleasant homes in their hereditary nests among its topmost windows and live delightful lives flitting and cawing about its pinnacles and flying buttresses  i should almost like to be a jackdaw myself for the sake of living up there  in front of the church not more than twenty yards off and with a low brick wall between flows the river witham  on the hither bank a fisherman was washing his boat and another skiff with her sail lazily half twisted lay on the opposite strand  the stream at this point is about of such width that if the tall tower were to tumble over flat on its face its topstone might perhaps reach to the middle of the channel on the farther shore there is a line of antiquelooking houses with roofs of red tile and windows opening out of themsome of these dwellings being so ancient that the reverend mr cotton subsequently our first boston minister must have seen them with his own bodily eyes when he used to issue from the frontportal after service  indeed there must be very many houses here and even some streets that bear much the aspect that they did when the puritan divine paced solemnly among them  in our rambles about town we went into a booksellers shop to inquire if he had any description of boston for sale  he offered me or rather produced for inspection not supposing that i would buy it a quarto history of the town published by subscription nearly forty years ago the bookseller showed himself a wellinformed and affable man and a local antiquary to whom a party of inquisitive strangers were a godsend he had met with several americans who at various times had come on pilgrimages to this place and he had been in correspondence with others happening to have heard the name of one member of our party he showed us great courtesy and kindness and invited us into his inner domicile where as he modestly intimated he kept a few articles which it might interest us to see  so we went with him through the shop up stairs into the private part of his establishment and really it was one of the rarest adventures i ever met with to stumble upon this treasure of a man with his treasury of antiquities and curiosities veiled behind the unostentatious front of a booksellers shop in a very moderate line of village business  the two upstair rooms into which he introduced us were so crowded with inestimable articles that we were almost afraid to stir for fear of breaking some fragile thing that had been accumulating value for unknown centuries  the apartment was hung round with pictures and old engravings many of which were extremely rare  premising that he was going to show us something very curious mr porter went into the next room and returned with a counterpane of fine linen elaborately embroidered with silk which so profusely covered the linen that the general effect was as if the main texture were silken  it was stained and seemed very old and had an ancient fragrance  it was wrought all over with birds and flowers in a most delicate style of needlework and among other devices more than once repeated was the cipher m sbeing the initials of one of the most unhappy names that ever a woman bore  this quilt was embroidered by the hands of mary queen of scots during her imprisonment at fotheringay castle and having evidently been a work of years she had doubtless shed many tears over it and wrought many doleful thoughts and abortive schemes into its texture along with the birds and flowers  as a counterpart to this most precious relic our friend produced some of the handiwork of a former queen of otaheite presented by her to captain cook it was a bag cunningly made of some delicate vegetable stuff and ornamented with feathers  next he brought out a green silk waistcoat of very antique fashion trimmed about the edges and pocketholes with a rich and delicate embroidery of gold and silver  this as the possessor of the treasure proved by tracing its pedigree till it came into his hands was once the vestment of queen elizabeths lord burleigh but that great statesman must have been a person of very moderate girth in the chest and waist for the garment was hardly more than a comfortable fit for a boy of eleven the smallest american of our party who tried on the gorgeous waistcoat  then mr porter produced some curiously engraved drinkingglasses with a view of saint botolphs steeple on one of them and other boston edifices public or domestic on the remaining two very admirably done  these crystal goblets had been a present long ago to an old master of the free school from his pupils and it is very rarely i imagine that a retired schoolmaster can exhibit such trophies of gratitude and affection won from the victims of his birch rod  our kind friend kept bringing out one unexpected and wholly unexpectable thing after another as if he were a magician and had only to fling a private signal into the air and some attendant imp would hand forth any strange relic we might choose to ask for  he was especially rich in drawings by the old masters producing two or three of exquisite delicacy by raphael one by salvator a head by rembrandt and others in chalk or penandink by giordano benvenuto cellini and hands almost as famous and besides what were shown us there seemed to be an endless supply of these arttreasures in reserve  on the wall hung a crayonportrait of sterne never engraved representing him as a rather young man blooming and not uncomely it was the worldly face of a man fond of pleasure but without that ugly keen sarcastic odd expression that we see in his only engraved portrait  the picture is an original and must needs be very valuable and we wish it might be prefixed to some new and worthier biography of a writer whose character the world has always treated with singular harshness considering how much it owes him there was likewise a crayonportrait of sternes wife looking so haughty and unamiable that the wonder is not that he ultimately left her but how he ever contrived to live a week with such an awful woman  after looking at these and a great many more things than i can remember above stairs we went down to a parlor where this wonderful bookseller opened an old cabinet containing numberless drawers and looking just fit to be the repository of such knickknacks as were stored up in it he appeared to possess more treasures than he himself knew off or knew where to find but rummaging here and there he brought forth things new and old rosenobles victoria crowns gold angels double sovereigns of george iv twoguinea pieces of george ii a marriagemedal of the first napoleon only fortyfive of which were ever struck off and of which even the british museum does not contain a specimen like this in gold a brass medal three or four inches in diameter of a roman emperor together with buckles bracelets amulets and i know not what besides  there was a green silk tassel from the fringe of queen marys bed at holyrood palace  there were illuminated missals antique latin bibles and what may seem of especial interest to the historian a secretbook of queen elizabeth in manuscript written for aught i know by her own hand  on examination however it proved to contain not secrets of state but recipes for dishes drinks medicines washes and all such matters of housewifery the toilet and domestic quackery among which we were horrified by the title of one of the nostrums how to kill a fellow quickly  we never doubted that bloody queen bess might often have had occasion for such a recipe but wondered at her frankness and at her attending to these anomalous necessities in such a methodical way the truth is we had read amiss and the queen had spelt amiss the word was fellona sort of whitlownot fellow  our hospitable friend now made us drink a glass of wine as old and genuine as the curiosities of his cabinet and while sipping it we ungratefully tried to excite his envy by telling of various things interesting to an antiquary and virtuoso which we had seen in the course of our travels about england  we spoke for instance of a missal bound in solid gold and set around with jewels but of such intrinsic value as no setting could enhance for it was exquisitely illuminated throughout by the hand of raphael himself  we mentioned a little silver case which once contained a portion of the heart of louis xiv nicely done up in spices but to the owners horror and astonishment dean buckland popped the kingly morsel into his mouth and swallowed it  we told about the blackletter prayerbook of king charles the martyr used by him upon the scaffold taking which into our hands it opened of itself at the communion service and there on the lefthand page appeared a spot about as large as a sixpence of a yellowish or brownish hue a drop of the kings blood had fallen there  mr porter now accompanied us to the church but first leading us to a vacant spot of ground where old john cottons vicarage had stood till a very short time since  according to our friends description it was a humble habitation of the cottage order built of brick with a thatched roof  the site is now rudely fenced in and cultivated as a vegetable garden  in the righthand aisle of the church there is an ancient chapel which at the time of our visit was in process of restoration and was to be dedicated to mr cotton whom these english people consider as the founder of our american boston  it would contain a painted memorialwindow in honor of the old puritan minister  a festival in commemoration of the event was to take place in the ensuing july to which i had myself received an invitation but i knew too well the pains and penalties incurred by an invited guest at public festivals in england to accept it  it ought to be recorded and it seems to have made a very kindly impression on our kinsfolk here that five hundred pounds had been contributed by persons in the united states principally in boston towards the cost of the memorialwindow and the repair and restoration of the chapel  after we emerged from the chapel mr porter approached us with the vicar to whom he kindly introduced us and then took his leave  may a strangers benediction rest upon him  he is a most pleasant man rather i imagine a virtuoso than an antiquary for he seemed to value the queen of otaheites bag as highly as queen marys embroidered quilt and to have an omnivorous appetite for everything strange and rare  would that we could fill up his shelves and drawers if there are any vacant spaces left with the choicest trifles that have dropped out of times carpetbag or give him the carpetbag itself to take out what he will  the vicar looked about thirty years old a gentleman evidently assured of his position as clergymen of the established church invariably are comfortable and welltodo a scholar and a christian and fit to be a bishop knowing how to make the most of life without prejudice to the life to come  i was glad to see such a model english priest so suitably accommodated with an old english church  he kindly and courteously did the honors showing us quite round the interior giving us all the information that we required and then leaving us to the quiet enjoyment of what we came to see  the interior of saint botolphs is very fine and satisfactory as stately almost as a cathedral and has been repairedso far as repairs were necessaryin a chaste and noble style  the great eastern window is of modern painted glass but is the richest mellowest and tenderest modern window that i have ever seen the art of painting these glowing transparencies in pristine perfection being one that the world has lost the vast clear space of the interior church delighted me  there was no screennothing between the vestibule and the altar to break the long vista even the organ stood asidethough it by and by made us aware of its presence by a melodious roar  around the walls there were old engraved brasses and a stone coffin and an alabaster knight of saint john and an alabaster lady each recumbent at full length as large as life and in perfect preservation except for a slight modern touch at the tips of their noses  in the chancel we saw a great deal of oaken work quaintly and admirably carved especially about the seats formerly appropriated to the monks which were so contrived as to tumble down with a tremendous crash if the occupant happened to fall asleep  we now essayed to climb into the upper regions  up we went winding and still winding round the circular stairs till we came to the gallery beneath the stone roof of the tower whence we could look down and see the raised font and my talma lying on one of the steps and looking about as big as a pockethandkerchief  then up again up up up through a yet smaller staircase till we emerged into another stone gallery above the jackdaws and far above the roof beneath which we had before made a halt  then up another flight which led us into a pinnacle of the temple but not the highest so retracing our steps we took the right turret this time and emerged into the loftiest lantern where we saw level lincolnshire far and near though with a haze on the distant horizon  there were dusty roads a river and canals converging towards boston whicha congregation of redtiled roofslay beneath our feet with pygmy people creeping about its narrow streets  we were three hundred feet aloft and the pinnacle on which we stood is a landmark forty miles at sea  content and weary of our elevation we descended the corkscrew stairs and left the church the last object that we noticed in the interior being a bird which appeared to be at home there and responded with its cheerful notes to the swell of the organ  pausing on the churchsteps we observed that there were formerly two statues one on each side of the doorway the canopies still remaining and the pedestals being about a yard from the ground  some of mr cottons puritan parishioners are probably responsible for the disappearance of these stone saints  this doorway at the base of the tower is now much dilapidated but must once have been very rich and of a peculiar fashion  it opens its arch through a great square tablet of stone reared against the front of the tower on most of the projections whether on the tower or about the body of the church there are gargoyles of genuine gothic grotesquenessfiends beasts angels and combinations of all three and where portions of the edifice are restored the modern sculptors have tried to imitate these wild fantasies but with very poor success  extravagance and absurdity have still their law and should pay as rigid obedience to it as the primmest things on earth  in our further rambles about boston we crossed the river by a bridge and observed that the larger part of the town seems to be on that side of its navigable stream  the crooked streets and narrow lanes reminded me much of hanover street ann street and other portions of the north end of our american boston as i remember that picturesque region in my boyish days  it is not unreasonable to suppose that the local habits and recollections of the first settlers may have had some influence on the physical character of the streets and houses in the new england metropolis at any rate here is a similar intricacy of bewildering lanes and numbers of old peaked and projectingstoried dwellings such as i used to see there  it is singular what a homefeeling and sense of kindred i derived from this hereditary connection and fancied physiognomical resemblance between the old town and its wellgrown daughter and how reluctant i was after chill years of banishment to leave this hospitable place on that account  moreover it recalled some of the features of another american town my own dear native place when i saw the seafaring people leaning against posts and sitting on planks under the lee of warehousesor lolling on longboats drawn up high and dry as sailors and old wharfrats are accustomed to do in seaports of little business  in other respects the english town is more villagelike than either of the american ones  the women and budding girls chat together at their doors and exchange merry greetings with young men children chase one another in the summer twilight schoolboys sail little boats on the river or play at marbles across the flat tombstones in the churchyard and ancient men in breeches and long waistcoats wander slowly about the streets with a certain familiarity of deportment as if each one were everybodys grandfather  i have frequently observed in old english towns that old age comes forth more cheerfully and genially into the sunshine than among ourselves where the rush stir bustle and irreverent energy of youth are so preponderant that the poor forlorn grandsires begin to doubt whether they have a right to breathe in such a world any longer and so hide their silvery heads in solitude  speaking of old men i am reminded of the scholars of the boston charity school who walk about in antique longskirted blue coats and kneebreeches and with bands at their necksperfect and grotesque pictures of the costume of three centuries ago  on the morning of our departure i looked from the parlorwindow of the peacock into the marketplace and beheld its irregular square already well covered with booths and more in progress of being put up by stretching tattered sailcloth on poles  it was marketday  the dealers were arranging their commodities consisting chiefly of vegetables the great bulk of which seemed to be cabbages  later in the forenoon there was a much greater variety of merchandise basketwork both for fancy and use twigbrooms beehives oranges rustic attire all sorts of things in short that are commonly sold at a rural fair  i heard the lowing of cattle too and the bleating of sheep and found that there was a market for cows oxen and pigs in another part of the town  a crowd of townspeople and lincolnshire yeomen elbowed one another in the square mr punch was squeaking in one corner and a vagabond juggler tried to find space for his exhibition in another so that my final glimpse of boston was calculated to leave a livelier impression than my former ones  meanwhile the tower of saint botolphs looked benignantly down and i fancied it was bidding me farewell as it did mr cotton two or three hundred years ago and telling me to describe its venerable height and the town beneath it to the people of the american city who are partly akin if not to the living inhabitants of old boston yet to some of the dust that lies in its churchyard  one thing more  they have a bunker hill in the vicinity of their town and what could hardly be expected of an english community seem proud to think that their neighborhood has given name to our first and most widely celebrated and best remembered battlefield     near oxford   on a fine morning in september we set out on an excursion to blenheim the sculptor and myself being seated on the box of our fourhorse carriage two more of the party in the dicky and the others less agreeably accommodated inside  we had no coachman but two postilions in short scarlet jackets and leather breeches with topboots each astride of a horse so that all the way along when not otherwise attracted we had the interesting spectacle of their upanddown bobbing in the saddle it was a sunny and beautiful day a specimen of the perfect english weather just warm enough for comfortindeed a little too warm perhaps in the noontide sunyet retaining a mere spice or suspicion of austerity which made it all the more enjoyable  the country between oxford and blenheim is not particularly interesting being almost level or undulating very slightly nor is oxfordshire agriculturally a rich part of england  we saw one or two hamlets and i especially remember a picturesque old gabled house at a turnpikegate and altogether the wayside scenery had an aspect of oldfashioned english life but there was nothing very memorable till we reached woodstock and stopped to water our horses at the black bear  this neighborhood is called new woodstock but has by no means the brandnew appearance of an american town being a large village of stone houses most of them pretty well timeworn and weatherstained  the black bear is an ancient inn large and respectable with balustraded staircases and intricate passages and corridors and queer old pictures and engravings hanging in the entries and apartments  we ordered a lunch the most delightful of english institutions next to dinner to be ready against our return and then resumed our drive to blenheim  the parkgate of blenheim stands close to the end of the village street of woodstock  immediately on passing through its portals we saw the stately palace in the distance but made a wide circuit of the park before approaching it  this noble park contains three thousand acres of land and is fourteen miles in circumference  having been in part a royal domain before it was granted to the marlborough family it contains many trees of unsurpassed antiquity and has doubtless been the haunt of game and deer for centuries  we saw pheasants in abundance feeding in the open lawns and glades and the stags tossed their antlers and bounded away not affrighted but only shy and gamesome as we drove by  it is a magnificent pleasureground not too tamely kept nor rigidly subjected within rule but vast enough to have lapsed back into nature again after all the pains that the landscapegardeners of queen annes time bestowed on it when the domain of blenheim was scientifically laid out  the great knotted slanting trunks of the old oaks do not now look as if man had much intermeddled with their growth and postures  the trees of later date that were set out in the great dukes time are arranged on the plan of the order of battle in which the illustrious commander ranked his troops at blenheim but the ground covered is so extensive and the trees now so luxuriant that the spectator is not disagreeably conscious of their standing in military array as if orpheus had summoned them together by beat of drum  the effect must have been very formal a hundred and fifty years ago but has ceased to be soalthough the trees i presume have kept their ranks with even more fidelity than marlboroughs veterans did  one of the parkkeepers on horseback rode beside our carriage pointing out the choice views and glimpses at the palace as we drove through the domain  there is a very large artificial lake to say the truth it seemed to me fully worthy of being compared with the welsh lakes at least if not with those of westmoreland which was created by capability brown and fills the basin that he scooped for it just as if nature had poured these broad waters into one of her own valleys  it is a most beautiful object at a distance and not less so on its immediate banks for the water is very pure being supplied by a small river of the choicest transparency which was turned thitherward for the purpose and blenheim owes not merely this waterscenery but almost all its other beauties to the contrivance of man  its natural features are not striking but art has effected such wonderful things that the uninstructed visitor would never guess that nearly the whole scene was but the embodied thought of a human mind  a skilful painter hardly does more for his blank sheet of canvas than the landscapegardener the planter the arranger of trees has done for the monotonous surface of blenheimmaking the most of every undulationflinging down a hillock a big lump of earth out of a giants hand wherever it was needed putting in beauty as often as there was a niche for itopening vistas to every point that deserved to be seen and throwing a veil of impenetrable foliage around what ought to be hiddenand then to be sure the lapse of a century has softened the harsh outline of mans labors and has given the place back to nature again with the addition of what consummate science could achieve  after driving a good way we came to a battlemented tower and adjoining house which used to be the residence of the ranger of woodstock park who held charge of the property for the king before the duke of marlborough possessed it  the keeper opened the door for us and in the entrancehall we found various things that had to do with the chase and woodland sports  we mounted the staircase through several stories up to the top of the tower whence there was a view of the spires of oxford and of points much farther offvery indistinctly seen however as is usually the case with the misty distances of england  returning to the groundfloor we were ushered into the room in which died wilmot the wicked earl of rochester who was ranger of the park in charles iis time  it is a low and bare little room with a window in front and a smaller one behind and in the contiguous entranceroom there are the remains of an old bedstead beneath the canopy of which perhaps rochester may have made the penitent end that bishop burnet attributes to him  i hardly know what it is in this poor fellows character which affects us with greater tenderness on his behalf than for all the other profligates of his day who seem to have been neither better nor worse than himself  i rather suspect that he had a human heart which never quite died out of him and the warmth of which is still faintly perceptible amid the dissolute trash which he left behind  methinks if such good fortune ever befell a bookish man i should choose this lodge for my own residence with the topmost room of the tower for a study and all the seclusion of cultivated wildness beneath to ramble in there being no such possibility we drove on catching glimpses of the palace in new points of view and by and by came to rosamonds well  the particular tradition that connects fair rosamond with it is not now in my memory but if rosamond ever lived and loved and ever had her abode in the maze of woodstock it may well be believed that she and henry sometimes sat beside this spring  it gushes out from a bank through some old stonework and dashes its little cascade about as abundant as one might turn out of a large pitcher into a pool whence it steals away towards the lake which is not far removed  the water is exceedingly cold and as pure as the legendary rosamond was not and is fancied to possess medicinal virtues like springs at which saints have quenched their thirst  there were two or three old women and some children in attendance with tumblers which they present to visitors full of the consecrated water but most of us filled the tumblers for ourselves and drank  thence we drove to the triumphal pillar which was erected in honor of the great duke and on the summit of which he stands in a roman garb holding a winged figure of victory in his hand as an ordinary man might hold a bird  the column is i know not how many feet high but lofty enough at any rate to elevate marlborough far above the rest of the world and to be visible a long way off and it is so placed in reference to other objects that wherever the hero wandered about his grounds and especially as he issued from his mansion he must inevitably have been reminded of his glory  in truth until i came to blenheim i never had so positive and material an idea of what fame really isof what the admiration of his country can do for a successful warrioras i carry away with me and shall always retain  unless he had the moral force of a thousand men together his egotism beholding himself everywhere imbuing the entire soil growing in the woods rippling and gleaming in the water and pervading the very air with his greatness must have been swollen within him like the liver of a strasburg goose  on the huge tablets inlaid into the pedestal of the column the entire act of parliament bestowing blenheim on the duke of marlborough and his posterity is engraved in deep letters painted black on the marble ground  the pillar stands exactly a mile from the principal front of the palace in a straight line with the precise centre of its entrancehall so that as already said it was the dukes principal object of contemplation  we now proceeded to the palacegate which is a great pillared archway of wonderful loftiness and state giving admittance into a spacious quadrangle  a stout elderly and rather surly footman in livery appeared at the entrance and took possession of whatever canes umbrellas and parasols he could get hold of in order to claim sixpence on our departure  this had a somewhat ludicrous effect  there is much public outcry against the meanness of the present duke in his arrangements for the admission of visitors chiefly of course his native countrymen to view the magnificent palace which their forefathers bestowed upon his own  in many cases it seems hard that a private abode should be exposed to the intrusion of the public merely because the proprietor has inherited or created a splendor which attracts general curiosity insomuch that his home loses its sanctity and seclusion for the very reason that it is better than other mens houses  but in the case of blenheim the public have certainly an equitable claim to admission both because the fame of its first inhabitant is a national possession and because the mansion was a national gift one of the purposes of which was to be a token of gratitude and glory to the english people themselves  if a man chooses to be illustrious he is very likely to incur some little inconveniences himself and entail them on his posterity  nevertheless his present grace of marlborough absolutely ignores the public claim above suggested and with a thrift of which even the hero of blenheim himself did not set the example sells tickets admitting six persons at ten shillings if only one person enters the gate he must pay for six and if there are seven in company two tickets are required to admit them  the attendants who meet you everywhere in the park and palace expect fees on their own private accounttheir noble master pocketing the ten shillings  but to be sure the visitor gets his moneys worth since it buys him the right to speak just as freely of the duke of marlborough as if he were the keeper of the cremorne gardens  the above was written two or three years ago or more and the duke of that day has since transmitted his coronet to his successor who we understand has adopted much more liberal arrangements  there is seldom anything to criticise or complain of as regards the facility of obtaining admission to interesting private houses in england  passing through a gateway on the opposite side of the quadrangle we had before us the noble classic front of the palace with its two projecting wings  we ascended the lofty steps of the portal and were admitted into the entrancehall the height of which from floor to ceiling is not much less than seventy feet being the entire elevation of the edifice the hall is lighted by windows in the upper story and it being a clear bright day was very radiant with lofty sunshine amid which a swallow was flitting to and fro  the ceiling was painted by sir james thornhill in some allegorical design doubtless commemorative of marlboroughs victories the purport of which i did not take the trouble to make out contenting myself with the general effect which was most splendidly and effectively ornamental  we were guided through the showrooms by a very civil person who allowed us to take pretty much our own time in looking at the pictures  the collection is exceedingly valuablemany of these works of art having been presented to the great duke by the crowned heads of england or the continent  one room was all aglow with pictures by rubens and there were works of raphael and many other famous painters any one of which would be sufficient to illustrate the meanest house that might contain it  i remember none of then however not being in a pictureseeing mood so well as vandycks large and familiar picture of charles i on horseback with a figure and face of melancholy dignity such as never by any other hand was put on canvas  yet on considering this face of charles which i find often repeated in halflengths and translating it from the ideal into literalism i doubt whether the unfortunate king was really a handsome or impressivelooking man a high thinridged nose a meagre hatchet face and reddish hair and beardthese are the literal facts  it is the painters art that has thrown such pensive and shadowy grace around him  on our passage through this beautiful suite of apartments we saw through the vista of open doorways a boy of ten or twelve years old coming towards us from the farther rooms  he had on a straw hat a linen sack that had certainly been washed and rewashed for a summer or two and gray trousers a good deal worna dress in short which an american mother in middle station would have thought too shabby for her darling schoolboys ordinary wear  this urchins face was rather pale as those of english children are apt to be quite as often as our own but he had pleasant eyes an intelligent look and an agreeable boyish manner  it was lord sunderland grandson of the present duke and heirthough not i think in the direct lineof the blood of the great marlborough and of the title and estate  after passing through the first suite of rooms we were conducted through a corresponding suite on the opposite side of the entrancehall  these latter apartments are most richly adorned with tapestries wrought and presented to the first duke by a sisterhood of flemish nuns they look like great glowing pictures and completely cover the walls of the rooms  the designs purport to represent the dukes battles and sieges and everywhere we see the hero himself as large as life and as gorgeous in scarlet and gold as the holy sisters could make him with a threecornered hat and flowing wig reining in his horse and extending his leadingstaff in the attitude of command  next to marlborough prince eugene is the most prominent figure  in the way of upholstery there can never have been anything more magnificent than these tapestries and considered as works of art they have quite as much merit as nine pictures out of ten  one whole wing of the palace is occupied by the library a most noble room with a vast perspective length from end to end  its atmosphere is brighter and more cheerful than that of most libraries a wonderful contrast to the old collegelibraries of oxford and perhaps less sombre and suggestive of thoughtfulness than any large library ought to be inasmuch as so many studious brains as have left their deposit on the shelves cannot have conspired without producing a very serious and ponderous result  both walls and ceiling are white and there are elaborate doorways and fireplaces of white marble  the floor is of oak so highly polished that our feet slipped upon it as if it had been new england ice  at one end of the room stands a statue of queen anne in her royal robes which are so admirably designed and exquisitely wrought that the spectator certainly gets a strong conception of her royal dignity while the face of the statue fleshy and feeble doubtless conveys a suitable idea of her personal character  the marble of this work long as it has stood there is as white as snow just fallen and must have required most faithful and religious care to keep it so  as for the volumes of the library they are wired within the cases and turn their gilded backs upon the visitor keeping their treasures of wit and wisdom just as intangible as if still in the unwrought mines of human thought  i remember nothing else in the palace except the chapel to which we were conducted last and where we saw a splendid monument to the first duke and duchess sculptured by rysbrack at the cost it is said of forty thousand pounds  the design includes the statues of the deceased dignitaries and various allegorical flourishes fantasies and confusions and beneath sleep the great duke and his proud wife their veritable bones and dust and probably all the marlboroughs that have since died  it is not quite a comfortable idea that these mouldy ancestors still inhabit after their fashion the house where their successors spend the passing day but the adulation lavished upon the hero of blenheim could not have been consummated unless the palace of his lifetime had become likewise a stately mausoleum over his remains and such we felt it all to be after gazing at his tomb  the next business was to see the private gardens  an old scotch undergardener admitted us and led the way and seemed to have a fair prospect of earning the fee all by himself but by and by another respectable scotchman made his appearance and took us in charge proving to be the headgardener in person  he was extremely intelligent and agreeable talking both scientifically and lovingly about trees and plants of which there is every variety capable of english cultivation positively the garden of eden cannot have been more beautiful than this private garden of blenheim  it contains three hundred acres and by the artful circumlocution of the paths and the undulations and the skilfully interposed clumps of trees is made to appear limitless  the sylvan delights of a whole country are compressed into this space as whole fields of persian roses go to the concoction of an ounce of precious attar  the world within that gardenfence is not the same weary and dusty world with which we outside mortals are conversant it is a finer lovelier more harmonious nature and the great mother lends herself kindly to the gardeners will knowing that he will make evident the halfobliterated traits of her pristine and ideal beauty and allow her to take all the credit and praise to herself  i doubt whether there is ever any winter within that precinctany clouds except the fleecy ones of summer  the sunshine that i saw there rests upon my recollection of it as if it were eternal  the lawns and glades are like the memory of places where one has wandered when first in love  what a good and happy life might be spent in a paradise like this  and yet at that very moment the besotted duke ah i have let out a secret which i meant to keep to myself but the ten shillings must pay for all was in that very garden for the guide told us so and cautioned our young people not to be too uproarious and if in a condition for arithmetic was thinking of nothing nobler than how many tenshilling tickets had that day been sold  republican as i am i should still love to think that noblemen lead noble lives and that all this stately and beautiful environment may serve to elevate them a little way above the rest of us  if it fail to do so the disgrace falls equally upon the whole race of mortals as on themselves because it proves that no more favorable conditions of existence would eradicate our vices and weaknesses  how sad if this be so  even a herd of swine eating the acorns under those magnificent oaks of blenheim would be cleanlier and of better habits than ordinary swine  well all that i have written is pitifully meagre as a description of blenheim and i bate to leave it without some more adequate expression of the noble edifice with its rich domain all as i saw them in that beautiful sunshine for if a day had been chosen out of a hundred years it could not have been a finer one  but i must give up the attempt only further remarking that the finest trees here were cedars of which i saw oneand there may have been many suchimmense in girth and not less than three centuries old  i likewise saw a vast heap of laurel two hundred feet in circumference all growing from one root and the gardener offered to show us another growth of twice that stupendous size if the great duke himself had been buried in that spot his heroic heart could not have been the seed of a more plentiful crop of laurels  we now went back to the black bear and sat down to a cold collation of which we ate abundantly and drank in the good old english fashion a due proportion of various delightful liquors  a stranger in england in his rambles to various quarters of the country may learn little in regard to wines for the ordinary english taste is simple though sound in that particular but he makes acquaintance with more varieties of hop and malt liquor than he previously supposed to exist  i remember a sort of foaming stuff called hopchampagne which is very vivacious and appears to be a hybrid between ale and bottled cider  another excellent tipple for warm weather is concocted by mixing brownstout or bitter ale with gingerbeer the foam of which stirs up the heavier liquor from its depths forming a compound of singular vivacity and sufficient body  but of all things ever brewed from malt unless it be the trinity ale of cambridge which i drank long afterwards and which barry cornwall has celebrated in immortal verse commend me to the archdeacon as the oxford scholars call it in honor of the jovial dignitary who first taught these erudite worthies how to brew their favorite nectar  john barleycorn has given his very heart to this admirable liquor it is a superior kind of ale the prince of ales with a richer flavor and a mightier spirit than you can find elsewhere in this weary world  much have we been strengthened and encouraged by the potent blood of the archdeacon  a few days after our excursion to blenheim the same party set forth in two flies on a tour to some other places of interest in the neighborhood of oxford  it was again a delightful day and in truth every day of late had been so pleasant that it seemed as if each must be the very last of such perfect weather and yet the long succession had given us confidence in as many more to come  the climate of england has been shamefully maligned its sulkiness and asperities are not nearly so offensive as englishmen tell us their climate being the only attribute of their country which they never overvalue and the really good summerweather is the very kindest and sweetest that the world knows  we first drove to the village of cumnor about six miles from oxford and alighted at the entrance of the church  here while waiting for the keys we looked at an old wall of the churchyard piled up of loose gray stones which are said to have once formed a portion of cumnor hall celebrated in mickles ballad and scotts romance  the hall must have been in very close vicinity to the churchnot more than twenty yards off and i waded through the long dewy grass of the churchyard and tried to peep over the wall in hopes to discover some tangible and traceable remains of the edifice  but the wall was just too high to be overlooked and difficult to clamber over without tumbling down some of the stones so i took the word of one of our party who had been here before that there is nothing interesting on the other side  the churchyard is in rather a neglected state and seems not to have been mown for the benefit of the parsons cow it contains a good many gravestones of which i remember only some upright memorials of slate to individuals of the name of tabbs  soon a woman arrived with the key of the churchdoor and we entered the simple old edifice which has the pavement of lettered tombstones the sturdy pillars and low arches and other ordinary characteristics of an english country church  one or two pews probably those of the gentlefolk of the neighborhood were better furnished than the rest but all in a modest style  near the high altar in the holiest place there is an oblong angular ponderous tomb of blue marble built against the wall and surmounted by a carved canopy of the same material and over the tomb and beneath the canopy are two monumental brasses such as we oftener see inlaid into a church pavement  on these brasses are engraved the figures of a gentleman in armor and a lady in an antique garb each about a foot high devoutly kneeling in prayer and there is a long latin inscription likewise cut into the enduring brass bestowing the highest eulogies on the character of anthony forster who with his virtuous dame lies buried beneath this tombstone  his is the knightly figure that kneels above and if sir walter scott ever saw this tomb he must have had an even greater than common disbelief in laudatory epitaphs to venture on depicting anthony forster in such lines as blacken him in the romance  for my part i read the inscription in full faith and believe the poor deceased gentleman to be a muchwronged individual with good grounds for bringing an action of slander in the courts above  but the circumstance lightly as we treat it has its serious moral what nonsense it is this anxiety which so worries us about our good fame or our bad fame after death  if it were of the slightest real moment our reputations would have been placed by providence more in our own power and less in other peoples than we now find them to be  if poor anthony forster happens to have met sir walter in the other world i doubt whether he has ever thought it worth while to complain of the latters misrepresentations  we did not remain long in the church as it contains nothing else of interest and driving through the village we passed a pretty large and rather antiquelooking inn bearing the sign of the bear and ragged staff  it could not be so old however by at least a hundred years as giles goslings time nor is there any other object to remind the visitor of the elizabethan age unless it be a few ancient cottages that are perhaps of still earlier date  cumnor is not nearly so large a village nor a place of such mark as one anticipates from its romantic and legendary fame but being still inaccessible by railway it has retained more of a sylvan character than we often find in english country towns in this retired neighborhood the road is narrow and bordered with grass and sometimes interrupted by gates the hedges grow in unpruned luxuriance there is not that closeshaven neatness and trimness that characterize the ordinary english landscape  the whole scene conveys the idea of seclusion and remoteness  we met no travellers whether on foot or otherwise  i cannot very distinctly trace out this days peregrinations but after leaving cumnor a few miles behind us i think we came to a ferry over the thames where an old woman served as ferryman and pulled a boat across by means of a rope stretching from shore to shore  our two vehicles being thus placed on the other side we resumed our drivefirst glancing however at the old womans antique cottage with its stone floor and the circular settle round the kitchen fireplace which was quite in the mediaeval english style  we next stopped at stanton harcourt where we were received at the parsonage with a hospitality which we should take delight in describing if it were allowable to make public acknowledgment of the private and personal kindnesses which we never failed to find ready for our needs an american in an english house will soon adopt the opinion that the english are the very kindest people on earth and will retain that idea as long at least as he remains on the inner side of the threshold their magnetism is of a kind that repels strongly while you keep beyond a certain limit but attracts as forcibly if you get within the magic line  it was at this place if i remember right that i heard a gentleman ask a friend of mine whether he was the author of the red letter a and after some consideration for he did not seem to recognize his own book at first under this improved title our countryman responded doubtfully that he believed so  the gentleman proceeded to inquire whether our friend had spent much time in americaevidently thinking that he must have been caught young and have had a tincture of english breeding at least if not birth to speak the language so tolerably and appear so much like other people  this insular narrowness is exceedingly queer and of very frequent occurrence and is quite as much a characteristic of men of education and culture as of clowns  stanton harcourt is a very curious old place  it was formerly the seat of the ancient family of harcourt which now has its principal abode at nuneham courtney a few miles off  the parsonage is a relic of the family mansion or castle other portions of which are close at hand for across the garden rise two gray towers both of them picturesquely venerable and interesting for more than their antiquity  one of these towers in its entire capacity from height to depth constituted the kitchen of the ancient castle and is still used for domestic purposes although it has not nor ever had a chimney or we might rather say it is itself one vast chimney with a hearth of thirty feet square and a flue and aperture of the same size  there are two huge fireplaces within and the interior walls of the tower are blackened with the smoke that for centuries used to gush forth from them and climb upward seeking an exit through some wide airholes in the comical roof full seventy feet above  these lofty openings were capable of being so arranged with reference to the wind that the cooks are said to have been seldom troubled by the smoke and here no doubt they were accustomed to roast oxen whole with as little fuss and ado as a modern cook would roast a fowl  the inside of the tower is very dim and sombre being nothing but rough stone walls lighted only from the apertures above mentioned and has still a pungent odor of smoke and soot the reminiscence of the fires and feasts of generations that have passed away  methinks the extremest range of domestic economy lies between an american cookingstove and the ancient kitchen seventy dizzy feet in height and all one fireplace of stanton harcourt  nowthe place being without a parallel in england and therefore necessarily beyond the experience of an americanit is somewhat remarkable that while we stood gazing at this kitchen i was haunted and perplexed by an idea that somewhere or other i had seen just this strange spectacle beforethe height the blackness the dismal void before my eyes seemed as familiar as the decorous neatness of my grandmothers kitchen only my unaccountable memory of the scene was lighted up with an image of lurid fires blazing all round the dim interior circuit of the tower  i had never before had so pertinacious an attack as i could not but suppose it of that odd state of mind wherein we fitfully and teasingly remember some previous scene or incident of which the one now passing appears to be but the echo and reduplication though the explanation of the mystery did not for some time occur to me i may as well conclude the matter here  in a letter of popes addressed to the duke of buckingham there is an account of stanton harcourt as i now find although the name is not mentioned where he resided while translating a part of the iliad  it is one of the most admirable pieces of description in the languageplayful and picturesque with fine touches of humorous pathosand conveys as perfect a picture as ever was drawn of a decayed english countryhouse and among other rooms most of which have since crumbled down and disappeared he dashes off the grim aspect of this kitchenwhich moreover he peoples with witches engaging satan himself as headcook who stirs the infernal caldrons that seethe and bubble over the fires  this letter and others relative to his abode here were very familiar to my earlier reading and remaining still fresh at the bottom of my memory caused the weird and ghostly sensation that came over one on beholding the real spectacle that had formerly been made so vivid to my imagination  our next visit was to the church which stands close by and is quite as ancient as the remnants of the castle  in a chapel or sideaisle dedicated to the harcourts are found some very interesting family monumentsand among them recumbent on a tombstone the figure of an armed knight of the lancastrian party who was slain in the wars of the roses  his features dress and armor are painted in colors still wonderfully fresh and there still blushes the symbol of the red rose denoting the faction for which he fought and died  his head rests on a marble or alabaster helmet and on the tomb lies the veritable helmet it is to be presumed which he wore in battlea ponderous iron ease with the visor complete and remnants of the gilding that once covered it the crest is a large peacock not of metal but of wood  very possibly this helmet was but an heraldic adornment of his tomb and indeed it seems strange that it has not been stolen before now especially in cromwells time when knightly tombs were little respected and when armor was in request  however it is needless to dispute with the dead knight about the identity of his iron pot and we may as well allow it to be the very same that so often gave him the headache in his lifetime  leaning against the wall at the foot of the tomb is the shaft of a spear with a wofully tattered and utterly faded banner appended to itthe knightly banner beneath which he marshalled his followers in the field  as it was absolutely falling to pieces i tore off one little bit no bigger than a fingernail and put it into my waistcoatpocket but seeking it subsequently it was not to be found  on the opposite side of the little chapel two or three yards from this tomb is another monument on which lie side by side one of the same knightly race of harcourts and his lady  the tradition of the family is that this knight was the standardbearer of henry of richmond in the battle of bosworth field and a banner supposed to be the same that he carried now droops over his effigy  it is just such a colorless silk rag as the one already described  the knight has the order of the garter on his knee and the lady wears it on her left arm an odd place enough for a garter but if worn in its proper locality it could not be decorously visible  the complete preservation and good condition of these statues even to the minutest adornment of the sculpture and their very nosesthe most vulnerable part of a marble man as of a living oneare miraculous  except in westminster abbey among the chapels of the kings i have seen none so well preserved  perhaps they owe it to the loyalty of oxfordshire diffused throughout its neighborhood by the influence of the university during the great civil war and the rule of the parliament  it speaks well too for the upright and kindly character of this old family that the peasantry among whom they had lived for ages did not desecrate their tombs when it might have been done with impunity  there are other and more recent memorials of the harcourts one of which is the tomb of the last lord who died about a hundred years ago  his figure like those of his ancestors lies on the top of his tomb clad not in armor but in his robes as a peer  the title is now extinct but the family survives in a younger branch and still holds this patrimonial estate though they have long since quitted it as a residence  we next went to see the ancient fishponds appertaining to the mansion and which used to be of vast dietary importance to the family in catholic times and when fish was not otherwise attainable  there are two or three or more of these reservoirs one of which is of very respectable sizelarge enough indeed to be really a picturesque object with its grassgreen borders and the trees drooping over it and the towers of the castle and the church reflected within the weedgrown depths of its smooth mirror  a sweet fragrance as it were of ancient time and present quiet and seclusion was breathing all around the sunshine of today had a mellow charm of antiquity in its brightness  these ponds are said still to breed abundance of such fish as love deep and quiet waters but i saw only some minnows and one or two snakes which were lying among the weeds on the top of the water sunning and bathing themselves at once  i mentioned that there were two towers remaining of the old castle the one containing the kitchen we have already visited the other still more interesting is next to be described  it is some seventy feet high gray and reverend but in excellent repair though i could not perceive that anything had been done to renovate it  the basement story was once the family chapel and is of course still a consecrated spot  at one corner of the tower is a circular turret within which a narrow staircase with worn steps of stone winds round and round as it climbs upward giving access to a chamber on each floor and finally emerging on the battlemented roof  ascending this turretstair and arriving at the third story we entered a chamber not large though occupying the whole area of the tower and lighted by a window on each side  it was wainscoted from floor to ceiling with dark oak and had a little fireplace in one of the corners  the windowpanes were small and set in lead  the curiosity of this room is that it was once the residence of pope and that he here wrote a considerable part of the translation of isomer and likewise no doubt the admirable letters to which i have referred above  the room once contained a record by himself scratched with a diamond on one of the windowpanes since removed for safekeeping to nuneham courtney where it was shown me purporting that he had here finished the fifth book of the iliad on such a day  a poet has a fragrance about him such as no other human being is gifted withal it is indestructible and clings forevermore to everything that he has touched  i was not impressed at blenheim with any sense that the mighty duke still haunted the palace that was created for him but here after a century and a half we are still conscious of the presence of that decrepit little figure of queen annes time although he was merely a casual guest in the old tower during one or two summer months however brief the time and slight the connection his spirit cannot be exorcised so long as the tower stands  in my mind moreover pope or any other person with an available claim is right in adhering to the spot dead or alive for i never saw a chamber that i should like better to inhabitso comfortably small in such a safe and inaccessible seclusion and with a varied landscape from each window  one of them looks upon the church close at hand and down into the green churchyard extending almost to the foot of the tower the others have views wide and far over a gently undulating tract of country  if desirous of a loftier elevation about a dozen more steps of the turretstair will bring the occupant to the summit of the towerwhere pope used to come no doubt in the summer evenings and peeppoor little shrimp that he was through the embrasures of the battlement  from stanton harcourt we drovei forget how farto a point where a boat was waiting for us upon the thames or some other stream for i am ashamed to confess my ignorance of the precise geographical whereabout we were at any rate some miles above oxford and i should imagine pretty near one of the sources of englands mighty river  it was little more than wide enough for the boat with extended oars to pass shallow too and bordered with bulrushes and waterweeds which in some places quite overgrew the surface of the river from bank to bank  the shores were flat and meadowlike and sometimes the boatman told us are overflowed by the rise of the stream  the water looked clean and pure but not particularly transparent though enough so to show us that the bottom is very much weedgrown and i was told that the weed is an american production brought to england with importations of timber and now threatening to choke up the thames and other english rivers  i wonder it does not try its obstructive powers upon the merrimack the connecticut or the hudsonnot to speak of the st lawrence or the mississippi  it was an open boat with cushioned seats astern comfortably accommodating our party the day continued sunny and warm and perfectly still the boatman well trained to his business managed the oars skilfully and vigorously and we went down the stream quite as swiftly as it was desirable to go the scene being so pleasant and the passing hours so thoroughly agreeable  the river grew a little wider and deeper perhaps as we glided on but was still an inconsiderable stream for it had a good deal more than a hundred miles to meander through before it should bear fleets on its bosom and reflect palaces and towers and parliament houses and dingy and sordid piles of various structure as it rolled two and fro with the tide dividing london asunder  not in truth that i ever saw any edifice whatever reflected in its turbid breast when the sylvan stream as we beheld it now is swollen into the thames at london  once on our voyage we had to land while the boatman and some other persons drew our skiff round some rapids which we could not otherwise have passed another time the boat went through a lock  we meanwhile stepped ashore to examine the ruins of the old nunnery of godstowe where fair rosamond secluded herself after being separated from her royal lover  there is a long line of ruinous wall and a shattered tower at one of the angles the whole much ivygrownbrimming over indeed with clustering ivy which is rooted inside of the walls  the nunnery is now i believe held in lease by the city of oxford which has converted its precincts into a barnyard  the gate was under lock and key so that we could merely look at the outside and soon resumed our places in the boat  at three oclock or thereabouts or sooner or laterfor i took little heed of time and only wished that these delightful wanderings might last forever we reached folly bridge at oxford  here we took possession of a spacious barge with a house in it and a comfortable diningroom or drawingroom within the house and a level roof on which we could sit at ease or dance if so inclined  these barges are common at oxfordsome very splendid ones being owned by the students of the different colleges or by clubs  they are drawn by horses like canalboats and a horse being attached to our own barge he trotted off at a reasonable pace and we slipped through the water behind him with a gentle and pleasant motion which save for the constant vicissitude of cultivated scenery was like no motion at all  it was life without the trouble of living nothing was ever more quietly agreeable  in this happy state of mind and body we gazed at christ church meadows as we passed and at the receding spires and towers of oxford and on a good deal of pleasant variety along the banks young men rowing or fishing troops of naked boys bathing as if this were arcadia in the simplicity of the golden age countryhouses cottages waterside inns all with something fresh about them as not being sprinkled with the dust of the highway  we were a large party now for a number of additional guests had joined us at folly bridge and we comprised poets novelists scholars sculptors painters architects men and women of renown dear friends genial outspoken openhearted englishmenall voyaging onward together like the wise ones of gotham in a bowl  i remember not a single annoyance except indeed that a swarm of wasps came aboard of us and alighted on the head of one of our young gentlemen attracted by the scent of the pomatum which he had been rubbing into his hair  he was the only victim and his small trouble the one little flaw in our days felicity to put us in mind that we were mortal  meanwhile a table had been laid in the interior of our barge and spread with cold ham cold fowl cold pigeonpie cold beef and other substantial cheer such as the english love and yankees toobesides tarts and cakes and pears and plumsnot forgetting of course a goodly provision of port sherry and champagne and bitter ale which is like mothers milk to an englishman and soon grows equally acceptable to his american cousin  by the time these matters had been properly attended to we had arrived at that part of the thames which passes by nuneham courtney a fine estate belonging to the harcourts and the present residence of the family  here we landed and climbing a steep slope from the riverside paused a moment or two to look at an architectural object called the carfax the purport of which i do not well understand  thence we proceeded onward through the loveliest park and woodland scenery i ever saw and under as beautiful a declining sunshine as heaven ever shed over earth to the stately mansionhouse  as we here cross a private threshold it is not allowable to pursue my feeble narrative of this delightful day with the same freedom as heretofore so perhaps i may as well bring it to a close  i may mention however that i saw the library a fine large apartment hung round with portraits of eminent literary men principally of the last century most of whom were familiar guests of the harcourts  the house itself is about eighty years old and is built in the classic style as if the family had been anxious to diverge as far as possible from the gothic picturesqueness of their old abode at stanton harcourt  the grounds were laid out in part by capability brown and seemed to me even more beautiful than those of blenheim  mason the poet a friend of the house gave the design of a portion of the garden  of the whole place i will not be niggardly of my rude transatlantic praise but be bold to say that it appeared to me as perfect as anything earthly can heutterly and entirely finished as if the years and generations had done all that the hearts and minds of the successive owners could contrive for a spot they dearly loved  such homes as nuneham courtney are among the splendid results of long hereditary possession and we republicans whose households melt away like newfallen snow in a spring morning must content ourselves with our many counterbalancing advantages for this one so apparently desirable to the farprojecting selfishness of our nature we are certain never to attain  it must not be supposed nevertheless that nuneham courtney is one of the great showplaces of england  it is merely a fair specimen of the better class of countryseats and has a hundred rivals and many superiors in the features of beauty and expansive manifold redundant comfort which most impressed me  a moderate man might be content with such a homethat is all  and now i take leave of oxford without even an attempt to describe it there being no literary faculty attainable or conceivable by me which can avail to put it adequately or even tolerably upon paper  it must remain its own sole expression and those whose sad fortune it may be never to behold it have no better resource than to dream about gray weatherstained ivygrown edifices wrought with quaint gothic ornament and standing around grassy quadrangles where cloistered walks have echoed to the quiet footsteps of twenty generationslawns and gardens of luxurious repose shadowed with canopies of foliage and lit up with sunny glimpses through archways of great boughsspires towers and turrets each with its history and legenddimly magnificent chapels with painted windows of rare beauty and brilliantly diversified hues creating an atmosphere of richest gloomvast collegehalls highwindowed oakenpanelled and hung round with portraits of the men in every age whom the university has nurtured to be illustriouslong vistas of alcoved libraries where the wisdom and learned folly of all time is shelvedkitchens we throw in this feature by way of ballast and because it would not be english oxford without its beef and beer with huge fireplaces capable of roasting a hundred joints at onceand cavernous cellars where rows of piledup hogsheads seethe and fume with that mighty maltliquor which is the true milk of alma mater make all these things vivid in your dream and you will never know nor believe how inadequate is the result to represent even the merest outside of oxford  we feel a genuine reluctance to conclude this article without making our grateful acknowledgments by name to a gentleman whose overflowing kindness was the main condition of all our sightseeings and enjoyments delightful as will always be our recollection of oxford and its neighborhood we partly suspect that it owes much of its happy coloring to the genial medium through which the objects were presented to usto the kindly magic of a hospitality unsurpassed within our experience in the quality of making the guest contented with his host with himself and everything about him  he has inseparably mingled his image with our remembrance of the spires of oxford     some of the haunts of burns   we left carlisle at a little past eleven and within the halfhour were at gretna green  thence we rushed onward into scotland through a flat and dreary tract of country consisting mainly of desert and bog where probably the mosstroopers were accustomed to take refuge after their raids into england  anon however the hills hove themselves up to view occasionally attaining a height which might almost be called mountainous in about two hours we reached dumfries and alighted at the station there  chill as the scottish summer is reputed to be we found it an awfully hot day not a whit less so than the day before but we sturdily adventured through the burning sunshine up into the town inquiring our way to the residence of burns  the street leading from the station is called shakespeare street and at its farther extremity we read burns street on a cornerhouse the avenue thus designated having been formerly known as millhole brae  it is a vile lane paved with small hard stones from side to side and bordered by cottages or mean houses of whitewashed stone joining one to another along the whole length of the street  with not a tree of course or a blade of grass between the pavingstones the narrow lane was as hot as topbet and reeked with a genuine scotch odor being infested with unwashed children and altogether in a state of chronic filth although some women seemed to be hopelessly scrubbing the thresholds of their wretched dwellings  i never saw an outskirt of a town less fit for a poets residence or in which it would be more miserable for any man of cleanly predilections to spend his days  we asked for burnss dwelling and a woman pointed across the street to a twostory house built of stone and whitewashed like its neighbors but perhaps of a little more respectable aspect than most of them though i hesitate in saying so  it was not a separate structure but under the same continuous roof with the next  there was an inscription on the door hearing no reference to burns but indicating that the house was now occupied by a ragged or industrial school  on knocking we were instantly admitted by a servantgirl who smiled intelligently when we told our errand and showed us into a low and very plain parlor not more than twelve or fifteen feet square  a young woman who seemed to be a teacher in the school soon appeared and told us that this had been burnss usual sittingroom and that he had written many of his songs here  she then led us up a narrow staircase into a little bedchamber over the parlor  connecting with it there is a very small room or windowed closet which burns used as a study and the bedchamber itself was the one where he slept in his later lifetime and in which he died at last altogether it is an exceedingly unsuitable place for a pastoral and rural poet to live or die ineven more unsatisfactory than shakespeares house which has a certain homely picturesqueness that contrasts favorably with the suburban sordidness of the abode before us the narrow lane the pavingstones and the contiguity of wretched hovels are depressing to remember and the steam of them such is our human weakness might almost make the poets memory less fragrant  as already observed it was an intolerably hot day  after leaving the house we found our way into the principal street of the town which it may be fair to say is of very different aspect from the wretched outskirt above described  entering a hotel in which as a dumfries guidebook assured us prince charles edward had once spent a night we rested and refreshed ourselves and then set forth in quest of the mausoleum of burns  coming to st michaels church we saw a man digging a grave and scrambling out of the hole he let us into the churchyard which was crowded full of monuments  their general shape and construction are peculiar to scotland being a perpendicular tablet of marble or other stone within a framework of the same material somewhat resembling the frame of a lookingglass and all over the churchyard those sepulchral memorials rise to the height of ten fifteen or twenty feet forming quite an imposing collection of monuments but inscribed with names of small general significance  it was easy indeed to ascertain the rank of those who slept below for in scotland it is the custom to put the occupation of the buried personage as skinner shoemaker flesher on his tombstone  as another peculiarity wives are buried under their maiden names instead of those of their husbands thus giving a disagreeable impression that the married pair have bidden each other an eternal farewell on the edge of the grave  there was a footpath through this crowded churchyard sufficiently well worn to guide us to the grave of burns but a woman followed behind us who it appeared kept the key of the mausoleum and was privileged to show it to strangers  the monument is a sort of grecian temple with pilasters and a dome covering a space of about twenty feet square  it was formerly open to all the inclemencies of the scotch atmosphere but is now protected and shut in by large squares of rough glass each pane being of the size of one whole side of the structure  the woman unlocked the door and admitted us into the interior  inlaid into the floor of the mausoleum is the gravestone of burnsthe very same that was laid over his grave by jean armour before this monument was built  displayed against the surrounding wall is a marble statue of burns at the plough with the genius of caledonia summoning the ploughman to turn poet methought it was not a very successful piece of work for the plough was better sculptured than the man and the man though heavy and cloddish was more effective than the goddess  our guide informed us that an old man of ninety who knew burns certifies this statue to be very like the original  the bones of the poet and of jean armour and of some of their children lie in the vault over which we stood  our guide who was intelligent in her own plain way and very agreeable to talk withal said that the vault was opened about three weeks ago on occasion of the burial of the eldest son of burns  the poets bones were disturbed and the dry skull once so brimming over with powerful thought and bright and tender fantasies was taken away and kept for several days by a dumfries doctor  it has since been deposited in a new leaden coffin and restored to the vault we learned that there is a surviving daughter of burnss eldest son and daughters likewise of the two younger sonsand besides these an illegitimate posterity by the eldest son who appears to have been of disreputable life in his younger days  he inherited his fathers failings with some faint shadow i have also understood of the great qualities which have made the world tender of his fathers vices and weaknesses  we listened readily enough to this paltry gossip but found that it robbed the poets memory of some of the reverence that was its due indeed this talk over his grave had very much the same tendency and effect as the homescene of his life which we had been visiting just previously  beholding his poor mean dwelling and its surroundings and picturing his outward life and earthly manifestations from these one does not so much wonder that the people of that day should have failed to recognize all that was admirable and immortal in a disreputable drunken shabbily clothed and shabbily housed man consorting with associates of damaged character and as his only ostensible occupation gauging the whiskey which he too often tasted  siding with burns as we needs must in his plea against the world let us try to do the world a little justice too  it is far easier to know and honor a poet when his fame has taken shape in the spotlessness of marble than when the actual man comes staggering before you besmeared with the sordid stains of his daily life  for my part i chiefly wonder that his recognition dawned so brightly while he was still living  there must have been something very grand in his immediate presence some strangely impressive characteristic in his natural behavior to have caused him to seem like a demigod so soon  as we went back through the churchyard we saw a spot where nearly four hundred inhabitants of dumfries were buried during the cholera year and also some curious old monuments with raised letters the inscriptions on which were not sufficiently legible to induce us to puzzle them out but i believe they mark the restingplaces of old covenanters some of whom were killed by claverhouse and his fellowruffians  st michaels church is of red freestone and was built about a hundred years ago on an old catholic foundation  our guide admitted us into it and showed us in the porch a very pretty little marble figure of a child asleep with a drapery over the lower part from beneath which appeared its two baby feet  it was truly a sweet little statue and the woman told us that it represented a child of the sculptor and that the baby here still in its marble infancy had died more than twentysix years ago  many ladies she said especially such as had ever lost a child had shed tears over it  it was very pleasant to think of the sculptor bestowing the best of his genius and art to recreate his tender child in stone and to make the representation as soft and sweet as the original but the conclusion of the story has something that jars with our awakened sensibilities  a gentleman from london had seen the statue and was so much delighted with it that he bought it of the fatherartist after it had lain above a quarter of a century in the churchporch  so this was not the real tender image that came out of the fathers heart he had sold that truest one for a hundred guineas and sculptured this mere copy to replace it  the first figure was entirely naked in its earthly and spiritual innocence  the copy as i have said above has a drapery over the lower limbs  but after all if we come to the truth of the matter the sleeping baby may be as fully reposited in the drawingroom of a connoisseur as in a cold and dreary churchporch  we went into the church and found it very plain and naked without altardecorations and having its floor quite covered with unsightly wooden pews  the woman led us to a pew cornering on one of the sideaisles and telling us that it used to be burnss familypew showed us his seat which is in the corner by the aisle  it is so situated that a sturdy pillar hid him from the pulpit and from the ministers eye for robin was no great friends with the ministers said she  this touchhis seat behind the pillar and burns himself nodding in sermontime or keenly observant of profane thingsbrought him before us to the life  in the cornerseat of the next pew right before burns and not more than two feet off sat the young lady on whom the poet saw that unmentionable parasite which he has immortalized in song  we were ungenerous enough to ask the ladys name but the good woman could not tell it  this was the last thing which we saw in dumfries worthy of record and it ought to be noted that our guide refused some money which my companion offered her because i had already paid her what she deemed sufficient  at the railwaystation we spent more than a weary hour waiting for the train which at last came up and took us to mauchline  we got into an omnibus the only conveyance to be had and drove about a mile to the village where we established ourselves at the loudoun hotel one of the veriest country inns which we have found in great britain  the town of mauchline a place more redolent of burns than almost any other consists of a street or two of contiguous cottages mostly whitewashed and with thatched roofs  it has nothing sylvan or rural in the immediate village and is as ugly a place as mortal man could contrive to make or to render uglier through a succession of untidy generations  the fashion of paving the village street and patching one shabby house on the gableend of another quite shuts out all verdure and pleasantness but i presume we are not likely to see a more genuine old scotch village such as they used to be in burnss time and long before than this of mauchline  the church stands about midway up the street and is built of red freestone very simple in its architecture with a square tower and pinnacles  in this sacred edifice and its churchyard was the scene of one of burnss most characteristic productions the holy fair  almost directly opposite its gate across the village street stands posie nansies inn where the jolly beggars congregated  the latter is a twostory redstone thatched house looking old but by no means venerable like a drunken patriarch  it has small oldfashioned windows and may well have stood for centuriesthough seventy or eighty years ago when burns was conversant with it i should fancy it might have been something better than a beggars alehouse  the whole town of mauchline looks rusty and timeworneven the newer houses of which there are several being shadowed and darkened by the general aspect of the place  when we arrived all the wretched little dwellings seemed to have belched forth their inhabitants into the warm summer evening everybody was chatting with everybody on the most familiar terms the barelegged children gambolled or quarrelled uproariously and came freely moreover and looked into the window of our parlor  when we ventured out we were followed by the gaze of the old town people standing in their doorways old women popping their heads from the chamberwindows and stalwart men idle on saturday at een after their weeks hard laborclustering at the streetcorners merely to stare at our unpretending selves  except in some remote little town of italy where besides the inhabitants had the intelligible stimulus of beggary i have never been honored with nearly such an amount of public notice  the next forenoon my companion put me to shame by attending church after vainly exhorting me to do the like and it being sacrament sunday and my poor friend being wedged into the farther end of a closely filled pew he was forced to stay through the preaching of four several sermons and came back perfectly exhausted and desperate  he was somewhat consoled however on finding that he had witnessed a spectacle of scotch manners identical with that of burnss holy fair on the very spot where the poet located that immortal description  by way of further conformance to the customs of the country we ordered a sheeps head and the broth and did penance accordingly and at five oclock we took a fly and set out for burnss farm of moss giel  moss giel is not more than a mile from mauchline and the road extends over a high ridge of land with a view of far hills and green slopes on either side  just before we reached the farm the driver stopped to point out a hawthorn growing by the wayside which he said was burnss lousie thorn and i devoutly plucked a branch although i have really forgotten where or how this illustrious shrub has been celebrated  we then turned into a rude gateway and almost immediately came to the farmhouse of moss giel standing some fifty yards removed from the highroad behind a tall hedge of hawthorn and considerably overshadowed by trees  the house is a whitewashed stone cottage like thousands of others in england and scotland with a thatched roof on which grass and weeds have intruded a picturesque though alien growth  there is a door and one window in front besides another little window that peeps out among the thatch  close by the cottage and extending back at right angles from it so as to enclose the farmyard are two other buildings of the same size shape and general appearance as the house any one of the three looks just as fit for a human habitation as the two others and all three look still more suitable for donkeystables and pigsties  as we drove into the farmyard bounded on three sides by these three hovels a large dog began to bark at us and some women and children made their appearance but seemed to demur about admitting us because the master and mistress were very religious people and had not yet come back from the sacrament at mauchline  however it would not do to be turned back from the very threshold of robert burns and as the women seemed to be merely straggling visitors and nobody at all events had a right to send us away we went into the back door and turning to the right entered a kitchen  it showed a deplorable lack of housewifely neatness and in it there were three or four children one of whom a girl eight or nine years old held a baby in her arms  she proved to be the daughter of the people of the house and gave us what leave she could to look about us  thence we stepped across the narrow midpassage of the cottage into the only other apartment below stairs a sittingroom where we found a young man eating broad and cheese  he informed us that he did not live there and had only called in to refresh himself on his way home from church  this room like the kitchen was a noticeably poor one and besides being all that the cottage had to show for a parlor it was a sleepingapartment having two beds which might be curtained off on occasion  the young man allowed us liberty so far as in him lay to go up stairs  up we crept accordingly and a few steps brought us to the top of the staircase over the kitchen where we found the wretchedest little sleepingchamber in the world with a sloping roof under the thatch and two beds spread upon the bare floor  this most probably was burnss chamber or perhaps it may have been that of his mothers servantmaid and in either case this rude floor at one time or another must have creaked beneath the poets midnight tread  on the opposite side of the passage was the door of another atticchamber opening which i saw a considerable number of cheeses on the floor  the whole house was pervaded with a frowzy smell and also a dunghill odor and it is not easy to understand how the atmosphere of such a dwelling can be any more agreeable or salubrious morally than it appeared to be physically  no virgin surely could keep a holy awe about her while stowed higgledypiggledy with coarsenatured rustics into this narrowness and filth  such a habitation is calculated to make beasts of men and women and it indicates a degree of barbarism which i did not imagine to exist in scotland that a tiller of broad fields like the farmer of mauchline should have his abode in a pigsty  it is sad to think of anybodynot to say a poet but any human beingsleeping eating thinking praying and spending all his homelife in this miserable hovel but methinks i never in the least knew how to estimate the miracle of burnss genius nor his heroic merit for being no worse man until i thus learned the squalid hindrances amid which he developed himself  space a free atmosphere and cleanliness have a vast deal to do with the possibilities of human virtue  the biographers talk of the farm of moss giel as being damp and unwholesome but i do not see why outside of the cottagewalls it should possess so evil a reputation  it occupies a high broad ridge enjoying surely whatever benefit can come of a breezy site and sloping far downward before any marshy soil is reached  the high hedge and the trees that stand beside the cottage give it a pleasant aspect enough to one who does not know the grimy secrets of the interior and the summer afternoon was now so bright that i shall remember the scene with a great deal of sunshine over it  leaving the cottage we drove through a field which the driver told us was that in which burns turned up the mouses nest  it is the enclosure nearest to the cottage and seems now to be a pasture and a rather remarkably unfertile one  a little farther on the ground was whitened with an immense number of daisiesdaisies daisies everywhere and in answer to my inquiry the driver said that this was the field where burns ran his ploughshare over the daisy  if so the soil seems to have been consecrated to daisies by the song which he bestowed on that first immortal one  i alighted and plucked a whole handful of these wee modest crimsontipped flowers which will be precious to many friends in our own country as coming from burnss farm and being of the same race and lineage as that daisy which he turned into an amaranthine flower while seeming to destroy it  from moss giel we drove through a variety of pleasant scenes some of which were familiar to us by their connection with burns  we skirted too along a portion of the estate of auchinleck which still belongs to the boswell familythe present possessor being sir james boswell sir james boswell is now dead a grandson of johnsons friend and son of the sir alexander who was killed in a duel  our driver spoke of sir james as a kind freehearted man but addicted to horseraces and similar pastimes and a little too familiar with the winecup so that poor bozzys booziness would appear to have become hereditary in his ancient line  there is no male heir to the estate of auchinleck  the portion of the lands which we saw is covered with wood and much undermined with rabbitwarrens nor though the territory extends over a large number of acres is the income very considerable  by and by we came to the spot where burns saw miss alexander the lass of ballochmyle  it was on a bridge which or more probably a bridge that has succeeded to the old one and is made of iron crosses from bank to bank high in air over a deep gorge of the road so that the young lady may have appeared to burns like a creature between earth and sky and compounded chiefly of celestial elements  but in honest truth the great charm of a woman in burnss eyes was always her womanhood and not the angelic mixture which other poets find in her  our driver pointed out the course taken by the lass of ballochmyle through the shrubbery to a rock on the banks of the lugar where it seems to be the tradition that burns accosted her  the song implies no such interview  lovers of whatever condition high or low could desire no lovelier scene in which to breathe their vows the river flowing over its pebbly bed sometimes gleaming into the sunshine sometimes hidden deep in verdure and here and there eddying at the foot of high and precipitous cliffs  this beautiful estate of ballochmyle is still held by the family of alexanders to whom burnss song has given renown on cheaper terms than any other set of people ever attained it  how slight the tenure seems  a young lady happened to walk out one summer afternoon and crossed the path of a neighboring farmer who celebrated the little incident in four or five warm rude at least not refined though rather ambitiousand somewhat ploughmanlike verses  burns has written hundreds of better things but henceforth for centuries that maiden has free admittance into the dreamland of beautiful women and she and all her race are famous  i should like to know the present head of the family and ascertain what value if any the members of it put upon the celebrity thus won  we passed through catrine known hereabouts as the clean village of scotland  certainly as regards the point indicated it has greatly the advantage of mauchline whither we now returned without seeing anything else worth writing about  there was a rainstorm during the night and in the morning the rusty old sloping street of mauchline was glistening with wet while frequent showers came spattering down  the intense heat of many days past was exchanged for a chilly atmosphere much more suitable to a strangers idea of what scotch temperature ought to be  we found after breakfast that the first train northward had already gone by and that we must wait till nearly two oclock for the next  i merely ventured out once during the forenoon and took a brief walk through the village in which i have left little to describe  its chief business appears to be the manufacture of snuffboxes  there are perhaps five or six shops or more including those licensed to sell only tea and tobacco the best of them have the characteristics of village stores in the united states dealing in a small way with an extensive variety of articles  i peeped into the open gateway of the churchyard and saw that the ground was absolutely stuffed with dead people and the surface crowded with gravestones both perpendicular and horizontal  all burnss old mauchline acquaintance are doubtless there and the armours among them except bonny jean who sleeps by her poets side  the family of armour is now extinct in mauchline  arriving at the railwaystation we found a tall elderly comely gentleman walking to and fro and waiting for the train  he proved to be a mr alexanderit may fairly be presumed the alexander of ballochmyle a blood relation of the lovely lass  wonderful efficacy of a poets verse that could shed a glory from long ago on this old gentlemans white hair  these alexanders by the by are not an old family on the ballochmyle estate the father of the lass having made a fortune in trade and established himself as the first landed proprietor of his name in these parts  the original family was named whitefoord  our ride to ayr presented nothing very remarkable and indeed a cloudy and rainy day takes the varnish off the scenery and causes a woful diminution in the beauty and impressiveness of everything we see  much of our way lay along a flat sandy level in a southerly direction  we reached ayr in the midst of hopeless rain and drove to the kings arms hotel  in the intervals of showers i took peeps at the town which appeared to have many modern or modernfronted edifices although there are likewise tall gray gabled and quaintlooking houses in the bystreets here and there betokening an ancient place  the town lies on both sides of the ayr which is here broad and stately and bordered with dwellings that look from their windows directly down into the passing tide  i crossed the river by a modern and handsome stone bridge and recrossed it at no great distance by a venerable structure of four gray arches which must have bestridden the stream ever since the early days of scottish history  these are the two briggs of ayr whose midnight conversation was overheard by burns while other auditors were aware only of the rush and rumble of the wintry stream among the arches  the ancient bridge is steep and narrow and paved like a street and defended by a parapet of red freestone except at the two ends where some mean old shops allow scanty room for the pathway to creep between  nothing else impressed me hereabouts unless i mention that during the rain the women and girls went about the streets of ayr barefooted to save their shoes  the next morning wore a lowering aspect as if it felt itself destined to be one of many consecutive days of storm  after a good scotch breakfast however of fresh herrings and eggs we took a fly and started at a little past ten for the banks of the doon  on our way at about two miles from ayr we drew up at a roadside cottage on which was an inscription to the effect that robert burns was born within its walls it is now a publichouse and of course we alighted and entered its little sittingroom which as we at present see it is a neat apartment with the modern improvement of a ceiling  the walls are much overscribbled with names of visitors and the wooden door of a cupboard in the wainscot as well as all the other woodwork of the room is cut and carved with initial letters  so likewise are two tables which having received a coat of varnish over the inscriptions form really curious and interesting articles of furniture  i have seldom though i do not personally adopt this mode of illustrating my bumble name felt inclined to ridicule the natural impulse of most people thus to record themselves at the shrines of poets and heroes  on a panel let into the wall in a corner of the room is a portrait of burns copied from the original picture by nasmyth  the floor of this apartment is of boards which are probably a recent substitute for the ordinary flagstones of a peasants cottage  there is but one other room pertaining to the genuine birthplace of robert burns it is the kitchen into which we now went  it has a floor of flagstones even ruder than those of shakespeares housethough perhaps not so strangely cracked and broken as the latter over which the hoof of satan himself might seem to have been trampling  a new window has been opened through the wall towards the road but on the opposite side is the little original window of only four small panes through which came the first daylight that shone upon the scottish poet  at the side of the room opposite the fireplace is a recess containing a bed which can be hidden by curtains  in that humble nook of all places in the world providence was pleased to deposit the germ of the richest human life which mankind then had within its circumference  these two rooms as i have said make up the whole sum and substance of burnss birthplace for there were no chambers nor even attics and the thatched roof formed the only ceiling of kitchen and sittingroom the height of which was that of the whole house  the cottage however is attached to another edifice of the same size and description as these little habitations often are and moreover a splendid addition has been made to it since the poets renown began to draw visitors to the wayside alehouse  the old woman of the house led us through an entry and showed a vaulted hall of no vast dimensions to be sure but marvellously large and splendid as compared with what might be anticipated from the outward aspect of the cottage  it contained a bust of burns and was hung round with pictures and engravings principally illustrative of his life and poems  in this part of the house too there is a parlor fragrant with tobaccosmoke and no doubt many a noggin of whiskey is here quaffed to the memory of the bard who professed to draw so much inspiration from that potent liquor  we bought some engravings of kirk alloway the bridge of doon and the monument and gave the old woman a fee besides and took our leave  a very short drive farther brought us within sight of the monument and to the hotel situated close by the entrance of the ornamental grounds within which the former is enclosed  we rang the bell at the gate of the enclosure but were forced to wait a considerable time because the old man the regular superintendent of the spot had gone to assist at the laying of the cornerstone of a new kirk  he appeared anon and admitted us but immediately hurried away to be present at the concluding ceremonies leaving us locked up with burns  the enclosure around the monument is beautifully laid out as an ornamental garden and abundantly provided with rare flowers and shrubbery all tended with loving care  the monument stands on an elevated site and consists of a massive basementstory threesided above which rises a light and elegant grecian templea mere dome supported on corinthian pillars and open to all the winds  the edifice is beautiful in itself though i know not what peculiar appropriateness it may have as the memorial of a scottish rural poet  the door of the basementstory stood open and entering we saw a bust of burns in a niche looking keener more refined but not so warm and wholesouled as his pictures usually do  i think the likeness cannot be good  in the centre of the room stood a glass case in which were reposited the two volumes of the little pocket bible that burns gave to highland mary when they pledged their troth to one another  it is poorly printed on coarse paper  a verse of scripture referring to the solemnity and awfulness of vows is written within the cover of each volume in the poets own hand and fastened to one of the covers is a lock of highland marys golden hair  this bible had been carried to americaby one of her relatives but was sent back to be fitly treasured here  there is a staircase within the monument by which we ascended to the top and had a view of both briggs of doon the scene of tam oshanters misadventure being close at hand  descending we wandered through the enclosed garden and came to a little building in a corner on entering which we found the two statues of tam and sutor watponderous stonework enough yet permeated in a remarkable degree with living warmth and jovial hilarity  from this part of the garden too we again beheld the old brigg of doon over which tam galloped in such imminent and awful peril  it is a beautiful object in the landscape with one high graceful arch ivygrown and shadowed all over and around with foliage  when we had waited a good while the old gardener came telling us that he had heard an excellent prayer at laying the cornerstone of the new kirk  he now gave us some roses and sweetbrier and let us out from his pleasant garden  we immediately hastened to kirk alloway which is within two or three minutes walk of the monument  a few steps ascend from the roadside through a gate into the old graveyard in the midst of which stands the kirk  the edifice is wholly roofless but the sidewalls and gableends are quite entire though portions of them are evidently modern restorations  never was there a plainer little church or one with smaller architectural pretension no new england meetinghouse has more simplicity in its very self though poetry and fun have clambered and clustered so wildly over kirk alloway that it is difficult to see it as it actually exists  by the by i do not understand why satan and an assembly of witches should hold their revels within a consecrated precinct but the weird scene has so established itself in the worlds imaginative faith that it must be accepted as an authentic incident in spite of rule and reason to the contrary possibly some carnal minister some priest of pious aspect and hidden infidelity had dispelled the consecration of the holy edifice by his pretence of prayer and thus made it the resort of unhappy ghosts and sorcerers and devils  the interior of the kirk even now is applied to quite as impertinent a purpose as when satan and the witches used it as a dancinghall for it is divided in the midst by a wall of stonemasonry and each compartment has been converted into a family burialplace  the name on one of the monuments is crawfurd the other bore no inscription  it is impossible not to feel that these good people whoever they may be had no business to thrust their prosaic bones into a spot that belongs to the world and where their presence jars with the emotions be they sad or gay which the pilgrim brings thither  they slant us out from our own precincts toofrom that inalienable possession which burns bestowed in free gift upon mankind by taking it from the actual earth and annexing it to the domain of imagination  and here these wretched squatters have lain down to their long sleep after barring each of the two doorways of the kirk with an iron grate  may their rest be troubled till they rise and let us in  kirk alloway is inconceivably small considering how large a space it fills in our imagination before we see it  i paced its length outside of the wall and found it only seventeen of my paces and not more than ten of them in breadth  there seem to have been but very few windows all of which if i rightly remember are now blocked up with masonwork of stone  one mullioned window tall and narrow in the eastern gable might have been seen by tam oshanter blazing with devilish light as he approached along the road from ayr and there is a small and square one on the side nearest the road into which he might have peered as he sat on horseback  indeed i could easily have looked through it standing on the ground had not the opening been walled up  there is an odd kind of belfry at the peak of one of the gables with the small bell still hanging in it  and this is all that i remember of kirk alloway except that the stones of its material are gray and irregular  the road from ayr passes alloway kirk and crosses the doon by a modern bridge without swerving much from a straight line  to reach the old bridge it appears to have made a bend shortly after passing the kirk and then to have turned sharply towards the river  the new bridge is within a minutes walk of the monument and we went thither and leaned over its parapet to admire the beautiful doon flowing wildly and sweetly between its deep and wooded banks  i never saw a lovelier scene although this might have been even lovelier if a kindly sun had shone upon it  the ivygrown ancient bridge with its high arch through which we had a picture of the river and the green banks beyond was absolutely the most picturesque object in a quiet and gentle way that ever blessed my eyes  bonny doon with its wooded banks and the boughs dipping into the water  the memory of them at this moment affects me like the song of birds and burns crooning some verses simple and wild in accordance with their native melody  it was impossible to depart without crossing the very bridge of tams adventure so we went thither over a now disused portion of the road and standing on the centre of the arch gathered some ivyleaves from that sacred spot  this done we returned as speedily as might be to ayr whence taking the rail we soon beheld ailsa craig rising like a pyramid out of the sea  drawing nearer to glasgow bell lomond hove in sight with a domelike summit supported by a shoulder on each side  but a man is better than a mountain and we had been holding intercourse if not with the reality at least with the stalwart ghost of one of earths memorable sons amid the scenes where he lived and sung  we shall appreciate him better as a poet hereafter for there is no writer whose life as a man has so much to do with his fame and throws such a necessary light upon whatever he has produced  henceforth there will be a personal warmth for us in everything that he wrote and like his countrymen we shall know him in a kind of personal way as if we had shaken hands with him and felt the thrill of his actual voice     a london suburb   one of our english summers looks in the retrospect as if it had been patched with more frequent sunshine than the sky of england ordinarily affords but i believe that it may be only a moral effecta light that never was on sea nor land caused by our having found a particularly delightful abode in the neighborhood of london  in order to enjoy it however i was compelled to solve the problem of living in two places at oncean impossibility which i so far accomplished as to vanish at frequent intervals out of mens sight and knowledge on one side of england and take my place in a circle of familiar faces on the other so quietly that i seemed to have been there all along  it was the easier to get accustomed to our new residence because it was not only rich in all the material properties of a home but had also the homelike atmosphere the household element which is of too intangible a character to be let even with the most thoroughly furnished lodginghouse  a friend had given us his suburban residence with all its conveniences elegances and snuggeriesits drawingrooms and library still warm and bright with the recollection of the genial presences that we had known there its closets chambers kitchen and even its winecellar if we could have availed ourselves of so dear and delicate a trustits lawn and cosey gardennooks and whatever else makes up the multitudinous idea of an english homehe had transferred it all to us pilgrims and dusty wayfarers that we might rest and take our ease during his summers absence on the continent  we had long been dwelling in tents as it were and morally shivering by hearths which heap the bituminous coal upon them as we might no blaze could render cheerful  i remember to this day the dreary feeling with which i sat by our first english fireside and watched the chill and rainy twilight of an autumn day darkening down upon the garden while the portrait of the preceding occupant of the house evidently a most unamiable personage in his lifetime scowled inhospitably from above the mantelpiece as if indignant that an american should try to make himself at home there possibly it may appease his sulky shade to know that i quitted his abode as much a stranger as i entered it  but mow at last we were in a genuine british home where refined and warmhearted people had just been living their daily life and had left us a summers inheritance of slowly ripened days such as a strangers hasty opportunities so seldom permit him to enjoy  within so trifling a distance of the central spot of all the world which as americans have at present no centre of their own we may allow to be somewhere in the vicinity we will say of st pauls cathedral it might have seemed natural that i should be tossed about by the turbulence of the vast london whirlpool  but i had drifted into a still eddy where conflicting movements made a repose and wearied with a good deal of uncongenial activity i found the quiet of my temporary haven more attractive than anything that the great town could offer  i already knew london well that is to say i had long ago satisfied so far as it was capable of satisfaction that mysterious yearningthe magnetism of millions of hearts operating upon onewhich impels every mans individuality to mingle itself with the immensest mass of human life within his scope  day alter day at an earlier period i had trodden the thronged thoroughfares the broad lonely squares the lanes alleys and strange labyrinthine courts the parks the gardens and enclosures of ancient studious societies so retired and silent amid the city uproar the markets the foggy streets along the riverside the bridgesi had sought all parts of the metropolis in short with an unweariable and indiscriminating curiosity until few of the native inhabitants i fancy had turned so many of its corners as myself  these aimless wanderings in which my prime purpose and achievement were to lose my way and so to find it the more surely had brought one at one time or another to the sight and actual presence of almost all the objects and renowned localities that i had read about and which had made london the dreamcity of my youth  i had found it better than my dream for there is nothing else in life comparable in that species of enjoyment i mean to the thick heavy oppressive sombre delight which an american is sensible of hardly knowing whether to call it a pleasure or a pain in the atmosphere of london  the result was that i acquired a homefeeling there as nowhere else in the worldthough afterwards i came to have a somewhat similar sentiment in regard to rome and as long as either of those two great cities shall exist the cities of the past and of the present a mans native soil may crumble beneath his feet without leaving him altogether homeless upon earth  thus having once fully yielded to its influence i was in a manner free of the city and could approach or keep away from it as i pleased hence it happened that living within a quarter of an hours rush of the london bridge terminus i was oftener tempted to spend a whole summerday in our garden than to seek anything new or old wonderful or commonplace beyond its precincts  it was a delightful garden of no great extent but comprising a good many facilities for repose and enjoyment such as arbors and gardenseats shrubbery flowerbeds rosebushes in a profusion of bloom pinks poppies geraniums sweetpeas and a variety of other scarlet yellow blue and purple blossoms which i did not trouble myself to recognize individually yet had always a vague sense of their beauty about me  the dim sky of england has a most happy effect on the coloring of flowers blending richness with delicacy in the same texture but in this garden as everywhere else the exuberance of english verdure had a greater charm than any tropical splendor or diversity of hue  the hunger for natural beauty might be satisfied with grass and green leaves forever  conscious of the triumph of england in this respect and loyally anxious for the credit of my own country it gratified me to observe what trouble and pains the english gardeners are fain to throw away in producing a few sour plums and abortive pears and applesas for example in this very garden where a row of unhappy trees were spread out perfectly flat against a brick wall looking as if impaled alive or crucified with a cruel and unattainable purpose of compelling them to produce rich fruit by torture  for my part i never ate an english fruit raised in the open air that could compare in flavor with a yankee turnip  the garden included that prime feature of english domestic scenery a lawn  it had been levelled carefully shorn and converted into a bowlinggreen on which we sometimes essayed to practise the timehonored game of bowls most unskilfully yet not without a perception that it involves a very pleasant mixture of exercise and ease as is the case with most of the old english pastimes  our little domain was shut in by the house on one side and in other directions by a hedgefence and a brick wall which last was concealed or softened by shrubbery and the impaled fruittrees already mentioned  over all the outer region beyond our immediate precincts there was an abundance of foliage tossed aloft from the near or distant trees with which that agreeable suburb is adorned  the effect was wonderfully sylvan and rural insomuch that we might have fancied ourselves in the depths of a wooded seclusion only that at brief intervals we could hear the galloping sweep of a railwaytrain passing within a quarter of a mile and its discordant screech moderated by a little farther distance as it reached the blackheath station  that harsh rough sound seeking me out so inevitably was the voice of the great world summoning me forth  i know not whether i was the more pained or pleased to be thus constantly put in mind of the neighborhood of london for on the one hand my conscience stung me a little for reading a book or playing with children in the grass when there were so many better things for an enlightened traveller to dowhile at the same time it gave a deeper delight to my luxurious idleness to contrast it with the turmoil which i escaped  on the whole however i do not repent of a single wasted hour and only wish that i could have spent twice as many in the same way for the impression on my memory is that i was as happy in that hospitable garden as the english summerday was long  one chief condition of my enjoyment was the weather  italy has nothing like it nor america  there never was such weather except in england where in requital of a vast amount of horrible eastwind between february and june and a brown october and black november and a wet chill sunless winter there are a few weeks of incomparable summer scattered through july and august and the earlier portion of september small in quantity but exquisite enough to atone for the whole years atmospherical delinquencies  after all the prevalent sombreness may have brought out those sunny intervals in such high relief that i see them in my recollection brighter than they really were a little light makes a glory for people who live habitually in a gray gloom  the english however do not seem to know how enjoyable the momentary gleams of their summer are they call it broiling weather and hurry to the seaside with red perspiring faces in a state of combustion and deliquescence and i have observed that even their cattle have similar susceptibilities seeking the deepest shade or standing midleg deep in pools and streams to cool themselves at temperatures which our own cows would deem little more than barely comfortable  to myself after the summer heats of my native land had somewhat effervesced out of my blood and memory it was the weather of paradise itself  it might be a little too warm but it was that modest and inestimable superabundance which constitutes a bounty of providence instead of just a niggardly enough during my first year in england residing in perhaps the most ungenial part of the kingdom i could never be quite comfortable without a fire on the hearth in the second twelvemonth beginning to get acclimatized i became sensible of an austere friendliness shy but sometimes almost tender in the veiled shadowy seldom smiling summer and in the succeeding yearswhether that i had renewed my fibre with english beef and replenished my blood with english ale or whatever were the causei grew content with winter and especially in love with summer desiring little more for happiness than merely to breathe and bask  at the midsummer which we are now speaking of i must needs confess that the noontide sun came down more fervently than i found altogether tolerable so that i was fain to shift my position with the shadow of the shrubbery making myself the movable index of a sundial that reckoned up the hours of an almost interminable day  for each day seemed endless though never wearisome  as far as your actual experience is concerned the english summerday has positively no beginning and no end  when you awake at any reasonable hour the sun is already shining through the curtains you live through unnumbered hours of sabbath quietude with a calm variety of incident softly etched upon their tranquil lapse and at length you become conscious that it is bedtime again while there is still enough daylight in the sky to make the pages of your book distinctly legible  night if there be any such season hangs down a transparent veil through which the bygone day beholds its successor or if not quite true of the latitude of london it may be soberly affirmed of the more northern parts of the island that tomorrow is born before its yesterday is dead  they exist together in the golden twilight where the decrepit old day dimly discerns the face of the ominous infant and you though a more mortal may simultaneously touch them both with one finger of recollection and another of prophecy i cared not how long the day might be nor how many of them  i had earned this repose by a long course of irksome toil and perturbation and could have been content never to stray out of the limits of that suburban villa and its garden  if i lacked anything beyond it would have satisfied me well enough to dream about it instead of struggling for its actual possession  at least this was the feeling of the moment although the transitory flitting and irresponsible character of my life there was perhaps the most enjoyable element of all as allowing me much of the comfort of house and home without any sense of their weight upon my back  the nomadic life has great advantages if we can find tents ready pitched for us at every stage  so much for the interior of our abodea spot of deepest quiet within reach of the intensest activity  but even when we stopped beyond our own gate we were not shocked with any immediate presence of the great world  we were dwelling in one of those oases that have grown up in comparatively recent years i believe on the wide waste of blackheath which otherwise offers a vast extent of unoccupied ground in singular proximity to the metropolis  as a general thing the proprietorship of the soil seems to exist in everybody and nobody but exclusive rights have been obtained here and there chiefly by men whose daily concerns link them with london so that you find their villas or boxes standing along village streets which have often more of an american aspect than the elder english settlements  the scene is semirural  ornamental trees overshadow the sidewalks and grassy margins border the wheeltracks  the houses to be sure have certain points of difference from those of an american village bearing tokens of architectural design though seldom of individual taste and as far as possible they stand aloof from the street and separated each from its neighbor by hedge or fence in accordance with the careful exclusiveness of the english character which impels the occupant moreover to cover the front of his dwelling with as much concealment of shrubbery as his limits will allow  through the interstices you catch glimpses of wellkept lawns generally ornamented with flowers and with what the english call rockwork being heaps of ivygrown stones and fossils designed for romantic effect in a small way  two or three of such village streets as are here described take a collective nameas for instance blackheath parkand constitute a kind of community of residents with gateways kept by a policeman and a semiprivacy stepping beyond which you find yourself on the breezy heath  on this great bare dreary common i often went astray as i afterwards did on the campagna of rome and drew the air tainted with london smoke though it might be into my lungs by deep inspirations with a strange and unexpected sense of desert freedom  the misty atmosphere helps you to fancy a remoteness that perhaps does not quite exist  during the little time that it lasts the solitude is as impressive as that of a western prairie or forest but soon the railway shriek a mile or two away insists upon informing you of your whereabout or you recognize in the distance some landmark that you may have knownan insulated villa perhaps with its gardenwall around it or the rudimental street of a new settlement which is sprouting on this otherwise barren soil  half a century ago the most frequent token of mans beneficent contiguity might have been a gibbet and the creak like a tavern sign of a murderer swinging to and fro in irons  blackheath with its highwaymen and footpads was dangerous in those days and even now for aught i know the western prairie may still compare favorably with it as a safe region to go astray in  when i was acquainted with blackheath the ingenious device of garroting had recently come into fashion and i can remember while crossing those waste places at midnight and hearing footsteps behind me to have been sensibly encouraged by also hearing not far off the clinking hooftramp of one of the horsepatrols who do regular duty there  about sunset or a little later was the time when the broad and somewhat desolate peculiarity of the heath seemed to me to put on its utmost impressiveness  at that hour finding myself on elevated ground i once had a view of immense london four or five miles off with the vast dome in the midst and the towers of the two houses of parliament rising up into the smoky canopy the thinner substance of which obscured a mass of things and hovered about the objects that were most distinctly visiblea glorious and sombre picture dusky awful but irresistibly attractive like a young mans dream of the great world foretelling at that distance a grandeur never to be fully realized  while i lived in that neighborhood the tents of two or three sets of cricketplayers were constantly pitched on blackheath and matches were going forward that seemed to involve the honor and credit of communities or counties exciting an interest in everybody but myself who cared not what part of england might glorify itself at the expense of another  it is necessary to be born an englishman i believe in order to enjoy this great national game at any rate as a spectacle for an outside observer i found it lazy lingering tedious and utterly devoid of pictorial effects  choice of other amusements was at hand  butts for archery were established and bows and arrows were to be let at so many shots for a pennythere being abundance of space for a farther flightshot than any modern archer can lend to his shaft  then there was an absurd game of throwing a stick at crockeryware which i have witnessed a hundred times and personally engaged in once or twice without ever having the satisfaction to see a bit of broken crockery  in other spots you found donkeys for children to ride and ponies of a very meek and patient spirit on which the cockney pleasureseekers of both sexes rode races and made wonderful displays of horsemanship  by way of refreshment there was gingerbread but as a true patriot i must pronounce it greatly interior to our native dainty and gingerbeer and probably stauncher liquor among the boothkeepers hidden stores  the frequent railwaytrains as well as the numerous steamers to greenwich have made the vacant portions of blackheath a playground and breathingplace for the londoners readily and very cheaply accessible so that in view of this broader use and enjoyment i a little grudged the tracts that have been filched away so to speak and individualized by thriving citizens one sort of visitors especially interested me they were schools of little boys or girls under the guardianship of their instructors charity schools as i often surmised from their aspect collected among dark alleys and squalid courts and hither they were brought to spend a summer afternoon these pale little progeny of the sunless nooks of london who had never known that the sky was any broader than that narrow and vapory strip above their native lane  i fancied that they took but a doubtful pleasure being half affrighted at the wide empty space overhead and round about them finding the air too little medicated with smoke soot and graveyard exhalations to be breathed with comfort and feeling shelterless and lost because grimy london their slatternly and disreputable mother had suffered them to stray out of her arms  passing among these holiday people we come to one of the gateways of greenwich park opening through an old brick wall  it admits us from the bare heath into a scene of antique cultivation and woodland ornament traversed in all directions by avenues of trees many of which bear tokens of a venerable age  these broad and wellkept pathways rise and decline over the elevations and along the bases of gentle hills which diversify the whole surface of the park  the loftiest and most abrupt of them though but of very moderate height is one of the earths noted summits and may hold up its head with mont blanc and chimborazo as being the site of greenwich observatory where if all nations will consent to say so the longitude of our great globe begins  i used to regulate my watch by the broad dialplate against the observatory wall and felt it pleasant to be standing at the very centre of time and space  there are lovelier parks than this in the neighborhood of london richer scenes of greensward and cultivated trees and kensington especially in a summer afternoon has seemed to me as delightful as any place can or ought to be in a world which some time or other we must quit  but greenwich too is beautifula spot where the art of man has conspired with nature as if he and the great mother had taken counsel together how to make a pleasant scene and the longest liver of the two had faithfully carried out their mutual design  it has likewise an additional charm of its own because to all appearance it is the peoples property and playground in a much more genuine way than the aristocratic resorts in closer vicinity to the metropolis  it affords one of the instances in which the monarchs property is actually the peoples and shows how much more natural is their relation to the sovereign than to the nobility which pretends to hold the intervening space between the two for a nobleman makes a paradise only for himself and fills it with his own pomp and pride whereas the people are sooner or later the legitimate inheritors of whatever beauty kings and queens create as now of greenwich park  on sundays when the sun shone and even on those grim and sombre days when if it do not actually rain the english persist in calling it fine weather it was too good to see how sturdily the plebeians trod under their own oaks and what fulness of simple enjoyment they evidently found there  they were the peoplenot the populace specimens of a class whose sunday clothes are a distinct kind of garb from their weekday ones and this in england implies wholesome habits of life daily thrift and a rank above the lowest  i longed to be acquainted with them in order to investigate what manner of folks they were what sort of households they kept their politics their religion their tastes and whether they were as narrowminded as their betters there can be very little doubt of it an englishman is english in whatever rank of life though no more intensely so i should imagine as an artisan or petty shopkeeper than as a member of parliament  the english character as i conceive it is by no means a very lofty one they seem to have a great deal of earth and grimy dust clinging about them as was probably the case with the stalwart and quarrelsome people who sprouted up out of the soil after cadmus had sown the dragons teeth  and yet though the individual englishman is sometimes preternaturally disagreeable an observer standing aloof has a sense of natural kindness towards them in the lump  they adhere closer to the original simplicity in which mankind was created than we ourselves do they love quarrel laugh cry and turn their actual selves inside out with greater freedom than any class of americans would consider decorous it was often so with these holiday folks in greenwich park and ridiculous as it may sound i fancy myself to have caught very satisfactory glimpses of arcadian life among the cockneys there hardly beyond the scope of bowbells picnicking in the grass uncouthly gambolling on the broad slopes or straying in motley groups or by single pairs of lovemaking youths and maidens along the sunstreaked avenues even the omnipresent policemen or parkkeepers could not disturb the beatific impression on my mind  one feature at all events of the golden age was to be seen in the herds of deer that encountered you in the somewhat remoter recesses of the park and were readily prevailed upon to nibble a bit of bread out of your hand  but though no wrong had ever been done them and no horn had sounded nor hound bayed at the heels of themselves or their antlered progenitors for centuries past there was still an apprehensiveness lingering in their hearts so that a slight movement of the hand or a step too near would send a whole squadron of them scampering away just as a breath scatters the winged seeds of a dandelion  the aspect of greenwich park with all those festal people wandering through it resembled that of the borghese gardens under the walls of rome on a sunday or saints day but i am not ashamed to say it a little disturbed whatever grim ghost of puritanic strictness might be lingering in the sombre depths of a new england heart among severe and sunless remembrances of the sabbaths of childhood and pangs of remorse for illgotten lessons in the catechism and for erratic fantasies or hardly suppressed laughter in the middle of long sermons  occasionally i tried to take the longhoarded sting out of these compunctious smarts by attending divine service in the open air  on a cart outside of the parkwall and if i mistake not at two or three corners and secluded spots within the park itself a methodist preacher uplifts his voice and speedily gathers a congregation his zeal for whose religious welfare impels the good man to such earnest vociferation and toilsome gesture that his perspiring face is quickly in a stew  his inward flame conspires with the too fervid sun and makes a positive martyr of him even in the very exercise of his pious labor insomuch that he purchases every atom of spiritual increment to his hearers by loss of his own corporeal solidity and should his discourse last long enough must finally exhale before their eyes  if i smile at him be it understood it is not in scorn he performs his sacred office more acceptably than many a prelate  these wayside services attract numbers who would not otherwise listen to prayer sermon or hymn from one years end to another and who for that very reason are the auditors most likely to be moved by the preachers eloquence  yonder greenwich pensioner too in his costume of threecornered hat and oldfashioned brassbuttoned blue coat with ample skirts which makes him look like a contemporary of admiral benbowthat tough old mariner may hear a word or two which will go nearer his heart than anything that the chaplain of the hospital can be expected to deliver  i always noticed moreover that a considerable proportion of the audience were soldiers who came hither with a days leave from woolwichhardy veterans in aspect some of whom wore as many as four or five medals crimean or east indian on the breasts of their scarlet coats  the miscellaneous congregation listen with every appearance of heartfelt interest and for my own part i must frankly acknowledge that i never found it possible to give five minutes attention to any other english preaching so cold and commonplace are the homilies that pass for such under the aged roofs of churches  and as for cathedrals the sermon is an exceedingly diminutive and unimportant part of the religious servicesif indeed it be considered a part among the pompous ceremonies the intonations and the resounding and loftyvoiced strains of the choristers  the magnificence of the setting quite dazzles out what we puritans look upon as the jewel of the whole affair for i presume that it was our forefathers the dissenters in england and america who gave the sermon its present prominence in the sabbath exercises  the methodists are probably the first and only englishmen who have worshipped in the open air since the ancient britons listened to the preaching of the druids and it reminded me of that old priesthood to see certain memorials of their dusky epochnot religious however but warlikein the neighborhood of the spot where the methodist was holding forth  these were some ancient barrows beneath or within which are supposed to be buried the slain of a forgotten or doubtfully remembered battle fought on the site of greenwich park as long ago as two or three centuries after the birth of christ  whatever may once have been their height and magnitude they have now scarcely more prominence in the actual scene than the battle of which they are the sole monuments retains in historybeing only a few mounds side by side elevated a little above the surface of the ground ten or twelve feet in diameter with a shallow depression in their summits  when one of them was opened not long since no bones nor armor nor weapons were discovered nothing but some small jewels and a tuft of hairperhaps from the head of a valiant general who dying on the field of his victory bequeathed this lock together with his indestructible fame to after ages  the hair and jewels are probably in the british museum where the potsherds and rubbish of innumerable generations make the visitor wish that each passing century could carry off all its fragments and relics along with it instead of adding them to the continually accumulating burden which human knowledge is compelled to lug upon its back  as for the fame i know not what has become of it  after traversing the park we come into the neighborhood of greenwich hospital and will pass through one of its spacious gateways for the sake of glancing at an establishment which does more honor to the heart of england than anything else that i am acquainted with of a public nature it is very seldom that we can be sensible of anything like kindliness in the acts or relations of such an artificial thing as a national government  our own government i should conceive is too much an abstraction ever to feel any sympathy for its maimed sailors and soldiers though it will doubtless do then a severe kind of justice as chilling as the touch of steel  but it seemed to me that the greenwich pensioners are the petted children of the nation and that the government is their drynurse and that the old men themselves have a childlike consciousness of their position  very likely a better sort of life might have been arranged and a wiser care bestowed on them but such as it is it enables them to spend a sluggish careless comfortable old age grumbling growling gruff as if all the foul weather of their past years were pent up within them yet not much more discontented than such weatherbeaten and battlebattered fragments of human kind must inevitably be  their home in its outward form is on a very magnificent plan  its germ was a royal palace the full expansion of which has resulted in a series of edifices externally more beautiful than any english palace that i have seen consisting of several quadrangles of stately architecture united by colonnades and gravelwalks and enclosing grassy squares with statues in the centre the whole extending along the thames  it is built of marble or very lightcolored stone in the classic style with pillars and porticos which to my own taste and i fancy to that of the old sailors produce but a cold and shivery effect in the english climate  had i been the architect i would have studied the characters habits and predilections of nautical people in wapping hotherhithe and the neighborhood of the tower places which i visited in affectionate remembrance of captain lemuel gulliver and other actual or mythological navigators and would have built the hospital in a kind of ethereal similitude to the narrow dark ugly and inconvenient but snug and cosey homeliness of the sailor boardinghouses there  there can be no question that all the above attributes or enough of then to satisfy an old sailors heart might be reconciled with architectural beauty and the wholesome contrivances of modern dwellings and thus a novel and genuine style of building be given to the world  but their countrymen meant kindly by the old fellows in assigning them the ancient royal site where elizabeth held her court and charles ii began to build his palace  so far as the locality went it was treating them like so many kings and with a discreet abundance of grog beer and tobacco there was perhaps little more to be accomplished in behalf of men whose whole previous lives have tended to unfit them for old age their chief discomfort is probably for lack of something to do or think about  but judging by the few whom i saw a listless habit seems to have crept over them a dim dreaminess of mood in which they sit between asleep and awake and find the long day wearing towards bedtime without its having made any distinct record of itself upon their consciousness sitting on stone benches in the sunshine they subside into slumber or nearly so and start at the approach of footsteps echoing under the colonnades ashamed to be caught napping and rousing themselves in a hurry as formerly on the midnight watch at sea  in their brightest moments they gather in groups and bore one another with endless seayarns about their voyages under famous admirals and about gale and calm battle and chase and all that class of incident that has its sphere on the deck and in the hollow interior of a ship where their world has exclusively been  for other pastime they quarrel among themselves comrade with comrade and perhaps shake paralytic fists in furrowed faces  if inclined for a little exercise they can bestir their wooden legs on the long esplanade that borders by the thames criticising the rig of passing ships and firing off volleys of malediction at the steamers which have made the sea another element than that they used to be acquainted with  all this is but cold comfort for the evening of life yet may compare rather favorably with the preceding portions of it comprising little save imprisonment on shipboard in the course of which they have been tossed all about the world and caught hardly a glimpse of it forgetting what grass and trees are and never finding out what woman is though they may have encountered a painted spectre which they took for her  a country owes much to human beings whose bodies she has worn out and whose immortal part she has left undeveloped or debased as we tied them here and having wasted an idle paragraph upon them let me now suggest that old men have a kind of susceptibility to moral impressions and even up to an advanced period a receptivity of truth which often appears to come to them after the active time of life is past  the greenwich pensioners might prove better subjects for true education now than in their schoolboy days but then where is the normal school that could educate instructors for such a class  there is a beautiful chapel for the pensioners in the classic style over the altar of which hangs a picture by west  i never could look at it long enough to make out its design for this artist though it pains me to say it of so respectable a countryman had a gift of frigidity a knack of grinding ice into his paint a power of stupefying the spectators perceptions and quelling his sympathy beyond any other limner that ever handled a brush  in spite of many pangs of conscience i seize this opportunity to wreak a lifelong abhorrence upon the poor blameless man for the sake of that dreary picture of lear an explosion of frosty fury that used to be a bugbear to me in the athenaeum exhibition  would fire burn it i wonder  the principal thing that they have to show you at greenwich hospital is the painted hall  it is a splendid and spacious room at least a hundred feet long and half as high with a ceiling painted in fresco by sir james thornhill  as a work of art i presume this frescoed canopy has little merit though it produces an exceedingly rich effect by its brilliant coloring and as a specimen of magnificent upholstery  the walls of the grand apartment are entirely covered with pictures many of them representing battles and other naval incidents that were once fresher in the worlds memory than now but chiefly portraits of old admirals comprising the whole line of heroes who have trod the quarterdecks of british ships for more than two hundred years back  next to a tomb in westminster abbey which was nelsons most elevated object of ambition it would seem to be the highest need of a naval warrior to have his portrait hung up in the painted hall but by dint of victory upon victory these illustrious personages have grown to be a mob and by no means a very interesting one so far as regards the character of the faces here depicted  they are generally commonplace and often singularly stolid and i have observed both in the painted hall and elsewhere and not only in portraits but in the actual presence of such renowned people as i have caught glimpses of that the countenances of heroes are not nearly so impressive as those of statesmenexcept of course in the rare instances where warlike ability has been but the onesided manifestation of a profound genius for managing the worlds affairs  nine tenths of these distinguished admirals for instance if their faces tell truth must needs have been blockheads and might have served better one would imagine as wooden figureheads for their own ships than to direct any difficult and intricate scheme of action from the quarterdeck  it is doubtful whether the same kind of men will hereafter meet with a similar degree of success for they were victorious chiefly through the old english hardihood exercised in a field of which modern science had not yet got possession  rough valor has lost something of its value since their days and must continue to sink lower and lower in the comparative estimate of warlike qualities  in the next naval war as between england and france i would bet methinks upon the frenchmans head  it is remarkable however that the great naval hero of englandthe greatest therefore in the world and of all timehad none of the stolid characteristics that belong to his class and cannot fairly be accepted as their representative man  foremost in the roughest of professions he was as delicately organized as a woman and as painfully sensitive as a poet  more than any other englishman he won the love and admiration of his country but won them through the efficacy of qualities that are not english or at all events were intensified in his case and made poignant and powerful by something morbid in the man which put him otherwise at crosspurposes with life  he was a man of genius and genius in an englishman not to cite the good old simile of a pearl in the oyster is usually a symptom of a lack of balance in the general makingup of the character as we may satisfy ourselves by running over the list of their poets for example and observing how many of them have been sickly or deformed and how often their lives have been darkened by insanity  an ordinary englishman is the healthiest and wholesomest of human beings an extraordinary one is almost always in one way or another a sick man  it was so with lord nelson  the wonderful contrast or relation between his personal qualities the position which he held and the life that he lived makes him as interesting a personage as all history has to show and it is a pity that southeys biographyso good in its superficial way and yet so inadequate as regards any real delineation of the manshould have taken the subject out of the hands of some writer endowed with more delicate appreciation and deeper insight than that genuine englishman possessed  but southey accomplished his own purpose which apparently was to present his hero as a pattern for englands young midshipmen  but the english capacity for heroworship is full to the brim with what they are able to comprehend of lord nelsons character  adjoining the painted hall is a smaller room the walls of which are completely and exclusively adorned with pictures of the great admirals exploits  we see the frail ardent man in all the most noted events of his career from his encounter with a polar bear to his death at trafalgar quivering here and there about the room like a blue lambent flame  no briton ever enters that apartment without feeling the beef and ale of his composition stirred to its depths and finding himself changed into a hero for the notice however stolid his brain however tough his heart however unexcitable his ordinary mood  to confess the truth i myself though belonging to another parish have been deeply sensible to the sublime recollections there aroused acknowledging that nelson expressed his life in a kind of symbolic poetry which i had as much right to understand as these burly islanders  cool and critical observer as i sought to be i enjoyed their burst of honest indignation when a visitor not an american i am glad to say thrust his walkingstick almost into nelsons face in one of the pictures by way of pointing a remark and the bystanders immediately glowed like so many hot coals and would probably have consumed the offender in their wrath had he not effected his retreat  but the most sacred objects of all are two of nelsons coats under separate glass cases  one is that which he wore at the battle of the nile and it is now sadly injured by moths which will quite destroy it in a few years unless its guardians preserve it as we do washingtons military suit by occasionally baking it in an oven  the other is the coat in which he received his deathwound at trafalgar  on its breast are sewed three or four stars and orders of knighthood now much dimmed by time and damp but which glittered brightly enough on the battleday to draw the fatal aim of a french marksman  the bullethole is visible on the shoulder as well as a part of the golden tassels of an epaulet the rest of which was shot away  over the coat is laid a white waistcoat with a great bloodstain on it out of which all the redness has utterly faded leaving it of a dingy yellow line in the threescore years since that blood gushed out  yet it was once the reddest blood in england nelsons blood  the hospital stands close adjacent to the town of greenwich which will always retain a kind of festal aspect in my memory in consequence of my having first become acquainted with it on easter monday  till a few years ago the first three days of easter were a carnival season in this old town during which the idle and disreputable part of london poured itself into the streets like an inundation of the thames as unclean as that turbid mixture of the offscourings of the vast city and overflowing with its grimy pollution whatever rural innocence if any might be found in the suburban neighborhood  this festivity was called greenwich fair the final one of which in an immemorial succession it was my fortune to behold  if i had bethought myself of going through the fair with a notebook and pencil jotting down all the prominent objects i doubt not that the result might have been a sketch of english life quite as characteristic and worthy of historical preservation as an account of the roman carnival  having neglected to do so i remember little more than a confusion of unwashed and shabbily dressed people intermixed with some smarter figures but on the whole presenting a mobbish appearance such as we never see in our own country  it taught me to understand why shakespeare in speaking of a crowd so often alludes to its attribute of evil odor  the common people of england i am afraid have no daily familiarity with even so necessary a thing as a washbowl not to mention a bathingtub  and furthermore it is one mighty difference between them and us that every man and woman on our side of the water has a workingday suit and a holiday suit and is occasionally as fresh as a rose whereas in the good old country the griminess of his labor or squalid habits clings forever to the individual and gets to be a part of his personal substance  these are broad facts involving great corollaries and dependencies  there are really if you stop to think about it few sadder spectacles in the world than a ragged coat or a soiled and shabby gown at a festival  this unfragrant crowd was exceedingly dense being welded together as it were in the street through which we strove to make our way  on either side were oysterstands stalls of oranges a very prevalent fruit in england where they give the withered ones a guise of freshness by boiling them and booths covered with old sailcloth in which the commodity that most attracted the eye was gilt gingerbread  it was so completely enveloped in dutch gilding that i did not at first recognize an old acquaintance but wondered what those golden crowns and images could be  there were likewise drums and other toys for small children and a variety of showy and worthless articles for children of a larger growth though it perplexed me to imagine who in such a mob could have the innocent taste to desire playthings or the money to pay for them not that i have a right to license the mob on my own knowledge of being any less innocent than a set of cleaner and better dressed people might have been for though one of them stole my pockethandkerchief i could not but consider it fair game under the circumstances and was grateful to the thief for sparing me my purse  they were quiet civil and remarkably goodhumored making due allowance for the national gruffness there was no riot no tumultuous swaying to and fro of the mass such as i have often noted in an american crowd no noise of voices except frequent bursts of laughter hoarse or shrill and a widely diffused inarticulate murmur resembling nothing so much as the rumbling of the tide among the arches of london bridge  what immensely perplexed me was a sharp angry sort of rattle in all quarters far off and close at hand and sometimes right at my own back where it sounded as if the stout fabric of my english surtout had been ruthlessly rent in twain and everybodys clothes all over the fair were evidently being torn asunder in the same way  by and by i discovered that this strange noise was produced by a little instrument called the fun of the faira sort of rattle consisting of a wooden wheel the cogs of which turn against a thin slip of wood and so produce a rasping sound when drawn smartly against a persons back  the ladies draw their rattles against the backs of their male friends and everybody passes for a friend at greenwich fair and the young men return the compliment on the broad british backs of the ladies and all are bound by immemorial custom to take it in good part and be merry at the joke  as it was one of my prescribed official duties to give an account of such mechanical contrivances as might be unknown in my own country i have thought it right to be thus particular in describing the fun of the fair  but this was far from being the sole amusement  there were theatrical booths in front of which were pictorial representations of the scenes to be enacted within and anon a drummer emerged from one of them thumping on a terribly lax drum and followed by the entire dramatis personae who ranged themselves on a wooden platform in front of the theatre  they were dressed in character but wofully shabby with very dingy and wrinkled white tights threadbare cottonvelvets crumpled silks and crushed muslin and all the gloss and glory gone out of their aspect and attire seen thus in the broad daylight and after a long series of performances  they sang a song together and withdrew into the theatre whither the public were invited to follow them at the inconsiderable cost of a penny a ticket  before another booth stood a pair of brawny fightingmen displaying their muscle and soliciting patronage for an exhibition of the noble british art of pugilism  there were pictures of giants monsters and outlandish beasts most prodigious to be sure and worthy of all admiration unless the artist had gone incomparably beyond his subject  jugglers proclaimed aloud the miracles which they were prepared to work and posturemakers dislocated every joint of their bodies and tied their limbs into inextricable knots wherever they could find space to spread a little square of carpet on the ground  in the midst of the confusion while everybody was treading on his neighbors toes some little boys were very solicitous to brush your boots  these lads i believe are a product of modern societyat least no older than the time of gay who celebrates their origin in his trivia but in most other respects the scene reminded me of bunyans description of vanity fairnor is it at all improbable that the pilgrim may have been a merrymaker here in his wild youth  it seemed very singularthough of course i immediately classified it as an english characteristicto see a great many portable weighingmachines the owners of which cried out continually and amain come know your weight  come come know your weight today come know your weight and a multitude of people mostly large in the girth were moved by this vociferation to sit down in the machines  i know not whether they valued themselves on their beef and estimated their standing as members of society at so much a pound but i shall set it down as a national peculiarity and a symbol of the prevalence of the earthly over the spiritual element that englishmen are wonderfully bent on knowing how solid and physically ponderous they are  on the whole having an appetite for the brown bread and the tripe and sausages of life as well as for its nicer cates and dainties i enjoyed the scene and was amused at the sight of a gruff old greenwich pensioner who forgetful of the sailorfrolics of his young days stood looking with grim disapproval at all these vanities  thus we squeezed our way through the mobjammed town and emerged into the park where likewise we met a great many merrymakers but with freer space for their gambols than in the streets  we soon found ourselves the targets for a cannonade with oranges most of them in a decayed condition which went humming past our ears from the vantageground of neighboring hillocks sometimes hitting our sacred persons with an inelastic thump this was one of the privileged freedoms of the time and was nowise to be resented except by returning the salute  many persons were running races hand in hand down the declivities especially that steepest one on the summit of which stands the worldcentral observatory and as in the race of life the partners were usually male and female and often caught a tumble together before reaching the bottom of the hill hereabouts we were pestered and haunted by two young girls the eldest not more than thirteen teasing us to buy matches and finding no market for their commodity the taller one suddenly turned a somerset before our faces and rolled heels over head from top to bottom of the hill on which we stood  then scrambling up the acclivity the topsyturvy trollop offered us her matches again as demurely as if she had never flung aside her equilibrium so that dreading a repetition of the feat we gave her sixpence and an admonition and enjoined her never to do so any more  the most curious amusement that we witnessed hereor anywhere else indeedwas an ancient and hereditary pastime called kissing in the ring  i shall describe the sport exactly as i saw it although an english friend assures me that there are certain ceremonies with a handkerchief which make it much more decorous and graceful  a handkerchief indeed  there was no such thing in the crowd except it were the one which they had just filched out of my pocket  it is one of the simplest kinds of games needing little or no practice to make the player altogether perfect and the manner of it is this  a ring is formed in the present case it was of large circumference and thickly gemmed around with faces mostly on the broad grin into the centre of which steps an adventurous youth and looking round the circle selects whatever maiden may most delight his eye  he presents his hand which she is bound to accept leads her into the centre salutes her on the lips and retires taking his stand in the expectant circle  the girl in her turn throws a favorable regard on some fortunate young man offers her hand to lead him forth makes him happy with a maidenly kiss and withdraws to hide her blushes if any there be among the simpering faces in the ring while the favored swain loses no time in transferring her salute to the prettiest and plumpest among the many mouths that are primming themselves in anticipation  and thus the thing goes on till all the festive throng are inwreathed and intertwined into an endless and inextricable chain of kisses though indeed it smote me with compassion to reflect that some forlorn pair of lips might be left out and never know the triumph of a salute after throwing aside so many delicate reserves for the sake of winning it  if the young men had any chivalry there was a fair chance to display it by kissing the homeliest damsel in the circle  to be frank however at the first glance and to my american eye they looked all homely alike and the chivalry that i suggest is more than i could have been capable of at any period of my life  they seemed to be countrylasses of sturdy and wholesome aspect with coarsegrained cabbagerosy cheeks and i am willing to suppose a stout texture of moral principle such as would bear a good deal of rough usage without suffering much detriment  but how unlike the trim little damsels of my native land  i desire above all things to be courteous but since the plain truth must be told the soil and climate of england produce feminine beauty as rarely as they do delicate fruit and though admirable specimens of both are to be met with they are the hothouse ameliorations of refined society and apt moreover to relapse into the coarseness of the original stock  the men are manlike but the women are not beautiful though the female bull be well enough adapted to the male to return to the lasses of greenwich fair their charms were few and their behavior perhaps not altogether commendable and yet it was impossible not to feel a degree of faith in their innocent intentions with such a halfbashful zest and entire simplicity did they keep up their part of the game  it put the spectator in goodhumor to look at them because there was still something of the old arcadian life the secure freedom of the antique age in their way of surrendering their lips to strangers as if there were no evil or impurity in the world  as for the young men they were chiefly specimens of the vulgar sediment of london life often shabbily genteel rowdyish pale wearing the unbrushed coat unshifted linen and unwashed faces of yesterday as well as the haggardness of last nights jollity in a ginshop  gathering their character from these tokens i wondered whether there were any reasonable prospect of their fair partners returning to their rustic homes with as much innocence whatever were its amount or quality as they brought to greenwich fair in spite of the perilous familiarity established by kissing in the ring  the manifold disorders resulting from the fair at which a vast city was brought into intimate relations with a comparatively rural district have at length led to its suppression this was the very last celebration of it and brought to a close the broadmouthed merriment of many hundred years  thus my poor sketch faint as its colors are may acquire some little value in the readers eyes from the consideration that no observer of the coming time will ever have an opportunity to give a better  i should find it difficult to believe however that the queer pastime just described or any moral mischief to which that and other customs might pave the way can have led to the overthrow of greenwich fair for it has often seemed to me that englishmen of station and respectability unless of a peculiarly philanthropic turn have neither any faith in the feminine purity of the lower orders of their countrywomen nor the slightest value for it allowing its possible existence  the distinction of ranks is so marked that the english cottage damsel holds a position somewhat analogous to that of the negro girl in our southern states hence cones inevitable detriment to the moral condition of those men themselves who forget that the humblest woman has a right and a duty to hold herself in the same sanctity as the highest  the subject cannot well be discussed in these pages but i offer it as a serious conviction from what i have been able to observe that the england of today is the unscrupulous old england of tom jones and joseph andrews humphrey clinker and roderick random and in our refined era just the same as at that more freespoken epoch this singular people has a certain contempt for any finestrained purity any special squeamishness as they consider it on the part of an ingenuous youth  they appear to look upon it as a suspicious phenomenon in the masculine character  nevertheless i by no means take upon me to affirm that english morality as regards the phase here alluded to is really at a lower point than our own  assuredly i hope so because making a higher pretension or at all events more carefully hiding whatever may be amiss we are either better than they or necessarily a great deal worse  it impressed me that their open avowal and recognition of immoralities served to throw the disease to the surface where it might be more effectually dealt with and leave a sacred interior not utterly profaned instead of turning its poison back among the inner vitalities of the character at the imminent risk of corrupting them all  be that as it may these englishmen are certainly a franker and simpler people than ourselves from peer to peasant but if we can take it as compensatory on our part which i leave to be considered that they owe those noble and manly qualities to a coarser grain in their nature and that with a finer one in ours we shall ultimately acquire a marble polish of which they are unsusceptible i believe that this may be the truth     up the thames   the upper portion of greenwich where my last article left me loitering is a cheerful comely oldfashioned town the peculiarities of which if there be any have passed out of my remembrance  as you descend towards the thames the streets get meaner and the shabby and sunken houses elbowing one another for frontage bear the signboards of beershops and eatingrooms with especial promises of whitebait and other delicacies in the fishing line  you observe also a frequent announcement of the gardens in the rear although estimating the capacity of the premises by their external compass the entire sylvan charm and shadowy seclusion of such blissful resorts must be limited within a small backyard  these places of cheap sustenance and recreation depend for support upon the innumerable pleasureparties who come from london bridge by steamer at a fare of a few pence and who get as enjoyable a meal for a shilling a head as the ship hotel would afford a gentleman for a guinea  the steamers which are constantly smoking their pipes up and down the thames offer much the most agreeable mode of getting to london  at least it might be exceedingly agreeable except for the myriad floating particles of soot from the stovepipe and the heavy heat of midsummer sunshine on the unsheltered deck or the chill misty air draught of a cloudy day and the spiteful little showers of rain that may spatter down upon you at any moment whatever the promise of the sky besides which there is some slight inconvenience from the inexhaustible throng of passengers who scarcely allow you standingroom nor so much as a breath of unappropriated air and never a chance to sit down  if these difficulties added to the possibility of getting your pocket picked weigh little with you the panorama along the shores of the memorable river and the incidents and shows of passing life upon its bosom render the trip far preferable to the brief yet tiresome shoot along the railway track  on one such voyage a regatta of wherries raced past us and at once involved every soul on board our steamer in the tremendous excitement of the struggle  the spectacle was but a moment within our view and presented nothing more than a few light skiffs in each of which sat a single rower barearmed and with little apparel save a shirt and drawers pale anxious with every muscle on the stretch and plying his oars in such fashion that the boat skimmed along with the aerial celerity of a swallow  i wondered at myself for so immediately catching an interest in the affair which seemed to contain no very exalted rivalship of manhood but whatever the kind of battle or the prize of victory it stirs ones sympathy immensely and is even awful to behold the rare sight of a man thoroughly in earnest doing his best putting forth all there is in him and staking his very soul as these rowers appeared willing to do on the issue of the contest  it was the seventyfourth annual regatta of the free watermen of greenwich and announced itself as under the patronage of the lord mayor and other distinguished individuals at whose expense i suppose a prizeboat was offered to the conqueror and some small amounts of money to the inferior competitors  the aspect of london along the thanes below bridge as it is called is by no means so impressive as it ought to be considering what peculiar advantages are offered for the display of grand and stately architecture by the passage of a river through the midst of a great city  it seems indeed as if the heart of london had been cleft open for the mere purpose of showing how rotten and drearily mean it had become  the shore is lined with the shabbiest blackest and ugliest buildings that can be imagined decayed warehouses with blind windows and wharves that look ruinous insomuch that had i known nothing more of the worlds metropolis i might have fancied that it had already experienced the downfall which i have heard commercial and financial prophets predict for it within the century  and the muddy tide of the thames reflecting nothing and hiding a million of unclean secrets within its breasta sort of guilty conscience as it were unwholesome with the rivulets of sin that constantly flow into itis just the dismal stream to glide by such a city  the surface to be sure displays no lack of activity being fretted by the passage of a hundred steamers and covered with a good deal of shipping but mostly of a clumsier build than i had been accustomed to see in the mersey a fact which i complacently attributed to the smaller number of american clippers in the thames and the less prevalent influence of american example in refining away the broadbottomed capacity of the old dutch or english models  about midway between greenwich and london bridge at a rude landingplace on the left bank of the river the steamer rings its bell and makes a momentary pause in front of a large circular structure where it may be worth our while to scramble ashore  it indicates the locality of one of those prodigious practical blunders that would supply john bull with a topic of inexhaustible ridicule if his cousin jonathan had committed them but of which he himself perpetrates ten to our one in the mere wantonness of wealth that lacks better employment  the circular building covers the entrance to the thames tunnel and is surmounted by a dome of glass so as to throw daylight down into the great depth at which the passage of the river commences  descending a wearisome succession of staircases we at last find ourselves still in the broad noon standing before a closed door on opening which we behold the vista of an arched corridor that extends into everlasting midnight  in these days when glass has been applied to so many new purposes it is a pity that the architect had not thought of arching portions of his abortive tunnel with immense blocks of the lucid substance over which the dusky thames would have flowed like a cloud making the subfluvial avenue only a little gloomier than a street of upper london  at present it is illuminated at regular intervals by jets of gas not very brilliantly yet with lustre enough to show the damp plaster of the ceiling and walls and the massive stone pavement the crevices of which are oozy with moisture not from the incumbent river but from hidden springs in the earths deeper heart there are two parallel corridors with a wall between for the separate accommodation of the double throng of footpassengers equestrians and vehicles of all kinds which was expected to roll and reverberate continually through the tunnel  only one of them has ever been opened and its echoes are but feebly awakened by infrequent footfalls  yet there seem to be people who spend their lives here and who probably blink like owls when once or twice a year perhaps they happen to climb into the sunshine  all along the corridor which i believe to be a mile in extent we see stalls or shops in little alcoves kept principally by women they were of a ripe age i was glad to observe and certainly robbed england of none of its very moderate supply of feminine loveliness by their deeper than tomblike interment  as you approach and they are so accustomed to the dusky gaslight that they read all your characteristics afar off they assail you with hungry entreaties to buy some of their merchandise holding forth views of the tunnel put up in cases of derbyshire spar with a magnifyingglass at one end to make the vista more effective  they offer you besides cheap jewelry sunny topazes and resplendent emeralds for sixpence and diamonds as big as the kohiinoor at a not much heavier cost together with a multifarious trumpery which has died out of the upper world to reappear in this tartarean bazaar  that you may fancy yourself still in the realms of the living they urge you to partake of cakes candy gingerbeer and such small refreshment more suitable however for the shadowy appetite of ghosts than for the sturdy stomachs of englishmen  the most capacious of the shops contains a dioramic exhibition of cities and scenes in the daylight world with a dreary glimmer of gas among them all so that they serve well enough to represent the dim unsatisfactory remembrances that dead people might be supposed to retain from their past lives mixing them up with the ghastliness of their unsubstantial state  i dwell the more upon these trifles and do my best to give them a mockery of importance because if these are nothing then all this elaborate contrivance and mighty piece of work has been wrought in vain  the englishman has burrowed under the bed of his great river and set ships of two or three thousand tons arolling over his head only to provide new sites for a few old women to sell cakes and gingerbeer  yet the conception was a grand one and though it has proved an absolute failure swallowing an immensity of toil and money with annual returns hardly sufficient to keep the pavement free from the ooze of subterranean springs yet it needs i presume only an expenditure three or four or for aught i know twenty times as large to make the enterprise brilliantly successful  the descent is so great from the bank of the river to its surface and the tunnel dips so profoundly under the rivers bed that the approaches on either side must commence a long way off in order to render the entrance accessible to horsemen or vehicles so that the larger part of the cost of the whole affair should have been expended on its margins  it has turned out a sublime piece of folly and when the newzealander of distant ages shall have moralized sufficiently among the ruins of london bridge he will bethink himself that somewhere thereabout was the marvellous tunnel the very existence of which will seem to him as incredible as that of the hanging gardens of babylon  but the thames will long ago have broken through the massive arch and choked up the corridors with mud and sand and with the large stones of the structure itself intermixed with skeletons of drowned people the rusty ironwork of sunken vessels and the great many such precious and curious things as a river always contrives to hide in its bosom the entrance will have been obliterated and its very site forgotten beyond the memory of twenty generations of men and the whole neighborhood be held a dangerous spot on account of the malaria insomuch that the traveller will make but a brief and careless inquisition for the traces of the old wonder and will stake his credit before the public in some pacific monthly of that day that the story of it is but a myth though enriched with a spiritual profundity which he will proceed to unfold  yet it is impossible for a yankee at least to see so much magnificent ingenuity thrown away without trying to endow the unfortunate result with some kind of use fulness though perhaps widely different from the purpose of its original conception  in former ages the milelong corridors with their numerous alcoves might have been utilized as a series of dungeons the fittest of all possible receptacles for prisoners of state  dethroned monarchs and fallen statesmen would not have needed to remonstrate against a domicile so spacious so deeply secluded from the worlds scorn and so admirably in accordance with their thenceforward sunless fortunes  an alcove here might have suited sir walter raleigh better than that darksome hidingplace communicating with the great chamber in the tower pacing from end to end of which he meditated upon his history of the world  his track would here have been straight and narrow indeed and would therefore have lacked somewhat of the freedom that his intellect demanded and yet the length to which his footsteps might have travelled forth and retraced themselves would partly have harmonized his physical movement with the grand curves and planetary returns of his thought through cycles of majestic periods having it in his mind to compose the worlds history methinks he could have asked no better retirement than such a cloister as this insulated from all the seductions of mankind and womankind deep beneath their mysteries and motives down into the heart of things full of personal reminiscences in order to the comprehensive measurement and verification of historic records seeing into the secrets of human naturesecrets that daylight never yet revealed to mortalbut detecting their whole scope and purport with the infallible eyes of unbroken solitude and night  and then the shades of the old mighty men might have risen from their still profounder abodes and joined him in the dim corridor treading beside him with an antique stateliness of mien telling him in melancholy tones grand but always melancholy of the greater ideas and purposes which their most renowned performances so imperfectly carried out that magnificent successes in the view of all posterity they were but failures to those who planned them  as raleigh was a navigator noah would have explained to him the peculiarities of construction that made the ark so seaworthy as raleigh was a statesman moses would have discussed with him the principles of laws and government as raleigh was a soldier caesar and hannibal would have held debate in his presence with this martial student for their umpire as raleigh was a poet david or whatever most illustrious bard he might call up would have touched his harp and made manifest all the true significance of the past by means of song and the subtle intelligences of music  meanwhile i had forgotten that sir walter raleighs century knew nothing of gaslight and that it would require a prodigious and wasteful expenditure of tallowcandles to illuminate the tunnel sufficiently to discern even a ghost  on this account however it would be all the more suitable place of confinement for a metaphysician to keep him from bewildering mankind with his shadowy speculations and being shut off from external converse the dark corridor would help him to make rich discoveries in those cavernous regions and mysterious bypaths of the intellect which he had so long accustomed himself to explore  but how would every successive age rejoice in so secure a habitation for its reformers and especially for each best and wisest man that happened to be then alive  he seeks to burn up our whole system of society under pretence of purifying it from its abuses  away with him into the tunnel and let him begin by setting the thames on fire if he is able  if not precisely these yet akin to these were some of the fantasies that haunted me as i passed under the river for the place is suggestive of such idle and irresponsible stuff by its own abortive character its lack of whereabout on upper earth or any solid foundation of realities could i have looked forward a few years i might have regretted that american enterprise had not provided a similar tunnel under the hudson or the potomac for the convenience of our national government in times hardly yet gone by  it would be delightful to clap up all the enemies of our peace and union in the dark together and there let them abide listening to the monotonous roll of the river above their heads or perhaps in a state of miraculously suspended animation untilbe it after months years or centurieswhen the turmoil shall be all over the wrong washed away in blood since that must needs be the cleansing fluid and the right firmly rooted in the soil which that blood will have enriched they might crawl forth again and catch a single glimpse at their redeemed country and feel it to be a better land than they deserve and die  i was not sorry when the daylight reached me after a much briefer abode in the nether regions than i fear would await the troublesome personages just hinted at  emerging on the surrey side of the thames i found myself in rotherhithe a neighborhood not unfamiliar to the readers of old books of maritime adventure  there being a ferry hard by the mouth of the tunnel i recrossed the river in the primitive fashion of an open boat which the conflict of wind and tide together with the swash and swell of the passing steamers tossed high and low rather tumultuously  this inquietude of our frail skiff which indeed bobbed up and down like a cork so much alarmed an old lady the only other passenger that the boatmen essayed to comfort her  never fear mother grumbled one of them well make the river as smooth as we can for you  well get a plane and plane down the waves  the joke may not read very brilliantly but i make bold to record it as the only specimen that reached my ears of the old rough waterwit for which the thames used to be so celebrated  passing directly along the line of the sunken tunnel we landed in wapping which i should have presupposed to be the most tarry and pitchy spot on earth swarming with old salts and full of warm bustling coarse homely and cheerful life  nevertheless it turned out to be a cold and torpid neighborhood mean shabby and unpicturesque both as to its buildings and inhabitants the latter comprising so far as was visible to me not a single unmistakable sailor though plenty of landsharks who get a halfdishonest livelihood by business connected with the sea  ale and spirit vaults as petty drinkingestablishments are styled in england pretending to contain vast cellars full of liquor within the compass of ten feet square above ground were particularly abundant together with apples oranges and oysters the stalls of fishmongers and butchers and slopshops where blue jackets and duck trousers swung and capered before the doors everything was on the poorest scale and the place bore an aspect of unredeemable decay  from this remote point of london i strolled leisurely towards the heart of the city while the streets at first but thinly occupied by man or vehicle got more and more thronged with footpassengers carts drays cabs and the allpervading and allaccommodating omnibus  but i lack courage and feel that i should lack perseverance as the gentlest reader would lack patience to undertake a descriptive stroll through london streets more especially as there would be a volume ready for the printer before we could reach a midway restingplace at charing cross  it will be the easier course to step aboard another passing steamer and continue our trip up the thames  the next notable group of objects is an assemblage of ancient walls battlements and turrets out of the midst of which rises prominently one great square tower of a grayish line bordered with white stone and having a small turret at each corner of the roof  this central structure is the white tower and the whole circuit of ramparts and enclosed edifices constitutes what is known in english history and still more widely and impressively in english poetry as the tower  a crowd of rivercraft are generally moored in front of it but if we look sharply at the right moment under the base of the rampart we may catch a glimpse of an arched waterentrance half submerged past which the thames glides as indifferently as if it were the mouth of a citykennel  nevertheless it is the traitors gate a dreary kind of triumphal passageway now supposed to be shut up and barred forever through which a multitude of noble and illustrious personages have entered the tower and found it a brief restingplace on their way to heaven  passing it many times i never observed that anybody glanced at this shadowy and ominous trapdoor save myself  it is well that america exists if it were only that her vagrant children may be impressed and affected by the historical monuments of england in a degree of which the native inhabitants are evidently incapable  these matters are too familiar too real and too hopelessly built in amongst and mixed up with the common objects and affairs of life to be easily susceptible of imaginative coloring in their minds and even their poets and romancers feel it a toil and almost a delusion to extract poetic material out of what seems embodied poetry itself to an american  an englishman cares nothing about the tower which to us is a haunted castle in dreamland  that honest and excellent gentleman the late mr g p r james whose mechanical ability one might have supposed would nourish itself by devouring every old stone of such a structure once assured me that he had never in his life set eyes upon the tower though for years an historic novelist in london  not to spend a whole summers day upon the voyage we will suppose ourselves to have reached london bridge and thence to have taken another steamer for a farther passage up the river  but here the memorable objects succeed each other so rapidly that i can spare but a single sentence even for the great dome through i deem it more picturesque in that dusky atmosphere than st peters in its clear blue sky  i must mention however since everything connected with royalty is especially interesting to my dear countrymen that i once saw a large and beautiful barge splendidly gilded and ornamented and overspread with a rich covering lying at the pier nearest to st pauls cathedral it had the royal banner of great britain displayed besides being decorated with a number of other flags and many footmen who are universally the grandest and gaudiest objects to be seen in england at this day and these were regal ones in a bright scarlet livery bedizened with goldlace and white silk stockings were in attendance  i know not what festive or ceremonial occasion may have drawn out this pageant after all it might have been merely a cityspectacle appertaining to the lord mayor but the sight had its value in bringing vividly before me the grand old times when the sovereign and nobles were accustomed to use the thames as the high street of the metropolis and join in pompous processions upon it whereas the desuetude of such customs nowadays has caused the whole show of riverlife to consist in a multitude of smokebegrimed steamers an analogous change has taken place in the streets where cabs and the omnibus have crowded out a rich variety of vehicles and thus life gets more monotonous in hue from age to age and appears to seize every opportunity to strip off a bit of its goldlace among the wealthier classes and to make itself decent in the lower ones  yonder is whitefriars the old rowdy alsatia now wearing as decorous a face as any other portion of london and adjoining it the avenues and brick squares of the temple with that historic garden close upon the riverside and still rich in shrubbery and flowers where the partisans of york and lancaster plucked the fatal roses and scattered their pale and bloody petals over so many english battlefields  hard by we see tine long white front or rear of somerset house and farther on rise the two new houses of parliament with a huge unfinished tower already hiding its imperfect summit in the smoky canopythe whole vast and cumbrous edifice a specimen of the best that modern architecture can effect elaborately imitating the masterpieces of those simple ages when men builded better than they knew  close by it we have a glimpse of the roof and upper towers of the holy abbey while that gray ancestral pile on the opposite side of the river is lambeth palace a venerable group of halls and turrets chiefly built of brick but with at least one large tower of stone  in our course we have passed beneath half a dozen bridges and emerging out of the black heart of london shall soon reach a cleanly suburb where old father thames if i remember begins to put on an aspect of unpolluted innocence  and now we look back upon the mass of innumerable roofs out of which rise steeples towers columns and the great crowning domelook back in short upon that mystery of the worlds proudest city amid which a man so longs and loves to be not perhaps because it contains much that is positively admirable and enjoyable but because at all events the world has nothing better  the cream of external life is there and whatever merely intellectual or material good we fail to find perfect in london we may as well content ourselves to seek that unattainable thing no farther on this earth  the steamer terminates its trip at chelsea an old town endowed with a prodigious number of pothouses and some famous gardens called the cremorne for public amusement  the most noticeable thing however is chelsea hospital which like that of greenwich was founded i believe by charles ii whose bronze statue in the guise of an old roman stands in the centre of the quadrangle and appropriated as a home for aged and infirm soldiers of the british army  the edifices are of three stories with windows in the high roofs and are built of dark sombre brick with stone edgings and facings  the effect is by no means that of grandeur which is somewhat disagreeably an attribute of greenwich hospital but a quiet and venerable neatness  at each extremity of the streetfront there is a spacious and hospitably open gateway lounging about which i saw some gray veterans in long scarlet coats of an antique fashion and the cocked hats of a century ago or occasionally a modern foragingcap almost all of them moved with a rheumatic gait two or three stumped on wooden legs and here and there an arm was missing  inquiring of one of these fragmentary heroes whether a stranger could be admitted to see the establishment he replied most cordially o yes siranywhere  walk in and go where you pleaseup stairs or anywhere  so i entered and passing along the inner side of the quadrangle came to the door of the chapel which forms a part of the contiguity of edifices next the street here another pensioner an old warrior of exceedingly peaceable and christian demeanor touched his threecornered hat and asked if i wished to see the interior to which i assenting he unlocked the door and we went in  the chapel consists of a great hall with a vaulted roof and over the altar is a large painting in fresco the subject of which i did not trouble myself to make out  more appropriate adornments of the place dedicated as well to martial reminiscences as religious worship are the long ranges of dusty and tattered banners that hang from their staves all round the ceiling of the chapel  they are trophies of battles fought and won in every quarter of the world comprising the captured flags of all the nations with whom the british lion has waged war since james iis timefrench dutch east indian prussian russian chinese and americancollected together in this consecrated spot not to symbolize that there shall be no more discord upon earth but drooping over the aisle in sullen though peaceable humiliation  yes i said american among the rest for the good old pensioner mistook me for an englishman and failed not to point out and methought with an especial emphasis of triumph some flags that had been taken at bladensburg and washington  i fancied indeed that they hung a little higher and drooped a little lower than any of their companions in disgrace  it is a comfort however that their proud devices are already indistinguishable or nearly so owing to dust and tatters and the kind offices of the moths and that they will soon rot from the bannerstaves and be swept out in unrecognized fragments from the chapeldoor  it is a good method of teaching a man how imperfectly cosmopolitan he is to show him his countrys flag occupying a position of dishonor in a foreign land  but in truth the whole system of a people crowing over its military triumphs had far better he dispensed with both on account of the illblood that it helps to keep fermenting among the nations and because it operates as an accumulative inducement to future generations to aim at a kind of glory the gain of which has generally proved more ruinous than its loss  i heartily wish that every trophy of victory might crumble away and that every reminiscence or tradition of a hero from the beginning of the world to this day could pass out of all mens memories at once and forever  i might feel very differently to be sure if we northerners had anything especially valuable to lose by the fading of those illuminated names  i gave the pensioner but i am afraid there may have been a little affectation in it a magnificent guerdon of all the silver i had in my pocket to requite him for having unintentionally stirred up my patriotic susceptibilities  he was a meeklooking kindly old man with a humble freedom and affability of manner that made it pleasant to converse with him  old soldiers i know not why seem to be more accostable than old sailors  one is apt to hear a growl beneath the smoothest courtesy of the latter  the mild veteran with his peaceful voice and gentle reverend aspect told me that he had fought at a cannon all through the battle of waterloo and escaped unhurt he had now been in the hospital four or five years and was married but necessarily underwent a separation from his wife who lived outside of the gates  to my inquiry whether his fellowpensioners were comfortable and happy he answered with great alacrity o yes sir qualifying his evidence after a moments consideration by saying in an undertone there are some people your honor knows who could not be comfortable anywhere  i did know it and fear that the system of chelsea hospital allows too little of that wholesome care and regulation of their own occupations and interests which might assuage the sting of life to those naturally uncomfortable individuals by giving them something external to think about  but my old friend here was happy in the hospital and by this time very likely is happy in heaven in spite of the bloodshed that he may have caused by touching off a cannon at waterloo  crossing battersea bridge in the neighborhood of chelsea i remember seeing a distant gleam of the crystal palace glimmering afar in the afternoon sunshine like an imaginary structurean aircastle by chance descended upon earth and resting there one instant before it vanished as we sometimes see a soapbubble touch unharmed on the carpeta thing of only momentary visibility and no substance destined to be overburdened and crushed down by the first cloudshadow that might fall upon that spot  even as i looked it disappeared  shall i attempt a picture of this exhalation of modern ingenuity or what else shall i try to paint  everything in london and its vicinity has been depicted innumerable times but never once translated into intelligible images it is an old old story never yet told nor to be told  while writing these reminiscences i am continually impressed with the futility of the effort to give any creative truth to ink sketch so that it might produce such pictures in the readers mind as would cause the original scenes to appear familiar when afterwards beheld  nor have other writers often been more successful in representing definite objects prophetically to my own mind  in truth i believe that the chief delight and advantage of this kind of literature is not for any real information that it supplies to untravelled people but for reviving the recollections and reawakening the emotions of persons already acquainted with the scenes described thus i found an exquisite pleasure the other day in reading mr tuckermans month in england fine example of the way in which a refined and cultivated american looks at the old country the things that he naturally seeks there and the modes of feeling and reflection which they excite  correct outlines avail little or nothing though truth of coloring may be somewhat more efficacious  impressions however states of mind produced by interesting and remarkable objects these if truthfully and vividly recorded may work a genuine effect and though lint the result of what we see go further towards representing the actual scene than any direct effort to paint it  give the emotions that cluster about it and without being able to analyze the spell by which it is summoned up you get something like a simulacre of the object in the midst of them  from some of the above reflections i draw the comfortable inference that the longer and better known a thing may be so much the more eligible is it as the subject of a descriptive sketch  on a sunday afternoon i passed through a sideentrance in the timeblackened wall of a place of worship and found myself among a congregation assembled in one of the transepts and the immediately contiguous portion of the nave  it was a vast old edifice spacious enough within the extent covered by its pillared roof and overspread by its stone pavement to accommodate the whole of churchgoing london and with a far wider and loftier concave than any human power of lungs could fill with audible prayer  oaken benches were arranged in the transept on one of which i seated myself and joined as well as i knew how in the sacred business that was going forward  but when it came to the sermon the voice of the preacher was puny and so were his thoughts and both seemed impertinent at such a time and place where he and all of us were bodily included within a sublime act of religion which could be seen above and around us and felt beneath our feet  the structure itself was the worship of the devout men of long ago miraculously preserved in stone without losing an atom of its fragrance and fervor it was a kind of anthemstrain that they had sung and poured out of the organ in centuries gone by and being so grand and sweet the divine benevolence had willed it to be prolonged for the behoof of auditors unborn  i therefore came to the conclusion that in my individual case it would be better and more reverent to let my eyes wander about the edifice than to fasten them and my thoughts on the evidently uninspired mortal who was venturingand felt it no venture at allto speak here above his breath  the interior of westminster abbey for the reader recognized it no doubt the moment we entered is built of rich brown stone and the whole of itthe lofty roof the tall clustered pillars and the pointed archesappears to be in consummate repair  at all points where decay has laid its finger the structure is clamped with iron or otherwise carefully protected and being thus watched overwhether as a place of ancient sanctity a noble specimen of gothic art or an object of national interest and prideit may reasonably be expected to survive for as many ages as have passed over it already  it was sweet to feel its venerable quietude its longenduring peace and yet to observe how kindly and even cheerfully it received the sunshine of today which fell from the great windows into the fretted aisles and arches that laid aside somewhat of their aged gloom to welcome it  sunshine always seems friendly to old abbeys churches and castles kissing them as it were with a more affectionate though still reverential familiarity than it accords to edifices of later date  a square of golden light lay on the sombre pavement of the nave afar off falling through the grand western entrance the folding leaves of which were wide open and afforded glimpses of people passing to and fro in the outer world while we sat dimly enveloped in the solemnity of antique devotion  in the south transept separated from us by the full breadth of the minster there were painted glass windows of which the uppermost appeared to be a great orb of manycolored radiance being indeed a cluster of saints and angels whose glorified bodies formed the rays of an aureole emanating from a cross in the midst  these windows are modern but combine softness with wonderful brilliancy of effect  through the pillars and arches i saw that the walls in that distant region of the edifice were almost wholly incrusted with marble now grown yellow with time no blank unlettered slabs but memorials of such men as their respective generations deemed wisest and bravest  some of them were commemorated merely by inscriptions on mural tablets others by sculptured basreliefs others once famous but now forgotten generals or admirals these by ponderous tombs that aspired towards the roof of the aisle or partly curtained the immense arch of a window  these mountains of marble were peopled with the sisterhood of allegory winged trumpeters and classic figures in fullbottomed wigs but it was strange to observe how the old abbey melted all such absurdities into the breadth of its own grandeur even magnifying itself by what would elsewhere have been ridiculous  methinks it is the test of gothic sublimity to overpower the ridiculous without deigning to hide it and these grotesque monuments of the last century answer a similar purpose with the grinning faces which the old architects scattered among their most solemn conceptions  from these distant wanderings it was my first visit to westminster abbey and i would gladly have taken it all in at a glance my eyes came back and began to investigate what was immediately about me in the transept  close at my elbow was the pedestal of cannings statue  next beyond it was a massive tomb on the spacious tablet of which reposed the fulllength figures of a marble lord and lady whom an inscription announced to be the duke and duchess of newcastlethe historic duke of charles is time and the fantastic duchess traditionally remembered by her poems and plays  she was of a family as the record on her tomb proudly informed us of which all the brothers had been valiant and all the sisters virtuous  a recent statue of sir john malcolm the new marble as white as snow held the next place and near by was a mural monument and bust of sir peter warren  the round visage of this old british admiral has a certain interest for a newenglander because it was by no merit of his own though he took care to assume it as such but by the valor and warlike enterprise of our colonial forefathers especially the stout men of massachusetts that he won rank and renown and a tomb in westminster abbey  lord mansfield a huge mass of marble done into the guise of a judicial gown and wig with a stern face in the midst of the latter sat on the other side of the transept and on the pedestal beside him was a figure of justice holding forth instead of the customary grocers scales an actual pair of brass steelyards  it is an ancient and classic instrument undoubtedly but i had supposed that portia when shylocks pound of flesh was to be weighed was the only judge that ever really called for it in a court of justice  pitt and fox were in the same distinguished company and john kemble in roman costume stood not far off but strangely shorn of the dignity that is said to have enveloped him like a mantle in his lifetime  perhaps the evanescent majesty of the stage is incompatible with the long endurance of marble and the solemn reality of the tomb though on the other hand almost every illustrious personage here represented has been invested with more or less of stagetrickery by his sculptor  in truth the artist unless there be a divine efficacy in his touch making evident a heretofore hidden dignity in the actual form feels itan imperious law to remove his subject as far from the aspect of ordinary life as may be possible without sacrificing every trace of resemblance  the absurd effect of the contrary course is very remarkable in the statue of mr wilberforce whose actual self save for the lack of color i seemed to behold seated just across the aisle  this excellent man appears to have sunk into himself in a sitting posture with a thin leg crossed over his knee a book in one hand and a finger of the other under his chin i believe or applied to the side of his nose or to some equally familiar purpose while his exceedingly homely and wrinkled face held a little on one side twinkles at you with the shrewdest complacency as if he were looking right into your eyes and twigged something there which you had half a mind to conceal from him  he keeps this look so pertinaciously that you feel it to be insufferably impertinent and bethink yourself what common ground there may be between yourself and a stone image enabling you to resent it  i have no doubt that the statue is as like mr wilberforce as one pea to another and you might fancy that at some ordinary moment when he least expected it and before he had time to smooth away his knowing complication of wrinkles he had seen the gorgons head and whitened into marblenot only his personal self but his coat and smallclothes down to a button and the minutest crease of the cloth  the ludicrous result marks the impropriety of bestowing the agelong duration of marble upon small characteristic individualities such as might come within the province of waxen imagery  the sculptor should give permanence to the figure of a great man in his mood of broad and grand composure which would obliterate all mean peculiarities for if the original were unaccustomed to such a mood or if his features were incapable of assuming the guise it seems questionable whether he could really have been entitled to a marble immortality  in point of fact however the english face and form are seldom statuesque however illustrious the individual  it ill becomes me perhaps to have lapsed into this mood of halfjocose criticism in describing my first visit to westminster abbey a spot which i had dreamed about more reverentially from my childhood upward than any other in the world and which i then beheld and now look back upon with profound gratitude to the men who built it and a kindly interest i may add in the humblest personage that has contributed his little all to its impressiveness by depositing his dust or his memory there  but it is a characteristic of this grand edifice that it permits you to smile as freely under the roof of its central nave as if you stood beneath the yet grander canopy of heaven  break into laughter if you feel inclined provided the vergers do not hear it echoing among the arches  in an ordinary church you would keep your countenance for fear of disturbing the sanctities or proprieties of the place but you need leave no honest and decorous portion of your human nature outside of these benign and truly hospitable walls  their mild awfulness will take care of itself thus it does no harm to the general impression when you come to be sensible that many of the monuments are ridiculous and commemorate a mob of people who are mostly forgotten in their graves and few of whom ever deserved any better boon from posterity  you acknowledge the force of sir godfrey knellers objection to being buried in westminster abbey because they do bury fools there  nevertheless these grotesque carvings of marble that break out in dingywhite blotches on the old freestone of the interior walls have come there by as natural a process as might cause mosses and ivy to cluster about the external edifice for they are the historical and biographical record of each successive age written with its own hand and all the truer for the inevitable mistakes and none the less solemn for the occasional absurdity  though you entered the abbey expecting to see the tombs only of the illustrious you are content at last to read many names both in literature and history that have now lost the reverence of mankind if indeed they ever really possessed it  let these men rest in peace  even if you miss a name or two that you hoped to find there they may well be spared  it matters little a few more or less or whether westminster abbey contains or lacks any one mans grave so long as the centuries each with the crowd of personages that it deemed memorable have chosen it as their place of honored sepulture and laid themselves down under its pavement  the inscriptions and devices on the walls are rich with evidences of the fluctuating tastes fashions manners opinions prejudices follies wisdoms of the past and thus they combine into a more truthful memorial of their dead times than any individual epitaphmaker ever meant to write  when the services were over many of the audience seemed inclined to linger in the nave or wander away among the mysterious aisles for there is nothing in this world so fascinating as a gothic minster which always invites you deeper and deeper into its heart both by vast revelations and shadowy concealments  through the openwork screen that divides the nave from the chancel and choir we could discern the gleam of a marvellous window but were debarred from entrance into that more sacred precinct of the abbey by the vergers  these vigilant officials doing their duty all the more strenuously because no fees could be exacted from sunday visitors flourished their staves and drove us towards the grand entrance like a flock of sheep  lingering through one of the aisles i happened to look down and found my foot upon a stone inscribed with this familiar exclamation o rare ben jonson and remembered the story of stout old bens burial in that spot standing uprightnot i presume on account of any unseemly reluctance on his part to lie down in the dust like other men but because standingroom was all that could reasonably be demanded for a poet among the slumberous notabilities of his age  it made me weary to think of itsuch a prodigious length of time to keep ones feetapart from the honor of the thing it would certainly have been better for ben to stretch himself at ease in some country churchyard  to this day however i fancy that there is a contemptuous alloy mixed up with the admiration which the higher classes of english society profess for their literary men  another dayin truth many other daysi sought out poets corner and found a signboard and pointed finger directing the visitor to it on the corner house of a little lane leading towards the rear of the abbey the entrance is at the southeastern end of the south transept and it is used on ordinary occasions as the only free mode of access to the building  it is no spacious arch but a small lowly door passing through which and pushing aside an inner screen that partly keeps out an exceedingly chill wind you find yourself in a dim nook of the abbey with the busts of poets gazing at you from the otherwise bare stonework of the walls  great poets too for ben jenson is right behind the door and spensers tablet is next and butlers on the same side of the transept and miltons whose bust you know at once by its resemblance to one of his portraits though older more wrinkled and sadder than that is close by and a profilemedallion of gray beneath it  a window high aloft sheds down a dusky daylight on these and many other sculptured marbles now as yellow as old parchment that cover the three walls of the nook up to an elevation of about twenty feet above the pavement  it seemed to me that i had always been familiar with the spot  enjoying a humble intimacyand how much of my life had else been a dreary solitudewith many of its inhabitants i could not feel myself a stranger there  it was delightful to be among them  there was a genial awe mingled with a sense of kind and friendly presences about me and i was glad moreover at finding so many of them there together in fit companionship mutually recognized and duly honored all reconciled now whatever distant generations whatever personal hostility or other miserable impediment had divided them far asunder while they lived i have never felt a similar interest in any other tombstones nor have i ever been deeply moved by the imaginary presence of other famous dead people  a poets ghost is the only one that survives for his fellowmortals after his bones are in the dustand be not ghostly but cherishing many hearts with his own warmth in the chillest atmosphere of life  what other fame is worth aspiring for  or let me speak it more boldly what other longenduring fame can exist  we neither remember nor care anything for the past except as the poet has made it intelligibly noble and sublime to our comprehension  the shades of the mighty have no substance they flit ineffectually about the darkened stage where they performed their momentary parts save when the poet has thrown his own creative soul into them and imparted a more vivid life than ever they were able to manifest to mankind while they dwelt in the body  and thereforethough he cunningly disguises himself in their armor their robes of state or kingly purpleit is not the statesman the warrior or the monarch that survives but the despised poet whom they may have fed with their crumbs and to whom they owe all that they now are or havea name  in the foregoing paragraph i seem to have been betrayed into a flight above or beyond the customary level that best agrees with me but it represents fairly enough the emotions with which i passed from poets corner into the chapels which contain the sepulchres of kings and great people  they are magnificent even now and must have been inconceivably so when the marble slabs and pillars wore their new polish and the statues retained the brilliant colors with which they were originally painted and the shrines their rich gilding of which the sunlight still shows a glimmer or a streak though the sunbeam itself looks tarnished with antique dust  yet this recondite portion of the abbey presents few memorials of personages whom we care to remember  the shrine of edward the confessor has a certain interest because it was so long held in religious reverence and because the very dust that settled upon it was formerly worth gold  the helmet and warsaddle of henry v worn at agincourt and now suspended above his tomb are memorable objects but more for shakespeares sake than the victors own  rank has been the general passport to admission here  noble and regal dust is as cheap as dirt under the pavement  i am glad to recollect indeed and it is too characteristic of the right english spirit not to be mentioned one or two gigantic statues of great mechanicians who contributed largely to the material welfare of england sitting familiarly in their marble chairs among forgotten kings and queens  otherwise the quaintness of the earlier monuments and the antique beauty of some of them are what chiefly gives them value  nevertheless addison is buried among the men of rank not on the plea of his literary fame however but because he was connected with nobility by marriage and had been a secretary of state  his gravestone is inscribed with a resounding verse from tickells lines to his memory the only lines by which tickell himself is now remembered and which as i discovered a little while ago he mainly filched from an obscure versifier of somewhat earlier date  returning to poets corner i looked again at the walls and wondered how the requisite hospitality can be shown to poets of our own and the succeeding ages  there is hardly a foot of space left although room has lately been found for a bust of southey and a fulllength statue of campbell  at best only a little portion of the abbey is dedicated to poets literary men musical composers and others of the gentle artist breed and even into that small nook of sanctity men of other pursuits have thought it decent to intrude themselves  methinks the tuneful throng being at home here should recollect how they were treated in their lifetime and turn the cold shoulder looking askance at nobles and official personages however worthy of honorable intercourse elsewhere yet it shows aptly and truly enough what portion of the worlds regard and honor has heretofore been awarded to literary eminence in comparison with other modes of greatnessthis dimly lighted corner nor even that quietly to themselves in the vast minster the walls of which are sheathed and hidden under marble that has been wasted upon the illustrious obscure  nevertheless it may not be worth while to quarrel with the world on this account for to confess the very truth their own little nook contains more than one poet whose memory is kept alive by his monument instead of imbuing the senseless stone with a spiritual immortalitymen of whom you do not ask where is he but why is he here  i estimate that all the literary people who really make an essential part of ones inner life including the period since english literature first existed might have ample elbowroom to sit down and quaff their draughts of castaly round chaucers broad horizontal tombstone  these divinest poets consecrate the spot and throw a reflected glory over the humblest of their companions  and as for the latter it is to be hoped that they may have long outgrown the characteristic jealousies and morbid sensibilities of their craft and have found out the little value probably not amounting to sixpence in immortal currency of the posthumous renown which they once aspired to win  it would be a poor compliment to a dead poet to fancy him leaning out of the sky and snuffing up the impure breath of earthly praise  yet we cannot easily rid ourselves of the notion that those who have bequeathed us the inheritance of an undying song would fain be conscious of its endless reverberations in the hearts of mankind and would delight among sublimer enjoyments to see their names emblazoned in such a treasureplace of great memories as westminster abbey  there are some men at all eventstrue and tender poets moreover and fully deserving of the honorwhose spirits i feel certain would linger a little while about poets corner for the sake of witnessing their own apotheosis among their kindred  they have had a strong natural yearning not so much for applause as sympathy which the cold fortune of their lifetime did but scantily supply so that this unsatisfied appetite may make itself felt upon sensibilities at once so delicate and retentive even a step or two beyond the grave  leigh hunt for example would be pleased even now if he could learn that his bust had been reposited in the midst of the old poets whom he admired and loved though there is hardly a man among the authors of today and yesterday whom the judgment of englishmen would be less likely to place there  he deserves it however if not for his verse the value of which i do not estimate never having been able to read it yet for his delightful prose his unmeasured poetry the inscrutable happiness of his touch working soft miracles by a lifeprocess like the growth of grass and flowers  as with all such gentle writers his page sometimes betrayed a vestige of affectation but the next moment a rich natural luxuriance overgrew and buried it out of sight  i knew him a little and since heaven be praised few english celebrities whom i chanced to meet have enfranchised my pen by their decease and as i assume no liberties with living men i will conclude this rambling article by sketching my first interview with leigh hunt  he was then at hammersmith occupying a very plain and shabby little house in a contiguous range of others like it with no prospect but that of an ugly village street and certainly nothing to gratify his craving for a tasteful environment inside or out  a slatternly maidservant opened the door for us and he himself stood in the entry a beautiful and venerable old man buttoned to the chin in a black dresscoat tall and slender with a countenance quietly alive all over and the gentlest and most naturally courteous manner  he ushered us into his little study or parlor or botha very forlorn room with poor paperhangings and carpet few books no pictures that i remember and an awful lack of upholstery  i touch distinctly upon these external blemishes and this nudity of adornment not that they would be worth mentioning in a sketch of other remarkable persons but because leigh hunt was born with such a faculty of enjoying all beautiful things that it seemed as if fortune did him as much wrong in not supplying them as in withholding a sufficiency of vital breath from ordinary men  all kinds of mild magnificence tempered by his taste would have become him well but he had not the grim dignity that assumes nakedness as the better robe  i have said that he was a beautiful old man  in truth i never saw a finer countenance either as to the mould of features or the expression nor any that showed the play of feeling so perfectly without the slightest theatrical emphasis  it was like a childs face in this respect  at my first glimpse of him when he met us in the entry i discerned that he was old his long hair being white and his wrinkles many it was an aged visage in short such as i had not at all expected to see in spite of dates because his books talk to the reader with the tender vivacity of youth  but when he began to speak and as he grew more earnest in conversation i ceased to be sensible of his age sometimes indeed its dusky shadow darkened through the gleam which his sprightly thoughts diffused about his face but then another flash of youth came out of his eyes and made an illumination again  i never witnessed such a wonderfully illusive transformation before or since and to this day trusting only to my recollection i should find it difficult to decide which was his genuine and stable predicamentyouth or age  i have met no englishman whose manners seemed to me so agreeable soft rather than polished wholly unconventional the natural growth of a kindly and sensitive disposition without any reference to rule or else obedient to some rule so subtile that the nicest observer could not detect the application of it  his eyes were dark and very fine and his delightful voice accompanied their visible language like music  he appeared to be exceedingly appreciative of whatever was passing among those who surrounded him and especially of the vicissitudes in the consciousness of the person to whom he happened to be addressing himself at the moment  i felt that no effect upon my mind of what he uttered no emotion however transitory in myself escaped his notice though not from any positive vigilance on his part but because his faculty of observation was so penetrative and delicate and to say the truth it a little confused me to discern always a ripple on his mobile face responsive to any slightest breeze that passed over the inner reservoir of my sentiments and seemed thence to extend to a similar reservoir within himself  on matters of feeling and within a certain depth you might spare yourself the trouble of utterance because he already knew what you wanted to say and perhaps a little more than you would have spoken  his figure was full of gentle movement though somehow without disturbing its quietude and as he talked he kept folding his hands nervously and betokened in many ways a fine and immediate sensibility quick to feel pleasure or pain though scarcely capable i should imagine of a passionate experience in either direction  there was not am english trait in him from head to foot morally intellectually or physically  beef ale or stout brandy or portwine entered not at all into his composition  in his earlier life he appears to have given evidences of courage and sturdy principle and of a tendency to fling himself into the rough struggle of humanity on the liberal side  it would be taking too much upon myself to affirm that this was merely a projection of his fancy world into the actual and that he never could have hit a downright blow and was altogether an unsuitable person to receive one  i beheld him not in his armor but in his peacefulest robes  nevertheless drawing my conclusion merely from what i saw it would have occurred to me that his main deficiency was a lack of grit  though anything but a timid man the combative and defensive elements were not prominently developed in his character and could have been made available only when he put an unnatural force upon his instincts  it was on this account and also because of the fineness of his nature generally that the english appreciated him no better and left this sweet and delicate poet poor and with scanty laurels in his declining age  it was not i think from his american blood that leigh hunt derived either his amiability or his peaceful inclinations at least i do not see how we can reasonably claim the former quality as a national characteristic though the latter might have been fairly inherited from his ancestors on the mothers side who were pennsylvania quakers  but the kind of excellence that distinguished himhis fineness subtilty and gracewas that which the richest cultivation has heretofore tended to develop in the happier examples of american genius and which though i say it a little reluctantly is perhaps what our future intellectual advancement may make general among us  his person at all events was thoroughly american and of the best type as were likewise his manners for we are the best as well as the worst mannered people in the world  leigh hunt loved dearly to be praised  that is to say he desired sympathy as a flower seeks sunshine and perhaps profited by it as much in the richer depth of coloring that it imparted to his ideas  in response to all that we ventured to express about his writings and for my part i went quite to the extent of my conscience which was a long way and there left the matter to a lady and a young girl who happily were with me his face shone and he manifested great delight with a perfect and yet delicate frankness for which i loved him  he could not tell us he said the happiness that such appreciation gave him it always took him by surprise he remarked forperhaps because he cleaned his own boots and performed other little ordinary offices for himself he never had been conscious of anything wonderful in his own person  and then he smiled making himself and all the poor little parlor about him beautiful thereby  it is usually the hardest thing in the world to praise a man to his face but leigh hunt received the incense with such gracious satisfaction feeling it to be sympathy not vulgar praise that the only difficulty was to keep the enthusiasm of the moment within the limit of permanent opinion  a storm had suddenly come up while we were talking the rain poured the lightning flashed and the thunder broke but i hope and have great pleasure in believing that it was a sunny hour for leigh hunt  nevertheless it was not to my voice that he most favorably inclined his ear but to those of my companions  women are the fit ministers at such a shrine  he must have suffered keenly in his lifetime and enjoyed keenly keeping his emotions so much upon the surface as he seemed to do and convenient for everybody to play upon  being of a cheerful temperament happiness had probably the upper hand  his was a light mildly joyous nature gentle graceful yet seldom attaining to that deepest grace which results from power for beauty like woman its human representative dallies with the gentle but yields its consummate favor only to the strong  i imagine that leigh bunt may have been more beautiful when i met him both in person and character than in his earlier days  as a young man i could conceive of his being finical in certain moods but not now when the gravity of age shed a venerable grace about him  i rejoiced to hear him say that he was favored with most confident and cheering anticipations in respect to a future life and there were abundant proofs throughout our interview of an unrepining spirit resignation quiet relinquishment of the worldly benefits that were denied him thankful enjoyment of whatever he had to enjoy and piety and hope shining onward into the duskall of which gave a reverential cast to the feeling with which we parted from him  i wish that he could have had one full draught of prosperity before he died  as a matter of artistic propriety it would have been delightful to see him inhabiting a beautiful house of his own in an italian climate with all sorts of elaborate upholstery and minute elegances about him and a succession of tender and lovely women to praise his sweet poetry from morning to night i hardly know whether it is my fault or the effect of a weakness in leigh haunts character that i should be sensible of a regret of this nature when at the same time i sincerely believe that he has found an infinity of better things in the world whither he has gone  at our leavetaking he grasped me warmly by both hands and seemed as much interested in our whole party as if he had known us for years  all this was genuine feeling a quick luxuriant growth out of his heart which was a soil for flowerseeds of rich and rare varieties not acorns but a true heart nevertheless  several years afterwards i met him for the last time at a london dinnerparty looking sadly broken down by infirmities and my final recollection of the beautiful old man presents him arm in arm with nay if i mistake not partly embraced and supported by another beloved and honored poet whose minstrelname since he has a weekday one for his personal occasions i will venture to speak  it was barry cornwall whose kind introduction had first made me known to leigh hunt     outside glimpses of english poverty   becoming an inhabitant of a great english town i often turned aside from the prosperous thoroughfares where the edifices the shops and the bustling crowd differed not so much from scenes with which i was familiar in my own country and went designedly astray among precincts that reminded me of some of dickenss grimiest pages  there i caught glimpses of a people and a mode of life that were comparatively new to my observation a sort of sombre phantasmagoric spectacle exceedingly undelightful to behold yet involving a singular interest and even fascination in its ugliness  dirt one would fancy is plenty enough all over the world being the symbolic accompaniment of the foul incrustation which began to settle over and bedim all earthly things as soon as eve had bitten the apple ever since which hapless epoch her daughters have chiefly been engaged in a desperate and unavailing struggle to get rid of it  but the dirt of a povertystricken english street is a monstrosity unknown on our side of the atlantic  it reigns supreme within its own limits and is inconceivable everywhere beyond them  we enjoy the great advantage that the brightness and dryness of our atmosphere keep everything clean that the sun shines upon converting the larger portion of our impurities into transitory dust which the next wind can sweep away in contrast with the damp adhesive grime that incorporates itself with all surfaces unless continually and painfully cleansed in the chill moisture of the english air  then the allpervading smoke of the city abundantly intermingled with the sable snowflakes of bituminous coal hovering overhead descending and alighting on pavements and rich architectural fronts on the snowy muslin of the ladies and the gentlemens starched collars and shirtbosoms invests even the better streets in a halfmourning garb it is beyond the resources of wealth to keep the smut away from its premises or its own fingers ends and as for poverty it surrenders itself to the dark influence without a struggle  along with disastrous circumstances pinching need adversity so lengthened out as to constitute the rule of life there comes a certain chill depression of the spirits which seems especially to shudder at cold water  in view of so wretched a state of things we accept the ancient deluge not merely as an insulated phenomenon but as a periodical necessity and acknowledge that nothing less than such a general washingday could suffice to cleanse the slovenly old world of its moral and material dirt  ginshops or what the english call spiritvaults are numerous in the vicinity of these poor streets and are set off with the magnificence of gilded doorposts tarnished by contact with the unclean customers who haunt there  ragged children come thither with old shavingmugs or brokennosed teapots or ally such makeshift receptacle to get a little poison or madness for their parents who deserve no better requital at their hands for having engendered them  inconceivably sluttish women enter at noonday and stand at the counter among booncompanions of both sexes stirring up misery and jollity in a bumper together and quaffing off the mixture with a relish  as for the men they lounge there continually drinking till they are drunkendrinking as long as they have a halfpenny left and then as it seemed to me waiting for a sixpenny miracle to be wrought in their pockets so as to enable them to be drunken again  most of these establishments have a significant advertisement of beds doubtless for the accommodation of their customers in the interval between one intoxication and the next  i never could find it in my heart however utterly to condemn these sad revellers and should certainly wait till i had some better consolation to offer before depriving them of their dram of gin though death itself were in the glass for methought their poor souls needed such fiery stimulant to lift them a little way out of the smothering squalor of both their outward and interior life giving them glimpses and suggestions even if bewildering ones of a spiritual existence that limited their present misery  the temperancereformers unquestionably derive their commission from the divine beneficence but have never been taken fully into its counsels  all may not be lost though those good men fail  pawnbrokers establishments distinguished by the mystic symbol of the three golden balls were conveniently accessible though what personal property these wretched people could possess capable of being estimated in silver or copper so as to afford a basis for a loan was a problem that still perplexes me  old clothesmen likewise dwelt hard by and hung out ancient garments to dangle in the wind  there were butchers shops too of a class adapted to the neighborhood presenting no such generously fattened carcasses as englishmen love to gaze at in the market no stupendous halves of mighty beeves no dead hogs or muttons ornamented with carved basreliefs of fat on their ribs and shoulders in a peculiarly british style of artnot these but bits and gobbets of lean meat selvages snipt off from steaks tough and stringy morsels bare bones smitten away from joints by the cleaver tripe liver bullocks feet or whatever else was cheapest and divisible into the smallest lots  i am afraid that even such delicacies came to many of their tables hardly oftener than christmas  in the windows of other little shops you saw half a dozen wizened herrings some eggs in a basket looking so dingily antique that your imagination smelt them flyspeckled biscuits segments of a hungry cheese pipes and papers of tobacco  now and then a sturdy milkwoman passed by with a wooden yoke over her shoulders supporting a pail on either side filled with a whitish fluid the composition of which was water and chalk and the milk of a sickly cow who gave the best she had poor thing but could scarcely make it rich or wholesome spending her life in some close citynook and pasturing on strange food  i have seen once or twice a donkey coming into one of these streets with panniers full of vegetables and departing with a return cargo of what looked like rubbish and streetsweepings  no other commerce seemed to exist except possibly a girl might offer you a pair of stockings or a worked collar or a man whisper something mysterious about wonderfully cheap cigars  and yet i remember seeing female hucksters in those regions with their wares on the edge of the sidewalk and their own seats right in the carriageway pretending to sell halfdecayed oranges and apples toffy ormskirk cakes combs and cheap jewelry the coarsest kind of crockery and little plates of oystersknitting patiently all day long and removing their undiminished stock in trade at nightfall  all indispensable importations from other quarters of the town were on a remarkably diminutive scale for example the wealthier inhabitants purchased their coal by the wheelbarrowload and the poorer ones by the peckmeasure it was a curious and melancholy spectacle when an overladen coalcart happened to pass through the street and drop a handful or two of its burden in the mud to see half a dozen women and children scrambling for the treasuretrove like a flock of hens and chickens gobbling up some spilt corn  in this connection i may as well mention a commodity of boiled snails for such they appeared to me though probably a marine production which used to be peddled from door to door piping hot as an article of cheap nutriment  the population of these dismal abodes appeared to consider the sidewalks and middle of the street as their common hall  in a drama of low life the unity of place might be arranged rigidly according to the classic rule and the street be the one locality in which every scene and incident should occur  courtship quarrels plot and counterplot conspiracies for robbery and murder family difficulties or agreements all such matters i doubt not are constantly discussed or transacted in this skyroofed saloon so regally hung with its sombre canopy of coalsmoke  whatever the disadvantages of the english climate the only comfortable or wholesome part of life for the city poor must be spent in the open air  the stifled and squalid rooms where they lie down at night whole families and neighborhoods together or sulkily elbow one another in the daytime when a settled rain drives them within doors are worse horrors than it is worth while without a practical object in view to admit into ones imagination  no wonder that they creep forth from the foul mystery of their interiors stumble down from their garrets or scramble up out of their cellars on the upper step of which you may see the grimy housewife before the shower is ended letting the raindrops gutter down her visage while her children an impish progeny of cavernous recesses below the common sphere of humanity swarm into the daylight and attain all that they know of personal purification in the nearest mudpuddle  it might almost make a man doubt the existence of his own soul to observe how nature has flung these little wretches into the street and left them there so evidently regarding them as nothing worth and how all mankind acquiesce in the great mothers estimate of her offspring  for if they are to have no immortality what superior claim can i assert for mine and how difficult to believe that anything so precious as a germ of immortal growth can have been buried under this dirtheap plunged into this cesspool of misery and vice  as often as i beheld the scene it affected me with surprise and loathsome interest much resembling though in a far intenser degree the feeling with which when a boy i used to turn over a plank or an old log that had long lain on the damp ground and found a vivacious multitude of unclean and devilishlooking insects scampering to and fro beneath it  without an infinite faith there seemed as much prospect of a blessed futurity for those hideous hugs and manyfooted worms as for these brethren of our humanity and coheirs of all our heavenly inheritance  ah what a mystery  slowly slowly as after groping at the bottom of a deep noisome stagnant pool my hope struggles upward to the surface bearing the halfdrowned body of a child along with it and heaving it aloft for its life and my own life and all our lives  unless these slimeclogged nostrils can be made capable of inhaling celestial air i know not how the purest and most intellectual of us can reasonably expect ever to taste a breath of it  the whole question of eternity is staked there if a single one of those helpless little ones be lost the world is lost  the women and children greatly preponderate in such places the men probably wandering abroad in quest of that daily miracle a dinner and a drink or perhaps slumbering in the daylight that they may the better follow out their catlike rambles through the dark  here are women with young figures but old wrinkled yellow faces fanned and bleareyed with the smoke which they cannot spare from their scanty firesit being too precious for its warmth to be swallowed by the chimney  some of them sit on the doorsteps nursing their unwashed babies at bosoms which we will glance aside from for the sake of our mothers and all womanhood because the fairest spectacle is here the foulest  yet motherhood in these dark abodes is strangely identical with what we have all known it to be in the happiest homes  nothing as i remember smote me with more grief and pity all the more poignant because perplexingly entangled with an inclination to smile than to hear a gaunt and ragged mother priding herself on the pretty ways of her ragged and skinny infant just as a young matron might when she invites her lady friends to admire her plump whiterobed darling in the nursery  indeed no womanly characteristic seemed to have altogether perished out of these poor souls  it was the very same creature whose tender torments make the rapture of our young days whom we love cherish and protect and rely upon in life and death and whom we delight to see beautify her beauty with rich robes and set it off with jewels though now fantastically masquerading in a garb of tatters wholly unfit for her to handle  i recognized her over and over again in the groups round a doorstep or in the descent of a cellar chatting with prodigious earnestness about intangible trifles laughing for a little jest sympathizing at almost the same instant with one neighbors sunshine and anothers shadow wise simple sly and patient yet easily perturbed and breaking into small feminine ebullitions of spite wrath and jealousy tornadoes of a moment such as vary the social atmosphere of her silkenskirted sisters though smothered into propriety by dint of a wellbred habit  not that there was an absolute deficiency of goodbreeding even here  it often surprised me to witness a courtesy and deference among these ragged folks which having seen it i did not thoroughly believe in wondering whence it should have come  i am persuaded however that there were laws of intercourse which they never violateda code of the cellar the garret the common staircase the doorstep and the pavement which perhaps had as deep a foundation in natural fitness as the code of the drawingroom  yet again i doubt whether i may not have been uttering folly in the last two sentences when i reflect how rude and rough these specimens of feminine character generally were  they had a readiness with their hands that reminded me of molly seagrim and other heroines in fieldings novels  for example i have seen a woman meet a man in the street and for no reason perceptible to me suddenly clutch him by the hair and cuff his earsan infliction which he bore with exemplary patience only snatching the very earliest opportunity to take to his heels  where a sharp tongue will not serve the purpose they trust to the sharpness of their fingernails or incarnate a whole vocabulary of vituperative words in a resounding slap or the downright blow of a doubled fist  all english people i imagine are influenced in a far greater degree than ourselves by this simple and honest tendency in cases of disagreement to batter one anothers persons and whoever has seen a crowd of english ladies for instance at the door of the sistine chapel in holy week will be satisfied that their belligerent propensities are kept in abeyance only by a merciless rigor on the part of society  it requires a vast deal of refinement to spiritualize their large physical endowments such being the case with the delicate ornaments of the drawingroom it is the less to be wondered at that women who live mostly in the open air amid the coarsest kind of companionship and occupation should carry on the intercourse of life with a freedom unknown to any class of american females though still i am resolved to think compatible with a generous breadth of natural propriety  it shocked me at first to see them of all ages even elderly as well as infants that could just toddle across the street alone going about in the mud and mire or through the dusky snow and slosh of a severe week in winter with petticoats high uplifted above bare red feet and legs but i was comforted by observing that both shoes and stockings generally reappeared with better weather having been thriftily kept out of the damp for the convenience of dry feet within doors  their hardihood was wonderful and their strength greater than could have been expected from such spare diet as they probably lived upon  i have seen them carrying on their heads great burdens under which they walked as freely as if they were fashionable bonnets or sometimes the burden was huge enough almost to cover the whole person looked at from behindas in tuscan villages you may see the girls coming in from the country with great bundles of green twigs upon their backs so that they resemble locomotive masses of verdure and fragrance  but these poor english women seemed to be laden with rubbish incongruous and indescribable such as bones and rags the sweepings of the house and of the street a merchandise gathered up from what poverty itself had thrown away a heap of filthy stuff analogous to christians bundle of sin  sometimes though very seldom i detected a certain gracefulness among the younger women that was altogether new to my observation  it was a charm proper to the lowest class  one girl i particularly remember in a garb none of the cleanest and nowise smart and herself exceedingly coarse in all respects but yet endowed with a sort of witchery a native charm a robe of simple beauty and suitable behavior that she was born in and had never been tempted to throw off because she had really nothing else to put on  eve herself could not have been more natural  nothing was affected nothing imitated no proper grace was vulgarized by an effort to assume the manners or adornments of another sphere  this kind of beauty arrayed in a fitness of its own is probably vanishing out of the world and will certainly never be found in america where all the girls whether daughters of the uppertendon the mediocrity the cottage or the kennel aim at one standard of dress and deportment seldom accomplishing a perfectly triumphant hit or an utterly absurd failure  those words genteel and ladylike are terrible ones and do us infinite mischief but it is because at least i hope so we are in a transition state and shall emerge into a higher mode of simplicity than has ever been known to past ages  in such disastrous circumstances as i have been attempting to describe it was beautiful to observe what a mysterious efficacy still asserted itself in character  a woman evidently poor as the poorest of her neighbors would be knitting or sewing on the doorstep just as fifty other women were but round about her skirts though wofully patched you would be sensible of a certain sphere of decency which it seemed to me could not have been kept more impregnable in the cosiest little sittingroom where the teakettle on the hob was humming its good old song of domestic peace  maidenhood had a similar power  the evil habit that grows upon us in this harsh world makes me faithless to my own better perceptions and yet i have seen girls in these wretched streets on whose virgin purity judging merely from their impression on my instincts as they passed by i should have deemed it safe at the moment to stake my life  the next moment however as the surrounding flood of moral uncleanness surged over their footsteps i would not have staked a spike of thistledown on the same wager  yet the miracle was within the scope of providence which is equally wise and equally beneficent even to those poor girls though i acknowledge the fact without the remotest comprehension of the mode of it whether they were pure or what we fellowsinners call vile  unless your faith be deeprooted and of most vigorous growth it is the safer way not to turn aside into this region so suggestive of miserable doubt  it was a place with dreadful faces thronged wrinkled and grim with vice and wretchedness and thinking over the line of milton here quoted i come to the conclusion that those ugly lineaments which startled adam and eve as they looked backward to the closed gate of paradise were no fiends from the pit but the more terrible foreshadowings of what so many of their descendants were to be god help them and us likewise their brethren and sisters  let me add that forlorn ragged careworn hopeless dirty haggard hungry as they were the most pitiful thing of all was to see the sort of patience with which they accepted their lot as if they had been born into the world for that and nothing else  even the little children had this characteristic in as perfect development as their grandmothers  the children in truth were the illomened blossoms from which another harvest of precisely such dark fruitage as i saw ripened around me was to be produced  of course you would imagine these to be lumps of crude iniquity tiny vessels as full as they could hold of naughtiness nor can i say a great deal to the contrary  small proof of parental discipline could i discern save when a mother drunken i sincerely hope snatched her own imp out of a group of pale halfnaked humoreaten abortions that were playing and squabbling together in the mud turned up its tatters brought down her heavy hand on its poor little tenderest part and let it go again with a shake  if the child knew what the punishment was for it was wiser than i pretend to be  it yelled and went back to its playmates in the mud  yet let me bear testimony to what was beautiful and more touching than anything that i ever witnessed in the intercourse of happier children  i allude to the superintendence which some of these small people too small one would think to be sent into the street alone had there been any other nursery for them exercised over still smaller ones  whence they derived such a sense of duty unless immediately from god i cannot tell but it was wonderful to observe the expression of responsibility in their deportment the anxious fidelity with which they discharged their unfit office the tender patience with which they linked their less pliable impulses to the wayward footsteps of an infant and let it guide them whithersoever it liked  in the hollowcheeked largeeyed girl of ten whom i saw giving a cheerless oversight to her babybrother i did not so much marvel at it  she had merely come a little earlier than usual to the perception of what was to be her business in life  but i admired the sicklylooking little boy who did violence to his boyish nature by making himself the servant of his little sistershe too small to walk and he too small to take her in his armsand therefore working a kind of miracle to transport her from one dirtheap to another  beholding such works of love and duty i took heart again and deemed it not so impossible after all for these neglected children to find a path through the squalor and evil of their circumstances up to the gate of heaven  perhaps there was this latent good in all of them though generally they looked brutish and dull even in their sports there was little mirth among them nor even a fully awakened spirit of blackguardism  yet sometimes again i saw with surprise and a sense as if i had been asleep and dreaming the bright intelligent merry face of a child whose dark eyes gleamed with vivacious expression through the dirt that incrusted its skin like sunshine struggling through a very dusty windowpane  in these streets the belted and bluecoated policeman appears seldom in comparison with the frequency of his occurrence in more reputable thoroughfares  i used to think that the inhabitants would have ample time to murder one another or any stranger like myself who might violate the filthy sanctities of the place before the law could bring up its lumbering assistance  nevertheless there is a supervision nor does the watchfulness of authority permit the populace to be tempted to any outbreak  once in a time of dearth i noticed a balladsinger going through the street hoarsely chanting some discordant strain in a provincial dialect of which i could only make out that it addressed the sensibilities of the auditors on the score of starvation but by his side stalked the policeman offering no interference but watchful to hear what this rough minstrel said or sang and silence him if his effusion threatened to prove too soulstirring  in my judgment however there is little or no danger of that kind they starve patiently sicken patiently die patiently not through resignation but a diseased flaccidity of hope  if ever they should do mischief to those above them it will probably be by the communication of some destructive pestilence for so the medical men affirm they suffer all the ordinary diseases with a degree of virulence elsewhere unknown and keep among themselves traditionary plagues that have long ceased to afflict more fortunate societies  charity herself gathers her robe about her to avoid their contact  it would be a dire revenge indeed if they were to prove their claims to be reckoned of one blood and nature with the noblest and wealthiest by compelling them to inhale death through the diffusion of their own povertypoisoned atmosphere  a true englishman is a kind man at heart but has an unconquerable dislike to poverty and beggary  beggars have heretofore been so strange to an american that he is apt to become their prey being recognized through his national peculiarities and beset by them in the streets the english smile at him and say that there are ample public arrangements for every paupers possible need that streetcharity promotes idleness and vice and that yonder personification of misery on the pavement will lay up a good days profit besides supping more luxuriously than the dupe who gives him a shilling  by and by the stranger adopts their theory and begins to practise upon it much to his own temporary freedom from annoyance but not entirely without moral detriment or sometimes a too late contrition  years afterwards it may be his memory is still haunted by some vindictive wretch whose cheeks were pale and hungerpinched whose rags fluttered in the eastwind whose right arm was paralyzed and his left leg shrivelled into a mere nerveless stick but whom he passed by remorselessly because an englishman chose to say that the fellows misery looked too perfect was too artistically got up to be genuine  even allowing this to be true as a hundred chances to one it was it would still have been a clear case of economy to buy him off with a little loose silver so that his lamentable figure should not limp at the heels of your conscience all over the world  to own the truth i provided myself with several such imaginary persecutors in england and recruited their number with at least one sicklylooking wretch whose acquaintance i first made at assisi in italy and taking a dislike to something sinister in his aspect permitted him to beg early and late and all day long without getting a single baiocco  at my latest glimpse of him the villain avenged himself not by a volley of horrible curses as any other italian beggar would but by taking an expression so griefstricken wantwrung hopeless and withal resigned that i could paint his lifelike portrait at this moment  were i to go over the same ground again i would listen to no mans theories but buy the little luxury of beneficence at a cheap rate instead of doing myself a moral mischief by exuding a stony incrustation over whatever natural sensibility i might possess  on the other hand there were some mendicants whose utmost efforts i even now felicitate myself on having withstood  such was a phenomenon abridged of his lower half who beset me for two or three years together and in spite of his deficiency of locomotive members had some supernatural method of transporting himself simultaneously i believe to all quarters of the city  he wore a sailors jacket possibly because skirts would have been a superfluity to his figure and had a remarkably broadshouldered and muscular frame surmounted by a large freshcolored face which was full of power and intelligence  his dress and linen were the perfection of neatness  once a day at least wherever i went i suddenly became aware of this trunk of a man on the path before me resting on his base and looking as if he had just sprouted out of the pavement and would sink into it again and reappear at some other spot the instant you left him behind  the expression of his eye was perfectly respectful but terribly fixed holding your own as by fascination never once winking never wavering from its pointblank gaze right into your face till you were completely beyond the range of his battery of one immense rifled cannon  this was his mode of soliciting alms and he reminded me of the old beggar who appealed so touchingly to the charitable sympathies of gil blas taking aim at him from the roadside with a longbarrelled musket  the intentness and directness of his silent appeal his close and unrelenting attack upon your individuality respectful as it seemed was the very flower of insolence or if you give it a possibly truer interpretation it was the tyrannical effort of a man endowed with great natural force of character to constrain your reluctant will to his purpose  apparently he had staked his salvation upon the ultimate success of a daily struggle between himself and me the triumph of which would compel me to become a tributary to the hat that lay on the pavement beside him  man or fiend however there was a stubbornness in his intended victim which this massive fragment of a mighty personality had not altogether reckoned upon and by its aid i was enabled to pass him at my customary pace hundreds of times over quietly meeting his terribly respectful eye and allowing him the fair chance which i felt to be his due to subjugate me if he really had the strength for it  he never succeeded but on the other hand never gave up the contest and should i ever walk those streets again i am certain that the truncated tyrant will sprout up through the pavement and look me fixedly in the eye and perhaps get the victory  i should think all the more highly of myself if i had shown equal heroism in resisting another class of beggarly depredators who assailed me on my weaker side and won an easy spoil  such was the sanctimonious clergyman with his white cravat who visited me with a subscriptionpaper which he himself had drawn up in a case of heartrending distressthe respectable and ruined tradesman going from door to door shy and silent in his own person but accompanied by a sympathizing friend who bore testimony to his integrity and stated the unavoidable misfortunes that had crushed him downor the delicate and prettily dressed lady who had been bred in affluence but was suddenly thrown upon the perilous charities of the world by the death of an indulgent but secretly insolvent father or the commercial catastrophe and simultaneous suicide of the best of husbands or the gifted but unsuccessful author appealing to my fraternal sympathies generously rejoicing in some small prosperities which he was kind enough to term my own triumphs in the field of letters and claiming to have largely contributed to them by his unbought notices in the public journals england is full of such people and a hundred other varieties of peripatetic tricksters higher than these and lower who act their parts tolerably well but seldom with an absolutely illusive effect  i knew at once raw yankee as i was that they were humbugs almost without an exceptionrats that nibble at the honest bread and cheese of the community and grow fat by their petty pilferings yet often gave them what they asked and privately owned myself a simpleton  there is a decorum which restrains you unless you happen to be a policeconstable from breaking through a crust of plausible respectability even when you are certain that there is a knave beneath it  after making myself as familiar as i decently could with the poor streets i became curious to see what kind of a home was provided for the inhabitants at the public expense fearing that it must needs be a most comfortless one or else their choice if choice it were of so miserable a life outside was truly difficult to account for  accordingly i visited a great almshouse and was glad to observe how unexceptionably all the parts of the establishment were carried on and what an orderly life fullfed sufficiently reposeful and undisturbed by the arbitrary exercise of authority seemed to be led there  possibly indeed it was that very orderliness and the cruel necessity of being neat and clean and even the comfort resulting from these and other christianlike restraints and regulations that constituted the principal grievance on the part of the poor shiftless inmates accustomed to a lifelong luxury of dirt and harumscarumness  the wild life of the streets has perhaps as unforgetable a charm to those who have once thoroughly imbibed it as the life of the forest or the prairie  but i conceive rather that there must be insuperable difficulties for the majority of the poor in the way of getting admittance to the almshouse than that a merely aesthetic preference for the street would incline the pauperclass to fare scantily and precariously and expose their raggedness to the rain and snow when such a hospitable door stood wide open for their entrance  it might be that the roughest and darkest side of the matter was not shown me there being persons of eminent station and of both sexes in the party which i accompanied and of course a properly trained public functionary would have deemed it a monstrous rudeness as well as a great shame to exhibit anything to people of rank that might too painfully shock their sensibilities  the womens ward was the portion of the establishment which we especially examined  it could not be questioned that they were treated with kindness as well as care  no doubt as has been already suggested some of them felt the irksomeness of submission to general rules of orderly behavior after being accustomed to that perfect freedom from the minor proprieties at least which is one of the compensations of absolutely hopeless poverty or of any circumstances that set us fairly below the decencies of life  i asked the governor of the house whether he met with any difficulty in keeping peace and order among his inmates and he informed me that his troubles among the women were incomparably greater than with the men  they were freakish and apt to be quarrelsome inclined to plague and pester one another in ways that it was impossible to lay hold of and to thwart his own authority by the like intangible methods  he said this with the utmost goodnature and quite won my regard by so placidly resigning himself to the inevitable necessity of letting the women throw dust into his eyes  they certainly looked peaceable and sisterly enough as i saw them though still it might be faintly perceptible that some of them were consciously playing their parts before the governor and his distinguished visitors  this governor seemed to me a man thoroughly fit for his position  an american in an office of similar responsibility would doubtless be a much superior person better educated possessing a far wider range of thought more naturally acute with a quicker tact of external observation and a readier faculty of dealing with difficult cases  the women would not succeed in throwing half so much dust into his eyes moreover his black coat and thin sallow visage would make him look like a scholar and his manners would indefinitely approximate to those of a gentleman  but i cannot help questioning whether on the whole these higher endowments would produce decidedly better results  the englishman was thoroughly plebeian both in aspect and behavior a bluff ruddyfaced hearty kindly yeomanlike personage with no refinement whatever nor any superfluous sensibility but gifted with a native wholesomeness of character which must have been a very beneficial element in the atmosphere of the almshouse  he spoke to his pauper family in loud goodhumored cheerful tones and treated them with a healthy freedom that probably caused the forlorn wretches to feel as if they were free and healthy likewise  if he had understood them a little better he would not have treated them half so wisely  we are apt to make sickly people more morbid and unfortunate people more miserable by endeavoring to adapt our deportment to their especial and individual needs  they eagerly accept our wellmeant efforts but it is like returning their own sick breath back upon themselves to be breathed over and over again intensifying the inward mischief at every repetition  the sympathy that would really do them good is of a kind that recognizes their sound and healthy parts and ignores the part affected by disease which will thrive under the eye of a too close observer like a poisonous weed in the sunshine  my good friend the governor had no tendencies in the latter direction and abundance of them in the former and was consequently as wholesome and invigorating as the westwind with a little spice of the north in it brightening the dreary visages that encountered us as if he had carried a sunbeam in his hand  he expressed himself by his whole being and personality and by works more than words and had the not unusual english merit of knowing what to do much better than how to talk about it  the women i imagine must have felt one imperfection in their state however comfortable otherwise  they were forbidden or at all events lacked the means to follow out their natural instinct of adorning themselves all were dressed in one homely uniform of bluechecked gowns with such caps upon their heads as english servants wear  generally too they had one dowdy english aspect and a vulgar type of features so nearly alike that they seemed literally to constitute a sisterhood  we have few of these absolutely unilluminated faces among our native american population individuals of whom must be singularly unfortunate if mixing as we do no drop of gentle blood has contributed to refine the turbid element no gleam of hereditary intelligence has lighted up the stolid eyes which their forefathers brought from the old country even in this english almshouse however there was at least one person who claimed to be intimately connected with rank and wealth  the governor after suggesting that this person would probably be gratified by our visit ushered us into a small parlor which was furnished a little more like a room in a private dwelling than others that we entered and had a row of religious books and fashionable novels on the mantelpiece  an old lady sat at a bright coalfire reading a romance and rose to receive us with a certain pomp of manner and elaborate display of ceremonious courtesy which in spite of myself made me inwardly question the genuineness of her aristocratic pretensions  but at any rate she looked like a respectable old soul and was evidently gladdened to the very core of her frostbitten heart by the awful punctiliousness with which she responded to her gracious and hospitable though unfamiliar welcome  after a little polite conversation we retired and the governor with a lowered voice and an air of deference told us that she had been a lady of quality and had ridden in her own equipage not many years before and now lived in continual expectation that some of her rich relatives would drive up in their carriages to take her away  meanwhile he added she was treated with great respect by her fellowpaupers  i could not help thinking from a few criticisable peculiarities in her talk and manner that there might have been a mistake on the governors part and perhaps a venial exaggeration on the old ladys concerning her former position in society but what struck me was the forcible instance of that most prevalent of english vanities the pretension to aristocratic connection on one side and the submission and reverence with which it was accepted by the governor and his household on the other  among ourselves i think when wealth and eminent position have taken their departure they seldom leave a pallid ghost behind themor if it sometimes stalks abroad few recognize it  we went into several other rooms at the doors of which pausing on the outside we could hear the volubility and sometimes the wrangling of the female inhabitants within but invariably found silence and peace when we stepped over the threshold  the women were grouped together in their sittingrooms sometimes three or four sometimes a larger number classified by their spontaneous affinities i suppose and all busied so far as i can remember with the one occupation of knitting coarse yarn stockings  hardly any of them i am sorry to say had a brisk or cheerful air though it often stirred them up to a momentary vivacity to be accosted by the governor and they seemed to like being noticed however slightly by the visitors  the happiest person whom i saw there and running hastily through my experiences i hardly recollect to have seen a happier one in my life if you take a careless flow of spirits as happiness was an old woman that lay in bed among ten or twelve heavylooking females who plied their knittingwork round about her she laughed when we entered and immediately began to talk to us in a thin little spirited quaver claiming to be more than a century old and the governor in whatever way he happened to be cognizant of the fact confirmed her age to be a hundred and four  her jauntiness and cackling merriment were really wonderful  it was as if she had got through with all her actual business in life two or three generations ago and now freed from every responsibility for herself or others had only to keep up a mirthful state of mind till the short time or long time and happy as she was she appeared not to care whether it were long or short before death who had misplaced her name in his list might remember to take her away  she had gone quite round the circle of human existence and come back to the playground again  and so she had grown to be a kind of miraculous old pet the plaything of people seventy or eighty years younger than herself who talked and laughed with her as if she were a child finding great delight in her wayward and strangely playful responses into some of which she cunningly conveyed a gibe that caused their ears to tingle a little  she had done getting out of bed in this world and lay there to be waited upon like a queen or a baby  in the same room sat a pauper who had once been an actress of considerable repute but was compelled to give up her profession by a softening of the brain  the disease seemed to have stolen the continuity out of her life and disturbed an healthy relationship between the thoughts within her and the world without  on our first entrance she looked cheerfully at us and showed herself ready to engage in conversation but suddenly while we were talking with the centuryold crone the poor actress began to weep contorting her face with extravagant stagegrimaces and wringing her hands for some inscrutable sorrow  it might have been a reminiscence of actual calamity in her past life or quite as probably it was but a dramatic woe beneath which she had staggered and shrieked and wrung her hands with hundreds of repetitions in the sight of crowded theatres and been as often comforted by thunders of applause  but my idea of the mystery was that she had a sense of wrong in seeing the aged woman whose empty vivacity was like the rattling of dry peas in a bladder chosen as the central object of interest to the visitors while she herself who had agitated thousands of hearts with a breath sat starving for the admiration that was her natural food  i appeal to the whole society of artists of the beautiful and the imaginativepoets romancers painters sculptors actors whether or no this is a grief that may be felt even amid the torpor of a dissolving brain  we looked into a good many sleepingchambers where were rows of beds mostly calculated for two occupants and provided with sheets and pillowcases that resembled sackcloth  it appeared to me that the sense of beauty was insufficiently regarded in all the arrangements of the almshouse a little cheap luxury for the eye at least might do the poor folks a substantial good  but at all events there was the beauty of perfect neatness and orderliness which being heretofore known to few of them was perhaps as much as they could well digest in the remnant of their lives  we were invited into the laundry where a great washing and drying were in process the whole atmosphere being hot and vaporous with the steam of wet garments and bedclothes  this atmosphere was the pauperlife of the past week or fortnight resolved into a gaseous state and breathing it however fastidiously we were forced to inhale the strange element into our inmost being  had the queen been there i know not how she could have escaped the necessity  what an intimate brotherhood is this in which we dwell do what we may to put an artificial remoteness between the high creature and the low one  a poor mans breath borne on the vehicle of tobaccosmoke floats into a palacewindow and reaches the nostrils of a monarch  it is but an example obvious to the sense of the innumerable and secret channels by which at every moment of our lives the flow and reflux of a common humanity pervade us all  how superficial are the niceties of such as pretend to keep aloof  let the whole world be cleansed or not a man or woman of us all can be clean  by and by we came to the ward where the children were kept on entering which we saw in the first place several unlovely and unwholesome little people lazily playing together in a courtyard  and here a singular incommodity befell one member of our party  among the children was a wretched pale halftorpid little thing about six years old perhapsbut i know not whether a girl or a boy with a humor in its eyes and face which the governor said was the scurvy and which appeared to bedim its powers of vision so that it toddled about gropingly as if in quest of it did not precisely know what  this childthis sickly wretched humoreaten infant the offspring of unspeakable sin and sorrow whom it must have required several generations of guilty progenitors to render so pitiable an object as we beheld itimmediately took an unaccountable fancy to the gentleman just hinted at  it prowled about him like a pet kitten rubbing against his legs following everywhere at his heels pulling at his coattails and at last exerting all the speed that its poor limbs were capable of got directly before him and held forth its arms mutely insisting on being taken up it said not a word being perhaps underwitted and incapable of prattle but it smiled up in his facea sort of woful gleam was that smile through the sickly blotches that covered its featuresand found means to express such a perfect confidence that it was going to be fondled and made much of that there was no possibility in a human heart of balking its expectation  it was as if god had promised the poor child this favor on behalf of that individual and he was bound to fulfil the contract or else no longer call himself a man among men  nevertheless it could be no easy thing for him to do he being a person burdened with more than an englishmans customary reserve shy of actual contact with human beings afflicted with a peculiar distaste for whatever was ugly and furthermore accustomed to that habit of observation from an insulated standpoint which is said but i hope erroneously to have the tendency of putting ice into the blood  so i watched the struggle in his mind with a good deal of interest and am seriously of opinion that he did an heroic act and effected more than he dreamed of towards his final salvation when he took up the loathsome child and caressed it as tenderly as if he had been its father  to be sure we all smiled at him at the time but doubtless would have acted pretty much the same in a similar stress of circumstances  the child at any rate appeared to be satisfied with his behavior for when he had held it a considerable time and set it down it still favored him with its company keeping fast hold of his forefinger till we reached the confines of the place  and on our return through the courtyard after visiting another part of the establishment here again was this same little wretchedness waiting for its victim with a smile of joyful and yet dull recognition about its scabby mouth and in its rheumy eyes  no doubt the childs mission in reference to our friend was to remind him that he was responsible in his degree for all the sufferings and misdemeanors of the world in which he lived and was not entitled to look upon a particle of its dark calamity as if it were none of his concern the offspring of a brothers iniquity being his own bloodrelation and the guilt likewise a burden on him unless he expiated it by better deeds  all the children in this ward seemed to be invalids and going up stairs we found more of them in the same or a worse condition than the little creature just described with their mothers or more probably other women for the infants were mostly foundlings in attendance as nurses  the matron of the ward a middleaged woman remarkably kind and motherly in aspect was walking to and fro across the chamberon that weary journey in which careful mothers and nurses travel so continually and so far and gain never a step of progresswith an unquiet baby in her arms  she assured us that she enjoyed her occupation being exceedingly fond of children and in fact the absence of timidity in all the little people was a sufficient proof that they could have had no experience of harsh treatment though on the other hand none of them appeared to be attracted to one individual more than another  in this point they differed widely from the poor child below stairs  they seemed to recognize a universal motherhood in womankind and cared not which individual might be the mother of the moment  i found their tameness as shocking as did alexander selkirk that of the brute subjects of his else solitary kingdom  it was a sort of tame familiarity a perfect indifference to the approach of strangers such as i never noticed in other children  i accounted for it partly by their nerveless unstrung state of body incapable of the quick thrills of delight and fear which play upon the lively harpstrings of a healthy childs nature and partly by their woful lack of acquaintance with a private home and their being therefore destitute of the sweet homebred shyness which is like the sanctity of heaven about a motherpetted child  their condition was like that of chickens hatched in an oven and growing up without the especial guardianship of a matron hen both the chicken and the child methinks must needs want something that is essential to their respective characters  in this chamber which was spacious containing a large number of beds there was a clear fire burning on the hearth as in all the other occupied rooms and directly in front of the blaze sat a woman holding a baby which beyond all reach of comparison was the most horrible object that ever afflicted my sight  days afterwardsnay even now when i bring it up vividly before my minds eyeit seemed to lie upon the floor of my heart polluting my moral being with the sense of something grievously amiss in the entire conditions of humanity  the holiest man could not be otherwise than full of wickedness the chastest virgin seemed impure in a world where such a babe was possible  the governor whispered me apart that like nearly all the rest of them it was the child of unhealthy parents  ah yes  there was the mischief  this spectral infant a hideous mockery of the visible link which love creates between man and woman was born of disease and sin  diseased sin was its father and sinful disease its mother and their offspring lay in the womans arms like a nursing pestilence which could it live and grow up would make the world a more accursed abode than ever heretofore  thank heaven it could not live  this baby if we must give it that sweet name seemed to be three or four months old but being such an unthrifty changeling might have been considerably older  it was all covered with blotches and preternaturally dark and discolored it was withered away quite shrunken and fleshless it breathed only amid pantings and gaspings and moaned painfully at every gasp  the only comfort in reference to it was the evident impossibility of its surviving to draw many more of those miserable moaning breaths and it would have been infinitely less heartdepressing to see it die right before my eyes than to depart and carry it alive in my remembrance still suffering the incalculable torture of its little life  i can by no means express how horrible this infant was neither ought i to attempt it  and yet i must add one final touch  young as the poor little creature was its pain and misery had endowed it with a premature intelligence insomuch that its eyes seemed to stare at the bystanders out of their sunken sockets knowingly and appealingly as if summoning us one and all to witness the deadly wrong of its existence  at least i so interpreted its look when it positively met and responded to my own awestricken gaze and therefore i lay the case as far as i am able before mankind on whom god has imposed the necessity to suffer in soul and body till this dark and dreadful wrong be righted  thence we went to the schoolrooms which were underneath the chapel the pupils like the children whom we had just seen were in large proportion foundlings  almost without exception they looked sickly with marks of eruptive trouble in their doltish faces and a general tendency to diseases of the eye  moreover the poor little wretches appeared to be uneasy within their skins and screwed themselves about on the benches in a disagreeably suggestive way as if they had inherited the evil habits of their parents as an innermost garment of the same texture and material as the shirt of nessus and must wear it with unspeakable discomfort as long as they lived  i saw only a single child that looked healthy and on my pointing him out the governor informed me that this little boy the sole exception to the miserable aspect of his schoolfellows was not a foundling nor properly a workhouse child being born of respectable parentage and his father one of the officers of the institution  as for the remainderthe hundred pale abortions to be counted against one rosycheeked boywhat shall we say or do depressed by the sight of so much misery and uninventive of remedies for the evils that force themselves on my perception i can do little more than recur to the idea already hinted at in the early part of this article regarding the speedy necessity of a new deluge  so far as these children are concerned at any rate it would be a blessing to the human race which they will contribute to enervate and corrupta greater blessing to themselves who inherit no patrimony but disease and vice and in whose souls if there be a spark of gods life this seems the only possible mode of keeping it aglowif every one of them could be drowned tonight by their best friends instead of being put tenderly to bed  this heroic method of treating human maladies moral and material is certainly beyond the scope of mans discretionary rights and probably will not be adopted by divine providence until the opportunity of milder reformation shall have been offered us again and again through a series of future ages  it may be fair to acknowledge that the humane and excellent governor as well as other persons better acquainted with the subject than myself took a less gloomy view of it though still so dark a one as to involve scanty consolation  they remarked that individuals of the male sex picked up in the streets and nurtured in the workhouse sometimes succeed tolerably well in life because they are taught trades before being turned into the world and by dint of immaculate behavior and good luck are not unlikely to get employment and earn a livelihood  the case is different with the girls  they can only go to service and are invariably rejected by families of respectability on account of their origin and for the better reason of their unfitness to fill satisfactorily even the meanest situations in a wellordered english household  their resource is to take service with people only a step or two above the poorest class with whom they fare scantily endure harsh treatment lead shifting and precarious lives and finally drop into the slough of evil through which in their best estate they do but pick their slimy way on steppingstones  from the schools we went to the bakehouse and the brewhouse for such cruelty is not harbored in the heart of a true englishman as to deny a pauper his daily allowance of beer and through the kitchens where we beheld an immense pot over the fire surging and walloping with some kind of a savory stew that filled it up to its brim  we also visited a tailors shop and a shoemakers shop in both of which a number of mien and pale diminutive apprentices were at work diligently enough though seemingly with small heart in the business  finally the governor ushered us into a shed inside of which was piled up an immense quantity of new coffins  they were of the plainest description made of pine boards probably of american growth not very nicely smoothed by the plane neither painted nor stained with black but provided with a loop of rope at either end for the convenience of lifting the rude box and its inmate into the cart that shall carry them to the burialground  there in holes ten feet deep the paupers are buried one above another mingling their relics indistinguishably  in another world may they resume their individuality and find it a happier one than here  as we departed a character came under our notice which i have met with in all almshouses whether of the city or village or in england or america  it was the familiar simpleton who shuffled across the courtyard clattering his woodensoled shoes to greet us with a howl or a laugh i hardly know which holding out his hand for a penny and chuckling grossly when it was given him  all underwitted persons so far as my experience goes have this craving for copper coin and appear to estimate its value by a miraculous instinct which is one of the earliest gleams of human intelligence while the nobler faculties are yet in abeyance  there may come a time even in this world when we shall all understand that our tendency to the individual appropriation of gold and broad acres fine houses and such good and beautiful things as are equally enjoyable by a multitude is but a trait of imperfectly developed intelligence like the simpletons cupidity of a penny  when that day dawnsand probably not till theni imagine that there will be no more poor streets nor need of almshouses  i was once present at the wedding of some poor english people and was deeply impressed by the spectacle though by no means with such proud and delightful emotions as seem to have affected all england on the recent occasion of the marriage of its prince  it was in the cathedral at manchester a particularly black and grim old structure into which i had stepped to examine some ancient and curious woodcarvings within the choir  the woman in attendance greeted me with a smile which always glimmers forth on the feminine visage i know not why when a wedding is in question and asked me to take a seat in the nave till some poor parties were married it being the easter holidays and a good time for them to marry because no fees would be demanded by the clergyman  i sat down accordingly and soon the parson and his clerk appeared at the altar and a considerable crowd of people made their entrance at a sidedoor and ranged themselves in a long huddled line across the chancel  they were my acquaintances of the poor streets or persons in a precisely similar condition of life and were now come to their marriageceremony in just such garbs as i had always seen them wear the men in their loafers coats out at elbows or their laborers jackets defaced with grimy toil the women drawing their shabby shawls tighter about their shoulders to hide the raggedness beneath all of them unbrushed unshaven unwashed uncombed and wrinkled with penury and care nothing virginlike in the brides nor hopeful or energetic in the bridegroomsthey were in short the mere rags and tatters of the human race whom some eastwind of evil omen howling along the streets had chanced to sweep together into an unfragrant heap  each and all of them conscious of his or her individual misery had blundered into the strange miscalculation of supposing that they could lessen the sum of it by multiplying it into the misery of another person  all the couples and it was difficult in such a confused crowd to compute exactly their number stood up at once and had execution done upon them in the lump the clergyman addressing only small parts of the service to each individual pair but so managing the larger portion as to include the whole company without the trouble of repetition  by this compendious contrivance one would apprehend he came dangerously near making every man and woman the husband or wife of every other nor perhaps would he have perpetrated much additional mischief by the mistake but after receiving a benediction in common they assorted themselves in their own fashion as they only knew how and departed to the garrets or the cellars or the unsheltered streetcorners where their honeymoon and subsequent lives were to be spent  the parson smiled decorously the clerk and the sexton grinned broadly the female attendant tittered almost aloud and even the married parties seemed to see something exceedingly funny in the affair but for my part though generally apt enough to be tickled by a joke i laid it away in my memory as one of the saddest sights i ever looked upon  not very long afterwards i happened to be passing the same venerable cathedral and heard a clang of joyful bells and beheld a bridal party coming down the steps towards a carriage and four horses with a portly coachman and two postilions that waited at the gate  one parson and one service had amalgamated the wretchedness of a score of paupers a bishop and three or four clergymen had combined their spiritual might to forge the golden links of this other marriagebond  the bridegrooms mien had a sort of careless and kindly english pride the bride floated along in her white drapery a creature so nice and delicate that it was a luxury to see her and a pity that her silk slippers should touch anything so grimy as the old stones of the churchyard avenue  the crowd of ragged people who always cluster to witness what they may of an aristocratic wedding broke into audible admiration of the brides beauty and the bridegrooms manliness and uttered prayers and ejaculations possibly paid for in alms for the happiness of both  if the most favorable of earthly conditions could make them happy they had every prospect of it they were going to live on their abundance in one of those stately and delightful english homes such as no other people ever created or inherited a hall set far and safe within its own private grounds and surrounded with venerable trees shaven lawns rich shrubbery and trimmest pathways the whole so artfully contrived and tended that summer rendered it a paradise and even winter would hardly disrobe it of its beauty and all this fair property seemed more exclusively and inalienably their own because of its descent through many forefathers each of whom had added an improvement or a charm and thus transmitted it with a stronger stamp of rightful possession to his heir  and is it possible after all that there may be a flaw in the titledeeds  is or is not the system wrong that gives one married pair so immense a superfluity of luxurious home and shuts out a million others from any home whatever  one day or another safe as they deem themselves and safe as the hereditary temper of the people really tends to make them the gentlemen of england will be compelled to face this question     civic banquets   it has often perplexed one to imagine how an englishman will be able to reconcile himself to any future state of existence from which the earthly institution of dinner shall be excluded  even if he fail to take his appetite along with him which it seems to me hardly possible to believe since this endowment is so essential to his composition the immortal day must still admit an interim of two or three hours during which he will be conscious of a slight distaste at all events if not an absolute repugnance to merely spiritual nutriment  the idea of dinner has so imbedded itself among his highest and deepest characteristics so illuminated itself with intellect and softened itself with the kindest emotions of his heart so linked itself with church and state and grown so majestic with long hereditary customs and ceremonies that by taking it utterly away death instead of putting the final touch to his perfection would leave him infinitely less complete than we have already known him  he could not be roundly happy  paradise among all its enjoyments would lack one daily felicity which his sombre little island possessed  perhaps it is not irreverent to conjecture that a provision may have been made in this particular for the englishmans exceptional necessities  it strikes me that milton was of the opinion here suggested and may have intended to throw out a delightful and consolatory hope for his countrymen when he represents the genial archangel as playing his part with such excellent appetite at adams dinnertable and confining himself to fruit and vegetables only because in those early days of her housekeeping eve had no more acceptable viands to set before him  milton indeed had a true english taste for the pleasures of the table though refined by the lofty and poetic discipline to which he had subjected himself  it is delicately implied in the refection in paradise and more substantially though still elegantly betrayed in the sonnet proposing to laurence of virtuous father virtuous son a series of nice little dinners in midwinter and it blazes fully out in that untasted banquet which elaborate as it was satan tossed up in a trice from the kitchenranges of tartarus  among this people indeed so wise in their generation dinner has a kind of sanctity quite independent of the dishes that may be set upon the table so that if it be only a muttonchop they treat it with due reverence and are rewarded with a degree of enjoyment which such reckless devourers as ourselves do not often find in our richest abundance  it is good to see how staunch they are after fifty or sixty years of heroic eating still relying upon their digestive powers and indulging a vigorous appetite whereas an american has generally lost the one and learned to distrust the other long before reaching the earliest decline of life and thenceforward he makes little account of his dinner and dines at his peril if at all  i know not whether my countrymen will allow me to tell them though i think it scarcely too much to affirm that on this side of the water people never dine  at any rate abundantly as nature has provided us with most of the material requisites the highest possible dinner has never yet been eaten in america  it is the consummate flower of civilization and refinement and our inability to produce it or to appreciate its admirable beauty if a happy inspiration should bring it into bloom marks fatally the limit of culture which we have attained  it is not to be supposed however that the mob of cultivated englishmen know how to dine in this elevated sense  the unpolishable ruggedness of the national character is still an impediment to them even in that particular line where they are best qualified to excel  though often present at good mens feasts i remember only a single dinner which while lamentably conscious that many of its higher excellences were thrown away upon me i yet could feel to be a perfect work of art  it could not without unpardonable coarseness be styled a matter of animal enjoyment because out of the very perfection of that lower bliss there had arisen a dreamlike development of spiritual happiness  as in the masterpieces of painting and poetry there was a something intangible a final deliciousness that only fluttered about your comprehension vanishing whenever you tried to detain it and compelling you to recognize it by faith rather than sense  it seemed as if a diviner set of senses were requisite and had been partly supplied for the special fruition of this banquet and that the guests around the table only eight in number were becoming so educated polished and softened by the delicate influences of what they ate and drunk as to be now a little more than mortal for the nonce  and there was that gentle delicious sadness too which we find in the very summit of our most exquisite enjoyments and feel it a charm beyond all the gayety through which it keeps breathing its undertone  in the present case it was worth a heavier sigh to reflect that such a festal achievementthe production of so much art skill fancy invention and perfect tastethe growth of all the ages which appeared to have been ripening for this hour since man first began to eat and to moisten his food with winemust lavish its happiness upon so brief a moment when other beautiful things can be made a joy forever  yet a dinner like this is no better than we can get any day at the rejuvenescent cornhill coffeehouse unless the whole man with soul intellect and stomach is ready to appreciate it and unless moreover there is such a harmony in all the circumstances and accompaniments and especially such a pitch of wellaccording minds that nothing shall jar rudely against the guests thoroughly awakened sensibilities  the world and especially our part of it being the rough illassorted and tumultuous place we find it a beefsteak is about as good as any other dinner  the foregoing reminiscence however has drawn me aside from the main object of my sketch in which i purposed to give a slight idea of those public or partially public banquets the custom of which so thoroughly prevails among the english people that nothing is ever decided upon in matters of peace and war until they have chewed upon it in the shape of roastbeef and talked it fully over in their cups  nor are these festivities merely occasional but of stated recurrence in all considerable municipalities and associated bodies  the most ancient times appear to have been as familiar with them as the englishmen of today  in many of the old english towns you find some stately gothic hall or chamber in which the mayor and other authorities of the place have long held their sessions and always in convenient contiguity there is a dusky kitchen with an immense fireplace where an ox might be roasting at his ease though the less gigantic scale of modern cookery may now have permitted the cobwebs to gather in its chimney  st marys hall in coventry is so good a specimen of an ancient banquetingroom that perhaps i may profitably devote a page or two to the description of it  in a narrow street opposite to st michaels church one of the three famous spires of coventry you behold a mediaeval edifice in the basement of which is such a venerable and now deserted kitchen as i have above alluded to and on the same level a cellar with low stone pillars and intersecting arches like the crypt of a cathedral  passing up a wellworn staircase the oaken balustrade of which is as black as ebony you enter the fine old hall some sixty feet in length and broad and lofty in proportion  it is lighted by six windows of modern stained glass on one side and by the immense and magnificent arch of another window at the farther end of the room its rich and ancient panes constituting a genuine historical piece in which are represented some of the kingly personages of old times with their heraldic blazonries notwithstanding the colored light thus thrown into the hall and though it was noonday when i last saw it the panelling of blackoak and some faded tapestry that hung round the walls together with the cloudy vault of the roof above made a gloom which the richness only illuminated into more appreciable effect  the tapestry is wrought with figures in the dress of henry vis time which is the date of the hall and is regarded by antiquaries as authentic evidence both for the costume of that epoch and i believe for the actual portraiture of men known in history  they are as colorless as ghosts however and vanish drearily into the old stitchwork of their substance when you try to make them out  coatsofarms were formerly emblazoned all round the hall but have been almost rubbed out by people hanging their overcoats against them or by women with dishclouts and scrubbingbrushes obliterating hereditary glories in their blind hostility to dust and spiders webs  fulllength portraits of several english kings charles ii being the earliest hang on the walls and on the dais or elevated part of the floor stands an antique chair of state which several royal characters are traditionally said to have occupied while feasting here with their loyal subjects of coventry  it is roomy enough for a person of kingly bulk or even two such but angular and uncomfortable reminding me of the oaken settles which used to be seen in oldfashioned new england kitchens  overhead supported by a selfsustaining power without the aid of a single pillar is the original ceiling of oak precisely similar in shape to the roof of a barn with all the beams and rafters plainly to be seen at the remote height of sixty feet you hardly discern that they are carved with figures of angels and doubtless many other devices of which the admirable gothic art is wasted in the duskiness that has so long been brooding there  over the entrance of the hall opposite the great arched window the partycolored radiance of which glimmers faintly through the interval is a gallery for minstrels and a row of ancient suits of armor is suspended from its balustrade  it impresses me too for having gone so far i would fain leave nothing untouched upon that i remember somewhere about these venerable precincts a picture of the countess godiva on horseback in which the artist has been so niggardly of that illustrious ladys hair that if she had no ampler garniture there was certainly much need for the good people of coventry to shut their eyes after all my pains i fear that i have made but a poor hand at the description as regards a transference of the scene from my own mind to the readers  it gave me a most vivid idea of antiquity that had been very little tampered with insomuch that if a group of steelclad knights had come clanking through the doorway and a bearded and beruffed old figure had handed in a stately dame rustling in gorgeous robes of a longforgotten fashion unveiling a face of beauty somewhat tarnished in the mouldy tomb yet stepping majestically to the trill of harp and viol from the minstrels gallery while the rusty armor responded with a hollow ringing sound beneathwhy i should have felt that these shadows once so familiar with the spot had a better right in st marys hall than i a stranger from a far country which has no past  but the moral of the foregoing description is to show how tenaciously this love of pompous dinners this reverence for dinner as a sacred institution has caught hold of the english character since from the earliest recognizable period we find them building their civic banquetinghalls as magnificently as their palaces or cathedrals  i know not whether the hall just described is now used for festive purposes but others of similar antiquity and splendor still are  for example there is barbersurgeons hall in london a very fine old room adorned with admirably carved woodwork on the ceiling and walls  it is also enriched with holbeins masterpiece representing a grave assemblage of barbers and surgeons all portraits with such extensive beards that methinks one half of the company might have been profitably occupied in trimming the other kneeling before king henry viii  sir robert peel is said to have offered a thousand pounds for the liberty of cutting out one of the heads from this picture he conditioning to have a perfect facsimile painted in  the room has many other pictures of distinguished members of the company in longpast times and of some of the monarchs and statesmen of england all darkened with age but darkened into such ripe magnificence as only age could bestow  it is not my design to inflict any more specimens of ancient hallpainting on the reader but it may be worth while to touch upon other modes of stateliness that still survive in these timehonored civic feasts where there appears to be a singular assumption of dignity and solemn pomp by respectable citizens who would never dream of claiming any privilege of rank outside of their own sphere  thus i saw two caps of state for the warden and junior warden of the company caps of silver real coronets or crowns indeed for these citygrandees wrought in openwork and lined with crimson velvet  in a strongcloset opening from the hall there was a great deal of rich plate to furnish forth the banquettable comprising hundreds of forks and spoons a vast silver punchbowl the gift of some jolly king or other and besides a multitude of less noticeable vessels two lovingcups very elaborately wrought in silver gilt one presented by henry viii the other by charles ii  these cups including the covers and pedestals are very large and weighty although the bowlpart would hardly contain more than half a pint of wine which when the custom was first established each guest was probably expected to drink off at a draught  in passing them from hand to hand adown a long table of compotators there is a peculiar ceremony which i may hereafter have occasion to describe  meanwhile if i might assume such a liberty i should be glad to invite the reader to the official dinnertable of his worship the mayor at a large english seaport where i spent several years  the mayors dinnerparties occur as often as once a fortnight and inviting his guests by fifty or sixty at a time his worship probably assembles at his board most of the eminent citizens and distinguished personages of the town and neighborhood more than once during his years incumbency and very much no doubt to the promotion of good feeling among individuals of opposite parties and diverse pursuits in life  a miscellaneous party of englishmen can always find more comfortable ground to meet upon than as many americans their differences of opinion being incomparably less radical than ours and it being the sincerest wish of all their hearts whether they call themselves liberals or what not that nothing in this world shall ever be greatly altered from what it has been and is  thus there is seldom such a virulence of political hostility that it may not be dissolved in a glass or two of wine without making the good liquor any more dry or bitter than accords with english taste  the first dinner of this kind at which i had the honor to be present took place during assizetime and included among the guests the judges and the prominent members of the bar  reaching the town hall at seven oclock i communicated my name to one of several splendidly dressed footmen and he repeated it to another on the first staircase by whom it was passed to a third and thence to a fourth at the door of the receptionroom losing all resemblance to the original sound in the course of these transmissions so that i had the advantage of making my entrance in the character of a stranger not only to the whole company but to myself as well  his worship however kindly recognized me and put me on speakingterms with two or three gentlemen whom i found very affable and all the more hospitably attentive on the score of my nationality  it is very singular how kind an englishman will almost invariably be to an individual american without ever bating a jot of his prejudice against the american character in the lump  my new acquaintances took evident pains to put me at my ease and in requital of their goodnature i soon began to look round at the general company in a critical spirit making my crude observations apart and drawing silent inferences of the correctness of which i should not have been half so well satisfied a year afterwards as at that moment  there were two judges present a good many lawyers and a few officers of the army in uniform  the other guests seemed to be principally of the mercantile class and among them was a shipowner from nova scotia with whom i coalesced a little inasmuch as we were born with the same sky over our heads and an unbroken continuity of soil between his abode and mine  there was one old gentleman whose character i never made out with powdered hair clad in black breeches and silk stockings and wearing a rapier at his side otherwise with the exception of the military uniforms there was little or no pretence of official costume it being the first considerable assemblage of englishmen that i had seen my honest impression about then was that they were a heavy and homely set of people with a remarkable roughness of aspect and behavior not repulsive but beneath which it required more familiarity with the national character than i then possessed always to detect the good breeding of a gentleman  being generally middleaged or still further advanced they were by no means graceful in figure for the comeliness of the youthful englishman rapidly diminishes with years his body appearing to grow longer his legs to abbreviate themselves and his stomach to assume the dignified prominence which justly belongs to that metropolis of his system  his face what with the acridity of the atmosphere ale at lunch wine at dinner and a welldigested abundance of succulent food gets red and mottled and develops at least one additional chin with a promise of more so that finally a stranger recognizes his animal part at the most superficial glance but must take time and a little pains to discover the intellectual  comparing him with an american i really thought that our national paleness and lean habit of flesh gave us greatly the advantage in an aesthetic point of view  it seemed to me moreover that the english tailor had not done so much as he might and ought for these heavy figures but had gone on wilfully exaggerating their uncouthness by the roominess of their garments he had evidently no idea of accuracy of fit and smartness was entirely out of his line  but to be quite open with the reader i afterwards learned to think that this aforesaid tailor has a deeper art than his brethren among ourselves knowing how to dress his customers with such individual propriety that they look as if they were born in their clothes the fit being to the character rather than the form  if you make an englishman smart unless he be a very exceptional one of whom i have seen a few you make him a monster his best aspect is that of ponderous respectability  to make an end of these first impressions i fancied that not merely the suffolk bar but the bar of any inland county in new england might show a set of thinvisaged men looking wretchedly worn sallow deeply wrinkled across the forehead and grimly furrowed about the mouth with whom these heavychecked english lawyers slowpaced and fatwitted as they must needs be would stand very little chance in a professional contest  how that matter might turn out i am unqualified to decide but i state these results of my earliest glimpses at englishmen not for what they are worth but because i ultimately gave them up as worth little or nothing  in course of time i came to the conclusion that englishmen of all ages are a rather goodlooking people dress in admirable taste from their own point of view and under a surface never silken to the touch have a refinement of manners too thorough and genuine to be thought of as a separate endowmentthat is to say if the individual himself be a man of station and has had gentlemen for his father and grandfather  the sturdy anglosaxon nature does not refine itself short of the third generation  the tradesmen too and all other classes have their own proprieties  the only value of my criticisms therefore lay in their exemplifying the proneness of a traveller to measure one people by the distinctive characteristics of anotheras english writers invariably measure us and take upon themselves to be disgusted accordingly instead of trying to find out some principle of beauty with which we may be in conformity  in due time we were summoned to the table and went thither in no solemn procession but with a good deal of jostling thrusting behind and scrambling for places when we reached our destination  the legal gentlemen i suspect were responsible for this indecorous zeal which i never afterwards remarked in a similar party  the dininghall was of noble size and like the other rooms of the suite was gorgeously painted and gilded and brilliantly illuminated  there was a splendid tableservice and a noble array of footmen some of them in plain clothes and others wearing the townlivery richly decorated with goldlace and themselves excellent specimens of the blooming young manhood of britain  when we were fairly seated it was certainly an agreeable spectacle to look up and down the long vista of earnest faces and behold them so resolute so conscious that there was an important business in hand and so determined to be equal to the occasion  indeed englishman or not i hardly know what can be prettier than a snowwhite tablecloth a huge heap of flowers as a central decoration bright silver rich china crystal glasses decanters of sherry at due intervals a french roll and an artistically folded napkin at each plate all that airy portion of a banquet in short that comes before the first mouthful the whole illuminated by a blaze of artificial light without which a dinner of madedishes looks spectral and the simplest viands are the best  printed billsoffare were distributed representing an abundant feast no part of which appeared on the table until called for in separate plates  i have entirely forgotten what it was but deem it no great matter inasmuch as there is a pervading commonplace and identicalness in the composition of extensive dinners on account of the impossibility of supplying a hundred guests with anything particularly delicate or rare  it was suggested to me that certain juicy old gentlemen had a private understanding what to call for and that it would be good policy in a stranger to follow in their footsteps through the feast  i did not care to do so however because like sancho panzas dip out of camachos caldron any sort of potluck at such a table would be sure to suit my purpose so i chose a dish or two on my own judgment and getting through my labors betimes had great pleasure in seeing the englishmen toil onward to the end  they drank rather copiously too though wisely for i observed that they seldom took hock and let the champagne bubble slowly away out of the goblet solacing themselves with sherry but tasting it warily before bestowing their final confidence  their taste in wines however did not seem so exquisite and certainly was not so various as that to which many americans pretend  this foppery of an intimate acquaintance with rare vintages does not suit a sensible englishman as he is very much in earnest about his wines and adopts one or two as his lifelong friends seldom exchanging them for any delilahs of a moment and reaping the reward of his constancy in an unimpaired stomach and only so much gout as he deems wholesome and desirable  knowing well the measure of his powers he is not apt to fill his glass too often  society indeed would hardly tolerate habitual imprudences of that kind though in my opinion the englishmen now upon the stage could carry off their three bottles at need with as steady a gait as any of their forefathers  it is not so very long since the threebottle heroes sank finally under the table  it may be at least i should be glad if it were true that there was an occult sympathy between our temperance reform now somewhat in abeyance and the almost simultaneous disappearance of harddrinking among the respectable classes in england  i remember a middleaged gentleman telling me in illustration of the very slight importance attached to breaches of temperance within the memory of men not yet old that he had seen a certain magistrate sir john linkwater or drinkwaterbut i think the jolly old knight could hardly have staggered under so perverse a misnomer as this lastwhile sitting on the magisterial bench pull out a crownpiece and hand it to the clerk  mr clerk said sir john as if it were the most indifferent fact in the world i was drunk last night  there are my five shillings  during the dinner i had a good deal of pleasant conversation with the gentlemen on either side of me  one of them a lawyer expatiated with great unction on the social standing of the judges  representing the dignity and authority of the crown they take precedence during assizetime of the highest military men in the kingdom of the lordlieutenant of the county of the archbishops of the royal dukes and even of the prince of wales  for the nonce they are the greatest men in england  with a glow of professional complacency that amounted to enthusiasm my friend assured me that in case of a royal dinner a judge if actually holding an assize would be expected to offer his arm and take the queen herself to the table  happening to be in company with some of these elevated personages on subsequent occasions it appeared to me that the judges are fully conscious of their paramount claims to respect and take rather more pains to impress them on their ceremonial inferiors than men of high hereditary rank are apt to do  bishops if it be not irreverent to say so are sometimes marked by a similar characteristic  dignified position is so sweet to an englishman that he needs to be born in it and to feel it thoroughly incorporated with his nature from its original germ in order to keep him from flaunting it obtrusively in the faces of innocent bystanders  my companion on the other side was a thickset middleaged man uncouth in manners and ugly where none were handsome with a dark roughly hewn visage that looked grim in repose and secured to hold within itself the machinery of a very terrific frown  he ate with resolute appetite and let slip few opportunities of imbibing whatever liquids happened to be passing by  i was meditating in what way this grisly featured tablefellow might most safely be accosted when he turned to me with a surly sort of kindness and invited me to take a glass of wine  we then began a conversation that abounded on his part with sturdy sense and somehow or other brought me closer to him than i had yet stood to an englishman  i should hardly have taken him to be an educated man certainly not a scholar of accurate training and yet he seemed to have all the resources of education and trained intellectual power at command my fresh americanism and watchful observation of english characteristics appeared either to interest or amuse him or perhaps both  under the mollifying influences of abundance of meat and drink he grew very gracious not that i ought to use such a phrase to describe his evidently genuine goodwill and by and by expressed a wish for further acquaintance asking me to call at his rooms in london and inquire for sergeant wilkinsthrowing out the name forcibly as if he had no occasion to be ashamed of it  i remembered dean swifts retort to sergeant bettesworth on a similar announcementof what regiment pray sirand fancied that the same question might not have been quite amiss if applied to the rugged individual at my side  but i heard of him subsequently as one of the prominent men at the english bar a rough customer and a terribly strong champion in criminal cases and it caused me more regret than might have been expected on so slight an acquaintanceship when not long afterwards i saw his death announced in the newspapers  not rich in attractive qualities he possessed i think the most attractive one of allthorough manhood  after the cloth was removed a goodly group of decanters were set before the mayor who sent them forth on their outward voyage full freighted with port sherry madeira and claret of which excellent liquors methought the latter found least acceptance among the guests  when every man had filled his glass his worship stood up and proposed a toast  it was of course our gracious sovereign or words to that effect and immediately a band of musicians whose preliminary footings and thrummings i had already heard behind me struck up god save the queen and the whole company rose with one impulse to assist in singing that famous national anthem  it was the first time in my life that i had ever seen a body of men or even a single man under the active influence of the sentiment of loyalty for though we call ourselves loyal to our country and institutions and prove it by our readiness to shed blood and sacrifice life in their behalf still the principle is as cold and hard in an american bosom as the steel spring that puts in motion a powerful machinery  in the englishmans system a force similar to that of our steel spring is generated by the warm throbbings of human hearts  he clothes our bare abstraction in flesh and bloodat present in the flesh and blood of a womanand manages to combine love awe and intellectual reverence all in one emotion and to embody his mother his wife his children the whole idea of kindred in a single person and make her the representative of his country and its laws  we americans smile superior as i did at the mayors table and yet i fancy we lose some very agreeable titillations of the heart in consequence of our proud prerogative of caring no more about our president than for a man of straw or a stuffed scarecrow straddling in a cornfield  but to say the truth the spectacle struck me rather ludicrously to see this party of stout middleaged and elderly gentlemen in the fulness of meat and drink their ample and ruddy faces glistening with wine perspiration and enthusiasm rumbling out those strange old stanzas from the very bottom of their hearts and stomachs which two organs in the english interior arrangement lie closer together than in ours  the song seemed to me the rudest old ditty in the world but i could not wonder at its universal acceptance and indestructible popularity considering how inimitably it expresses the national faith and feeling as regards the inevitable righteousness of england the almightys consequent respect and partiality for that redoubtable little island and his presumed readiness to strengthen its defence against the contumacious wickedness and knavery of all other principalities or republics  tennyson himself though evidently english to the very last prejudice could not write half so good a song for the purpose  finding that the entire dinnertable struck in with voices of every pitch between rolling thunder and the squeak of a cartwheel and that the strain was not of such delicacy as to be much hurt by the harshest of them i determined to lend my own assistance in swelling the triumphant roar  it seemed but a proper courtesy to the first lady in the land whose guest in the largest sense i might consider myself  accordingly my first tuneful efforts and probably my last for i purpose not to sing any more unless it he hail columbia on the restoration of the union were poured freely forth in honor of queen victoria  the sergeant smiled like the carved head of a swiss nutcracker and the other gentlemen in my neighborhood by nods and gestures evinced grave approbation of so suitable a tribute to english superiority and we finished our stave and sat down in an extremely happy frame of mind  other toasts followed in honor of the great institutions and interests of the country and speeches in response to each were made by individuals whom the mayor designated or the company called for  none of them impressed me with a very high idea of english postprandial oratory  it is inconceivable indeed what ragged and shapeless utterances most englishmen are satisfied to give vent to without attempting anything like artistic shape but clapping on a patch here and another there and ultimately getting out what they want to say and generally with a result of sufficiently good sense but in some such disorganized mass as if they had thrown it up rather than spoken it  it seemed to me that this was almost as much by choice as necessity  an englishman ambitious of public favor should not be too smooth  if an orator is glib his countrymen distrust him  they dislike smartness  the stronger and heavier his thoughts the better provided there be an element of commonplace running through them and any rough yet never vulgar force of expression such as would knock an opponent down if it hit him only it must not be too personal is altogether to their taste but a studied neatness of language or other such superficial graces they cannot abide  they do not often permit a man to make himself a fine orator of malice aforethought that is unless he be a nobleman as for example lord stanley of the derby family who as an hereditary legislator and necessarily a public speaker is bound to remedy a poor natural delivery in the best way he can  on the whole i partly agree with them and if i cared for any oratory whatever should be as likely to applaud theirs as our own  when an english speaker sits down you feel that you have been listening to a real man and not to an actor his sentiments have a wholesome earthsmell in them though very likely this apparent naturalness is as much an art as what we expend in rounding a sentence or elaborating a peroration  it is one good effect of this inartificial style that nobody in england seems to feel any shyness about shovelling the untrimmed and untrimmable ideas out of his mind for the benefit of an audience  at least nobody did on the occasion now in hand except a poor little major of artillery who responded for the army in a thin quavering voice with a terribly hesitating trickle of fragmentary ideas and i question not would rather have been bayoneted in front of his batteries than to have said a word  not his own mouth but the cannons was this poor majors proper organ of utterance  while i was thus amiably occupied in criticising my fellowguests the mayor had got up to propose another toast and listening rather inattentively to the first sentence or two i soon became sensible of a drift in his worships remarks that made me glance apprehensively towards sergeant wilkins  yes grumbled that gruff personage shoving a decanter of port towards me it is your turn next and seeing in my face i suppose the consternation of a wholly unpractised orator he kindly added it is nothing  a mere acknowledgment will answer the purpose  the less you say the better they will like it  that being the case i suggested that perhaps they would like it best if i said nothing at all  but the sergeant shook his head  now on first receiving the mayors invitation to dinner it had occurred to me that i might possibly be brought into my present predicament but i had dismissed the idea from my mind as too disagreeable to be entertained and moreover as so alien from my disposition and character that fate surely could not keep such a misfortune in store for me  if nothing else prevented an earthquake or the crack of doom would certainly interfere before i need rise to speak  yet here was the mayor getting on inexorablyand indeed i heartily wished that he might get on and on forever and of his wordy wanderings find no end  if the gentle reader my kindest friend and closest confidant deigns to desire it i can impart to him my own experience as a public speaker quite as indifferently as if it concerned another person  indeed it does concern another or a mere spectral phenomenon for it was not i in my proper and natural self that sat there at table or subsequently rose to speak  at the moment then if the choice had been offered me whether the mayor should let off a speech at my head or a pistol i should unhesitatingly have taken the latter alternative  i had really nothing to say not an idea in my head nor which was a great deal worse any flowing words or embroidered sentences in which to dress out that empty nothing and give it a cunning aspect of intelligence such as might last the poor vacuity the little time it had to live  but time pressed the mayor brought his remarks affectionately eulogistic of the united states and highly complimentary to their distinguished representative at that table to a close amid a vast deal of cheering and the band struck up hail columbia i believe though it might have been old hundred or god save the queen over again for anything that i should have known or cared  when the music ceased there was an intensely disagreeable instant during which i seemed to rend away and fling off the habit of a lifetime and rose still void of ideas but with preternatural composure to make a speech  the guests rattled on the table and cried hear most vociferously as if now at length in this foolish and idly garrulous world had come the longexpected moment when one golden word was to be spoken and in that imminent crisis i caught a glimpse of a little bit of an effusion of international sentiment which it might and must and should do to utter  well it was nothing as the sergeant had said  what surprised me most was the sound of my own voice which i had never before heard at a declamatory pitch and which impressed me as belonging to some other person who and not myself would be responsible for the speech a prodigious consolation and encouragement under the circumstances  i went on without the slightest embarrassment and sat down amid great applause wholly undeserved by anything that i had spoken but well won from englishmen methought by the new development of pluck that alone had enabled me to speak at all  it was handsomely done quoth sergeant wilkins and i felt like a recruit who had been for the first time under fire  i would gladly have ended my oratorical career then and there forever but was often placed in a similar or worse position and compelled to meet it as i best might for this was one of the necessities of an office which i had voluntarily taken on my shoulders and beneath which i might be crushed by no moral delinquency on my own part but could not shirk without cowardice and shame  my subsequent fortune was various  once though i felt it to be a kind of imposture i got a speech by heart and doubtless it might have been a very pretty one only i forgot every syllable at the moment of need and had to improvise another as well as i could  i found it a better method to prearrange a few points in my mind and trust to the spur of the occasion and the kind aid of providence for enabling me to bring them to bear  the presence of any considerable proportion of personal friends generally dumbfounded me  i would rather have talked with an enemy in the gate  invariably too i was much embarrassed by a small audience and succeeded better with a large one the sympathy of a multitude possessing a buoyant effect which lifts the speaker a little way out of his individuality and tosses him towards a perhaps better range of sentiment than his private one  again if i rose carelessly and confidently with an expectation of going through the business entirely at my ease i often found that i had little or nothing to say whereas if i came to the charge in perfect despair and at a crisis when failure would have been horrible it once or twice happened that the frightful emergency concentrated my poor faculties and enabled me to give definite and vigorous expression to sentiments which an instant before looked as vague and far off as the clouds in the atmosphere  on the whole poor as my own success may have been i apprehend that any intelligent man with a tongue possesses the chief requisite of oratorical power and may develop many of the others if he deems it worth while to bestow a great amount of labor and pains on an object which the most accomplished orators i suspect have not found altogether satisfactory to their highest impulses  at any rate it must be a remarkably true man who can keep his own elevated conception of truth when the lower feeling of a multitude is assailing his natural sympathies and who can speak out frankly the best that there is in him when by adulterating it a little or a good deal he knows that he may make it ten times as acceptable to the audience   this slight article on the civic banquets of england would be too wretchedly imperfect without an attempted description of a lord mayors dinner at the mansion house in london  i should have preferred the annual feast at guildhall but never had the good fortune to witness it once however i was honored with an invitation to one of the regular dinners and gladly accepted ittaking the precaution nevertheless though it hardly seemed necessary to inform the cityking through a mutual friend that i was no fit representative of american eloquence and must humbly make it a condition that i should not be expected to open my mouth except for the reception of his lordships bountiful hospitality  the reply was gracious and acquiescent so that i presented myself in the great entrancehall of the mansion house at half past six oclock in a state of most enjoyable freedom from the pusillanimous apprehensions that often tormented me at such times  the mansion house was built in queen annes days in the very heart of old london and is a palace worthy of its inhabitant were he really as great a man as his traditionary state and pomp would seem to indicate  times are changed however since the days of whittington or even of hogarths industrious apprentice to whom the highest imaginable reward of lifelong integrity was a seat in the lord mayors chair  people nowadays say that the real dignity and importance have perished out of the office as they do sooner or later out of all earthly institutions leaving only a painted and gilded shell like that of an easter egg and that it is only secondrate and thirdrate men who now condescend to be ambitious of the mayoralty  i felt a little grieved at this for the original emigrants of new england had strong sympathies with the people of london who were mostly puritans in religion and parliamentarians in politics in the early days of our country so that the lord mayor was a potentate of huge dimensions in the estimation of our forefathers and held to be hardly second to the prime minister of the throne  the true great men of the city now appear to have aims beyond city greatness connecting themselves with national politics and seeking to be identified with the aristocracy of the country  in the entrancehall i was received by a body of footmen dressed in a livery of blue coats and buff breeches in which they looked wonderfully like american revolutionary generals only bedizened with far more lace and embroidery than those simple and grand old heroes ever dreamed of wearing  there were likewise two very imposing figures whom i should have taken to be military men of rank being arrayed in scarlet coats and large silver epaulets but they turned out to be officers of the lord mayors household and were now employed in assigning to the guests the places which they were respectively to occupy at the dinnertable  our names for i had included myself in a little group of friends were announced and ascending the staircase we met his lordship in the doorway of the first receptionroom where also we had the advantage of a presentation to the lady mayoress  as this distinguished couple retired into private life at the termination of their year of office it is inadmissible to make any remarks critical or laudatory on the manners and bearing of two personages suddenly emerging from a position of respectable mediocrity into one of preeminent dignity within their own sphere  such individuals almost always seem to grow nearly or quite to the full size of their office  if it were desirable to write an essay on the latent aptitude of ordinary people for grandeur we have an exemplification in our own country and on a scale incomparably greater than that of the mayoralty though invested with nothing like the outward magnificence that gilds and embroiders the latter  if i have been correctly informed the lord mayors salary is exactly double that of the president of the united states and yet is found very inadequate to his necessary expenditure  there were two receptionrooms thrown into one by the opening of wide foldingdoors and though in an old style and not yet so old as to be venerable they are remarkably handsome apartments lofty as well as spacious with carved ceilings and walls and at either end a splendid fireplace of white marble ornamented with sculptured wreaths of flowers and foliage  the company were about three hundred many of them celebrities in politics war literature and science though i recollect none preeminently distinguished in either department  but it is certainly a pleasant mode of doing honor to men of literature for example who deserve well of the public yet do not often meet it face to face thus to bring them together under genial auspices in connection with persons of note in other lines  i know not what may be the lord mayors mode or principle of selecting his guests nor whether during his official term he can proffer his hospitality to every man of noticeable talent in the wide world of london nor in fine whether his lordships invitation is much sought for or valued but it seemed to me that this periodical feast is one of the many sagacious methods which the english have contrived for keeping up a good understanding among different sorts of people  like most other distinctions of society however i presume that the lord mayors card does not often seek out modest merit but comes at last when the recipient is conscious of the bore and doubtful about the honor  one very pleasant characteristic which i never met with at any other public or partially public dinner was the presence of ladies  no doubt they were principally the wives and daughters of city magnates and if we may judge from the many sly allusions in old plays and satirical poems the city of london has always been famous for the beauty of its women and the reciprocal attractions between them and the men of quality  be that as it might while straying hither and thither through those crowded apartments i saw much reason for modifying certain heterodox opinions which i had imbibed in my transatlantic newness and rawness as regarded the delicate character and frequent occurrence of english beauty  to state the entire truth being at this period some years old in english life my taste i fear had long since begun to be deteriorated by acquaintance with other models of feminine loveliness than it was my happiness to know in america  i often found or seemed to find if i may dare to confess it in the persons of such of my dear countrywomen as i now occasionally met a certain meagreness heaven forbid that i should call it scrawniness a deficiency of physical development a scantiness so to speak in the pattern of their material make a paleness of complexion a thinness of voiceall of which characteristics nevertheless only made me resolve so much the more sturdily to uphold these fair creatures as angels because i was sometimes driven to a halfacknowledgment that the english ladies looked at from a lower point of view were perhaps a little finer animals than they  the advantages of the latter if any they could really be said to have were all comprised in a few additional lumps of clay on their shoulders and other parts of their figures  it would be a pitiful bargain to give up the ethereal charm of american beauty in exchange for half a hundredweight of human clay  at a given signal we all found our way into an immense room called the egyptian hall i know not why except that the architecture was classic and as different as possible from the ponderous style of memphis and the pyramids  a powerful band played inspiringly as we entered and a brilliant profusion of light shone down on two long tables extending the whole length of the hall and a crosstable between them occupying nearly its entire breadth  glass gleamed and silver glistened on an acre or two of snowy damask over which were set out all the accompaniments of a stately feast  we found our places without much difficulty and the lord mayors chaplain implored a blessing on the fooda ceremony which the english never omit at a great dinner or a small one yet consider i fear not so much a religious rite as a sort of preliminary relish before the soup  the soup of course on this occasion was turtle of which in accordance with immemorial custom each guest was allowed two platefuls in spite of the otherwise immitigable law of tabledecorum  indeed judging from the proceedings of the gentlemen near me i surmised that there was no practical limit except the appetite of the guests and the capacity of the souptureens  not being fond of this civic dainty i partook of it but once and then only in accordance with the wise maxim always to taste a fruit a wine or a celebrated dish at its indigenous site and the very fountainhead of turtlesoup i suppose is in the lord mayors dinnerpot  it is one of those orthodox customs which people follow for half a century without knowing why to drink a sip of rumpunch in a very small tumbler after the soup  it was excellently wellbrewed and it seemed to me almost worth while to sup the soup for the sake of sipping the punch  the rest of the dinner was catalogued in a billoffare printed on delicate white paper within an arabesque border of green and gold  it looked very good not only in the english and french names of the numerous dishes but also in the positive reality of the dishes themselves which were all set on the table to be carved and distributed by the guests  this ancient and honest method is attended with a good deal of trouble and a lavish effusion of gravy yet by no means bestowed or dispensed in vain because you have thereby the absolute assurance of a banquet actually before your eyes instead of a shadowy promise in the billoffare and such meagre fulfilment as a single guest can contrive to get upon his individual plate  i wonder that englishmen who are fond of looking at prizeoxen in the shape of butchersmeat do not generally better estimate the aesthetic gormandism of devouring the whole dinner with their eyesight before proceeding to nibble the comparatively few morsels which after all the most heroic appetite and widest stomachic capacity of mere mortals can enable even an alderman really to eat  there fell to my lot three delectable things enough which i take pains to remember that the reader may not go away wholly unsatisfied from the barmecide feast to which i have bidden him a red mullet a plate of mushrooms exquisitely stewed and part of a ptarmigan a bird of the same family as the grouse but feeding high up towards the summit of the scotch mountains whence it gets a wild delicacy of flavor very superior to that of the artificially nurtured english gamefowl  all the other dainties have vanished from my memory as completely as those of prosperos banquet after ariel had clapped his wings over it  the band played at intervals inspiriting us to new efforts as did likewise the sparkling wines which the footmen supplied from an inexhaustible cellar and which the guests quaffed with little apparent reference to the disagreeable fact that there comes a tomorrow morning after every feast  as long as that shall be the case a prudent man can never have full enjoyment of his dinner  nearly opposite to me on the other side of the table sat a young lady in white whom i am sorely tempted to describe but dare not because not only the supereminence of her beauty but its peculiar character would cause the sketch to be recognized however rudely it might be drawn  i hardly thought that there existed such a woman outside of a pictureframe or the covers of a romance not that i had ever met with her resemblance even there but being so distinct and singular an apparition she seemed likelier to find her sisterhood in poetry and picture than in real life  let us turn away from her lest a touch too apt should compel her stately and cold and soft and womanly grace to gleam out upon my page with a strange repulsion and unattainableness in the very spell that made her beautiful  at her side and familiarly attentive to her sat a gentleman of whom i remember only a hard outline of the nose and forehead and such a monstrous portent of a beard that you could discover no symptom of a mouth except when he opened it to speak or to put in a morsel of food  then indeed you suddenly became aware of a cave hidden behind the impervious and darksome shrubbery there could be no doubt who this gentleman and lady were  any child would have recognized them at a glance  it was bluebeard and a new wife the loveliest of the series but with already a mysterious gloom overshadowing her fair young brow travelling in their honeymoon and dining among other distinguished strangers at the lord mayors table  after an hour or two of valiant achievement with knife and fork came the dessert and at the point of the festival where fingerglasses are usually introduced a large silver basin was carried round to the guests containing rosewater into which we dipped the ends of our napkins and were conscious of a delightful fragrance instead of that heavy and weary odor the hateful ghost of a defunct dinner  this seems to be an ancient custom of the city not confined to the lord mayors table but never met with westward of temple bar  during all the feast in accordance with another ancient custom the origin or purport of which i do not remember to have heard there stood a man in armor with a helmet on his head behind his lordships chair when the afterdinner wine was placed on the table still another official personage appeared behind the chair and proceeded to make a solemn and sonorous proclamation in which he enumerated the principal guests comprising three or four noblemen several baronets and plenty of generals members of parliament aldermen and other names of the illustrious one of which sounded strangely familiar to my ears ending in some such style as this and other gentlemen and ladies here present the lord mayor drinks to you all in a lovingcupgiving a sort of sentimental twang to the two wordsand sends it round among you  and forthwith the lovingcupseveral of them indeed on each side of the tablescame slowly down with all the antique ceremony  the fashion of it is thus  the lord mayor standing up and taking the covered cup in both hands presents it to the guest at his elbow who likewise rises and removes the cover for his lordship to drink which being successfully accomplished the guest replaces the cover and receives the cup into his own hands  he then presents it to his next neighbor that the cover may be again removed for himself to take a draught after which the third person goes through a similar manoeuvre with a fourth and he with a fifth until the whole company find themselves inextricably intertwisted and entangled in one complicated chain of love  when the cup came to my hands i examined it critically both inside and out and perceived it to be an antique and richly ornamented silver goblet capable of holding about a quart of wine considering how much trouble we all expended in getting the cup to our lips the guests appeared to content themselves with wonderfully moderate potations  in truth nearly or quite the original quart of wine being still in the goblet it seemed doubtful whether any of the company had more than barely touched the silver rim before passing it to their neighborsa degree of abstinence that might be accounted for by a fastidious repugnance to so many compotators in one cup or possibly by a disapprobation of the liquor  being curious to know all about these important matters with a view of recommending to my countrymen whatever they might usefully adopt i drank an honest sip from the lovingcup and had no occasion for anotherascertaining it to be claret of a poor original quality largely mingled with water and spiced and sweetened it was good enough however for a merely spectral or ceremonial drink and could never have been intended for any better purpose  the toasts now began in the customary order attended with speeches neither more nor less witty and ingenious than the specimens of tableeloquence which had heretofore delighted me  as preparatory to each new display the herald or whatever he was behind the chair of state gave awful notice that the right honorable the lord mayor was about to propose a toast  his lordship being happily delivered thereof together with some accompanying remarks the band played an appropriate tune and the herald again issued proclamation to the effect that such or such a nobleman or gentleman general dignified clergyman or what not was going to respond to the right honorable the lord mayors toast then if i mistake not there was another prodigious flourish of trumpets and twanging of stringed instruments and finally the doomed individual waiting all this while to be decapitated got up and proceeded to make a fool of himself  a bashful young earl tried his maiden oratory on the good citizens of london and having evidently got every word by heart even including however he managed it the most seemingly casual improvisations of the moment he really spoke like a book and made incomparably the smoothest speech i ever heard in england  the weight and gravity of the speakers not only on this occasion but all similar ones was what impressed me as most extraordinary not to say absurd  why should people eat a good dinner and put their spirits into festive trim with champagne and afterwards mellow themselves into a most enjoyable state of quietude with copious libations of sherry and old port and then disturb the whole excellent result by listening to speeches as heavy as an afterdinner nap and in no degree so refreshing if the champagne had thrown its sparkle over the surface of these effusions or if the generous port had shone through their substance with a ruddy glow of the old english humor i might have seen a reason for honest gentlemen prattling in their cups and should undoubtedly have been glad to be a listener  but there was no attempt nor impulse of the kind on the part of the orators nor apparent expectation of such a phenomenon on that of the audience  in fact i imagine that the latter were best pleased when the speaker embodied his ideas in the figurative language of arithmetic or struck upon any hard matter of business or statistics as a heavyladen bark bumps upon a rock in midocean  the sad severity the too earnest utilitarianism of modern life have wrought a radical and lamentable change i am afraid in this ancient and goodly institution of civic banquets  people used to come to them a few hundred years ago for the sake of being jolly they come now with an odd notion of pouring sober wisdom into their wine by way of wormwoodbitters and thus make such a mess of it that the wine and wisdom reciprocally spoil one another  possibly the foregoing sentiments have taken a spice of acridity from a circumstance that happened about this stage of the feast and very much interrupted my own further enjoyment of it  up to this time my condition had been exceedingly felicitous both on account of the brilliancy of the scene and because i was in close proximity with three very pleasant english friends  one of them was a lady whose honored name my readers would recognize as a household word if i dared write it another a gentleman likewise well known to them whose fine taste kind heart and genial cultivation are qualities seldom mixed in such happy proportion as in him  the third was the man to whom i owed most in england the warm benignity of whose nature was never weary of doing me good who led me to many scenes of life in town camp and country which i never could have found out for myself who knew precisely the kind of help a stranger needs and gave it as freely as if he had not had a thousand more important things to live for  thus i never felt safer or cosier at anybodys fireside even my own than at the dinnertable of the lord mayor  out of this serene sky came a thunderbolt  his lordship got up and proceeded to make some very eulogistic remarks upon the literary and commerciali question whether those two adjectives were ever before married by a copulative conjunction and they certainly would not live together in illicit intercourse of their own accordthe literary and commercial attainments of an eminent gentleman there present and then went on to speak of the relations of blood and interest between great britain and the aforesaid eminent gentlemans native country  those bonds were more intimate than had ever before existed between two great nations throughout all history and his lordship felt assured that that whole honorable company would join him in the expression of a fervent wish that they might be held inviolably sacred on both sides of the atlantic now and forever  then came the same wearisome old toast dry and hard to chew upon as a musty seabiscuit which had been the text of nearly all the oratory of my public career  the herald sonorously announced that mr soandso would now respond to his right honorable lordships toast and speech the trumpets sounded the customary flourish for the onset there was a thunderous rumble of anticipatory applause and finally a deep silence sank upon the festive hall  all this was a horrid piece of treachery on the lord mayors part after beguiling me within his lines on a pledge of safeconduct and it seemed very strange that he could not let an unobtrusive individual eat his dinner in peace drink a small sample of the mansion house wine and go away grateful at heart for the old english hospitality  if his lordship had sent me an infusion of ratsbane in the lovingcup i should have taken it much more kindly at his hands  but i suppose the secret of the matter to have been somewhat as follows  all england just then was in one of those singular fits of panic excitement not fear though as sensitive and tremulous as that emotion which in consequence of the homogeneous character of the people their intense patriotism and their dependence for their ideas in public affairs on other sources than their own examination and individual thought are more sudden pervasive and unreasoning than any similar mood of our own public  in truth i have never seen the american public in a state at all similar and believe that we are incapable of it  our excitements are not impulsive like theirs but right or wrong are moral and intellectual  for example the grand rising of the north at the commencement of this war bore the aspect of impulse and passion only because it was so universal and necessarily done in a moment just as the quiet and simultaneous gettingup of a thousand people out of their chairs would cause a tumult that might be mistaken for a storm  we were cool then and have been cool ever since and shall remain cool to the end which we shall take coolly whatever it may be  there is nothing which the english find it so difficult to understand in us as this characteristic  they imagine us in our collective capacity a kind of wild beast whose normal condition is savage fury and are always looking for the moment when we shall break through the slender barriers of international law and comity and compel the reasonable part of the world with themselves at the head to combine for the purpose of putting us into a stronger cage  at times this apprehension becomes so powerful and when one man feels it a million do that it resembles the passage of the wind over a broad field of grain where you see the whole crop bending and swaying beneath one impulse and each separate stalk tossing with the selfsame disturbance as its myriad companions  at such periods all englishmen talk with a terrible identity of sentiment and expression you have the whole country in each man and not one of them all if you put him strictly to the question can give a reasonable ground for his alarm  there are but two nations in the worldour own country and francethat can put england into this singular state  it is the united sensitiveness of a people extremely welltodo careful of their countrys honor most anxious for the preservation of the cumbrous and mossgrown prosperity which they have been so long in consolidating and incompetent owing to the national halfsightedness and their habit of trusting to a few leading minds for their public opinion to judge when that prosperity is really threatened  if the english were accustomed to look at the foreign side of any international dispute they might easily have satisfied themselves that there was very little danger of a war at that particular crisis from the simple circumstance that their own government had positively not an inch of honest ground to stand upon and could not fail to be aware of the fact  neither could they have met parliament with any show of a justification for incurring war  it was no such perilous juncture as exists now when law and right are really controverted on sustainable or plausible grounds and a naval commander may at any moment fire off the first cannon of a terrible contest  if i remember it correctly it was a mere diplomatic squabble in which the british ministers with the politic generosity which they are in the habit of showing towards their official subordinates had tried to browbeat us for the purpose of sustaining an ambassador in an indefensible proceeding and the american government for god had not denied us an administration of statesmen then had retaliated with stanch courage and exquisite skill putting inevitably a cruel mortification upon their opponents but indulging them with no pretence whatever for active resentment  now the lord mayor like any other englishman probably fancied that war was on the western gale and was glad to lay hold of even so insignificant an american as myself who might be made to harp on the rusty old strings of national sympathies identity of blood and interest and community of language and literature and whisper peace where there was no peace in however weak an utterance  and possibly his lordship thought in his wisdom that the good feeling which was sure to be expressed by a company of wellbred englishmen at his august and farfamed dinnertable might have an appreciable influence on the grand result  thus when the lord mayor invited me to his feast it was a piece of strategy  he wanted to induce me to fling myself like a lesser curtius with a larger object of selfsacrifice into the chasm of discord between england and america and on my ignominious demur had resolved to shove me in with his own righthonorable hands in the hope of closing up the horrible pit forever  on the whole i forgive his lordship  he meant well by all partieshimself who would share the glory and me who ought to have desired nothing better than such an heroic opportunityhis own country which would continue to get cotton and breadstuffs and mine which would get everything that men work with and wear  as soon as the lord mayor began to speak i rapped upon my mind and it gave forth a hollow sound being absolutely empty of appropriate ideas i never thought of listening to the speech because i knew it all beforehand in twenty repetitions from other lips and was aware that it would not offer a single suggestive point  in this dilemma i turned to one of my three friends a gentleman whom i knew to possess an enviable flow of silver speech and obtested him by whatever he deemed holiest to give me at least an available thought or two to start with and once afloat i would trust to my guardianangel for enabling me to flounder ashore again  he advised me to begin with some remarks complimentary to the lord mayor and expressive of the hereditary reverence in which his office was heldat least my friend thought that there would be no harm in giving his lordship this little sugarplum whether quite the fact or nowas held by the descendants of the puritan forefathers  thence if i liked getting flexible with the oil of my own eloquence i might easily slide off into the momentous subject of the relations between england and america to which his lordship had made such weighty allusion  seizing this handful of straw with a deathgrip and bidding my three friends bury me honorably i got upon my legs to save both countries or perish in the attempt  the tables roared and thundered at me and suddenly were silent again  but as i have never happened to stand in a position of greater dignity and peril i deem it a stratagem of sage policy here to close these sketches leaving myself still erect in so heroic an attitude   the end
