moorish lady   ebremar      a monk   cola         a lame boy   monks and inquisitors   scene i  a little moorish room in the village of azubia in the centre of the room a chafing dish    mosada alone three times the roses have grown less and less as slowly autumn climbed the golden throne where sat old summer fading into song and thrice the peaches flushed upon the walls and thrice the corn around the sickles flamed since mong my people tented on the hills he stood a messenger in aprils prime swallows were flashing their white breasts above or perching on the tents aweary still from waste seas crossd yet ever garrulous along the velvet vale i saw him come in autumn when far down the mountain slopes the heavy clusters of the grapes were full i saw him sigh and turn and pass away for i and all my people were accurst of his sad god and down among the grass hiding my face i cried long bitterly twas evening and the cricket nation sang around my head and danced among the grass and all was dimness till a dying leaf slid circling down and softly touched my lips with dew as though twere sealing them for death yet somewhere in the footsore world we meet we two before we die for azolar the startaught moor said thus it was decreed by those wan stars that sit in company above the alpujarras on their thrones that when the stars of our nativity draw star to star as on that eve he passed down the long valleys from my peoples tents we meetwe two  she opens the casementthe mingled sound of the voices and laughter of the apple gatherers floats in                    how merry all these are among the fruit but yon lame cola crouches away from all the others now the sun ashining on the little crucifix of silver hanging round lame colas neck sinks down at last with yonder minaret of the alhambra black athwart his disk and cola seeing knows the sign and comes thus do i burn these precious herbs whose smoke pours up and floats in fragrance oer my head in coil on coil of azure  enter cola all is ready    cola mosada it is then so much the worse i will not share your sin    mosada                   it is no sin that you shall see on yonder glowing cloud pictured where wander the beloved feet whose footfall i have longed for three sad summers why these new fears    cola             the servant of the lord the dark still man has come and says tis sin    mosada they say the wish itself is half the sin then has this one been sinned full many times yet tis no sinmy father taught it me he was a man most learned and most mild who dreaming to a wondrous age lived on tending the roses round his lattice door for years his days had dawned and faded thus among the plants the flowery silence fell deep in his soul like rain upon a soil worn by the solstice fierce and made it pure would he teach any sin    cola                   gaze in the cloud yourself    mosada none but the innocent can see    cola they say i am all ugliness lamefooted i am one shoulder turned awrywhy then should i be good but you are beautiful    mosada i cannot see    cola               the beetles and the bats and spiders are my friends im theirs and they are not good but you are like the butterflies    mosada i cannot see i cannot see but you shall see a thing to talk on when youre old under a lemon tree beside your door and all the elders sitting in the sun will wondering listen and this tale shall ease for long the burthen of their talking griefs    cola upon my knees i pray you let it sleep the vision    mosada youre pale and weeping child be not afraid youll see no fearful thing thus thus i beckon from her viewless fields thus beckon to our aid a phantom fair and calm robed all in raiment moony white she was a great enchantress once of yore whose dwelling was a treewrapt island lulled far out upon the water world and ringed with wonderful white sand where never yet were furled the wings of ships there in a dell a lily blanch√®d place she sat and sang and in her singing wove around her head white lilies and her song flew forth afar along the sea and many a man grew hushed in his own house or mong the merchants grey hearing the far off singing guile and groaned and manned an argosy and sailing died in the far isle she sang herself asleep at last but now i wave her to my side    cola stay stay or i will hold your white arms down ah me i cannot reach themhere and there darting you wave them darting in the vapour heard you your lute upon the wall has sounded i feel a finger drawn across my cheek    mosada the phantoms come ha ha they come they come i wave them hither my breast heaves with joy ah now im easternhearted once again and while they gather round my beckoning arms ill sing the songs the dusky lovers sing wandering in sultry palaces of

morning of the autodafe dawns dimly through a barred window a few faint stars are shining swallows are circling in the dimness without    mosada oh swallows swallows swallows will ye fly this eve tomorrow or tomorrow night above the farmhouse by the little lake thats rustling in the reeds with patient pushes soft as a long dead footstep whispering through the brain my brothers will be passing down quite soon the cornfield where the poppies grow to their farmwork how silent all will be but no in this warm weather mong the hills will be the faint far thundersound as though the world were dreaming in its summer sleep that will be later day is scarcely dawning and hassan will be with themhe was so small a weak thin child when last i saw him there he will be taller nowtwas long ago  the men are busy in the glimmering square i hear the murmur as they raise the beams to build the circling seats where high in air soon will the churchmen nod above the crowd im not of that pale company whose feet ere long shall falter through the noisy square and not come thencefor here in this small ring hearken ye swallows i have hoarded up a poison drop the toy of fancy once a fashion with us moorish maids begot of dreaming and of watching by the door the shadows pass but now i love my ring for it alone of all the world will do my bidding  sucks poison from the ring                    now tis done and i am glad and freetwill thieve away with sleepy mood my thoughts and yonder brightening patch of sky with three bars crossed and these four walls my world and yon few stars grown dim like eyes of lovers the noisy world divides how soon a deed so small makes one grow weak and tottering where shall i lay me down that question is a weighty question for it is the last not there for there a spider weaves her web nay here ill lay me down where i can watch the burghers of the night fade one by one                            yonder a leaf of apple blossom circles in the gloom floating from yon barred window new comer thourt welcome lie there close against my fingers i wonder which is whitest they or thou tis thou for theyve grown blue around the nails my blossom i am dying and the stars are dying too they were full seven stars two only now they are two side by side oh allah it was thus they shone that night when my lost lover left these arms my vallence we meet at last the ministering stars of our nativity hang side by side and throb within the circles of green dawn too late too late for i am near to death i try to lift mine armsthey fall again this death is heavy in my veins like sleep i cannot even crawl along the flags a little nearer those bright stars tell me is it your message stars that when death comes my soul shall touch with his and the two flames be one i think alls finished now and sealed  after a pause enter ebremar    ebremar young moorish girl thy final hour is here cast off thy heresies and save thy soul from dateless pain she sleeps  starting                            mosadathou oh godawake thou shalt not die she sleeps her head cast backward in her unloosed hair look up look up thy vallence is by thee a fearful paleness creeps across her breast and outspread arms  casting himself down by her                            be not so pale dear love oh can my kisses bring a flush no more upon thy face how heavily thy head hangs on my breast listen we shall be safe well fly from this before the morning star dear heart there is a secret way that leads its paven length towards the rivers marge where lies a shallop in the yellow reeds awake awake and we will sail afar afar along the fleet white rivers face alone with our own whispers and replies alone among the murmurs of the dawn among thy nation none shall know that i was ebremar whose thoughts were fixed on god and heaven and holiness    mosada               lets talk and grieve for thats the sweetest music for sad souls days dead all flamebewildered and the hills in listning silence gazing on our grief i never knew an eve so marvellous still    ebremar her dreams are talking with old years awake grieve not for vallence kneels beside thee    mosada                                   vallence tis late wait one more day below the hills the footworn way is long and it grows dark it is the darkest eve i ever knew    ebremar i kneel by theeno parting nowlook up she smilesis happy with her wandering griefs    mosada so you must go kiss me before you go oh would the busy minutes might fold up their thieving wings that we might never part i never knew a night so honey sweet    ebremar there is no leave taking i go no more safe on the breast of vallence is thy head unhappy one    mosada go not go not go not for night comes fast look down on me my love and see how thick the dew lies on my face i never knew a night so dewbedrowned    ebremar oh hush the wandering music of thy mind look on me once why sink your eyelids so why do you hang so heavy in my arms love will you die when we have met one look give to thy vallence    mosada                 vallencehe has gone from here along the shadowy way that winds companioning the rivers pilgrim torch ill see him longer if i stand out here upon the mountains brow  she tries to stand and totters ebremar supports her and she stands pointing down as if into a visionary valley                                    yonder he treads the path oermuffled with the leavesdead leaves like happy thoughts grown sad in evil days he fades among the mists how fast they come and pour upon the world ah well a day poor love and sorrow with their arms thrown round each others necks and whispering as they go still wander through the world hes gone hes gone im wearyweary and tis very cold ill draw my cloak around me it is cold i never knew a night so bitter cold  dies    ebremar mosada oh mosada  enter monks and inquisitors    first inquisitor my lord you called    ebremar              not i this maid is dead    first monk from
