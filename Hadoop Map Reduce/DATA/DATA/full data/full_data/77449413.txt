a great bustle in the castle of bayeux in normandy  the hall was large and low the roof arched and supported on thick short columns almost like the crypt of a cathedral the walls were thick and the windows which had no glass were very small set in such a depth of wall that there was a wide deep window seat upon which the rain might beat without reaching the interior of the room  and even if it had come in there was nothing for it to hurt for the walls were of rough stone and the floor of tiles  there was a fire at each end of this great dark apartment but there were no chimneys over the ample hearths and the smoke curled about in thick white folds in the vaulted roof adding to the wreaths of soot which made the hall look still darker  the fire at the lower end was by far the largest and hottest  great black cauldrons hung over it and servants both men and women with red faces bare and grimed arms and long iron hooks or pots and pans were busied around it  at the other end which was raised about three steps above the floor of the hall other servants were engaged  two young maidens were strewing fresh rushes on the floor some men were setting up a long table of rough boards supported on trestles and then ranging upon it silver cups drinking horns and wooden trenchers  benches were placed to receive most of the guests but in the middle at the place of honour was a high chair with very thick crossing legs and the arms curiously carved with lions faces and claws a clumsy wooden footstool was set in front and the silver drinkingcup on the table was of far more beautiful workmanship than the others richly chased with vine leaves and grapes and figures of little boys with goats legs  if that cup could have told its story it would have been a strange one for it had been made long since in the old roman times and been carried off from italy by some northman pirate  from one of these scenes of activity to the other there moved a stately old lady her long thick light hair hardly touched with grey was bound round her head under a tall white cap with a band passing under her chin she wore a long sweeping dark robe with wide hanging sleeves and thick gold earrings and necklace which had possibly come from the same quarter as the cup  she directed the servants inspected both the cookery and arrangements of the table held council with an old steward now and then looked rather anxiously from the window as if expecting some one and began to say something about fears that these loitering youths would not bring home the venison in time for duke williams supper  presently she looked up rejoiced for a few notes of a buglehorn were sounded there was a clattering of feet and in a few moments there bounded into the hall a boy of about eight years old his cheeks and large blue eyes bright with air and exercise and his long lightbrown hair streaming behind him as he ran forward flourishing a bow in his hand and crying out i hit him i hit him  dame astrida do you hear tis a stag of ten branches and i hit him in the neck  you my lord richard you killed him  oh no i only struck him  it was osmonds shaft that took him in the eye andlook you fru astrida he came thus through the wood and i stood here it might be under the great elm with my bow thusand richard was beginning to act over again the whole scene of the deerhunt but fru that is to say lady astrida was too busy to listen and broke in with have they brought home the haunch  yes walter is bringing it  i had a long arrow                     picture richard with dame estrida  a stout forester was at this instant seen bringing in the venison and dame astrida hastened to meet it and gave directions little richard following her all the way and talking as eagerly as if she was attending to him showing how he shot how osmond shot how the deer bounded and how it fell and then counting the branches of its antlers always ending with this is something to tell my father  do you think he will come soon  in the meantime two men entered the hall one about fifty the other one or twoandtwenty both in hunting dresses of plain leather crossed by broad embroidered belts supporting a knife and a buglehorn  the elder was broadshouldered sunburnt ruddy and rather sternlooking the younger who was also the taller was slightly made and very active with a bright keen grey eye and merry smile  these were dame astridas son sir eric de centeville and her grandson osmond and to their care duke william of normandy had committed his only child richard to be fostered or brought up 1  it was always the custom among the northmen that young princes should thus be put under the care of some trusty vassal instead of being brought up at home and one reason why the centevilles had been chosen by duke william was that both sir eric and his mother spoke only the old norwegian tongue which he wished young richard to understand well whereas in other parts of the duchy the normans had forgotten their own tongue and had taken up what was then called the languedoui a language between german and latin which was the beginning of french  on this day duke william himself was expected at bayeux to pay a visit to his son before setting out on a journey to settle the disputes between the counts of flanders and montreuil and this was the reason of fru astridas great preparations  no sooner had she seen the haunch placed upon a spit which a little boy was to turn before the fire than she turned to dress something else namely the young prince richard himself whom she led off to one of the upper rooms and there he had full time to talk while she great lady though she was herself combed smooth his long flowing curls and fastened his short scarlet cloth tunic which just reached to his knee leaving his neck arms and legs bare  he begged hard to be allowed to wear a short beautifully ornamented dagger at his belt but this fru astrida would not allow  you will have enough to do with steel and dagger before your life is at an end said she without seeking to begin over soon  to be sure i shall answered richard  i will be called richard of the sharp axe or the bold spirit i promise you fru astrida  we are as brave in these days as the sigurds and ragnars you sing of  i only wish there were serpents and dragons to slay here in normandy  never fear but you will find even too many of them said dame astrida there be dragons of wrong here and everywhere quite as venomous as any in my sagas  i fear them not said richard but half understanding her if you would only let me have the dagger  but hark hark he darted to the window  they come they come  there is the banner of normandy  away ran the happy child and never rested till he stood at the bottom of the long steep stone stair leading to the embattled porch  thither came the baron de centeville and his son to receive their prince richard looked up at osmond saying let me hold his stirrup and then sprang up and shouted for joy as under the arched gateway there came a tall black horse bearing the stately form of the duke of normandy  his purple robe was fastened round him by a rich belt sustaining the mighty weapon from which he was called william of the long sword his legs and feet were cased in linked steel chainwork his gilded spurs were on his heels and his short brown hair was covered by his ducal cap of purple turned up with fur and a feather fastened in by a jewelled clasp  his brow was grave and thoughtful and there was something both of dignity and sorrow in his face at the first moment of looking at it recalling the recollection that he had early lost his young wife the duchess emma and that he was beset by many cares and toils but the next glance generally conveyed encouragement so full of mildness were his eyes and so kind the expression of his lips  and now how bright a smile beamed upon the little richard who for the first time paid him the duty of a pupil in chivalry by holding the stirrup while he sprung from his horse  next richard knelt to receive his blessing which was always the custom when children met their parents  the duke laid his hand on his head saying god of his mercy bless thee my son and lifting him in his arms held him to his breast and let him cling to his neck and kiss him again and again before setting him down while sir eric came forward bent his knee kissed the hand of his prince and welcomed him to his castle  it would take too long to tell all the friendly and courteous words that were spoken the greeting of the duke and the noble old lady astrida and the reception of the barons who had come in the train of their lord richard was bidden to greet them but though he held out his hand as desired he shrank a little to his fathers side gazing at them in dread and shyness  there was count bernard of harcourt called the dane 2 with his shaggy red hair and beard to which a touch of grey had given a strange unnatural tint his eyes looking fierce and wild under his thick eyebrows one of them misshapen in consequence of a sword cut which had left a broad red and purple scar across both cheek and forehead  there too came tall baron rainulf of ferrieres cased in a linked steel hauberk that rang as he walked and the menatarms with helmets and shields looking as if sir erics armour that hung in the hail had come to life and was walking about  they sat down to fru astridas banquet the old lady at the dukes right hand and the count of harcourt on his left osmond carved for the duke and richard handed his cup and trencher  all through the meal the duke and his lords talked earnestly of the expedition on which they were bound to meet count arnulf of flanders on a little islet in the river somme there to come to some agreement by which arnulf might make restitution to count herluin of montreuil for certain wrongs which he had done him  some said that this would be the fittest time for requiring arnulf to yield up some towns on his borders to which normandy had long laid claim but the duke shook his head saying that he must seek no selfish advantage when called to judge between others  richard was rather tired of their grave talk and thought the supper very long but at last it was over the grace was said the boards which had served for tables were removed and as it was still light some of the guests went to see how their steeds had been bestowed others to look at sir erics horses and hounds and others collected together in groups  the duke had time to attend to his little boy and richard sat upon his knee and talked told about all his pleasures how his arrow had hit the deer today how sir eric let him ride out to the chase on his little pony how osmond would take him to bathe in the cool bright river and how he had watched the ravens nest in the top of the old tower  duke william listened and smiled and seemed as well pleased to hear as the boy was to tell  and richard said he at last have you nought to tell me of father lucas and his great book  what not a word  look up richard and tell me how it goes with the learning 3  oh father said richard in a low voice playing with the clasp of his fathers belt and looking down i dont like those crabbed letters on the old yellow parchment  but you try to learn them i hope said the duke  yes father i do but they are very hard and the words are so long and father lucas will always come when the sun is so bright and the wood so green that i know not how to bear to be kept poring over those black hooks and strokes  poor little fellow said duke william smiling and richard rather encouraged went on more boldly  you do not know this reading noble father  to my sorrow no said the duke  and sir eric cannot read nor osmond nor any one and why must i read and cramp my fingers with writing just as if i was a clerk instead of a young duke  richard looked up in his fathers face and then hung his head as if halfashamed of questioning his will but the duke answered him without displeasure  it is hard no doubt my boy to you now but it will be the better for you in the end  i would give much to be able myself to read those holy books which i must now only hear read to me by a clerk but since i have had the wish i have had no time to learn as you have now  but knights and nobles never learn said richard  and do you think it a reason they never should  but you are wrong my boy for the kings of france and england the counts of anjou of provence and paris yes even king hako of norway 4 can all read  i tell you richard when the treaty was drawn up for restoring this king louis to his throne i was ashamed to find myself one of the few crown vassals who could not write his name thereto  but none is so wise or so good as you father said richard proudly sir eric often says so  sir eric loves his duke too well to see his faults said duke william but far better and wiser might i have been had i been taught by such masters as you may be  and hark richard not only can all princes here read but in england king ethelstane would have every noble taught they study in his own palace with his brothers and read the good words that king alfred the truthteller put into their own tongue for them  i hate the english said richard raising his head and looking very fierce  hate them and wherefore  because they traitorously killed the brave sea king ragnar  fru astrida sings his deathsong which he chanted when the vipers were gnawing him to death and he gloried to think how his sons would bring the ravens to feast upon the saxon  oh had i been his son how i would have carried on the feud  how i would have laughed when i cut down the false traitors and burnt their palaces  richards eye kindled and his words as he spoke the old norse language flowed into the sort of wild verse in which the sagas or legendary songs were composed and which perhaps he was unconsciously repeating  duke william looked grave  fru astrida must sing you no more such sagas said he if they fill your mind with these revengeful thoughts fit only for the worshippers of odin and thor  neither ragnar nor his sons knew better than to rejoice in this deadly vengeance but we who are christians know that it is for us to forgive  the english had slain their father said richard looking up with wondering dissatisfied eyes  yes richard and i speak not against them for they were even as we should have been had not king harold the fairhaired driven your grandfather from denmark  they had not been taught the truth but to us it has been said forgive and ye shall be forgiven  listen to me my son christian as is this nation of ours this duty of forgiveness is too often neglected but let it not be so with you  bear in mind whenever you see the cross 5 marked on our banner or carved in stone on the churches that it speaks of forgiveness to us but of that pardon we shall never taste if we forgive not our enemies  do you mark me boy  richard hesitated a little and then said yes father but i could never have pardoned had i been one of ragnars sons  it may be that you will be in their case richard said the duke and should i fall as it may well be i shall in some of the contests that tear to pieces this unhappy kingdom of france then remember what i say now  i charge you on your duty to god and to your father that you keep up no feud no hatred but rather that you should deem me best revenged when you have with heart and hand given the fullest proof of forgiveness to your enemy  give me your word that you will  yes father said richard with rather a subdued tone and resting his head on his fathers shoulder  there was a silence for a little space during which he began to revive into playfulness to stroke the dukes short curled beard and play with his embroidered collar  in so doing his fingers caught hold of a silver chain and pulling it out with a jerk he saw a silver key attached to it  oh what is that he asked eagerly  what does that key unlock  my greatest treasure replied duke william as he replaced the chain and key within his robe  your greatest treasure father  is that your coronet  you will know one day said his father putting the little hand down from its too busy investigations and some of the barons at that moment returning into the hall he had no more leisure to bestow on his little son  the next day after morning service in the chapel and breakfast in the hall the duke again set forward on his journey giving richard hopes he might return in a fortnights time and obtaining from him a promise that he would be very attentive to father lucas and very obedient to sir eric de centeville     chapter ii   one evening fru astrida sat in her tall chair in the chimney corner her distaff with its load of flax in her hand while she twisted and drew out the thread and her spindle danced on the floor  opposite to her sat sleeping in his chair sir eric de centeville osmond was on a low bench within the chimney corner trimming and shaping with his knife some feathers of the wild goose which were to fly in a different fashion from their former one and serve not to wing the flight of a harmless goose but of a sharp arrow  the men of the household sat ranged on benches on one side of the hall the women on the other a great red fire together with an immense flickering lamp which hung from the ceiling supplied the light the windows were closed with wooden shutters and the whole apartment had a cheerful appearance  two or three large hounds were reposing in front of the hearth and among them sat little richard of normandy now smoothing down their broad silken ears now tickling the large cushions of their feet with the end of one of osmonds feathers now fairly pulling open the eyes of one of the goodnatured sleepy creatures which only stretched its legs and remonstrated with a sort of low groan rather than a growl  the boys eyes were all the time intently fixed on dame astrida as if he would not lose one word of the story she was telling him how earl rollo his grandfather had sailed into the mouth of the seine and how archbishop franco of rouen had come to meet him and brought him the keys of the town and how not one neustrian of rouen had met with harm from the brave northmen  then she told him of his grandfathers baptism and how during the seven days that he wore his white baptismal robes he had made large gifts to all the chief churches in his dukedom of normandy  oh but tell of the paying homage said richard and how sigurd bloodaxe threw down simple king charles  ah how would i have laughed to see it  nay nay lord richard said the old lady i love not that tale  that was ere the norman learnt courtesy and rudeness ought rather to be forgotten than remembered save for the sake of amending it  no i will rather tell you of our coming to centeville and how dreary i thought these smooth meads and broad soft gliding streams compared with mine own fathers fiord in norway shut in with the tall black rocks and dark pines above them and far away the snowy mountains rising into the sky ah how blue the waters were in the long summer days when i sat in my fathers boat in the little fiord and  dame astrida was interrupted  a bugle note rang out at the castle gate the dogs started to their feet and uttered a sudden deafening bark osmond sprung up exclaiming hark and trying to silence the hounds and richard running to sir eric cried wake wake sir eric my father is come  oh haste to open the gate and admit him  peace dogs said sir eric slowly rising as the blast of the horn was repeated  go osmond with the porter and see whether he who comes at such an hour be friend or foe  stay you here my lord he added as richard was running after osmond and the little boy obeyed and stood still though quivering all over with impatience  tidings from the duke i should guess said fru astrida  it can scarce be himself at such an hour  oh it must be dear fru astrida said richard  he said he would come again  hark there are horses feet in the court  i am sure that is his black chargers tread  and i shall not be there to hold his stirrup oh  sir eric let me go  sir eric always a man of few words only shook his head and at that moment steps were heard on the stone stairs  again richard was about to spring forward when osmond returned his face showing at a glance that something was amiss but all that he said was count bernard of harcourt and sir rainulf de ferrieres and he stood aside to let them pass  richard stood still in the midst of the hall disappointed  without greeting to sir eric or to any within the hall the count of harcourt came forward to richard bent his knee before him took his hand and said with a broken voice and heaving breast richard duke of normandy i am thy liegeman and true vassal then rising from his knees while rainulf de ferrieres went through the same form the old man covered his face with his hands and wept aloud  is it even so said the baron de centeville and being answered by a mournful look and sigh from ferrieres he too bent before the boy and repeated the words i am thy liegeman and true vassal and swear fealty to thee for my castle and barony of centeville  oh no no cried richard drawing back his hand in a sort of agony feeling as if he was in a frightful dream from which he could not awake what means it  oh  fru astrida tell me what means it  where is my father                      picture the oath of the vassals  alas my child said the old lady putting her arm round him and drawing him close to her whilst her tears flowed fast and richard stood reassured by her embrace listening with eyes open wide and deep oppressed breathing to what was passing between the four nobles who spoke earnestly among themselves without much heed of him  the duke dead repeated sir eric de centeville like one stunned and stupefied  even so said rainulf slowly and sadly and the silence was only broken by the longdrawn sobs of old count bernard  but how when where broke forth sir eric presently  there was no note of battle when you went forth  oh why was not i at his side  he fell not in battle gloomily replied sir rainulf  ha could sickness cut him down so quickly  it was not sickness answered ferrieres  it was treachery  he fell in the isle of pecquigny by the hand of the false fleming  lives the traitor yet cried the baron de centeville grasping his good sword  he lives and rejoices in his crime said ferrieres safe in his own merchant towns  i can scarce credit you my lords said sir eric  our duke slain and his enemy safe and you here to tell the tale  i would i were stark and stiff by my lords side said count bernard but for the sake of normandy and of that poor child who is like to need all that ever were friends to his house  i would that mine eyes had been blinded for ever ere they had seen that sight  and not a sword lifted in his defence  tell you how it passed rainulf  my tongue will not speak it  he threw himself on a bench and covered his face with his mantle while rainulf de ferrieres proceeded you know how in an evil hour our good duke appointed to meet this caitiff count of flanders in the isle of pecquigny the duke and count each bringing twelve men with them all unarmed  duke alan of brittany was one on our side count bernard here another old count bothon and myself we bore no weaponwould that we hadbut not so the false flemings  ah me  i shall never forget duke williams lordly presence when he stepped ashore and doffed his bonnet to the knave arnulf  yes interposed bernard  and marked you not the words of the traitor as they met  my lord quoth he you are my shield and defence 6 would that i could cleave his treasonhatching skull with my battleaxe  so continued rainulf they conferred together and as words cost nothing to arnulf he not only promised all restitution to the paltry montreuil but even was for offering to pay homage to our duke for flanders itself but this our william refused saying it were foul wrong to both king louis of france and kaiser otho of germany to take from them their vassal  they took leave of each other in all courtesy and we embarked again  it was duke williams pleasure to go alone in a small boat while we twelve were together in another  just as we had nearly reached our own bank there was a shout from the flemings that their count had somewhat further to say to the duke and forbidding us to follow him the duke turned his boat and went back again  no sooner had he set foot on the isle proceeded the norman clenching his hands and speaking between his teeth than we saw one fleming strike him on the head with an oar he fell senseless the rest threw themselves upon him and the next moment held up their bloody daggers in scorn at us  you may well think how we shouted and yelled at them and plied our oars like men distracted but all in vain they were already in their boats and ere we could even reach the isle they were on the other side of the river mounted their horses fled with coward speed and were out of reach of a normans vengeance  but they shall not be so long cried richard starting forward for to his childish fancy this dreadful history was more like one of dame astridas legends than a reality and at the moment his thought was only of the blackness of the treason  oh that i were a man to chastise them  one day they shall feel  he broke off short for he remembered how his father had forbidden his denunciations of vengeance but his words were eagerly caught up by the barons who as duke william had said were far from possessing any temper of forgiveness thought revenge a duty and were only glad to see a warlike spirit in their new prince  ha say you so my young lord exclaimed old count bernard rising yes and i see a sparkle in your eye that tells me you will one day avenge him nobly  richard drew up his head and his heart throbbed high as sir eric made answer ay truly that will he  you might search normandy through yea and norway likewise ere you would find a temper more bold and free trust my word count bernard our young duke will be famed as widely as ever were his forefathers  i believe it well said bernard  he hath the port of his grandfather duke rollo and much too of his noble father  how say you lord richard will you be a valiant leader of the norman race against our foes  that i will said richard carried away by the applause excited by those few words of his  i will ride at your head this very night if you will but go to chastise the false flemings  you shall ride with us tomorrow my lord answered bernard but it must be to rouen there to be invested with your ducal sword and mantle and to receive the homage of your vassals  richard drooped his head without replying for this seemed to bring to him the perception that his father was really gone and that he should never see him again  he thought of all his projects for the day of his return how he had almost counted the hours and had looked forward to telling him that father lucas was well pleased with him  and now he should never nestle into his breast again never hear his voice never see those kind eyes beam upon him  large tears gathered in his eyes and ashamed that they should be seen he sat down on a footstool at fru astridas feet leant his forehead on his hands and thought over all that his father had done and said the last time they were together  he fancied the return that had been promised going over the meeting and the greeting till he had almost persuaded himself that this dreadful story was but a dream  but when he looked up there were the barons with their grave mournful faces speaking of the corpse which duke alan of brittany was escorting to rouen there to be buried beside the old duke rollo and the duchess emma richards mother  then he lost himself in wonder how that stiff bleeding body could be the same as the father whose arm was so lately around him and whether his fathers spirit knew how he was thinking of him and in these dreamy thoughts the young orphan duke of normandy forgotten by his vassals in their grave councils fell asleep and scarce wakened enough to attend to his prayers when fru astrida at length remembered him and led him away to bed  when richard awoke the next morning he could hardly believe that all that had passed in the evening was true but soon he found that it was but too real and all was prepared for him to go to rouen with the vassals indeed it was for no other purpose than to fetch him that the count of harcourt had come to bayeux  fru astrida was quite unhappy that the child as she called him should go alone with the warriors but sir eric laughed at her and said that it would never do for the duke of normandy to bring his nurse with him in his first entry into rouen and she must be content to follow at some space behind under the escort of walter the huntsman  so she took leave of richard charging both sir eric and osmond to have the utmost care of him and shedding tears as if the parting was to be for a much longer space then he bade farewell to the servants of the castle received the blessing of father lucas and mounting his pony rode off between sir eric and count bernard  richard was but a little boy and he did not think so much of his loss as he rode along in the free morning air feeling himself a prince at the head of his vassals his banner displayed before him and the people coming out wherever he passed to gaze on him and call for blessings on his name  rainulf de ferrieres carried a large heavy purse filled with silver and gold and whenever they came to these gazing crowds richard was well pleased to thrust his hands deep into it and scatter handfuls of coins among the gazers especially where he saw little children  they stopped to dine and rest in the middle of the day at the castle of a baron who as soon as the meal was over mounted his horse and joined them in their ride to rouen  so far it had not been very different from richards last journey when he went to keep christmas there with his father but now they were beginning to come nearer the town he knew the broad river seine again and saw the square tower of the cathedral and he remembered how at that very place his father had met him and how he had ridden by his side into the town and had been led by his hand up to the hall  his heart was very heavy as he recollected there was no one now to meet and welcome him scarcely any one to whom he could even tell his thoughts for those tall grave barons had nothing to say to such a little boy and the very respect and formality with which they treated him made him shrink from them still more especially from the grimfaced bernard and osmond his own friend and playfellow was obliged to ride far behind as inferior in rank  they entered the town just as it was growing dark  count bernard looked back and arrayed the procession eric de centeville bade richard sit upright and not look weary and then all the knights held back while the little duke rode alone a little in advance of them through the gateway there was a loud shout of long live the little duke and crowds of people were standing round to gaze upon his entry so many that the bag of coins was soon emptied by his largesses  the whole city was like one great castle shut in by a wall and moat and with rollos tower rising at one end like the keep of a castle and it was thither that richard was turning his horse when the count of harcourt said nay my lord to the church of our lady 7  it was then considered a duty to be paid to the deceased that their relatives and friends should visit them as they lay in state and sprinkle them with drops of holy water and richard was now to pay this token of respect  he trembled a little and yet it did not seem quite so dreary since he should once more look on his fathers face and he accordingly rode towards the cathedral  it was then very unlike what it is now the walls were very thick the windows small and almost buried in heavy carved arches the columns within were low clumsy and circular and it was usually so dark that the vaulting of the roof could scarcely be seen  now however a whole flood of light poured forth from every window and when richard came to the door he saw not only the two tall thick candles that always burnt on each side of the altar but in the chancel stood a double row ranged in a square shedding a pure quiet brilliancy throughout the building and chiefly on the silver and gold ornaments of the altar  outside these lights knelt a row of priests in dark garments their heads bowed over their clasped hands and their chanted psalms sounding sweet and full of soothing music  within that guarded space was a bier and a form lay on it  richard trembled still more with awe and would have paused but he was obliged to proceed  he dipped his hand in the water of the font crossed his brow and came slowly on sprinkled the remaining drops on the lifeless figure and then stood still  there was an oppression on his breast as if he could neither breathe nor move  there lay william of the long sword like a good and true christian warrior arrayed in his shining armour his sword by his side his shield on his arm and a cross between his hands clasped upon his breast  his ducal mantle of crimson velvet lined with ermine was round his shoulders and instead of a helmet his coronet was on his head but in contrast with this rich array over the collar of the hauberk was folded the edge of a rough hair shirt which the duke had worn beneath his robes unknown to all until his corpse was disrobed of his bloodstained garments  his face looked full of calm solemn peace as if he had gently fallen asleep and was only awaiting the great call to awaken there was not a single token of violence visible about him save that one side of his forehead bore a deep purple mark where he had first been struck by the blow of the oar which had deprived him of sense  see you that my lord said count bernard first breaking the silence in a low deep stern voice  richard had heard little for many hours past save counsels against the flemings and plans of bitter enmity against them and the sight of his murdered father with that look and tone of the old dane fired his spirit and breaking from his trance of silent awe and grief he exclaimed i see it and dearly shall the traitor fleming abye it then encouraged by the applauding looks of the nobles he proceeded feeling like one of the young champions of fru astridas songs  his cheek was coloured his eye lighted up and he lifted his head so that the hair fell back from his forehead he laid his hand on the hilt of his fathers sword and spoke on in words perhaps suggested by some sage yes arnulf of flanders know that duke william of normandy shall not rest unavenged  on this good sword i vow that as soon as my arm shall have strength  the rest was left unspoken for a hand was laid on his arm  a priest who had hitherto been kneeling near the head of the corpse had risen and stood tall and dark over him and looking up he recognized the pale grave countenance of martin abbot of jumieges his fathers chief friend and councillor  richard of normandy what sayest thou said he sternly  yes hang thy head and reply not rather than repeat those words  dost thou come here to disturb the peace of the dead with clamours for vengeance  dost thou vow strife and anger on that sword which was never drawn save in the cause of the poor and distressed  wouldst thou rob him to whose service thy life has been pledged and devote thyself to that of his foe is this what thou hast learnt from thy blessed father  richard made no answer but he covered his face with his hands to hide the tears which were fast streaming  lord abbot lord abbot this passes exclaimed bernard the dane  our young lord is no monk and we will not see each spark of noble and knightly spirit quenched as soon as it shows itself  count of harcourt said abbot martin are these the words of a savage pagan or of one who has been washed in yonder blessed font  never while i have power shalt thou darken the childs soul with thy foul thirst of revenge insult the presence of thy master with the crime he so abhorred nor the temple of him who came to pardon with thy hatred well do i know ye barons of normandy that each drop of your blood would willingly be given could it bring back our departed duke or guard his orphan child but if ye have loved the father do his biddinglay aside that accursed spirit of hatred and vengeance if ye love the child seek not to injure his soul more deeply than even his bitterest foe were it arnulf himself hath power to hurt him  the barons were silenced whatever their thoughts might be and abbot martin turned to richard whose tears were still dropping fast through his fingers as the thought of those last words of his father returned more clearly upon him  the abbot laid his hand on his head and spoke gently to him  these are tears of a softened heart i trust said he i well believe that thou didst scarce know what thou wert saying  forgive me said richard as well as he could speak  see there said the priest pointing to the large cross over the altar thou knowest the meaning of that sacred sign  richard bowed his head in assent and reverence  it speaks of forgiveness continued the abbot  and knowest thou who gave that pardon  the son forgave his murderers the father them who slew his son  and shalt thou call for vengeance  but oh said richard looking up must that cruel murderous traitor glory unpunished in his crime while there lies and again his voice was cut off by tears  vengeance shall surely overtake the sinner said martin the vengeance of the lord and in his own good time but it must not be of thy seeking nay richard thou art of all men the most bound to show love and mercy to arnulf of flanders  yes when the hand of the lord hath touched him and bowed him down in punishment for his crime it is then that thou whom he hath most deeply injured shouldst stretch out thine hand to aid him and receive him with pardon and peace  if thou dost vow aught on the sword of thy blessed father in the sanctuary of thy redeemer let it be a christian vow  richard wept too bitterly to speak and bernard de harcourt taking his hand led him away from the church     chapter iii   duke william of the long sword was buried the next morning in high pomp and state with many a prayer and psalm chanted over his grave  when this was over little richard who had all the time stood or knelt nearest the corpse in one dull heavy dream of wonder and sorrow was led back to the palace and there his long heavy black garments were taken off and he was dressed in his short scarlet tunic his hair was carefully arranged and then he came down again into the hall where there was a great assembly of barons some in armour some in long furred gowns who had all been attending his fathers burial  richard as he was desired by sir eric de centeville took off his cap and bowed low in reply to the reverences with which they all greeted his entrance and he then slowly crossed the hall and descended the steps from the door while they formed into a procession behind him according to their ranksthe duke of brittany first and then all the rest down to the poorest knight who held his manor immediately from the duke of normandy  thus they proceeded in slow and solemn order till they came to the church of our lady  the clergy were there already ranged in ranks on each side of the choir and the bishops in their mitres and rich robes each with his pastoral staff in his hand were standing round the altar as the little duke entered there arose from all the voices in the chancel the full loud clear chant of te deum laudamus echoing among the dark vaults of the roof  to that sound richard walked up the choir to a large heavy crossedlegged carved chair raised on two steps just before the steps of the altar began and there he stood bernard de harcourt and eric de centeville on each side of him and all his other vassals in due order in the choir  after the beautiful chant of the hymn was ended the service for the holy communion began  when the time came for the offering each noble gave gold or silver and lastly rainulf of ferrieres came up to the step of the altar with a cushion on which was placed a circlet of gold the ducal coronet and another baron following him closely carried a long heavy sword with a cross handle  the archbishop of rouen received both coronet and sword and laid them on the altar  then the service proceeded  at that time the rite of confirmation was administered in infancy and richard who had been confirmed by his godfather the archbishop of rouen immediately after his baptism knelt in solemn awe to receive the other holy sacrament from his hands as soon as all the clergy had communicated 8  when the administration was over richard was led forward to the step of the altar by count bernard and sir eric and the archbishop laying one hand upon both his as he held them clasped together demanded of him in the name of god and of the people of normandy whether he would be their good and true ruler guard them from their foes maintain truth punish iniquity and protect the church  i will answered richards young trembling voice so help me god and he knelt and kissed the book of the holy gospels which the archbishop offered him  it was a great and awful oath and he dreaded to think that he had taken it  he still knelt put both hands over his face and whispered o god my father help me to keep it  the archbishop waited till he rose and then turning him with his face to the people said richard by the grace of god i invest thee with the ducal mantle of normandy  two of the bishops then hung round his shoulders a crimson velvet mantle furred with ermine which made as it was for a grown man hung heavily on the poor childs shoulders and lay in heaps on the ground  the archbishop then set the golden coronet on his long flowing hair where it hung so loosely on the little head that sir eric was obliged to put his hand to it to hold it safe and lastly the long straight twohanded sword was brought and placed in his hand with another solemn bidding to use it ever in maintaining the right  it should have been girded to his side but the great sword was so much taller than the little duke that as it stood upright by him he was obliged to raise his arm to put it round the handle  he then had to return to his throne which was not done without some difficulty encumbered as he was but osmond held up the train of his mantle sir eric kept the coronet on his head and he himself held fast and lovingly the sword though the count of harcourt offered to carry it for him  he was lifted up to his throne and then came the paying him homage alan duke of brittany was the first to kneel before him and with his hand between those of the duke he swore to be his man to obey him and pay him feudal service for his dukedom of brittany  in return richard swore to be his good lord and to protect him from all his foes then followed bernard the dane and many another each repeating the same formulary as their large rugged hands were clasped within those little soft fingers  many a kind and loving eye was bent in compassion on the orphan child many a strong voice faltered with earnestness as it pronounced the vow and many a brave stalwart heart heaved with grief for the murdered father and tears flowed down the warworn cheeks which had met the fiercest storms of the northern ocean as they bent before the young fatherless boy whom they loved for the sake of his conquering grandfather and his brave and pious father  few normans were there whose hearts did not glow at the touch of those small hands with a love almost of a parent for their young duke  the ceremony of receiving homage lasted long and richard though interested and touched at first grew very weary the crown and mantle were so heavy the faces succeeded each other like figures in an endless dream and the constant repetition of the same words was very tedious he grew sleepy he longed to jump up to lean to the right or left or to speak something besides that regular form  he gave one great yawn but it brought him such a frown from the stern face of bernard as quite to wake him for a few minutes and make him sit upright and receive the next vassal with as much attention as he had shown the first but he looked imploringly at sir eric as if to ask if it ever would be over at last far down among the barons came one at whose sight richard revived a little  it was a boy only a few years older than himself perhaps about ten with a pleasant brown face black hair and quick black eyes which glanced with a look between friendliness and respect up into the little dukes gazing face  richard listened eagerly for his name and was refreshed at the sound of the boyish voice which pronounced i alberic de montemar am thy liegeman and vassal for my castle and barony of montemar sur epte  when alberic moved away richard followed him with his eye as far as he could to his place in the cathedral and was taken by surprise when he found the next baron kneeling before him  the ceremony of homage came to an end at last and richard would fain have run all the way to the palace to shake off his weariness but he was obliged to head the procession again and even when he reached the castle hall his toils were not over for there was a great state banquet spread out and he had to sit in the high chair where he remembered climbing on his fathers knee last christmasday all the time that the barons feasted round and held grave converse  richards best comfort all this time was in watching osmond de centeville and alberic de montemar who with the other youths who were not yet knighted were waiting on those who sat at the table  at last he grew so very weary that he fell fast asleep in the corner of his chair and did not wake till he was startled by the rough voice of bernard de harcourt calling him to rouse up and bid the duke of brittany farewell  poor child said duke alan as richard rose up startled he is overwearied with this days work  take care of him count bernard thou a kindly nurse but a rough one for such a babe  ha my young lord your colour mantles at being called a babe  i crave your pardon for you are a fine spirit  and hark you lord richard of normandy i have little cause to love your race and little right i trow had king charles the simple to call us free bretons liegemen to a race of plundering northern pirates  to duke rollos might my father never gave his homage nay nor did i yield it for all duke williams long sword but i did pay it to his generosity and forbearance and now i grant it to thy weakness and to his noble memory  i doubt not that the recreant frank louis whom he restored to his throne will strive to profit by thy youth and helplessness and should that be remember that thou hast no surer friend than alan of brittany  fare thee well my young duke  farewell sir said richard willingly giving his hand to be shaken by his kind vassal and watching him as sir eric attended him from the hall  fair words but i trust not the breton muttered bernard hatred is deeply ingrained in them  he should know what the frank king is made of said rainulf de ferrieres he was bred up with him in the days that they were both exiles at the court of king ethelstane of england  ay and thanks to duke william that either louis or alan are not exiles still  now we shall see whose gratitude is worth most the franks or the bretons  i suspect the norman valour will be the best to trust to  yes and how will norman valour prosper without treasure  who knows what gold is in the dukes coffers  there was some consultation here in a low voice and the next thing richard heard distinctly was that one of the nobles held up a silver chain and key 9 saying that they had been found on the dukes neck and that he had kept them thinking that they doubtless led to something of importance  oh yes said richard eagerly i know it  he told me it was the key to his greatest treasure  the normans heard this with great interest and it was resolved that several of the most trusted persons among whom were the archbishop of rouen abbot martin of jumieges and the count of harcourt should go immediately in search of this precious hoard  richard accompanied them up the narrow rough stone stairs to the large dark apartment where his father had slept  though a princes chamber it had little furniture a low uncurtained bed a cross on a ledge near its head a rude table a few chairs and two large chests were all it contained  harcourt tried the lid of one of the chests it opened and proved to be full of wearing apparel he went to the other which was smaller much more carved and ornamented with very handsome ironwork  it was locked and putting in the key it fitted the lock turned and the chest was opened  the normans pressed eagerly to see their dukes greatest treasure  it was a robe of serge and a pair of sandals such as were worn in the abbey of jumieges  ha is this all  what didst say child cried bernard the dane hastily  he told me it was his greatest treasure repeated richard  and it was said abbot martin  then the good abbot told them the history part of which was already known to some of them  about five or six years before duke william had been hunting in the forest of jumieges when he had suddenly come on the ruins of the abbey which had been wasted thirty or forty years previously by the seaking hasting  two old monks of the original brotherhood still survived and came forth to greet the duke and offer him their hospitality  ay said bernard well do i remember their bread we asked if it was made of firbark like that of our brethren of norway  william then an eager thoughtless young man turned with disgust from this wretched fare and throwing the old men some gold galloped on to enjoy his hunting  in the course of the sport he was left alone and encountered a wild boar which threw him down trampled on him and left him stretched senseless on the ground severely injured  his companions coming up carried him as the nearest place of shelter to the ruins of jumieges where the two old monks gladly received him in the remaining portion of their house  as soon as he recovered his senses he earnestly asked their pardon for his pride and the scorn he had shown to the poverty and patient suffering which he should have reverenced  william had always been a man who chose the good and refused the evil but this accident and the long illness that followed it made him far more thoughtful and serious than he had ever been before he made preparing for death and eternity his first object and thought less of his worldly affairs his wars and his ducal state  he rebuilt the old abbey endowed it richly and sent for martin himself from france to become the abbot he delighted in nothing so much as praying there conversing with the abbot and hearing him read holy books and he felt his temporal affairs and the state and splendour of his rank so great a temptation that he had one day come to the abbot and entreated to be allowed to lay them aside and become a brother of the order  but martin had refused to receive his vows  he had told him that he had no right to neglect or forsake the duties of the station which god had appointed him that it would be a sin to leave the post which had been given him to defend and that the way marked out for him to serve god was by doing justice among his people and using his power to defend the right  not till he had done his allotted work and his son was old enough to take his place as ruler of the normans might he cease from his active duties quit the turmoil of the world and seek the repose of the cloister  it was in this hope of peaceful retirement that william had delighted to treasure up the humble garments that he hoped one day to wear in peace and holiness  and oh my noble duke exclaimed abbot martin bursting into tears as he finished his narration the lord hath been very gracious unto thee he has taken thee home to thy rest long before thou didst dare to hope for it  slowly and with subdued feelings the norman barons left the chamber richard whom they seemed to have almost forgotten wandered to the stairs to find his way to the room where he had slept last night  he had not made many steps before he heard osmonds voice say here my lord he looked up saw a white cap at a doorway a little above him he bounded up and flew into dame astridas outstretched arms  how glad he was to sit in her lap and lay his wearied head on her bosom while with a wornout voice he exclaimed oh fru astrida  i am very very tired of being duke of normandy     chapter iv   richard of normandy was very anxious to know more of the little boy whom he had seen among his vassals  ah the young baron de montemar said sir eric  i knew his father well and a brave man he was though not of northern blood  he was warden of the marches of the epte and was killed by your fathers side in the inroad of the viscount du cotentin 10 at the time when you were born lord richard  but where does he live  shall i not see him again  montemar is on the bank of the epte in the domain that the french wrongfully claim from us  he lives there with his mother and if he be not yet returned you shall see him presently  osmond go you and seek out the lodgings of the young montemar and tell him the duke would see him  richard had never had a playfellow of his own age and his eagerness to see alberic de montemar was great  he watched from the window and at length beheld osmond entering the court with a boy of ten years old by his side and an old greyheaded squire with a golden chain to mark him as a seneschal or steward of the castle walking behind  richard ran to the door to meet them holding out his hand eagerly alberic uncovered his bright dark hair bowed low and gracefully but stood as if he did not exactly know what to do next  richard grew shy at the same moment and the two boys stood looking at each other somewhat awkwardly  it was easy to see that they were of different races so unlike were the blue eyes flaxen hair and fair face of the young duke to the black flashing eyes and olive cheek of his french vassal who though two years older was scarcely above him in height and his slight figure wellproportioned active and agile as it was did not give the same promise of strength as the round limbs and largeboned frame of richard which even now seemed likely to rival the gigantic stature of his grandfather earl rollo the ganger  for some minutes the little duke and the young baron stood surveying each other without a word and old sir eric did not improve matters by saying well lord duke here he is  have you no better greeting for him  the children are shamefaced said fru astrida seeing how they both coloured  is your lady mother in good health my young sir  alberic blushed more deeply bowed to the old northern lady and answered fast and low in french i cannot speak the norman tongue  richard glad to say something interpreted fru astridas speech and alberic readily made courteous reply that his mother was well and he thanked the dame de centeville a french title which sounded new to fru astridas ears  then came the embarrassment again and fru astrida at last said take him out lord richard take him to see the horses in the stables or the hounds or what not  richard was not sorry to obey so out they went into the court of rollos tower and in the open air the shyness went off  richard showed his own pony and alberic asked if he could leap into the saddle without putting his foot in the stirrup  no richard could not indeed even osmond had never seen it done for the feats of french chivalry had scarcely yet spread into normandy  can you said richard will you show us  i know i can with my own pony said alberic for bertrand will not let me mount in any other way but i will try with yours if you desire it my lord  so the pony was led out  alberic laid one hand on its mane and vaulted on its back in a moment  both osmond and richard broke out loudly into admiration  oh this is nothing said alberic  bertrand says it is nothing  before he grew old and stiff he could spring into the saddle in this manner fully armed  i ought to do this much better  richard begged to be shown how to perform the exploit and alberic repeated it then richard wanted to try but the ponys patience would not endure any longer and alberic said he had learnt on a block of wood and practised on the great wolfhound  they wandered about a little longer in the court and then climbed up the spiral stone stairs to the battlements at the top of the tower where they looked at the housetops of rouen close beneath and the river seine broadening and glittering on one side in its course to the sea and on the other narrowing to a blue ribbon winding through the green expanse of fertile normandy  they threw the pebbles and bits of mortar down that they might hear them fall and tried which could stand nearest to the edge of the battlement without being giddy  richard was pleased to find that he could go the nearest and began to tell some of fru astridas stories about the precipices of norway among which when she was a young girl she used to climb about and tend the cattle in the long light summer time  when the two boys came down again into the hall to dinner they felt as if they had known each other all their lives  the dinner was laid out in full state and richard had as before to sit in the great thronelike chair with the old count of harcourt on one side but to his comfort fru astrida was on the other  after the dinner alberic de montemar rose to take his leave as he was to ride half way to his home that afternoon  count bernard who all dinner time had been watching him intently from under his shaggy eyebrows at this moment turned to richard whom he hardly ever addressed and said to him hark ye my lord what should you say to have him yonder for a comrade  to stay with me cried richard eagerly  oh thanks sir count and may he stay  you are lord here  oh alberic cried richard jumping out of his chair of state and running up to him will you not stay with me and be my brother and comrade  alberic looked down hesitating  oh say that you will  i will give you horses and hawks and hounds and i will love youalmost as well as osmond  oh stay with me alberic  i must obey you my lord said alberic but  come young frenchman out with it said bernardno buts  speak honestly and at once like a norman if you can  this rough speech seemed to restore the little barons selfpossession and he looked up bright and bold at the rugged face of the old dane while he said i had rather not stay here  ha not do service to your lord  i would serve him with all my heart but i do not want to stay here  i love the castle of montemar better and my mother has no one but me  brave and true sir frenchman said the old count laying his great hand on alberics head and looking better pleased than richard thought his grim features could have appeared  then turning to bertrand alberics seneschal he said bear the count de harcourts greetings to the noble dame de montemar and say to her that her son is of a free bold spirit and if she would have him bred up with my lord duke as his comrade and brother in arms he will find a ready welcome  so alberic you will come back perhaps said richard  that must be as my mother pleases answered alberic bluntly and with all due civilities he and his seneschal departed  four or five times a day did richard ask osmond and fru astrida if they thought alberic would return and it was a great satisfaction to him to find that every one agreed that it would be very foolish in the dame de montemar to refuse so good an offer only fru astrida could not quite believe she would part with her son  still no baron de montemar arrived and the little duke was beginning to think less about his hopes when one evening as he was returning from a ride with sir eric and osmond he saw four horsemen coming towards them and a little boy in front  it is alberic himself i am sure of it he exclaimed and so it proved and while the seneschal delivered his ladys message to sir eric richard rode up and greeted the welcome guest  oh i am very glad your mother has sent you  she said she was not fit to bring up a young warrior of the marches said alberic  were you very sorry to come  i dare say i shall not mind it soon and bertrand is to come and fetch me home to visit her every three months if you will let me go my lord  richard was extremely delighted and thought he could never do enough to make rouen pleasant to alberic who after the first day or two cheered up missed his mother less managed to talk something between french and norman to sir eric and fru astrida and became a very animated companion and friend  in one respect alberic was a better playfellow for the duke than osmond de centeville for osmond playing as a grown up man not for his own amusement but the childs had left all the advantages of the game to richard who was growing not a little inclined to domineer  this alberic did not like unless as he said it was to be always lord and vassal and then he did not care for the game and he played with so little animation that richard grew vexed  i cant help it said alberic if you take all the best chances to yourself tis no sport for me  i will do your bidding as you are the duke but i cannot like it  never mind my being duke but play as we used to do  then let us play as i did with bertrands sons at montemar  i was their baron as you are my duke but my mother said there would be no sport unless we forgot all that at play  then so we will  come begin again alberic and you shall have the first turn  however alberic was quite as courteous and respectful to the duke when they were not at play as the difference of their rank required indeed he had learnt much more of grace and courtliness of demeanour from his mother a provencal lady than was yet to be found among the normans the chaplain of montemar had begun to teach him to read and write and he liked learning much better than richard who would not have gone on with father lucass lessons at all if abbot martin of jumieges had not put him in mind that it had been his fathers especial desire  what richard most disliked was however the being obliged to sit in council  the count of harcourt did in truth govern the dukedom but nothing could be done without the dukes consent and once a week at least there was held in the great hall of rollos tower what was called a parlement or a talkation where count bernard the archbishop the baron de centeville the abbot of jumieges and such other bishops nobles or abbots as might chance to be at rouen consulted on the affairs of normandy and there the little duke always was forced to be present sitting up in his chair of state and hearing rather than listening to questions about the repairing and guarding of castles the asking of loans from the vassals the appeals from the barons of the exchequer who were then nobles sent through the duchy to administer justice and the discussions about the proceedings of his neighbours king louis of france count foulques of anjou and count herluin of montreuil and how far the friendship of hugh of paris and alan of brittany might be trusted  very tired of all this did richard grow especially when he found that the normans had made up their minds not to attempt a war against the wicked count of flanders  he sighed most wearily yawned again and again and moved restlessly about in his chair but whenever count bernard saw him doing so he received so severe a look and sign that he grew perfectly to dread the eye of the fierce old dane  bernard never spoke to him to praise him or to enter into any of his pursuits he only treated him with the grave distant respect due to him as a prince or else now and then spoke a few stern words to him of reproof for this restlessness or for some other childish folly  used as richard was to be petted and made much of by the whole house of centeville he resented this considerably in secret disliked and feared the old count and more than once told alberic de montemar that as soon as he was fourteen when he would be declared of age he should send count bernard to take care of his own castle of harcourt instead of letting him sit gloomy and grim in the castle hall in the evening spoiling all their sport  winter had set in and osmond used daily to take the little duke and alberic to the nearest sheet of ice for the normans still prided themselves on excelling in skating though they had long since left the frostbound streams and lakes of norway  one day as they were returning from the ice they were surprised even before they entered the castle court by hearing the trampling of horses feet and a sound of voices  what may this mean said osmond  there must surely be a great arrival of the vassals  the duke of brittany perhaps  oh said richard piteously we have had one council already this week  i hope another is not coming  it must import something extraordinary proceeded osmond  it is a mischance that the count of harcourt is not at rouen just now  richard thought this no mischance at all and just then alberic who had run on a little before came back exclaiming they are french  it is the frank tongue not the norman that they speak  so please you my lord said osmond stopping short we go not rashly into the midst of them  i would i knew what were best to do  osmond rubbed his forehead and stood considering while the two boys looked at him anxiously  in a few seconds before he had come to any conclusion there came forth from the gate a norman squire accompanied by two strangers  my lord duke said he to richard in french sir eric has sent me to bring you tidings that the king of france has arrived to receive your homage  the king exclaimed osmond  ay proceeded the norman in his own tongue louis himself and with a train looking bent on mischief  i wish it may portend good to my lord here  you see i am accompanied  i believe from my heart that louis meant to prevent you from receiving a warning and taking the boy out of his clutches  ha what said richard anxiously  why is the king come  what must i do  go on now since there is no help for it said osmond  greet the king as becomes you bend the knee and pay him homage  richard repeated over to himself the form of homage that he might be perfect in it and walked on into the court alberic osmond and the rest falling back as he entered  the court was crowded with horses and men and it was only by calling out loudly the duke the duke that osmond could get space enough made for them to pass  in a few moments richard had mounted the steps and stood in the great hall  in the chair of state at the upper end of the room sat a small spare man of about eight or nineandtwenty pale and of a light complexion with a rich dress of blue and gold  sir eric and several other persons stood respectfully round him and he was conversing with the archbishop who as well as sir eric cast several anxious glances at the little duke as he advanced up the hall  he came up to the king put his knee to the ground and was just beginning louis king of france i when he found himself suddenly lifted from the ground in the kings arms and kissed on both cheeks  then setting him on his knee the king exclaimed and is this the son of my brave and noble friend duke william  ah  i should have known it from his likeness  let me embrace you again dear child for your fathers sake  richard was rather overwhelmed but he thought the king very kind especially when louis began to admire his height and freespirited bearing and to lament that his own sons lothaire and carloman were so much smaller and more backward  he caressed richard again and again praised every word he saidfru astrida was nothing to him and richard began to say to himself how strange and unkind it was of bernard de harcourt to like to find fault with him when on the contrary he deserved all this praise from the king himself                picture louis of france and the little duke     chapter v   duke richard of normandy slept in the room which had been his fathers alberic de montemar as his page slept at his feet and osmond de centeville had a bed on the floor across the door where he lay with his sword close at hand as his young lords guard and protector  all had been asleep for some little time when osmond was startled by a slight movement of the door which could not be pushed open without awakening him  in an instant he had grasped his sword while he pressed his shoulder to the door to keep it closed but it was his fathers voice that answered him with a few whispered words in the norse tongue it is i open  he made way instantly and old sir eric entered treading cautiously with bare feet and sat down on the bed motioning him to do the same so that they might be able to speak lower  right osmond he said  it is well to be on the alert for peril enough is around himthe frank means mischief  i know from a sure hand that arnulf of flanders was in council with him just before he came hither with his false tongue wiling and coaxing the poor child  ungrateful traitor murmured osmond  do you guess his purpose  yes surely to carry the boy off with him and so he trusts doubtless to cut off all the race of rollo  i know his purpose is to bear off the duke as a ward of the crown forsooth  did you not hear him luring the child with his promises of friendship with the princes  i could not understand all his french words but i saw it plain enough  you will never allow it  if he does it must be across our dead bodies but taken as we are by surprise our resistance will little avail  the castle is full of french the hall and court swarm with them  even if we could draw our normans together we should not be more than a dozen men and what could we do but die  that we are ready for if it may not be otherwise rather than let our charge be thus borne off without a pledge for his safety and without the knowledge of the states  the king could not have come at a worse time said osmond  no just when bernard the dane is absent  if he only knew what has befallen he could raise the country and come to the rescue  could we not send some one to bear the tidings tonight  i know not said sir eric musingly  the french have taken the keeping of the doors indeed they are so thick through the castle that i can hardly reach one of our men nor could i spare one hand that may avail to guard the boy tomorrow  sir eric a bare little foot was heard on the floor and alberic de montemar stood before him  i did not mean to listen but i could not help hearing you  i cannot fight for the duke yet but i could carry a message  how would that be said osmond eagerly  once out of the castle and in rouen he could easily find means of sending to the count  he might go either to the convent of st ouen or which would be better to the trusty armourer thibault who would soon find man and horse to send after the count  ha let me see said sir eric  it might be  but how is he to get out  i know a way said alberic  i scrambled down that wide buttress by the east wall last week when our ball was caught in a branch of the ivy and the drawbridge is down  if bernard knew it would be off my mind at least said sir eric well my young frenchman you may do good service  osmond whispered alberic as he began hastily to dress himself only ask one thing of sir ericnever to call me young frenchman again  sir eric smiled saying prove yourself norman my boy  then added osmond if it were possible to get the duke himself out of the castle tomorrow morning  if i could take him forth by the postern and once bring him into the town he would be safe  it would be only to raise the burghers or else to take refuge in the church of our lady till the count came up and then louis would find his prey out of his hands when he awoke and sought him  that might be replied sir eric but i doubt your success  the french are too eager to hold him fast to let him slip out of their hands  you will find every door guarded  yes but all the french have not seen the duke and the sight of a squire and a little page going forth will scarcely excite their suspicion  ay if the duke would bear himself like a little page but that you need not hope for  besides he is so taken with this kings flatteries that i doubt whether he would consent to leave him for the sake of count bernard  poor child he is like to be soon taught to know his true friends  i am ready said alberic coming forward  the baron de centeville repeated his instructions and then undertook to guard the door while his son saw alberic set off on his expedition osmond went with him softly down the stairs then avoiding the hall which was filled with french they crept silently to a narrow window guarded by iron bars placed at such short intervals apart that only so small and slim a form as alberics could have squeezed out between them the distance to the ground was not much more than twice his own height and the wall was so covered with ivy that it was not a very dangerous feat for an active boy so that alberic was soon safe on the ground then looking up to wave his cap he ran on along the side of the moat and was soon lost to osmonds sight in the darkness  osmond returned to the dukes chamber and relieved his fathers guard while richard slept soundly on little guessing at the plots of his enemies or at the schemes of his faithful subjects for his protection  osmond thought this all the better for he had small trust in richards patience and selfcommand and thought there was much more chance of getting him unnoticed out of the castle if he did not know how much depended on it and how dangerous his situation was  when richard awoke he was much surprised at missing alberic but osmond said he was gone into the town to thibault the armourer and this was a message on which he was so likely to be employed that richards suspicion was not excited  all the time he was dressing he talked about the king and everything he meant to show him that day then when he was ready the first thing was as usual to go to attend morning mass  not by that way today my lord said osmond as richard was about to enter the great hall  it is crowded with the french who have been sleeping there all night come to the postern  osmond turned as he spoke along the passage walking fast and not sorry that richard was lingering a little as it was safer for him to be first  the postern was as he expected guarded by two tall steelcased figures who immediately held their lances across the doorway saying none passes without warrant  you will surely let us of the castle attend to our daily business said osmond  you will hardly break your fast this morning if you stop all communication with the town  you must bring warrant repeated one of the menatarms  osmond was beginning to say that he was the son of the seneschal of the castle when richard came hastily up  what  do these men want to stop us he exclaimed in the imperious manner he had begun to take up since his accession  let us go on sirs  the menatarms looked at each other and guarded the door more closely osmond saw it was hopeless and only wanted to draw his young charge back without being recognised but richard exclaimed loudly what means this  the king has given orders that none should pass without warrant was osmonds answer  we must wait  i will pass said richard impatient at opposition to which he was little accustomed  what mean you osmond  this is my castle and no one has a right to stop me  do you hear grooms let me go  i am the duke  the sentinels bowed but all they said was our orders are express  i tell you i am duke of normandy and i will go where i please in my own city exclaimed richard passionately pressing against the crossed staves of the weapons to force his way between them but he was caught and held fast in the powerful gauntlet of one of the menatarms  let me go villain cried he struggling with all his might  osmond osmond help  even as he spoke osmond had disengaged him from the grasp of the frenchman and putting his hand on his arm said nay my lord it is not for you to strive with such as these  i will strive cried the boy  i will not have my way barred in my own castle  i will tell the king how these rogues of his use me  i will have them in the dungeon  sir eric where is sir eric  away he rushed to the stairs osmond hurrying after him lest he should throw himself into some fresh danger or by his loud calls attract the french who might then easily make him prisoner  however on the very first step of the stairs stood sir eric who was too anxious for the success of the attempt to escape to be very far off  richard too angry to heed where he was going dashed up against him without seeing him and as the old baron took hold of him began sir eric sir eric those french are villains they will not let me pass  hush hush my lord said sir eric  silence come here  however imperious with others richard from force of habit always obeyed sir eric and now allowed himself to be dragged hastily and silently by him osmond following closely up the stairs up a second and a third winding flight still narrower and with broken steps to a small round thickwalled turret chamber with an extremely small door and loopholes of windows high up in the tower  here to his great surprise he found dame astrida kneeling and telling her beads two or three of her maidens and about four of the norman squires and menatarms  so you have failed osmond said the baron  but what is all this  how did fru astrida come up here  may i not go to the king and have those insolent franks punished  listen to me lord richard said sir eric that smoothspoken king whose words so charmed you last night is an ungrateful deceiver  the franks have always hated and feared the normans and not being able to conquer us fairly they now take to foul means  louis came hither from flanders he has brought this great troop of french to surprise us claim you as a ward of the crown and carry you away with him to some prison of his own  you will not let me go said richard  not while i live said sir eric  alberic is gone to warn the count of harcourt to call the normans together and here we are ready to defend this chamber to our last breath but we are few the french are many and succour may be far off  then you meant to have taken me out of their reach this morning osmond  yes my lord  and if i had not flown into a passion and told who i was i might have been safe  o sir eric  sir eric you will not let me be carried off to a french prison  here my child said dame astrida holding out her arms sir eric will do all he can for you but we are in gods hands  richard came and leant against her  i wish i had not been in a passion said he sadly after a silence then looking at her in wonderbut how came you up all this way  it is a long way for my old limbs said fru astrida smiling but my son helped me and he deems it the only safe place in the castle  the safest said sir eric and that is not saying much for it  hark said osmond what a tramping the franks are making  they are beginning to wonder where the duke is  to the stairs osmond said sir eric  on that narrow step one man may keep them at bay a long time  you can speak their jargon too and hold parley with them  perhaps they will think i am gone whispered richard if they cannot find me and go away  osmond and two of the normans were as he spoke taking their stand on the narrow spiral stair where there was just room for one man on the step  osmond was the lowest the other two above him and it would have been very hard for an enemy to force his way past them  osmond could plainly hear the sounds of the steps and voices of the french as they consulted together and sought for the duke  a man at length was heard clanking up these very stairs till winding round he suddenly found himself close upon young de centeville  ha  norman he cried starting back in amazement what are you doing here  my duty answered osmond shortly  i am here to guard this stair and his drawn sword expressed the same intention  the frenchman drew back and presently a whispering below was heard and soon after a voice came up the stairs saying normangood norman  what would you say replied osmond and the head of another frank appeared  what means all this my friend was the address  our king comes as a guest to you and you received him last evening as loyal vassals  wherefore have you now drawn out of the way and striven to bear off your young duke into secret places  truly it looks not well that you should thus strive to keep him apart and therefore the king requires to see him instantly  sir frenchman replied osmond your king claims the duke as his ward how that may be my father knows not but as he was committed to his charge by the states of normandy he holds himself bound to keep him in his own hands until further orders from them  that means insolent norman that you intend to shut the boy up and keep him in your own rebel hands  you had best yieldit will be the better for you and for him  the child is the kings ward and he shall not be left to be nurtured in rebellion by northern pirates  at this moment a cry from without arose so loud as almost to drown the voices of the speakers on the turret stair a cry welcome to the ears of osmond repeated by a multitude of voices haro  haro our little duke  it was well known as a norman shout  so just and so ready to redress all grievances had the old duke rollo been that his very name was an appeal against injustice and whenever wrong was done the norman outcry against the injury was always ha rollo or as it had become shortened haro and now osmond knew that those whose affection had been won by the uprightness of rollo were gathering to protect his helpless grandchild  the cry was likewise heard by the little garrison in the turret chamber bringing hope and joy  richard thought himself already rescued and springing from fru astrida danced about in ecstasy only longing to see the faithful normans whose voices he heard ringing out again and again in calls for their little duke and outcries against the franks  the windows were however so high that nothing could be seen from them but the sky and like richard the old baron de centeville was almost beside himself with anxiety to know what force was gathered together and what measures were being taken  he opened the door called to his son and asked if he could tell what was passing but osmond knew as littlehe could see nothing but the black cobwebbed dusty steps winding above his head while the clamours outside waxing fiercer and louder drowned all the sounds which might otherwise have come up to him from the french within the castle  at last however osmond called out to his father in norse there is a frank baron come to entreat and this time very humbly that the duke may come to the king  tell him replied sir eric that save with consent of the council of normandy the child leaves not my hands  he says called back osmond after a moment that you shall guard him yourself with as many as you choose to bring with you  he declares on the faith of a free baron that the king has no thought of illhe wants to show him to the rouennais without who are calling for him and threaten to tear down the tower rather than not see their little duke shall i bid him send a hostage  answer him returned the baron that the duke leaves not this chamber unless a pledge is put into our hands for his safety  there was an oilytongued count who sat next the king at supperlet him come hither and then perchance i may trust the duke among them  osmond gave the desired reply which was carried to the king  meantime the uproar outside grew louder than ever and there were new sounds a horn was winded and there was a shout of dieu aide the norman warcry joined with notre dame de harcourt  there there cried sir eric with a long breath as if relieved of half his anxieties the boy has sped well  bernard is here at last now his head and hand are there i doubt no longer  here comes the count said osmond opening the door and admitting a stout burly man who seemed sorely out of breath with the ascent of the steep broken stair and very little pleased to find himself in such a situation  the baron de centeville augured well from the speed with which he had been sent thinking it proved great perplexity and distress on the part of louis  without waiting to hear his hostage speak he pointed to a chest on which he had been sitting and bade two of his menatarms stand on each side of the count saying at the same time to fru astrida now mother if aught of evil befalls the child you know your part  come lord richard  richard moved forward  sir eric held his hand  osmond kept close behind him and with as many of the menatarms as could be spared from guarding fru astrida and her hostage he descended the stairs not by any means sorry to go for he was weary of being besieged in that turret chamber whence he could see nothing and with those friendly cries in his ears he could not be afraid  he was conducted to the large councilroom which was above the hall there the king was walking up and down anxiously looking paler than his wont and no wonder for the uproar sounded tremendous thereand now and then a stone dashed against the sides of the deep window  nearly at the same moment as richard entered by one door count bernard de harcourt came in from the other and there was a slight lull in the tumult  what means this my lords exclaimed the king  here am i come in all good will in memory of my warm friendship with duke william to take on me the care of his orphan and hold council with you for avenging his death and is this the greeting you afford me  you steal away the child and stir up the rascaille of rouen against me  is this the reception for your king  sir king replied bernard what your intentions may be i know not all i do know is that the burghers of rouen are fiercely incensed against youso much so that they were almost ready to tear me to pieces for being absent at this juncture  they say that you are keeping the child prisoner in his own castle and that they will have him restored if they tear it down to the foundations  you are a true man a loyal manyou understand my good intentions said louis trembling for the normans were extremely dreaded  you would not bring the shame of rebellion on your town and people  advise mei will do just as you counsel mehow shall i appease them  take the child lead him to the window swear that you mean him no evil that you will not take him from us said bernard  swear it on the faith of a king  as a kingas a christian it is true said louis  here my boy wherefore shrink from me  what have i done that you should fear me you have been listening to evil tales of me my child  come hither  at a sign from the count de harcourt sir eric led richard forward and put his hand into the kings  louis took him to the window lifted him upon the sill and stood there with his arm round him upon which the shout long live richard our little duke arose again  meantime the two centevilles looked in wonder at the old harcourt who shook his head and muttered in his own tongue i will do all i may but our force is small and the king has the best of it  we must not yet bring a war on ourselves  hark he is going to speak said osmond  fair sirsexcellent burgesses began the king as the cries lulled a little 11  i rejoice to see the love ye bear to our young prince  i would all my subjects were equally loyal  but wherefore dread me as if i were come to injure him  i who came but to take counsel how to avenge the death of his father who brought me back from england when i was a friendless exile  know ye not how deep is the debt of gratitude i owe to duke william  he it was who made me kingit was he who gained me the love of the king of germany he stood godfather for my sonto him i owe all my wealth and state and all my care is to render guerdon for it to his child since alas  i may not to himself  duke william rests in his bloody grave  it is for me to call his murderers to account and to cherish his son even as mine own  so saying louis tenderly embraced the little boy and the rouennais below broke out into another cry in which long live king louis was joined with long live richard  you will not let the child go said eric meanwhile to harcourt  not without provision for his safety but we are not fit for war as yet and to let him go is the only means of warding it off  eric groaned and shook his head but the count de harcourts judgment was of such weight with him that he never dreamt of disputing it  bring me here said the king all that you deem most holy and you shall see me pledge myself to be your dukes most faithful friend  there was some delay during which the norman nobles had time for further counsel together and richard looked wistfully at them wondering what was to happen to him and wishing he could venture to ask for alberic  several of the clergy of the cathedral presently appeared in procession bringing with them the book of the gospels on which richard had taken his installation oath with others of the sacred treasures of the church preserved in gold cases  the priests were followed by a few of the norman knights and nobles some of the burgesses of rouen and to richards great joy by alberic de montemar himself  the two boys stood looking eagerly at each other while preparation was made for the ceremony of the kings oath  the stone table in the middle of the room was cleared and arranged so as in some degree to resemble the altar in the cathedral then the count de harcourt standing before it and holding the kings hand demanded of him whether he would undertake to be the friend protector and good lord of richard duke of normandy guarding him from all his enemies and ever seeking his welfare  louis with his hand on the gospels swore that so he would  amen returned bernard the dane solemnly and as thou keepest that oath to the fatherless child so may the lord do unto thine house  then followed the ceremony which had been interrupted the night before of the homage and oath of allegiance which richard owed to the king and on the other hand the kings formal reception of him as a vassal holding under him the two dukedoms of normandy and brittany  and said the king raising him in his arms and kissing him no dearer vassal do i hold in all my realm than this fair child son of my murdered friend and benefactorprecious to me as my own children as so on my queen and i hope to testify  richard did not much like all this embracing but he was sure the king really meant him no ill and he wondered at all the distrust the centevilles had shown  now brave normans said the king be ye ready speedily for an onset on the traitor fleming  the cause of my ward is my own cause  soon shall the trumpet be sounded the ban and arriere ban of the realm be called forth and arnulf in the flames of his cities and the blood of his vassals shall learn to rue the day when his foot trod the isle of pecquigny  how many normans can you bring to the muster sir count  i cannot say within a few hundreds of lances replied the old dane cautiously it depends on the numbers that may be engaged in the italian war with the saracens but of this be sure sir king that every man in normandy and brittany who can draw a sword or bend a bow will stand forth in the cause of our little duke ay and that his blessed fathers memory is held so dear in our northern home that it needs but a message to king harold bluetooth to bring a fleet of long keels into the seine with stout danes enough to carry fire and sword not merely through flanders but through all france  we of the north are not apt to forget old friendships and favours sir king  yes yes i know the norman faith of old returned louis uneasily but we should scarcely need such wild allies as you propose the count of paris and hubert of senlis may be reckoned on i suppose  no truer friend to normandy than gallant and wise old hugh the white said bernard and as to senlis he is uncle to the boy and doubly bound to us  i rejoice to see your confidence said louis  you shall soon hear from me  in the meantime i must return to gather my force together and summon my great vassals and i will with your leave brave normans take with me my dear young ward  his presence will plead better in his cause than the finest words moreover he will grow up in love and friendship with my two boys and shall be nurtured with them in all good learning and chivalry nor shall he ever be reminded that he is an orphan while under the care of queen gerberge and myself  let the child come to me so please you my lord the king answered harcourt bluntly  i must hold some converse with him ere i can reply  go then richard said louis go to your trusty vassalhappy are you in possessing such a friend i hope you know his value  here then young sir said the count in his native tongue when richard had crossed from the kings side and stood beside him what say you to this proposal  the king is very kind said richard  i am sure he is kind but i do not like to go from rouen or from dame astrida  listen my lord said the dane stooping down and speaking low  the king is resolved to have you away he has with him the best of his franks and has so taken us at unawares that though i might yet rescue you from his hands it would not be without a fierce struggle wherein you might be harmed and this castle and town certainly burnt and wrested from us  a few weeks or months and we shall have time to draw our force together so that normandy need fear no man and for that time you must tarry with him  must iand all alone  no not alone not without the most trusty guardian that can be found for you  friend eric what say you and he laid his hand on the old barons shoulder  yet i know not true thou art as a norwegian mountain but i doubt me if thy brains are not too dull to see through the french wiles and disguises sharp as thou didst show thyself last night  that was osmond not i said sir eric  he knows their mincing tongue better than i  he were the best to go with the poor child if go he must  bethink you eric said the count in an undertone osmond is the only hope of your good old houseif there is foul play the guardian will be the first to suffer  since you think fit to peril the only hope of all normandy i am not the man to hold back my son where he may aid him said old eric sadly the poor child will be lonely and uncaredfor there and it were hard he should not have one faithful comrade and friend with him  it is well said bernard young as he is i had rather trust osmond with the child than any one else for he is ready of counsel and quick of hand  ay and a pretty pass it is come to muttered old centeville that we whose business it is to guard the boy should send him where you scarcely like to trust my son  bernard paid no further attention to him but coming forward required another oath from the king that richard should be as safe and free at his court as at rouen and that on no pretence whatsoever should he be taken from under the immediate care of his esquire osmond fitz eric heir of centeville  after this the king was impatient to depart and all was preparation bernard called osmond aside to give full instructions on his conduct and the means of communicating with normandy and richard was taking leave of fru astrida who had now descended from her turret bringing her hostage with her  she wept much over her little duke praying that he might safely be restored to normandy even though she might not live to see it she exhorted him not to forget the good and holy learning in which he had been brought up to rule his temper and above all to say his prayers constantly never leaving out one as the beads of his rosary reminded him of their order  as to her own grandson anxiety for him seemed almost lost in her fears for richard and the chief things she said to him when he came to take leave of her were directions as to the care he was to take of the child telling him the honour he now received was one which would make his name forever esteemed if he did but fulfil his trust the most precious that norman had ever yet received  i will grandmother to the very best of my power said osmond i may die in his cause but never will i be faithless  alberic said richard are you glad to be going back to montemar  yes my lord answered alberic sturdily as glad as you will be to come back to rouen  then i shall send for you directly alberic for i shall never love the princes carloman and lothaire half as well as you  my lord the king is waiting for the duke said a frenchman coming forward  farewell then fru astrida  do not weep  i shall soon come back farewell alberic  take the bartailed falcon back to montemar and keep him for my sake  farewell sir ericfarewell count bernard  when the normans come to conquer arnulf you will lead them  o dear dear fru astrida farewell again  farewell my own darling  the blessing of heaven go with you and bring you safe home  farewell osmond  heaven guard you and strengthen you to be his shield and his defence     chapter vi   away from the tall narrow gateway of rollos tower with the cluster of friendly sorrowful faces looking forth from it away from the boothlike shops of rouen and the stout burghers shouting with all the power of their lungs long live duke richard  long live king louis  death to the flemingaway from the broad seineaway from home and friends rode the young duke of normandy by the side of the palfrey of the king of france  the king took much notice of him kept him by his side talked to him admired the beautiful cattle grazing in security in the green pastures and as he looked at the rich dark brown earth of the fields the castles towering above the woods the convents looking like great farms the many villages round the rude churches and the numerous population who came out to gaze at the party and repeat the cry of long live the king blessings on the little duke he told richard again and again that his was the most goodly duchy in france and germany to boot  when they crossed the epte the king would have richard in the same boat with him and sitting close to louis and talking eagerly about falcons and hounds the little duke passed the boundary of his own dukedom  the country beyond was not like normandy  first they came to a great forest which seemed to have no path through it  the king ordered that one of the men who had rowed them across should be made to serve as guide and two of the menatarms took him between them and forced him to lead the way while others with their swords and battleaxes cut down and cleared away the tangled branches and briars that nearly choked the path  all the time every one was sharply on the lookout for robbers and the weapons were all held ready for use at a moments notice  on getting beyond the forest a castle rose before them and though it was not yet late in the day they resolved to rest there as a marsh lay not far before them which it would not have been safe to traverse in the evening twilight  the baron of the castle received them with great respect to the king but without paying much attention to the duke of normandy and richard did not find the second place left for him at the board  he coloured violently and looked first at the king and then at osmond but osmond held up his finger in warning he remembered how he had lost his temper before and what had come of it and resolved to try to bear it better and just then the barons daughter a gentlelooking maiden of fifteen or sixteen came and spoke to him and entertained him so well that he did not think much more of his offended dignitywhen they set off on their journey again the baron and several of his followers came with them to show the only safe way across the morass and a very slippery treacherous quaking road it was where the horses feet left pools of water wherever they trod  the king and the baron rode together and the other french nobles closed round them richard was left quite in the background and though the french menatarms took care not to lose sight of him no one offered him any assistance excepting osmond who giving his own horse to sybald one of the two norman grooms who accompanied him led richards horse by the bridle along the whole distance of the marshy path a business that could scarcely have been pleasant as osmond wore his heavy hauberk and his pointed ironguarded boots sunk deep at every step into the bog  he spoke little but seemed to be taking good heed of every stump of willow or steppingstone that might serve as a note of remembrance of the path  at the other end of the morass began a long tract of drearylooking heathy waste without a sign of life  the baron took leave of the king only sending three menatarms to show him the way to a monastery which was to be the next haltingplace  he sent three because it was not safe for one even fully armed to ride alone for fear of the attacks of the followers of a certain marauding baron who was at deadly feud with him and made all that border a most perilous region  richard might well observe that he did not like the vexin half as well as normandy and that the people ought to learn fru astridas story of the golden bracelets which in his grandfathers time had hung untouched for a year in a tree in a forest  it was pretty much the same through the whole journey waste lands marshes and forests alternated  the castles stood on high mounds frowning on the country round and villages were clustered round them where the people either fled away driving off their cattle with them at the first sight of an armed band or else if they remained proved to be thin wretchedlooking creatures with wasted limbs aguish faces and often iron collars round their necks  wherever there was anything of more prosperous appearance such as a few cornfields vineyards on the slopes of the hills fat cattle and peasantry looking healthy and secure there was sure to be seen a range of long low stone buildings surmounted with crosses with a short square church tower rising in the midst and interspersed with gnarled hoary old appletrees or with gardens of potherbs spreading before them to the meadows  if instead of two or three menatarms from a castle or of some trembling serf pressed into the service and beaten threatened and watched to prevent treachery the king asked for a guide at a convent some lay brother would take his staff or else mount an ass and proceed in perfect confidence and security as to his return homewards sure that his poverty and his sacred character would alike protect him from any outrage from the most lawless marauder of the neighbourhood  thus they travelled until they reached the royal castle of laon where the fleurdelys standard on the battlements announced the presence of gerberge queen of france and her two sons  the king rode first into the court with his nobles and before richard could follow him through the narrow arched gateway he had dismounted entered the castle and was out of sight  osmond held the dukes stirrup and followed him up the steps which led to the castle hall  it was full of people but no one made way and richard holding his squires hand looked up in his face inquiring and bewildered  sir seneschal said osmond seeing a broad portly old man with grey hair and a golden chain this is the duke of normandyi pray you conduct him to the kings presence  richard had no longer any cause to complain of neglect for the seneschal instantly made him a very low bow and calling placeplace for the high and mighty prince my lord duke of normandy ushered him up to the dais or raised part of the floor where the king and queen stood together talking  the queen looked round as richard was announced and he saw her face which was sallow and with a sharp sour expression that did not please him and he backed and looked reluctant while osmond with a warning hand pressed on his shoulder was trying to remind him that he ought to go forward kneel on one knee and kiss her hand  there he is said the king  one thing secure said the queen but what makes that northern giant keep close to his heels  louis answered something in a low voice and in the meantime osmond tried in a whisper to induce his young lord to go forward and perform his obeisance  i tell you i will not said richard  she looks cross and i do not like her  luckily he spoke his own language but his look and air expressed a good deal of what he said and gerberge looked all the more unattractive  a thorough little norwegian bear said the king fierce and unruly as the rest  come and perform your courtesydo you forget where you are he added sternly  richard bowed partly because osmond forced down his shoulder but he thought of old rollo and charles the simple and his proud heart resolved that he would never kiss the hand of that sourlooking queen  it was a determination made in pride and defiance and he suffered for it afterwards but no more passed now for the queen only saw in his behaviour that of an unmannerly young northman and though she disliked and despised him she did not care enough about his courtesy to insist on its being paid  she sat down and so did the king and they went on talking the king probably telling her his adventures at rouen while richard stood on the step of the dais swelling with sullen pride  nearly a quarter of an hour had passed in this manner when the servants came to set the table for supper and richard in spite of his indignant looks was forced to stand aside  he wondered that all this time he had not seen the two princes thinking how strange he should have thought it to let his own dear father be in the house so long without coming to welcome him  at last just as the supper had been served up a side door opened and the seneschal called place for the high and mighty princes my lord lothaire and my lord carloman and in walked two boys one about the same age as richard the other rather less than a year younger  they were both thin pale sharpfeatured children and richard drew himself up to his full height with great satisfaction at being so much taller than lothaire  they came up ceremoniously to their father and kissed his hand while he kissed their foreheads and then said to them there is a new playfellow for you  is that the little northman said carloman turning to stare at richard with a look of curiosity while richard in his turn felt considerably affronted that a boy so much less than himself should call him little  yes said the queen your father has brought him home with him  carloman stepped forward shyly holding out his hand to the stranger but his brother pushed him rudely aside  i am the eldest it is my business to be first  so young northman you are come here for us to play with  richard was too much amazed at being spoken to in this imperious way to make any answer  he was completely taken by surprise and only opened his great blue eyes to their utmost extent  ha why dont you answer  dont you hear  can you speak only your own heathen tongue continued lothaire  the norman is no heathen tongue said richard at once breaking silence in a loud voice  we are as good christians as you areay and better too  hush hush my lord said osmond  what now sir duke again interfered the king in an angry tone are you brawling already  time indeed i should take you from your own savage court  sir squire look to it that you keep your charge in better rule or i shall send him instantly to bed supperless  my lord my lord whispered osmond see you not that you are bringing discredit on all of us  i would be courteous enough if they would be courteous to me returned richard gazing with eyes full of defiance at lothaire who returning an angry look had nevertheless shrunk back to his mother  she meanwhile was saying so strong so rough the young savage is he will surely harm our poor boys  never fear said louis he shall be watched  and he added in a lower tone for the present at least we must keep up appearances hubert of senlis and hugh of paris have their eyes on us and were the boy to be missed the grim old harcourt would have all the pirates of his land on us in the twinkling of an eye  we have him and there we must rest content for the present  now to supper  at supper richard sat next little carloman who peeped at him every now and then from under his eyelashes as if he was afraid of him and presently when there was a good deal of talking going on so that his voice could not be heard half whispered in a very grave tone do you like salt beef or fresh  i like fresh answered richard with equal gravity only we eat salt all the winter  there was another silence and then carloman with the same solemnity asked how old are you  i shall be nine on the eve of st boniface  how old are you  eight  i was eight at martinmas and lothaire was nine three days since  another silence then as osmond waited on richard carloman returned to the charge is that your squire  yes that is osmond de centeville  how tall he is  we normans are taller than you french  dont say so to lothaire or you will make him angry  why it is true  yes but and carloman sunk his voicethere are some things which lothaire will not hear said  do not make him cross or he will make my mother displeased with you  she caused thierry de lincourt to be scourged because his ball hit lothaires face  she cannot scourge mei am a free duke said richard  but why  did he do it on purpose  oh no  and was lothaire hurt  hush you must say prince lothaire  no it was quite a soft ball  why again asked richardwhy was he scourged  i told you because he hit lothaire  well but did he not laugh and say it was nothing  alberic quite knocked me down with a great snowball the other day and sir eric laughed and said i must stand firmer  do you make snowballs  to be sure i do  do not you  oh no the snow is so cold  ah you are but a little boy said richard in a superior manner carloman asked how it was done and richard gave an animated description of the snowballing a fortnight ago at rouen when osmond and some of the other young men built a snow fortress and defended it against richard alberic and the other squires  carloman listened with delight and declared that next time it snowed they would have a snow castle and thus by the time supper was over the two little boys were very good friends  bedtime came not long after supper  richards was a smaller room than he had been used to at rouen but it amazed him exceedingly when he first went into it he stood gazing in wonder because as he said it was as if he had been in a church  yes truly said osmond  no wonder these poor creatures of french cannot stand before a norman lance if they cannot sleep without glass to their windows  well what would my father say to this  and see see osmond they have put hangings up all round the walls just like our ladys church on a great feastday  they treat us just as if we were the holy saints and here are fresh rushes strewn about the floor too  this must be a mistakeit must be an oratory instead of my chamber  no no my lord here is our gear which i bade sybald and henry see bestowed in our chamber  well these franks are come to a pass indeed my grandmother will never believe what we shall have to tell her  glass windows and hangings to sleeping chambers i do not like it i am sure we shall never be able to sleep closed up from the free air of heaven in this way i shall be always waking and fancying i am in the chapel at home hearing father lucas chanting his matins  besides my father would blame me for letting you be made as tender as a frank  ill have out this precious window if i can  luxurious as the young norman thought the king the glazing of laon was not permanent  it consisted of casements which could be put up or removed at pleasure for as the court possessed only one set of glass windows they were taken down and carried from place to place as often as louis removed from rheims to soissons laon or any other of his royal castles so that osmond did not find much difficulty in displacing them and letting in the sharp cold wintry breeze  the next thing he did was to give his young lord a lecture on his want of courtesy telling him that no wonder the franks thought he had no more culture than a viking or pirate fresh caught from norway  a fine notion he was giving them of the training he had at centeville if he could not even show common civility to the queena lady  was that the way alberic had behaved when he came to rouen  fru astrida did not make sour faces at him nor call him a young savage replied richard  no and he gave her no reason to do so he knew that the first teaching of a young knight is to be courteous to ladiesnever mind whether fair and young or old and foul of favour  till you learn and note that lord richard you will never be worthy of your golden spurs  and the king told me she would treat me as a mother exclaimed richard do you think the king speaks the truth osmond  that we shall see by his deeds said osmond  he was very kind while we were in normandy  i loved him so much better than the count de harcourt but now i think that the count is best  ill tell you osmond i will never call him grim old bernard again  you had best not sir for you will never have a more truehearted vassal  well i wish we were back in normandy with fru astrida and alberic  i cannot bear that lothaire  he is proud and unknightly and cruel  i am sure he is and i will never love him  hush my lordbeware of speaking so loud  you are not in your own castle  and carloman is a chickenheart continued richard unheeding  he does not like to touch snow and he cannot even slide on the ice and he is afraid to go near that great dogthat beautiful wolfhound  he is very little said osmond  i am sure i was not as cowardly at his age now was i osmond  dont you remember  come lord richard i cannot let you wait to remember everything tell your beads and pray that we may be brought safe back to rouen and that you may not forget all the good that father lucas and holy abbot martin have laboured to teach you  so richard told the beads of his rosaryblack polished wood with amber at certain spaceshe repeated a prayer with every bead and osmond did the same then the little duke put himself into a narrow crib of richly carved walnut while osmond having stuck his dagger so as to form an additional bolt to secure the door and examined the hangings that no secret entrance might be concealed behind them gathered a heap of rushes together and lay down on them wrapped in his mantle across the doorway  the duke was soon asleep but the squire lay long awake musing on the possible dangers that surrounded his charge and on the best way of guarding against them     chapter vii   osmond de centeville was soon convinced that no immediate peril threatened his young duke at the court of laon  louis seemed to intend to fulfil his oaths to the normans by allowing the child to be the companion of his own sons and to be treated in every respect as became his rank  richard had his proper place at table and all due attendance he learnt rode and played with the princes and there was nothing to complain of excepting the coldness and inattention with which the king and queen treated him by no means fulfilling the promise of being as parents to their orphan ward  gerberge who had from the first dreaded his superior strength and his roughness with her puny boys and who had been by no means won by his manners at their first meeting was especially distant and severe with him hardly ever speaking to him except with some rebuke which it must be confessed richard often deserved  as to the boys his constant companions richard was on very friendly terms with carloman a gentle timid weakly child  richard looked down upon him but he was kind as a generoustempered boy could not fail to be to one younger and weaker than himself  he was so much kinder than lothaire that carloman was fast growing very fond of him and looked up to his strength and courage as something noble and marvellous  it was very different with lothaire the person from whom above all others richard would have most expected to meet with affection as his fathers godson a relationship which in those times was thought almost as near as kindred by blood  lothaire had been brought up by an indulgent mother and by courtiers who never ceased flattering him as the heir to the crown and he had learnt to think that to give way to his naturally imperious and violent disposition was the way to prove his power and assert his rank  he had always had his own way and nothing had ever been done to check his faults somewhat weakly health had made him fretful and timid and a latent consciousness of this fearfulness made him all the more cruel sometimes because he was frightened sometimes because he fancied it manly  he treated his little brother in a way which in these times boys would call bullying and as no one ever dared to oppose the kings eldest son it was pretty much the same with every one else except now and then some dumb creature and then all lothaires cruelty was shown  when his horse kicked and ended by throwing him he stood by and caused it to be beaten till the poor creatures back streamed with blood when his dog bit his hand in trying to seize the meat with which he was teazing it he insisted on having it killed and it was worse still when a falcon pecked one of his fingers  it really hurt him a good deal and in a furious rage he caused two nails to be heated red hot in the fire intending to have them thrust into the poor birds eyes  i will not have it done exclaimed richard expecting to be obeyed as he was at home but lothaire only laughed scornfully saying do you think you are master here sir pirate  i will not have it done repeated richard  shame on you shame on you for thinking of such an unkingly deed  shame on me do you know to whom you speak master savage cried lothaire red with passion  i know who is the savage now said richard  hold to the servant who was bringing the redhot irons in a pair of tongs  hold exclaimed lothaire  no one commands here but i and my father go on charlotwhere is the bird  keep her fast giles  osmond  you i can command  come away my lord said osmond interrupting richards order before it was issued we have no right to interfere here and cannot hinder it come away from such a foul sight  shame on you too osmond to let such a deed be done without hindering it exclaimed richard breaking from him and rushing on the man who carried the hot irons  the french servants were not very willing to exert their strength against the duke of normandy and richards onset taking the man by surprise made him drop the tongs  lothaire both afraid and enraged caught them up as a weapon of defence and hardly knowing what he did struck full at richards face with the hot iron happily it missed his eye and the heat had a little abated but as it touched his cheek it burnt him sufficiently to cause considerable pain with a cry of passion he flew at lothaire shook him with all his might and ended by throwing him at his length on the pavement  but this was the last of richards exploits for he was at the same moment captured by his squire and borne off struggling and kicking as if osmond had been his greatest foe but the young normans arms were like iron round him and he gave over his resistance sooner because at that moment a whirring flapping sound was heard and the poor hawk rose high higher over their heads in ever lessening circles far away from her enemies  the servant who held her had relaxed his grasp in the consternation caused by lothaires fall and she was mounting up and up spying it might be her way to her native rocks in iceland with the yellow eyes which richard had saved  safe safe cried richard joyfully ceasing his struggles  oh how glad i am  that young villain should never have hurt her  put me down osmond what are you doing with me  saving you from yourno i cannot call it follyi would hardly have had you stand still to see suchbut let me see your face  it is nothing  i dont care now the hawk is safe said richard though he could hardly keep his lips in order and was obliged to wink very hard with his eyes to keep the tears out now that he had leisure to feel the smarting but it would have been far beneath a northman to complain and he stood bearing it gallantly and pinching his fingers tightly together while osmond knelt down to examine the hurt  tis not much said he talking to himself half bruise half burni wish my grandmother was herehowever it cant last long  tis right you bear it like a little berserkar and it is no bad thing that you should have a scar to show that they may not be able to say you did all the damage  will it always leave a mark said richard  i am afraid they will call me richard of the scarred cheek when we get back to normandy  never mind if they doit will not be a mark to be ashamed of even if it does last which i do not believe it will  oh no i am so glad the gallant falcon is out of his reach replied richard in a somewhat quivering voice  does it smart much  well come and bathe it with cold wateror shall i take you to one of the queens women  nothe water said richard and to the fountain in the court they went but osmond had only just begun to splash the cheek with the halffrozen water with a sort of rough kindness afraid at once of teaching the duke to be effeminate and of not being as tender to him as dame astrida would have wished when a messenger came in haste from the king commanding the presence of the duke of normandy and his squire  lothaire was standing between his father and mother on their thronelike seat leaning against the queen who had her arm round him his face was red and glazed with tears and he still shook with subsiding sobs  it was evident he was just recovering from a passionate crying fit  how is this began the king as richard entered  what means this conduct my lord of normandy  know you what you have done in striking the heir of france  i might imprison you this instant in a dungeon where you would never see the light of day  then bernard de harcourt would come and set me free fearlessly answered richard  do you bandy words with me child ask prince lothaires pardon instantly or you shall rue it  i have done nothing to ask his pardon for  it would have been cruel and cowardly in me to let him put out the poor hawks eyes said richard with a northmans stern contempt for pain disdaining to mention his own burnt cheek which indeed the king might have seen plainly enough  hawks eyes repeated the king  speak the truth sir duke do not add slander to your other faults                         picture false accusation  i have spoken the truthi always speak it cried richard  whoever says otherwise lies in his throat  osmond here hastily interfered and desired permission to tell the whole story  the hawk was a valuable bird and louiss face darkened when he heard what lothaire had purposed for the prince had in telling his own story made it appear that richard had been the aggressor by insisting on letting the falcon fly  osmond finished by pointing to the mark on richards cheek so evidently a burn as to be proof that hot iron had played a part in the matter  the king looked at one of his own squires and asked his account and he with some hesitation could not but reply that it was as the young sieur de centeville had said  thereupon louis angrily reproved his own people for having assisted the prince in trying to injure the hawk called for the chief falconer rated him for not better attending to his birds and went forth with him to see if the hawk could yet be recaptured leaving the two boys neither punished nor pardoned  so you have escaped for this once said gerberge coldly to richard you had better beware another time  come with me my poor darling lothaire  she led her son away to her own apartments and the french squires began to grumble to each other complaints of the impossibility of pleasing their lords since if they contradicted prince lothaire he was so spiteful that he was sure to set the queen against them and that was far worse in the end than the kings displeasure  osmond in the meantime took richard to recommence bathing his face and presently carloman ran out to pity him wonder at him for not crying and say he was glad the poor hawk had escaped  the cheek continued inflamed and painful for some time and there was a deep scar long after the pain had ceased but richard thought little of it after the first and would have scorned to bear illwill to lothaire for the injury  lothaire left off taunting richard with his norman accent and calling him a young seaking  he had felt his strength and was afraid of him but he did not like him the betterhe never played with him willinglyscowled and looked dark and jealous if his father or if any of the great nobles took the least notice of the little duke and whenever he was out of hearing talked against him with all his natural spitefulness  richard liked lothaire quite as little contemning almost equally his cowardly ways and his imperious disposition  since he had been duke richard had been somewhat inclined to grow imperious himself though always kept under restraint by fru astridas good training and count bernards authority and his whole generous nature would have revolted against treating alberic or indeed his meanest vassal as lothaire used the unfortunate children who were his playfellows  perhaps this made him look on with great horror at the tyranny which lothaire exercised at any rate he learnt to abhor it more and to make many resolutions against ordering people about uncivilly when once he should be in normandy again he often interfered to protect the poor boys and generally with success for the prince was afraid of provoking such another shake as richard had once given him and though he generally repaid himself on his victim in the end he yielded for the time  carloman whom richard often saved from his brothers unkindness clung closer and closer to him went with him everywhere tried to do all he did grew very fond of osmond and liked nothing better than to sit by richard in some wide windowseat in the evening after supper and listen to richards version of some of fru astridas favourite tales or hear the neverending history of sports at centeville or at rollos tower or settle what great things they would both do when they were grown up and richard was ruling normandyperhaps go to the holy land together and slaughter an unheardof host of giants and dragons on the way  in the meantime however poor carloman gave small promise of being able to perform great exploits for he was very small for his age and often ailing soon tired and never able to bear much rough play richard who had never had any reason to learn to forbear did not at first understand this and made carloman cry several times with his roughness and violence but this always vexed him so much that he grew careful to avoid such things for the future and gradually learnt to treat his poor little weakly friend with a gentleness and patience at which osmond used to marvel and which he would hardly have been taught in his prosperity at home  between carloman and osmond he was thus tolerably happy at laon but he missed his own dear friends and the loving greetings of his vassals and longed earnestly to be at rouen asking osmond almost every night when they should go back to which osmond could only answer that he must pray that heaven would be pleased to bring them home safely  osmond in the meantime kept a vigilant watch for anything that might seem to threaten danger to his lord but at present there was no token of any evil being intended the only point in which louis did not seem to be fulfilling his promises to the normans was that no preparations were made for attacking the count of flanders  at easter the court was visited by hugh the white the great count of paris the most powerful man in france and who was only prevented by his own loyalty and forbearance from taking the crown from the feeble and degenerate race of charlemagne  he had been a firm friend of william longsword and osmond remarked how on his arrival the king took care to bring richard forward talk of him affectionately and caress him almost as much as he had done at rouen  the count himself was really kind and affectionate to the little duke he kept him by his side and seemed to like to stroke down his long flaxen hair looking in his face with a grave mournful expression as if seeking for a likeness to his father he soon asked about the scar which the burn had left and the king was obliged to answer hastily it was an accident a disaster that had chanced in a boyish quarrel  louis in fact was uneasy and appeared to be watching the count of paris the whole time of his visit so as to prevent him from having any conversation in private with the other great vassals assembled at the court  hugh did not seem to perceive this and acted as if he was entirely at his ease but at the same time he watched his opportunity  one evening after supper he came up to the window where richard and carloman were as usual deep in story telling he sat down on the stone seat and taking richard on his knee he asked if he had any greetings for the count de harcourt  how richards face lighted up  oh sir he cried are you going to normandy  not yet my boy but it may be that i may have to meet old harcourt at the elm of gisors  oh if i was but going with you  i wish i could take you but it would scarcely do for me to steal the heir of normandy  what shall i tell him  tell him whispered richard edging himself close to the count and trying to reach his ear tell him that i am sorry now that i was sullen when he reproved me  i know he was right  and sir if he brings with him a certain huntsman with a long hooked nose whose name is walter 12 tell him i am sorry i used to order him about so unkindly and tell him to bear my greetings to fru astrida and sir eric and to alberic  shall i tell him how you have marked your face  no said richard he would think me a baby to care about such a thing as that  the count asked how it happened and richard told the story for he felt as if he could tell the kind count anythingit was almost like that last evening that he had sat on his fathers knee  hugh ended by putting his arm round him and saying well my little duke i am as glad as you are the gallant bird is safeit will be a tale for my own little hugh and eumacette 13 at homeand you must one day be friends with them as your father has been with me  and now do you think your squire could come to my chamber late this evening when the household is at rest  richard undertook that osmond should do so and the count setting him down again returned to the dais  osmond before going to the count that evening ordered sybald to come and guard the dukes door  it was a long conference for hugh had come to laon chiefly for the purpose of seeing how it went with his friends son and was anxious to know what osmond thought of the matter  they agreed that at present there did not seem to be any evil intended and that it rather appeared as if louis wished only to keep him as a hostage for the tranquillity of the borders of normandy but hugh advised that osmond should maintain a careful watch and send intelligence to him on the first token of mischief  the next morning the count of paris quitted laon and everything went on in the usual course till the feast of whitsuntide when there was always a great display of splendour at the french court  the crown vassals generally came to pay their duty and go with the king to church and there was a state banquet at which the king and queen wore their crowns and every one sat in great magnificence according to their rank  the grand procession to church was over  richard had walked with carloman the prince richly dressed in blue embroidered with golden fleurdelys and richard in scarlet with a gold cross on his breast the beautiful service was over they had returned to the castle and there the seneschal was marshalling the goodly and noble company to the banquet when horses feet were heard at the gate announcing some fresh arrival  the seneschal went to receive the guests and presently was heard ushering in the noble prince arnulf count of flanders  richards face became palehe turned from carloman by whose side he had been standing and walked straight out of the hall and up the stairs closely followed by osmond  in a few minutes there was a knock at the door of his chamber and a french knight stood there saying comes not the duke to the banquet  no answered osmond he eats not with the slayer of his father  the king will take it amiss for the sake of the child you had better beware said the frenchman hesitating  he had better beware himself exclaimed osmond indignantly how he brings the treacherous murderer of william longsword into the presence of a freeborn norman unless he would see him slain where he stands  were it not for the boy i would challenge the traitor this instant to single combat  well i can scarce blame you said the knight but you had best have a care how you tread  farewell  richard had hardly time to express his indignation and his wishes that he was a man before another message came through a groom of lothaires train that the duke must fast if he would not consent to feast with the rest  tell prince lothaire replied richard that i am not such a glutton as hei had rather fast than be choked with eating with arnulf  all the rest of the day richard remained in his own chamber resolved not to run the risk of meeting with arnulf  the squire remained with him in this voluntary imprisonment and they occupied themselves as best they could with furbishing osmonds armour and helping each other out in repeating some of the sagas  they once heard a great uproar in the court and both were very anxious to learn its cause but they did not know it till late in the afternoon  carloman crept up to themhere i am at last he exclaimed  here richard i have brought you some bread as you had no dinner it was all i could bring  i saved it under the table lest lothaire should see it  richard thanked carloman with all his heart and being very hungry was glad to share the bread with osmond  he asked how long the wicked count was going to stay and rejoiced to hear he was going away the next morning and the king was going with him  what was that great noise in the court asked richard  i scarcely like to tell you returned carloman  richard however begged to hear and carloman was obliged to tell that the two norman grooms sybald and henry had quarrelled with the flemings of arnulfs train there had been a fray which had ended in the death of three flemings a frank and of sybald himselfand where was henry alas there was more ill newsthe king had sentenced henry to die and he had been hanged immediately  dark with anger and sorrow grew young richards face he had been fond of his two norman attendants he trusted to their attachment and he would have wept for their loss even if it had happened in any other way but now when it had been caused by their enmity to his fathers foes the flemingswhen one had fallen overwhelmed by numbers and the other been condemned hastily cruelly unjustly it was too much and he almost choked with grief and indignation  why had he not been there to claim henry as his own vassal and if he could not save him at least bid him farewell  then he would have broken out in angry threats but he felt his own helplessness and was ashamed and he could only shed tears of passionate grief refusing all carlomans attempts to comfort him osmond was even more concerned he valued the two normans extremely for their courage and faithfulness and had relied on sending intelligence by their means to rouen in case of need  it appeared to him as if the first opportunity had been seized of removing these protectors from the little duke and as if the designs whatever they might be which had been formed against him were about to take effect  he had little doubt that his own turn would be the next but he was resolved to endure anything rather than give the smallest opportunity of removing him to bear even insults with patience and to remember that in his care rested the sole hope of safety for his charge  that danger was fast gathering around them became more evident every day especially after the king and arnulf had gone away together  it was very hot weather and richard began to weary after the broad cool river at rouen where he used to bathe last summer and one evening he persuaded his squire to go down with him to the oise which flowed along some meadow ground about a quarter of a mile from the castle but they had hardly set forth before three or four attendants came running after them with express orders from the queen that they should return immediately they obeyed and found her standing in the castle hall looking greatly incensed  what means this she asked angrily  knew you not that the king has left commands that the duke quits not the castle in his absence  i was only going as far as the river began richard but gerberge cut him short  silence childi will hear no excuses  perhaps you think sieur de centeville that you may take liberties in the kings absence but i tell you that if you are found without the walls again it shall be at your peril ay and his  ill have those haughty eyes put out if you disobey  she turned away and lothaire looked at them with his air of gratified malice  you will not lord it over your betters much longer young pirate said he as he followed his mother afraid to stay to meet the anger he might have excited by the taunt he could not deny himself the pleasure of making but richard who six months ago could not brook a slight disappointment or opposition had in his present life of restraint danger and vexation learnt to curb the first outbreak of temper and to bear patiently instead of breaking out into passion and threats and now his only thought was of his beloved squire  oh osmond  osmond he exclaimed they shall not hurt you  i will never go out again  i will never speak another hasty word  i will never affront the prince if they will but leave you with me 14     chapter viii   it was a fine summer evening and richard and carloman were playing at ball on the steps of the castlegate when a voice was heard from beneath begging for alms from the noble princes in the name of the blessed virgin and the two boys saw a pilgrim standing at the gate wrapt in a long robe of serge with a staff in his hand surmounted by a cross a scrip at his girdle and a broad shady hat which he had taken off as he stood making low obeisances and asking charity  come in holy pilgrim said carloman  it is late and you shall sup and rest here tonight  blessings from heaven light on you noble prince replied the pilgrim and at that moment richard shouted joyfully a norman a norman tis my own dear speech  oh are you not from normandy  osmond osmond he comes from home  my lord my own lord exclaimed the pilgrim and kneeling on one knee at the foot of the steps he kissed the hand which his young duke held out to himthis is joy unlooked for  walterwalter the huntsman cried richard  is it you  oh how is fru astrida and all at home  well my lord and wearying to know how it is with you began walterbut a very different tone exclaimed from behind the pilgrim what is all this  who is stopping my way  what  richard would be king and more would he  more insolence  it was lothaire returning with his attendants from the chase in by no means an amiable mood for he had been disappointed of his game  he is a normana vassal of richards own said carloman  a norman is he  i thought we had got rid of the robbers  we want no robbers here  scourge him soundly perron and teach him how to stop my way  he is a pilgrim my lord suggested one of the followers  i care not ill have no normans here coming spying in disguise scourge him i say dog that he is  away with him  a spy a spy  no norman is scourged in my sight said richard darting forwards and throwing himself between walter and the woodsman who was preparing to obey lothaire just in time to receive on his own bare neck the sharp cutting leathern thong which raised a long red streak along its course lothaire laughed  my lord duke  what have you done  oh leave methis befits you not cried walter extremely distressed but richard had caught hold of the whip and called out away away run haste haste and the words were repeated at once by osmond carloman and many of the french who though afraid to disobey the prince were unwilling to violate the sanctity of a pilgrims person and the norman seeing there was no help for it obeyed the french made way for him and he effected his escape while lothaire after a great deal of storming and raging went up to his mother to triumph in the cleverness with which he had detected a norman spy in disguise  lothaire was not far wrong walter had really come to satisfy himself as to the safety of the little duke and try to gain an interview with osmond  in the latter purpose he failed though he lingered in the neighbourhood of laon for several days for osmond never left the duke for an instant and he was as has been shown a close prisoner in all but the name within the walls of the castle  the pilgrim had however the opportunity of picking up tidings which made him perceive the true state of things he learnt the deaths of sybald and henry the alliance between the king and arnulf and the restraint and harshness with which the duke was treated and with this intelligence he went in haste to normandy  soon after his arrival a three days fast was observed throughout the dukedom and in every church from the cathedral of bayeux to the smallest and rudest village shrine crowds of worshippers were kneeling imploring many of them with tears that god would look on them in his mercy restore to them their prince and deliver the child out of the hands of his enemies  how earnest and sorrowful were the prayers offered at centeville may well be imagined and at montemar sur epte the anxiety was scarcely less  indeed from the time the evil tidings arrived alberic grew so restless and unhappy and so anxious to do something that at last his mother set out with him on a pilgrimage to the abbey of jumieges to pray for the rescue of his dear little duke  in the meantime louis had sent notice to laon that he should return home in a weeks time and richard rejoiced at the prospect for the king had always been less unkind to him than the queen and he hoped to be released from his captivity within the castle  just at this time he became very unwell it might have been only the effect of the life of unwonted confinement which he had lately led that was beginning to tell on his health but after being heavy and uncomfortable for a day or two without knowing what was the matter with him he was one night attacked with high fever  osmond was dreadfully alarmed knowing nothing at all of the treatment of illness and what was worse fully persuaded that the poor child had been poisoned and therefore resolved not to call any assistance he hung over him all night expecting each moment to see him expireready to tear his hair with despair and fury and yet obliged to restrain himself to the utmost quietness and gentleness to soothe the suffering of the sick child  through that night richard either tossed about on his narrow bed or when his restlessness desired the change sat leaning his aching head on osmonds breast too oppressed and miserable to speak or think  when the day dawned on them and he was still too ill to leave the room messengers were sent for him and osmond could no longer conceal the fact of his sickness but parleyed at the door keeping out every one he could and refusing all offers of attendance  he would not even admit carloman though richard hearing his voice begged to see him and when a proposal was sent from the queen that a skilful old nurse should visit and prescribe for the patient he refused with all his might and when he had shut the door walked up and down muttering ay ay the witch coming to finish what she has begun  all that day and the next richard continued very ill and osmond waited on him very assiduously never closing his eyes for a moment but constantly telling his beads whenever the boy did not require his attendance  at last richard fell asleep slept long and soundly for some hours and waked much better  osmond was in a transport of joy thanks to heaven they shall fail for this time and they shall never have another chance  may heaven be with us still  richard was too weak and weary to ask what he meant and for the next few days osmond watched him with the utmost care  as for food now that richard could eat again osmond would not hear of his touching what was sent for him from the royal table but always went down himself to procure food in the kitchen where he said he had a friend among the cooks who would he thought scarcely poison him intentionally  when richard was able to cross the room he insisted on his always fastening the door with his dagger and never opening to any summons but his own not even prince carlomans richard wondered but he was obliged to obey and he knew enough of the perils around him to perceive the reasonableness of osmonds caution  thus several days had passed the king had returned and richard was so much recovered that he had become very anxious to be allowed to go down stairs again instead of remaining shut up there but still osmond would not consent though richard had done nothing all day but walk round the room to show how strong he was  now my lord guard the doortake care said osmond you have no loss today for the king has brought home herluin of montreuil whom you would be almost as loth to meet as the fleming  and tell your beads while i am gone that the saints may bring us out of our peril  osmond was absent nearly half an hour and when he returned brought on his shoulders a huge bundle of straw  what is this for exclaimed richard  i wanted my supper and you have brought straw  here is your supper said osmond throwing down the straw and producing a bag with some bread and meat  what should you say my lord if we should sup in normandy tomorrow night  in normandy cried richard springing up and clapping his hands  in normandy  oh osmond did you say in normandy  shall we shall we really  oh joy joy  is count bernard come  will the king let us go  hush hush sir  it must be our own doing it will all fail if you are not silent and prudent and we shall be undone  i will do anything to get home again  eat first said osmond  but what are you going to do  i will not be as foolish as i was when you tried to get me safe out of rollos tower  but i should like to wish carloman farewell  that must not be said osmond we should not have time to escape if they did not still believe you very ill in bed  i am sorry not to wish carloman goodbye repeated richard but we shall see fru astrida again and sir eric and alberic must come back oh do let us go  o normandy dear normandy  richard could hardly eat for excitement while osmond hastily made his arrangements girding on his sword and giving richard his dagger to put into his belt  he placed the remainder of the provisions in his wallet threw a thick purple cloth mantle over the duke and then desired him to lie down on the straw which he had brought in  i shall hide you in it he said and carry you through the hall as if i was going to feed my horse  oh they will never guess cried richard laughing  i will be quite stilli will make no noisei will hold my breath  yes mind you do not move hand or foot or rustle the straw  it is no playit is life or death said osmond as he disposed the straw round the little boy  there can you breathe  yes said richards voice from the midst  am i quite hidden  entirely  now remember whatever happens do not move  may heaven protect us  now the saints be with us  richard from the interior of the bundle heard osmond set open the door then he felt himself raised from the ground osmond was carrying him along down the stairs the ends of the straw crushing and sweeping against the wall  the only way to the outer door was through the hall and here was the danger  richard heard voices steps loud singing and laughter as if feasting was going on then some one said tending your horse sieur de centeville  yes osmond made answer  you know since we lost our grooms the poor black would come off badly did i not attend to him  presently came carlomans voice o osmond de centeville is richard better  he is better my lord i thank you but hardly yet out of danger  oh i wish he was well  and when will you let me come to him osmond indeed i would sit quiet and not disturb him  it may not be yet my lord though the duke loves you wellhe told me so but now  did he  oh tell him i love him very muchbetter than any one hereand it is very dull without him  tell him so osmond  richard could hardly help calling out to his dear little carloman but he remembered the peril of osmonds eyes and the queens threat and held his peace with some vague notion that some day he would make carloman king of france  in the meantime half stifled with the straw he felt himself carried on down the steps across the court and then he knew from the darkness and the changed sound of osmonds tread that they were in the stable  osmond laid him carefully down and whisperedall right so far  you can breathe  not well  cant you let me out  not yetnot for worlds  now tell me if i put you face downwards for i cannot see  he laid the living heap of straw across the saddle bound it on then led out the horse gazing round cautiously as he did so but the whole of the people of the castle were feasting and there was no one to watch the gates  richard heard the hollow sound of the hoofs as the drawbridge was crossed and knew that he was free but still osmond held his arm over him and would not let him move for some distance  then just as richard felt as if he could endure the stifling of the straw and his uncomfortable position not a moment longer osmond stopped the horse took him down laid him on the grass and released him  he gazed around they were in a little wood evening twilight was just coming on and the birds sang sweetly  free freethis is freedom cried richard leaping up in the delicious cool evening breeze the queen and lothaire and that grim room all far behind  not so far yet said osmond you must not call yourself safe till the epte is between us and them  into the saddle my lord we must ride for our lives                       picture escape from captivity  osmond helped the duke to mount and sprang to the saddle behind him set spurs to the horse and rode on at a quick rate though not at full speed as he wished to spare the horse  the twilight faded the stars came out and still he rode his arm round the child who as night advanced grew weary and often sunk into a sort of half doze conscious all the time of the trot of the horse  but each step was taking him further from queen gerberge and nearer to normandy and what recked he of weariness  onon the stars grew pale again and the first pink light of dawn showed in the eastern sky the sun rose mounted higher and higher and the day grew hotter the horse went more slowly stumbled and though osmond halted and loosed the girth he only mended his pace for a little while  osmond looked grievously perplexed but they had not gone much further before a party of merchants came in sight winding their way with a long train of loaded mules and stout men to guard them across the plains like an eastern caravan in the desert  they gazed in surprise at the tall young norman holding the child upon the wornout warhorse  sir merchant said osmond to the first see you this steed  better horse never was ridden but he is sorely spent and we must make speed let me barter him with you for yonder stout palfrey  he is worth twice as much but i cannot stop to chafferay or no at once  the merchant seeing the value of osmonds gallant black accepted the offer and osmond removing his saddle and placing richard on his new steed again mounted and on they went through the country which osmonds eye had marked with the sagacity men acquire by living in wild unsettled places  the great marshes were now far less dangerous than in the winter and they safely crossed them  there had as yet been no pursuit and osmonds only fear was for his little charge who not having recovered his full strength since his illness began to suffer greatly from fatigue in the heat of that broiling summer day and leant against osmond patiently but very wearily without moving or looking up he scarcely revived when the sun went down and a cool breeze sprang up which much refreshed osmond himself and still more did it refresh the squire to see at length winding through the green pastures a blue river on the opposite bank of which rose a high rocky mound bearing a castle with many a turret and battlement  the epte the epte  there is normandy sir  look up and see your own dukedom  normandy cried richard sitting upright  oh my own home  still the epte was wide and deep and the peril was not yet ended  osmond looked anxiously and rejoiced to see marks of cattle as if it had been forded  we must try it he said and dismounting he waded in leading the horse and firmly holding richard in the saddle deep they went the water rose to richards feet then to the horses neck then the horse was swimming and osmond too still keeping his firm hold then there was ground again the force of the current was less and they were gaining the bank  at that instant however they perceived two men aiming at them with crossbows from the castle and another standing on the bank above them who called out hold  none pass the ford of montemar without permission of the noble dame yolande  ha bertrand the seneschal is that you returned osmond  who calls me by my name replied the seneschal  it is i osmond de centeville  open your gates quickly sir seneschal for here is the duke sorely in need of rest and refreshment  the duke exclaimed bertrand hurrying down to the landingplace and throwing off his cap  the duke the duke rang out the shout from the menatarms on the battlements above and in an instant more osmond had led the horse up from the water and was exclaiming look up my lord look up  you are in your own dukedom again and this is alberics castle  welcome indeed most noble lord duke  blessings on the day cried the seneschal  what joy for my lady and my young lord  he is sorely weary said osmond looking anxiously at richard who even at the welcome cries that showed so plainly that he was in his own normandy scarcely raised himself or spoke  he had been very sick ere i brought him away  i doubt me they sought to poison him and i vowed not to tarry at laon another hour after he was fit to move  but cheer up my lord you are safe and free now and here is the good dame de montemar to tend you far better than a rude squire like me  alas no said the seneschal our dame is gone with young alberic on a pilgrimage to jumieges to pray for the dukes safety  what joy for them to know that their prayers have been granted  osmond however could scarcely rejoice so alarmed was he at the extreme weariness and exhaustion of his charge who when they brought him into the castle hall hardly spoke or looked and could not eat  they carried him up to alberics bed where he tossed about restlessly too tired to sleep  alas alas said osmond i have been too hasty  i have but saved him from the franks to be his death by my own imprudence  hush  sieur de centeville said the seneschals wife coming into the room  to talk in that manner is the way to be his death indeed  leave the child to mehe is only overweary  osmond was sure his duke was among friends and would have been glad to trust him to a woman but richard had but one instinct left in all his weakness and exhaustionto cling close to osmond as if he felt him his only friend and protector for he was as yet too much worn out to understand that he was in normandy and safe  for two or three hours therefore osmond and the seneschals wife watched on each side of his bed soothing his restlessness until at length he became quiet and at last dropped sound asleep  the sun was high in the heavens when richard awoke  he turned on his strawfilled crib and looked up  it was not the tapestried walls of his chamber at laon that met his opening eyes but the rugged stone and tall loophole window of a turret chamber  osmond de centeville lay on the floor by his side in the sound sleep of one overcome by long watching and weariness  and what more did richard see  it was the bright face and sparkling eyes of alberic de montemar who was leaning against the foot of his bed gazing earnestly as he watched for his waking  there was a cryalberic alberic  my lord my lord richard sat up and held out both arms and alberic flung himself into them  they hugged each other and uttered broken exclamations and screams of joy enough to have awakened any sleeper but one so wearied out as osmond  and is it true  oh am i really in normandy again cried richard  yes yesoh yes my lord  you are at montemar  everything here is yours  the bartailed hawk is quite well and my mother will be here this evening she let me ride on the instant we heard the news  we rode long and late and i was very weary said richard but i dont care now we are at home  but i can hardly believe it  oh alberic it has been very dreary  see here my lord said alberic standing by the window  look here and you will know you are at home again  richard bounded to the window and what a sight met his eyes the castle court was thronged with menatarms and horses the morning sun sparkling on many a burnished hauberk and tall conical helmet and above them waved many a banner and pennon that richard knew full well  there there he shouted aloud with glee  oh there is the horseshoe of ferrieres and there the chequers of warenne  oh and best of all there isthere is our own red pennon of centeville  o alberic  alberic is sir eric here i must go down to him  bertrand sent out notice to them all as soon as you came to come and guard our castle said alberic lest the franks should pursue you but you are safe nowsafe as norman spears can make youthanks be to god  yes thanks to god said richard crossing himself and kneeling reverently for some minutes while he repeated his latin prayer then rising and looking at alberic he said i must thank him indeed for he has saved osmond and me from the cruel king and queen and i must try to be a less hasty and overbearing boy than i was when i went away for i vowed that so i would be if ever i came back  poor osmond how soundly he sleeps come alberic show me the way to sir eric  and holding alberics hand richard left the room and descended the stairs to the castle hall  many of the norman knights and barons in full armour were gathered there but richard looked only for one  he knew sir erics grizzled hair and blue inlaid armour though his back was towards him and in a moment before his entrance had been perceived he sprang towards him and with outstretched arms exclaimed sir ericdear sir eric here i am osmond is safe  and is fru astrida well  the old baron turned  my child he exclaimed and clasped him in his mailed arms while the tears flowed down his rugged cheeks  blessed be god that you are safe and that my son has done his duty  and is fru astrida well  yes right well since she heard of your safety  but look round my lord it befits not a duke to be clinging thus round an old mans neck see how many of your true vassals be here to guard you from the villain franks  richard stood up and held out his hand bowing courteously and acknowledging the greetings of each bold baron with a grace and readiness he certainly had not when he left normandy  he was taller too and though still pale and not dressed with much care since he had hurried on his clothes with no help but albericsthough his hair was rough and disordered and the scar of the burn had not yet faded from his checkyet still with his bright blue eyes glad face and upright form he was a princely promising boy and the norman knights looked at him with pride and joy more especially when unprompted he said i thank you gallant knights for coming to guard me  i do not fear the whole french host now i am among my own true normans  sir eric led him to the door of the hall to the top of the steps that the menatarms might see him and then such a shout rang out of long live duke richardblessings on the little dukethat it echoed and came back again from the hills aroundit pealed from the old towerit roused osmond from his sleepand if anything more had been wanting to do so it made richard feel that he was indeed in a land where every heart glowed with loyal love for him  before the shout had died away a buglehorn was heard winding before the gate and sir eric saying it is the count of harcourts note sent bertrand to open the gates in haste while alberic followed as lord of the castle to receive the count  the old count rode into the court and to the foot of the steps where he dismounted alberic holding his stirrup  he had not taken many steps upwards before richard came voluntarily to meet him which he had never done before held out his hand and said welcome count bernard welcome  thank you for coming to guard me  i am very glad to see you once more  ah my young lord said bernard i am right glad to see you out of the clutches of the franks you know friend from foe now methinks  yes indeed i do count bernard  i know you meant kindly by me and that i ought to have thanked you and not been angry when you reproved me  wait one moment sir count there is one thing that i promised myself to say if ever i came safe to my own dear home waltermauricejeannotall you of my household and of sir ericsi know before i went away i was often no good lord to you i was passionate and proud and overbearing but god has punished me for it when i was far away among my enemies and sick and lonely  i am very sorry for it and i hope you will pardon me for i will strive and i hope god will help me never to be proud and passionate again  there sir eric said bernard you hear what the boy says  if he speaks it out so bold and free without bidding and if he holds to what he says i doubt it not that he shall not grieve for his journey to france and that we shall see him in all things such a prince as his father of blessed memory  you must thank osmond for me said richard as osmond came down awakened at length  it is osmond who has helped me to bear my troubles and as to saving me why he flew away with me even like an old eagle with its eaglet  i say osmond you must ever after this wear a pair of wings on shield and pennon to show how well we managed our flight 15  as you will my lord said osmond half asleep but twas a good long flight at a stretch and i trust never to have to fly before your foes or mine again  what a glad summers day was that even the three hours spent in council did but renew the relish with which richard visited alberics treasures told his adventures and showed the accomplishments he had learnt at laon  the evening was more joyous still for the castle gates were opened first to receive dame yolande montemar and not above a quarter of an hour afterwards the drawbridge was lowered to admit the followers of centeville and in front of them appeared fru astridas own high cap richard made but one bound into her arms and was clasped to her breast then held off at armslength that she might see how much he was grown and pity his scar then hugged closer than ever but taking another look she declared that osmond left his hair like king harald horridlocks 16 and drawing an ivory comb from her pouch began to pull out the thick tangles hurting him to a degree that would once have made him rebel but now he only fondled her the more  as to osmond when he knelt before her she blessed him and sobbed over him and blamed him for overtiring her darling all in one and assuredly when night closed in and richard had as of old told his beads beside her knee the happiest boy in normandy was its little duke     chapter ix   montemar was too near the frontier to be a safe abode for the little duke and his uncle count hubert of senlis agreed with bernard the dane that he would be more secure beyond the limits of his own duchy which was likely soon to be the scene of war and sorely against his will he was sent in secret under a strong escort first to the castle of coucy and afterwards to senlis  his consolation was that he was not again separated from his friends alberic sir eric and even fru astrida accompanied him as well as his constant follower osmond  indeed the baron would hardly bear that he should be out of his sight and he was still so carefully watched that it was almost like a captivity  never even in the summer days was he allowed to go beyond the castle walls and his guardians would fain have had it supposed that the castle did not contain any such guest  osmond did not give him so much of his company as usual but was always at work in the armourers forgea low vaulted chamber opening into the castle court  richard and alberic were very curious to know what he did there but he fastened the door with an iron bar and they were forced to content themselves with listening to the strokes of the hammer keeping time to the voice that sang out loud and cheerily the song of sigurds sword and the maiden sleeping within the ring of flame  fru astrida said osmond was quite rightno good weaponsmith ever toiled with open doors and when the boys asked him questions as to his work he only smiled and said that they would see what it was when the call to arms should come  they thought it near at hand for tidings came that louis had assembled his army and marched into normandy to recover the person of the young duke and to seize the country  no summons however arrived but a message came instead that rouen had been surrendered into the bands of the king  richard shed indignant tears  my fathers castle  my own city in the hands of the foe  bernard is a traitor then  none shall hinder me from so calling him  why did we trust him  never fear lord duke said osmond  when you come to the years of knighthood your own sword shall right you in spite of all the false danes and falser franks in the land  what you too son osmond  i deemed you carried a cooler brain than to miscall one who was true to rollos race before you or yon varlet were born said the old baron  he has yielded my dukedom  it is miscalling to say he is aught but a traitor cried richard  vile treacherous favourseeking  peace peace my lord said the baron  bernard has more in that wary head of his than your young wits or my old ones can unwind  what he is doing i may not guess but i gage my life his heart is right  richard was silent remembering he had been once unjust but he grieved heartily when he thought of the french in rollos tower and it was further reported that the king was about to share normandy among his french vassals  a fresh outcry broke out in the little garrison of senlis but sir eric still persisted in his trust in his friend bernard even when he heard that centeville was marked out as the prey of the fat french count who had served for a hostage at rouen  what say you now my lord said he after a conference with a messenger at the gate  the black raven has spread its wings  fifty keels are in the seine and harald bluetooths long serpent at the head of them  the king of denmark come to my aid  ay that he is  come at bernards secret call to right you and put you on your fathers seat  now call honest harcourt a traitor because he gave not up your fair dukedom to the flame and sword  no traitor to me said richard pausing  no verily but what more would you say  i think when i come to my dukedom i will not be so politic said richard  i will be an open friend or an open foe  the boy grows too sharp for us said sir eric smiling but it was spoken like his father  he grows more like his blessed father each day said fru astrida  but the danes father the danes said osmond  blows will be passing now  i may join the host and win my spurs  with all my heart returned the baron so my lord here gives you leave would that i could leave him and go with you  it would do my very spirit good but to set foot in a northern keel once more  i would fain see what these men of the north are said osmond  oh they are only danes not norsemen and there are no vikings such as once were when ragnar laid waste  son son what talk is this for the childs ears broke in fru astrida are these words for a christian baron  your pardon mother said the grey warrior in all humility but my blood thrills to hear of a northern fleet at hand and to think of osmond drawing sword under a seaking  the next morning osmonds steed was led to the door and such menatarms as could be spared from the garrison of senlis were drawn up in readiness to accompany him  the boys stood on the steps wishing they were old enough to be warriors and wondering what had become of him until at length the sound of an opening door startled them and there in the low archway of the smithy the red furnace glowing behind him stood osmond clad in bright steel the links of his hauberk reflecting the light and on his helmet a pair of golden wings while the same device adorned his long pointed kiteshaped shield  your wings our wings cried richard the bearing of centeville  may they fly after the foe not before him said sir eric  speed thee well my sonlet not our danish cousins say we learn frank graces instead of northern blows  with such farewells osmond quitted senlis while the two boys hastened to the battlements to watch him as long as he remained in view  the highest tower became their principal resort and their eyes were constantly on the heath where he had disappeared but days passed and they grew weary of the watch and betook themselves to games in the castle court  one day alberic in the character of a dragon was lying on his back panting hard so as to be supposed to cast out volumes of flame and smoke at richard the knight who with a stick for a lance and a wooden sword was waging fierce war when suddenly the dragon paused sat up and pointed towards the warder on the tower  his horn was at his lips and in another moment the blast rang out through the castle  with a loud shout both boys rushed headlong up the turret stairs and came to the top so breathless that they could not even ask the warder what he saw  he pointed and the keeneyed alberic exclaimed i see look my lord a speck there on the heath  i do not see where oh where  he is behind the hillock now butoh there again  how fast he comes  it is like the flight of a bird said richard fast fast  if only it be not flight in earnest said alberic a little anxiously looking into the warders face for he was a borderer and tales of terror of the inroad of the vicomte du contentin were rife on the marches of the epte  no young sir said the warder no fear of that  i know how men ride when they flee from the battle  no indeed there is no discomfiture in the pace of that steed said sir eric who had by this time joined them  i see him clearer  i see the horse cried richard dancing with eagerness so that sir eric caught hold of him exclaiming you will be over the battlements hold still better hear of a battle lost than that  he bears somewhat in his hand said alberic  a banner or pennon said the warder methinks he rides like the young baron  he does  my brave boy  he has done good service exclaimed sir eric as the figure became more developed  the danes have seen how we train our young men  his wings bring good tidings said richard  let me go sir eric i must tell fru astrida  the drawbridge was lowered the portcullis raised and as all the dwellers in the castle stood gathered in the court in rode the warrior with the winged helm bearing in his hand a drooping banner lowering it as he entered it unfolded and displayed trailing on the ground at the feet of the little duke of normandy the golden lilies of france  a shout of amazement arose and all gathered round him asking hurried questions  a great victorythe king a prisonermontreuil slain  richard would not be denied holding his hand and leading him to the hall and there sitting around him they heard his tidings  his fathers first question was what he thought of their kinsmen the danes  rude comrades father i must own said osmond smiling and shaking his head  i could not pledge them in a skullgobletset in gold though it were  none the worse warriors said sir eric  ay ay and you were dainty and brooked not the hearty old fashion of tearing the whole sheep to pieces  you must needs cut your portion with the fine french knife at your girdle  osmond could not see that a man was braver for being a savage but he held his peace and richard impatiently begged to hear how the battle had gone and where it had been fought  on the bank of the dive said osmond  ah father you might well call old harcourt waryhis name might better have been foxheart than bearheart  he had sent to the franks a message of distress that the danes were on him in full force and to pray them to come to his aid  i trust there was no treachery  no foul dealing shall be wrought in my name exclaimed richard with such dignity of tone and manner as made all feel he was indeed their duke and forget his tender years  no or should i tell the tale with joy like this said osmond bernards view was to bring the kings together and let louis see you had friends to maintain your right  he sought but to avoid bloodshed  and how chanced it  the danes were encamped on the dive and so soon as the french came in sight bluetooth sent a messenger to louis to summon him to quit neustria and leave it to you its lawful owner  thereupon louis hoping to win him over with wily words invited him to hold a personal conference  where were you osmond  where i had scarce patience to be  bernard had gathered all of us honest normans together and arranged us beneath that standard of the king as if to repel his danish inroad  oh he was in all seeming handandglove with louis guiding him by his counsel and verily seeming his friend and best adviser  but in one thing he could not prevail  that ungrateful recreant herluin of montreuil came with the king hoping it seems to get his share of our spoils and when bernard advised the king to send him home since no true norman could bear the sight of him the hotheaded franks vowed no norman should hinder them from bringing whom they chose  so a tent was set up by the riverside wherein the two kings with bernard alan of brittany and count hugh held their meeting  we all stood without and the two hosts began to mingle together we normans making acquaintance with the danes  there was a redhaired wildlooking fellow who told me he had been with anlaff in england and spoke much of the doings of hako in norway when suddenly he pointed to a knight who was near speaking to a cotentinois and asked me his name  my blood boiled as i answered for it was montreuil himself  the cause of your dukes death said the dane ha ye normans are fallen sons of odin to see him yet live  you said i trust my son that we follow not the laws of odin said fru astrida  i had no space for a word grandmother the danes took the vengeance on themselves  in one moment they rushed on herluin with their axes and the unhappy man was dead  all was tumult every one struck without knowing at whom or for what  some shouted thor hulfe some dieu aide others montjoie st denis  northern blood against french that was all our guide  i found myself at the foot of this standard and had a hard combat for it but i bore it away at last  and the kings  they hurried out of the tent it seems to rejoin their men  louis mounted but you know of old my lord he is but an indifferent horseman and the beast carried him into the midst of the danes where king harald caught his bridle and delivered him to four knights to keep  whether he dealt secretly with them or whether they as they declared lost sight of him whilst plundering his tent i cannot say but when harald demanded him of them he was gone  gone is this what you call having the king prisoner  you shall hear  he rode four leagues and met one of the baser sort of rouennais whom he bribed to hide him in the isle of willows  however bernard made close inquiries found the fellow had been seen in speech with a french horseman pounced on his wife and children and threatened they should die if he did not disclose the secret  so the king was forced to come out of his hidingplace and is now fast guarded in rollos towera dane with a battleaxe on his shoulder keeping guard at every turn of the stairs  ha ha cried richard  i wonder how he likes it  i wonder if he remembers holding me up to the window and vowing that he meant me only good  when you believed him my lord said osmond slyly  i was a little boy then said richard proudly  why the very walls must remind him of his oath and how count bernard said as he dealt with me so might heaven deal with him  remember it my childbeware of broken vows said father lucas but remember it not in triumph over a fallen foe  it were better that all came at once to the chapel to bestow their thanksgivings where alone they are due     chapter x   after nearly a years captivity the king engaged to pay a ransom and until the terms could be arranged his two sons were to be placed as hostages in the hands of the normans whilst he returned to his own domains  the princes were to be sent to bayeux whither richard had returned under the charge of the centevilles and was now allowed to ride and walk abroad freely provided he was accompanied by a guard  i shall rejoice to have carloman and make him happy said richard but i wish lothaire were not coming  perhaps said good father lucas he comes that you may have a first trial in your fathers last lesson and abbot martins and return good for evil  the dukes cheek flushed and he made no answer  he and alberic betook themselves to the watchtower and by and by saw a cavalcade approaching with a curtained vehicle in the midst slung between two horses  that cannot be the princes said alberic that must surely be some sick lady  i only hope it is not the queen exclaimed richard in dismay  but no lothaire is such a coward no doubt he was afraid to ride and she would not trust her darling without shutting him up like a demoiselle but come down alberic i will say nothing unkind of lothaire if i can help it  richard met the princes in the court his sunny hair uncovered and bowing with such becoming courtesy that fru astrida pressed her sons arm and bade him say if their little duke was not the fairest and noblest child in christendom  with black looks lothaire stepped from the litter took no heed of the little duke but roughly calling his attendant charlot to follow him he marched into the hall vouchsafing neither word nor look to any as he passed threw himself into the highest seat and ordered charlot to bring him some wine  meanwhile richard looking into the litter saw carloman crouching in a corner sobbing with fright  carlomandear carlomando not cry  come out  it is iyour own richard  will you not let me welcome you  carloman looked caught at the outstretched hand and clung to his neck  oh richard send us back  do not let the savage danes kill us  no one will hurt you  there are no danes here  you are my guest my friend my brother  look up here is my own fru astrida  but my mother said the northmen would kill us for keeping you captive she wept and raved and the cruel men dragged us away by force  oh let us go back  i cannot do that said richard for you are the king of denmarks captives not mine but i will love you and you shall have all that is mine if you will only not cry dear carloman  oh fru astrida what shall i do  you comfort him as the poor boy clung sobbing to him  fru astrida advanced to take his hand speaking in a soothing voice but he shrank and started with a fresh cry of terrorher tall figure high cap and wrinkled face were to him witchlike and as she knew no french he understood not her kind words  however he let richard lead him into the hall where lothaire sat moodily in the chair with one leg tucked under him and his finger in his mouth  i say sir duke said he is there nothing to be had in this old den of yours  not a drop of bordeaux  richard tried to repress his anger at this very uncivil way of speaking and answered that he thought there was none but there was plenty of norman cider  as if i would taste your mean peasant drinks i bade them bring my supperwhy does it not come  because you are not master here trembled on richards lips but he forced it back and answered that it would soon be ready and carloman looked imploringly at his brother and said do not make them angry lothaire  what crying still foolish child said lothaire  do you not know that if they dare to cross us my father will treat them as they deserve bring supper i say and let me have a pasty of ortolans  there are nonethey are not in season said richard  do you mean to give me nothing i like  i tell you it shall be the worse for you  there is a pullet roasting began richard  i tell you i do not care for pulletsi will have ortolans  if i do not take order with that boy my name is not eric muttered the baron  what must he not have made our poor child suffer returned fru astrida but the little one moves my heart  how small and weakly he is but it is worth anything to see our little duke so tender to him  he is too brave not to be gentle said osmond and indeed the highspirited impetuous boy was as soft and kind as a maiden with that feeble timid child  he coaxed him to eat consoled him and instead of laughing at his fears kept between him and the great bloodhound hardigras and drove it off when it came too near  take that dog away said lothaire imperiously  no one moved to obey him and the dog in seeking for scraps again came towards him  take it away he repeated and struck it with his foot  the dog growled and richard started up in indignation  prince lothaire he said i care not what else you do but my dogs and my people you shall not maltreat  i tell you i am prince  i do what i will  ha who laughs there cried the passionate boy stamping on the floor  it is not so easy for french princes to scourge freeborn normans here said the rough voice of walter the huntsman there is a reckoning for the stripe my lord duke bore for me  hush hush walter began richard but lothaire had caught up a footstool and was aiming it at the huntsman when his arm was caught  osmond who knew him well enough to be prepared for such outbreaks held him fast by both hands in spite of his passionate screams and struggles which were like those of one frantic  sir eric meanwhile thundered forth in his norman patois i would have you to know young sir prince though you be you are our prisoner and shall taste of a dungeon and bread and water unless you behave yourself  either lothaire did not hear or did not believe and fought more furiously in osmonds arms but he had little chance with the stalwart young warrior and in spite of richards remonstrances he was carried from the hall roaring and kicking and locked up alone in an empty room  let him alone for the present said sir eric putting the duke aside when he knows his master we shall have peace  here richard had to turn to reassure carloman who had taken refuge in a dark corner and there shook like an aspen leaf crying bitterly and starting with fright when richard touched him  oh do not put me in the dungeon  i cannot bear the dark  richard again tried to comfort him but he did not seem to hear or heed oh they said you would beat and hurt us for what we did to you but indeed it was not i that burnt your cheek  we would not hurt you for worlds dear carloman lothaire is not in the dungeonhe is only shut up till he is good  it was lothaire that did it repeated carloman and indeed you must not be angry with me for my mother was so cross with me for not having stopped osmond when i met him with the bundle of straw that she gave me a blow that knocked me down  and were you really there richard  richard told his story and was glad to find carloman could smile at it and then fru astrida advised him to take his little friend to bed carloman would not lie down without still holding richards hand and the little duke spared no pains to set him at rest knowing what it was to be a desolate captive far from home  i thought you would be good to me said carloman  as to lothaire it serves him right that you should use him as he used you  oh no carloman if i had a brother i would never speak so of him  but lothaire is so unkind  ah but we must be kind to those who are unkind to us  the child rose on his elbow and looked into richards face  no one ever told me so before  oh carloman not brother hilary  i never heed brother hilaryhe is so lengthy and wearisome besides no one is ever kind to those that hate them  my father was said richard  and they killed him said carloman  yes said richard crossing himself but he is gone to be in peace  i wonder if it is happier there than here said carloman  i am not happy  but tell me why should we be good to those that hate us  because the holy saints wereand look at the crucifix carloman  that was for them that hated him  and dont you know what our pater noster says  poor little carloman could only repeat the lords prayer in latinhe had not the least notion of its meaningin which richard had been carefully instructed by father lucas  he began to explain it but before many words had passed his lips little carloman was asleep  the duke crept softly away to beg to be allowed to go to lothaire he entered the room already dark with a pine torch in his hand that so flickered in the wind that he could at first see nothing but presently beheld a dark lump on the floor  prince lothaire he said here is  lothaire cut him short  get away he said  if it is your turn now it will be mine by and by  i wish my mother had kept her word and put your eyes out  richards temper did not serve for such a reply  it is a foul shame of you to speak so when i only came out of kindness to youso i shall leave you here all night and not ask sir eric to let you out  and he swung back the heavy door with a resounding clang  but his heart smote him when he told his beads and remembered what he had said to carloman  he knew he could not sleep in his warm bed when lothaire was in that cold gusty room  to be sure sir eric said it would do him good but sir eric little knew how tender the french princes were  so richard crept down in the dark slid back the bolt and called prince prince i am sorry i was angry  come out and let us try to be friends  what do you mean said lothaire  come out of the cold and dark  here am i  i will show you the way where is your hand  oh how cold it is  let me lead you down to the hall fire  lothaire was subdued by fright cold and darkness and quietly allowed richard to lead him down  round the fire at the lower end of the hall snored halfadozen menatarms at the upper hearth there was only hardigras who raised his head as the boys came in  richards whisper and soft pat quieted him instantly and the two little princes sat on the hearth together lothaire surprised but sullen  richard stirred the embers so as to bring out more heat then spoke prince will you let us be friends  i must if i am in your power  i wish you would be my guest and comrade  well i will i cant help it  richard thought his advances might have been more graciously met and having little encouragement to say more took lothaire to bed as soon as he was warm     chapter xi   as the baron had said there was more peace now that lothaire had learnt to know that he must submit and that no one cared for his threats of his fathers or his mothers vengeance  he was very sulky and disagreeable and severely tried richards forbearance but there were no fresh outbursts and on the whole from one week to another there might be said to be an improvement  he could not always hold aloof from one so goodnatured and goodhumoured as the little duke and the fact of being kept in order could not but have some beneficial effect on him after such spoiling as his had been at home  indeed osmond was once heard to say it was a pity the boy was not to be a hostage for life to which sir eric replied so long as we have not the training of him  little carloman meanwhile recovered from his fears of all the inmates of the castle excepting hardigras at whose approach he always shrank and trembled  he renewed his friendship with osmond no longer started at the entrance of sir eric laughed at alberics merry ways and liked to sit on fru astridas lap and hear her sing though he understood not one word but his especial love was still for his first friend duke richard handinhand they went about together richard sometimes lifting him up the steep steps and out of consideration for him refraining from rough play and richard led him to join with him in those lessons that father lucas gave the children of the castle every friday and sunday evening in the chapel  the good priest stood on the altar steps with the children in a half circle round himthe son and daughter of the armourer the huntsmans little son the young baron de montemar the duke of normandy and the prince of france all were equal thereand together they learnt as he explained to them the things most needful to believe and thus carloman left off wondering why richard thought it right to be good to his enemies and though at first he had known less than even the little leathercoated huntsman he seemed to take the holy lessons in faster than any of themyes and act on them too  his feeble health seemed to make him enter into their comfort and meaning more than even richard and alberic and father lucas soon told fru astrida that it was a saintlyminded child  indeed carloman was more disposed to thoughtfulness because he was incapable of joining in the sports of the other boys  a race round the court was beyond his strength the fresh wind on the battlements made him shiver and cower and loud shouting play was dreadful to him  in old times he used to cry when lothaire told him he must have his hair cut and be a priest now he only said quietly he should like it very much if he could be good enough  fru astrida sighed and shook her head and feared the poor child would never grow up to be anything on this earth  great as had been the difference at first between him and richard it was now far greater richard was an unusually strong boy for ten years old upright and broadchested and growing very fast while carloman seemed to dwindle stooped forward from weakness had thin pinched features and sallow cheeks looking like a plant kept in the dark  the old baron said that hardy healthy habits would restore the puny children and lothaire improved in health and therewith in temper but his little brother had not strength enough to bear the seasoning  he pined and drooped more each day and as the autumn came on and the wind was chilly he grew worse and was scarcely ever off the lap of the kind lady astrida  it was not a settled sickness but he grew weaker and wasted away  they made up a little couch for him by the fire with the high settle between it and the door to keep off the draughts and there he used patiently to lie hour after hour speaking feebly or smiling and seeming pleased when any one of those he loved approached  he liked father lucas to come and say prayers with him and he never failed to have a glad look when his dear little duke came to talk to him in his cheerful voice about his rides and his hunting and hawking adventures richards sick guest took up much of his thoughts and he never willingly spent many hours at a distance from him softening his step and lowering his voice as he entered the hall lest carloman should be asleep  richard is it you said the little boy as the young figure came round the settle in the darkening twilight  yes  how do you feel now carloman are you better  no better thanks dear richard and the little wasted fingers were put into his  has the pain come again  no i have been lying still musing richard i shall never be better  oh do not say so  you will indeed you will when spring comes  i feel as if i should die said the little boy i think i shall  but do not grieve richard  i do not feel much afraid  you said it was happier there than here and i know it now  where my blessed father is said richard thoughtfully  but oh carloman you are so young to die  i do not want to live  this is a fighting hard world full of cruel people and it is peace there  you are strong and brave and will make them better but i am weak and fearfuli could only sigh and grieve  oh carloman  carloman  i cannot spare you  i love you like my own brother  you must not dieyou must live to see your father and mother again  commend me to them said carloman  i am going to my father in heaven i am glad i am here richard i never was so happy before  i should have been afraid indeed to die if father lucas had not taught me how my sins are pardoned  now i think the saints and angels are waiting for me  he spoke feebly and his last words faltered into sleep  he slept on and when supper was brought and the lamps were lighted fru astrida thought the little face looked unusually pale and waxen but he did not awake  at night they carried him to his bed and he was roused into a half conscious state moaning at being disturbed  fru astrida would not leave him and father lucas shared her watch  at midnight all were wakened by the slow notes falling one by one on the ear of the solemn passingbell calling them to waken that their prayers might speed a soul on its way  richard and lothaire were soon at the bedside  carloman lay still asleep his hands folded on his breast but his breath came in long gasps  father lucas was praying over him and candles were placed on each side of the bed  all was still the boys not daring to speak or move  there came a longer breaththen they heard no more  he was indeed gone to a happier homea truer royalty than ever had been his on earth  then the boys grief burst out  lothaire screamed for his mother and sobbed out that he should die toohe must go home  richard stood by the bed large silent tears rolling down his cheeks and his chest heaving with suppressed sobs  fru astrida led them from the room back to their beds  lothaire soon cried himself to sleep  richard lay awake sorrowful and in deep thought while that scene in st marys at rouen returned before his eyes and though it had passed nearly two years ago its meaning and its teaching had sunk deep into his mind and now stood before him more completely  where shall i go when i come to die if i have not returned good for evil  and a resolution was taken in the mind of the little duke  morning came and brought back the sense that his gentle little companion was gone from him and richard wept again as if he could not be consoled as he beheld the screened couch where the patient smile would never again greet him  he now knew that he had loved carloman all the more for his weakness and helplessness but his grief was not like lothaires for with the princes was still joined a selfish fear his cry was still that he should die too if not set free and violent weeping really made him heavy and ill  the little corpse embalmed and lapped in lead was to be sent back to france that it might rest with its forefathers in the city of rheims and lothaire seemed to feel this as an additional stroke of desertion he was almost beside himself with despair imploring every one in turn to send him home though he well knew they were unable to do so     chapter xii   sir eric said richard you told me there was a parlement to be held at falaise between count bernard and the king of denmark  i mean to attend it  will you come with me or shall osmond go and you remain in charge of the prince  how now lord richard you were not wont to love a parlement  i have something to say replied richard  the baron made no objection only telling his mother that the duke was a marvellous wise child and that he would soon be fit to take the government himself  lothaire lamented the more when he found that richard was going away his presence seemed to him a protection and he fancied now carloman was dead that his former injuries were about to be revenged  the duke assured him repeatedly that he meant him nothing but kindness adding when i return you will see lothaire then commending him to the care and kindness of fru astrida osmond and alberic richard set forth upon his pony attended by sir eric and three menatarms  richard felt sad when he looked back at bayeux and thought that it no longer contained his dear little friend but it was a fresh bright frosty morning the fields were covered with a silverywhite coating the flakes of hoarfrost sparkled on every bush and the hard ground rung cheerily to the tread of the horses feet  as the yellow sun fought his way through the grey mists that dimmed his brightness and shone out merrily in the blue heights of the sky richards spirits rose and he laughed and shouted as hare or rabbit rushed across the heath or as the plover rose screaming above his head flapping her broad wings across the wintry sky  one night they slept at a convent where they heard that hugh of paris had passed on to join the conference at falaise  the next day they rode on and towards the afternoon the baron pointed to a sharp rocky range of hills crowned by a tall solid tower and told richard yonder was his keep of falaise the strongest castle in normandy  the country was far more broken as they advancednarrow valleys and sharp hills each little vale full of wood and interspersed with rocks a choice place for game sir eric said and richard as he saw a herd of deer dash down a forest glade exclaimed that they must come here to stay for some autumn sport  there seemed to be huntsmen abroad in the woods for through the frosty air came the baying of dogs the shouts and calls of men and now and then the echoing ringing notes of a bugle  richards eyes and cheeks glowed with excitement and he pushed his brisk little pony on faster and faster unheeding that the heavier men and horses of his suite were not keeping pace with him on the rough ground and through the tangled boughs  presently a strange sound of growling and snarling was heard close at hand his pony swerved aside and could not be made to advance so richard dismounting dashed through some briars and there on an open space beneath a precipice of dark ivycovered rock that rose like a wall he beheld a huge grey wolf and a large dog in mortal combat  it was as if they had fallen or rolled down the precipice together not heeding it in their fury  both were bleeding and the eyes of both glared like red fiery glass in the dark shadow of the rock  the dog lay undermost almost overpowered making but a feeble resistance and the wolf would in another moment be at liberty to spring on the lonely child  but not a thought of fear passed through his breast to save the dog was richards only idea  in one moment he had drawn the dagger he wore at his girdle ran to the two struggling animals and with all his force plunged it into the throat of the wolf which happily was still held by the teeth of the hound  the struggles relaxed the wolf rolled heavily aside dead the dog lay panting and bleeding and richard feared he was cruelly torn  poor fellow noble dog what shall i do to help you and he gently smoothed the dark brindled head  a voice was now heard shouting aloud at which the dog raised and crested his head as a figure in a hunting dress was coming down a rocky pathway an extremely tall wellmade man of noble features  ha holla  vige vige  how now my brave hound he said in the northern tongue though not quite with the accent richard was accustomed to hear art hurt  much torn i fear richard called out as the faithful creature wagged his tail and strove to rise and meet his master  ha lad what art thou exclaimed the hunter amazed at seeing the boy between the dead wolf and wounded dog  you look like one of those frenchified norman gentilesse with your smooth locks and gilded baldrick yet your words are norse  by the hammer of thor that is a dagger in the wolfs throat  it is mine said richard  i found your dog nearly spent and i made in to the rescue  you did  well done  i would not have lost vige for all the plunder of italy  i am beholden to you my brave young lad said the stranger all the time examining and caressing the hound  what is your name  you cannot be southern bred  as he spoke more shouts came near and the baron de centeville rushed through the trees holding richards pony by the bridle  my lord my lordoh thank heaven i see you safe  at the same moment a party of hunters also approached by the path and at the head of them bernard the dane  ha exclaimed he what do i see  my young lord what brought you here  and with a hasty obeisance bernard took richards outstretched hand  i came hither to attend your council replied richard  i have a boon to ask of the king of denmark  any boon the king of denmark has in his power will be yours said the dogs master slapping his hand on the little dukes shoulder with a rude hearty familiarity that took him by surprise and he looked up with a shade of offence till on a sudden flash of perception he took off his cap exclaiming king harald himself  pardon me sir king  pardon jarl richart  what would you have me pardonyour saving the life of vige here  no french politeness for me  tell me your boon and it is yours  shall i take you a voyage and harry the fat monks of ireland  richard recoiled a little from his new friend  oh ha  i forgot  they have made a christian of youmores the pity you have the northern spirit so strong  i had forgotten it  come walk by my side and let me hear what you would ask  holla you sweyn carry vige up to the castle and look to his wounds  now for it young jarl  my boon is that you would set free prince lothaire  whatthe young frank  why they kept you captive burnt your face and would have made an end of you but for your clever bonder  that is long past and lothaire is so wretched  his brother is dead and he is sick with grief and he says he shall die if he does not go home  a good thing too for the treacherous race to die out in him  what should you care for him he is your foe  i am a christian was richards answer  well i promised you whatever you might ask  all my share of his ransom or his person bond or free is yours  you have only to prevail with your own jarls and bonders  richard feared this would be more difficult but abbot martin came to the meeting and took his part  moreover the idea of their hostage dying in their hands so as to leave them without hold upon the king had much weight with them and after long deliberation they consented that lothaire should be restored to his father without ransom but only on condition that louis should guarantee to the duke the peaceable possession of the country as far as st clair sur epte which had been long in dispute so that alberic became indisputably a vassal of normandy  perhaps it was the happiest day in richards life when he rode back to bayeux to desire lothaire to prepare to come with him to st clair there to be given back into the hands of his father  and then they met king louis grave and sorrowful for the loss of his little carloman and for the time repenting of his misdeeds towards the orphan heir of normandy  he pressed the duke in his arms and his kiss was a genuine one as he said duke richard we have not deserved this of you  i did not treat you as you have treated my children  we will be true lord and vassal from henceforth  lothaires last words were farewell richard  if i lived with you i might be good like you  i will never forget what you have done for me  when richard once more entered rouen in state his subjects shouting round him in transports of joy better than all his honour and glory was the being able to enter the church of our lady and kneel by his fathers grave with a clear conscience and the sense that he had tried to keep that last injunction     conclusion   years had passed away  the oaths of louis and promises of lothaire had been broken and arnulf of flanders the murderer of duke william had incited them to repeated and treacherous inroads on normandy so that richards life from fourteen to five or sixandtwenty had been one long war in defence of his country  but it had been a glorious war for him and his gallant deeds had well earned for him the title of richard the fearlessa name well deserved for there was but one thing he feared and that was to do wrong  by and by success and peace came and then arnulf of flanders finding open force would not destroy him three times made attempts to assassinate him like his father by treachery  but all these had failed and now richard had enjoyed many years of peace and honour whilst his enemies had vanished from his sight  king louis was killed by a fall from his horse lothaire died in early youth and in him ended the degenerate line of charlemagne hugh capet the son of richards old friend hugh the white was on the throne of france his sure ally and brotherinlaw looking to him for advice and aid in all his undertakings  fru astrida and sir eric had long been in their quiet graves osmond and alberic were among richards most trusty councillors and warriors abbot martin in extreme old age still ruled the abbey of jumieges where richard like his father loved to visit him hold converse with him and refresh himself in the peaceful cloister after the affairs of state and war  and richard himself was a greyheaded man of lofty stature and majestic bearing  his eldest son was older than he had been himself when he became the little duke and he had even begun to remember his fathers project of an old age to be spent in retirement and peace  it was on a summer eve that duke richard sat beside the whitebearded old abbot within the porch looking at the sun shining with soft declining beams on the arches and columns  they spoke together of that burial at rouen and of the silver key the abbot delighting to tell over and over again all the good deeds and good sayings of william longsword  as they sat a man also very old and shrivelled and bent came up to the cloister gate with the tottering feeble step of one pursued beyond his strength coming to take sanctuary  what can be the crime of one so aged and feeble said the duke in surprise  at the sight of him a look of terror shot from the old mans eye  he clasped his hands together and turned as if to flee then finding himself incapable of escape he threw himself on the ground before him  mercy mercy noble most noble duke was all he said  rise upkneel not to me  i cannot brook this from one who might be my father said richard trying to raise him but at those words the old man groaned and crouched lower still  who art thou said the duke  in this holy place thou art secure be thy deed what it may  speakwho art thou  dost thou not know me said the suppliant  promise mercy ere thou dost hear my name  i have seen that face under a helmet said the duke  thou art arnulf of flanders  there was a deep silence  and wherefore art thou here  i delayed to own the french king hugh  he has taken my towns and ravaged my lands  each frenchman and each norman vows to slay me in revenge for your wrongs lord duke  i have been driven hither and thither in fear of my life till i thought of the renown of duke richard not merely the most fearless but the most merciful of princes i sought to come hither trusting that when the holy father abbot beheld my bitter repentance he would intercede for me with you most noble prince for my safety and forgiveness  oh gallant duke forgive and spare  rise up arnulf said richard  where the hand of the lord hath stricken it is not for man to exact his own reckoning  my fathers death has been long forgiven and what you may have planned against myself has by the blessing of heaven been brought to nought  from normans at least you are safe and it shall be my work to ensure your pardon from my brother the king  come into the refectory you need refreshment  the lord abbot makes you welcome 17  tears of gratitude and true repentance choked arnulfs speech and he allowed himself to be raised from the ground and was forced to accept the support of the dukes arm  the venerable abbot slowly rose and held up his hand in an attitude of blessing the blessing of a merciful god be upon the sinner who turneth from his evil way and ten thousand blessings of pardon and peace are already on the head of him who hath stretched out his hand to forgive and aid him who was once his most grievous foe     footnotes   1  richards place of education was bayeaux for as duke william says in the rhymed chronicle of normandy      si a roem le faz garder     e norir gaires longement     il ne saura
