19214333	modern mythology   dedication   dedicated to the memory of john fergus mclennan     introduction   it may well be doubted whether works of controversy serve any useful purpose  on an opponent as mr matthew arnold said one never does make any impression though one may hope that controversy sometimes illuminates a topic in the eyes of impartial readers  the pages which follow cannot but seem wandering and desultory for they are a reply to a book mr max mullers contributions to the science of mythology in which the attack is of a skirmishing character  throughout more than eight hundred pages the learned author keeps up an irregular fire at the ideas and methods of the anthropological school of mythologists  the reply must follow the lines of attack  criticism cannot dictate to an author how he shall write his own book yet anthropologists and folklorists agriologists and hottentotic students must regret that mr max muller did not state their general theory as he understands it fully and once for all  adversaries rarely succeed in quite understanding each other but had mr max muller made such a statement we could have cleared up anything in our position which might seem to him obscure  our system is but one aspect of the theory of evolution or is but the application of that theory to the topic of mythology  the archaeologist studies human life in its material remains he tracks progress and occasional degeneration from the rudely chipped flints in the ancient gravel beds to the polished stone weapon and thence to the ages of bronze and iron  he is guided by material survivalsancient arms implements and ornaments  the student of institutions has a similar method  he finds his relics of the uncivilised past in agricultural usages in archaic methods of allotment of land in odd marriage customs things rudimentaryfossil relics as it were of an early social and political condition  the archaeologist and the student of institutions compare these relics material or customary with the weapons pottery implements or again with the habitual law and usage of existing savage or barbaric races and demonstrate that our weapons and tools and our laws and manners have been slowly evolved out of lower conditions even out of savage conditions  the anthropological method in mythology is the same  in civilised religion and myth we find rudimentary survivals fossils of rite and creed ideas absolutely incongruous with the environing morality philosophy and science of greece and india  parallels to these things so out of keeping with civilisation we recognise in the creeds and rites of the lower races even of cannibals but there the creeds and rites are not incongruous with their environment of knowledge and culture there they are as natural and inevitable as the flintheaded spear or marriage by capture  we argue therefore that religions and mythical faiths and rituals which among greeks and indians are inexplicably incongruous have lived on from an age in which they were natural and inevitable an age of savagery  that is our general position and it would have been a benefit to us if mr max muller had stated it in his own luminous way if he wished to oppose us and had shown us where and how it fails to meet the requirements of scientific method  in place of doing this once for all he often assails our evidence yet never notices the defences of our evidence which our school has been offering for over a hundred years  he attacks the excesses of which some sweet anthropological enthusiasts have been guilty or may be guilty such as seeing totems wherever they find beasts in ancient religion myth or art  he asks for definitions as of totemism but never i think alludes to the authoritative definitions by mr mclennan and mr frazer  he assails the theory of fetishism as if it stood now where de brosses left it in a purely pioneer workor rather where he understands de brosses to have left it  one might as well attack the atomic theory where lucretius left it or the theory of evolution where it was left by the elder darwin  thus mr max muller really never conies to grips with his opponents and his large volumes shine rather in erudition and style than in method and system  anyone who attempts a reply must necessarily follow mr max muller up and down collecting his scattered remarks on this or that point at issue  hence my reply much against my will must seem desultory and rambling  but i have endeavoured to answer with some kind of method and system and i even hope that this little book may be useful as a kind of supplement to mr max mullers for it contains exact references to certain works of which he takes the readers knowledge for granted  the general problem at issue is apt to be lost sight of in this guerilla kind of warfare  it is perhaps more distinctly stated in the preface to mr max mullers chips from a german workshop vol iv longmans 1895 than in his two recent volumes  the general problem is this has languageespecially language in a state of disease been the great source of the mythology of the world  or does mythology on the whole represent the survival of an old stage of thoughtnot caused by languagefrom which civilised men have slowly emancipated themselves mr max muller is of the former anthropologists are of the latter opinion  both of course agree that myths are a product of thought of a kind of thought almost extinct in civilised races but mr max muller holds that language caused that kind of thought  we on the other hand think that language only gave it one means of expressing itself  the essence of myth as of fairy tale we agree is the conception of the things in the world as all alike animated personal capable of endless interchanges of form  men may become beasts beasts may change into men gods may appear as human or bestial stones plants winds water may speak and act like human beings and change shapes with them  anthropologists demonstrate that the belief in this universal kinship universal personality of things which we find surviving only in the myths of civilised races is even now to some degree part of the living creed of savages  civilised myths then they urge are survivals from a parallel state of belief once prevalent among the ancestors of even the aryan race  but how did this mental condition this early sort of false metaphysics come into existence  we have no direct historical information on the subject  if i were obliged to offer an hypothesis it would be that early men conscious of personality will and lifeconscious that force when exerted by themselves followed on a determination of will within themextended that explanation to all the exhibitions of force which they beheld without them  rivers run early man thought winds blow fire burns trees wave as a result of their own will the will of personal conscious entities  such vitality and even power of motion early man attributed even to inorganic matter as rocks and stones  all these things were beings like man himself  this does not appear to me an unnatural kind of nascent halfconscious metaphysics  man never knows how much he anthropomorphises  he extended the only explanation of his own action which consciousness yielded to him he extended it to explain every other sort of action in the sensible world  early greek philosophy recognised the stars as living bodies all things had once seemed living and personal  from the beginning man was eager causas cognoscere rerum  the only cause about which selfconsciousness gave him any knowledge was his own personal will  he therefore supposed all things to be animated with a like will and personality  his mythology is a philosophy of things stated in stories based on the belief in universal personality  my theory of the origin of that belief is of course a mere guess we have never seen any race in the process of passing from a total lack of a hypothesis of causes into that hypothesis of universally distributed personality which is the basis of mythology  but mr max muller conceives that this belief in universally distributed personality the word animism is not very clear was the result of an historical necessitynot of speculation but of language roots were all or nearly all expressive of action     hence a river could only be called or conceived as a runner or a roarer or a defender and in all these capacities always as something active and animated nay as something masculine or feminine  but why conceived as masculine or feminine  this necessity for endowing inanimate though active things such as rivers with sex is obviously a necessity of a stage of thought wholly unlike our own  we know that active inanimate things are sexless are neuter we feel no necessity to speak of them as male or female  how did the first speakers of the human race come to be obliged to call lifeless things by names connoting sex and therefore connoting not only activity but also life and personality  we explain it by the theory that man called lifeless things male or femaleby using genderterminationsas a result of his habit of regarding lifeless things as personal beings that habit again being the result of his consciousness of himself as a living will  mr max muller takes the opposite view  man did not call lifeless things by names denoting sex because he regarded them as persons he came to regard them as persons because he had already given them names connoting sex  and why had he done that  this is what mr max muller does not explain  he says  in ancient languages every one of these words sky earth sea rain had necessarily why necessarily a termination expressive of gender and this naturally produced in the mind the corresponding idea of sex so that these names received not only an individual but a sexual character 0a  it is curious that in proof apparently of this mr max muller cites a passage from the printers register in which we read that to little children everything is alive     the same instinct that prompts the child to personify everything remains unchecked in the savage and grows up with him to manhood  hence in all simple and early languages there are but two genders masculine and feminine  the printers register states our theory in its own words  first came the childlike and savage belief in universal personality  thence arose the genders masculine and feminine in early languages  these ideas are the precise reverse of mr max mullers ideas  in his opinion genders in language caused the belief in the universal personality even of inanimate things  the printers register holds that the belief in universal personality on the other hand caused the genders  yet for thirty years since 1868 mr max muller has been citing his direct adversary in the printers register as a supporter of his opinion  we then hold that man thought all things animated and expressed his belief in genderterminations  mr max muller holds that because man used genderterminations therefore he thought all things animated and so he became mythopoeic  in the passage cited mr max muller does not say why in ancient languages every one of these words had necessarily terminations expressive of gender  he merely quotes the hypothesis of the printers register  if he accepts that hypothesis it destroys his own theorythat genderterminations caused all things to be regarded as personal for ex hypothesi it was just because they were regarded as personal that they received names with genderterminations  somewherei cannot find the referencemr max muller seems to admit that personalising thought caused genderterminations but these later reacted on thought an hypothesis which multiplies causes praeter necessitatem  here then at the very threshold of the science of mythology we find mr max muller at once maintaining that a feature of language genderterminations caused the mythopoeic state of thought and quoting with approval the statement that the mythopoeic state of thought caused genderterminations  mr max mullers whole system of mythology is based on reasoning analogous to this example  his mot dordre as professor tiele says is a disease of language  this theory implies universal human degradation  man was once for all we know rational enough but his mysterious habit of using genderterminations and his perpetual misconceptions of the meaning of old words in his own language reduced him to the irrational and often as we now say obscene and revolting absurdities of his myths  here as is later pointed out the objection arises that all languages must have taken the disease in the same way  a maori myth is very like a greek myth  if the greek myth arose from a disease of greek how did the wholly different maori speech and a score of others come to have precisely the same malady  mr max muller alludes to a maori parallel to the myth of cronos 0b we can only say that there is a rusty lock in new zealand and a rusty lock in greece and that surely is very small comfort  he does not take the point  the point is that as the myth occurs in two remote and absolutely unconnected languages a theory of disease of language cannot turn the wards of the rusty locks  the myth is in part at least a naturemythan attempt to account for the severance of heaven and earth once united by telling a story in which natural phenomena are animated and personal  a disease of language has nothing to do with this myth  it is cited as a proof against the theory of disease of language  the truth is that while languages differ men and above all early men have the same kind of thoughts desires fancies habits institutions it is not that in which all races formally differtheir languagebut that in which all early races are astonishingly the sametheir ideas fancies habits desiresthat causes the amazing similarity of their myths  mythologists then who find in early human nature the living ideas which express themselves in myths will hardily venture to compare the analogous myths of all peoples  mythologists on the other hand who find the origin of myths in a necessity imposed upon thought by misunderstood language will necessarily and logically compare only myths current among races who speak languages of the same family  thus throughout mr max mullers new book we constantly find him protesting on the whole and as a rule against the system which illustrates aryan myths by savage parallels  thus he maintains that it is perilous to make comparative use of myths current in languagessay maori or samoyedwhich the mythologists confessedly do not know  to this we can only reply that we use the works of the best accessible authorities men who do know the languagessay dr codrington or bishop callaway or castren or egede now it is not maintained that the myths on the whole are incorrectly translated  the danger which we incur it seems is ignorance of the original sense of savage or barbaric divine or heroic namessay maui or yehl or huitzilopochhtli or heitsi eibib or pundjel  by mr max mullers system such names are old words of meanings long ago generally lost by the speakers of each language but analysable by true scholars into their original significance  that will usually be found by the philologists to indicate the inevitable dawn or sun or night or the like according to the taste and fancy of the student  to all this a reply is urged in the following pages  in agreement with curtius and many other scholars we very sincerely doubt almost all etymologies of old proper names even in greek or sanskrit  we find among philologists as a rule the widest discrepancies of interpretation  moreover every name must mean something  now whatever the meaning of a name supposing it to be really ascertained very little ingenuity is needed to make it indicate one or other aspect of dawn or night of lightning or storm just as the philologist pleases then he explains the divine or heroic being denoted by the nameas dawn or storm or fire or night or twilight or windin accordance with his private taste easily accommodating the facts of the myth whatever they may be to his favourite solution  we rebel against this kind of logic and persist in studying the myth in itself and in comparison with analogous myths in every accessible language  certainly if divine and heroic namesartemis or pundjelcan be interpreted so much is gained  but the myth may be older than the name  as mr hogarth points out alexander has inherited in the remote east the myths of early legendary heroes  we cannot explain these by the analysis of the name of alexander  even if the heroic or divine name can be shown to be the original one which is practically impossible the meaning of the name helps us little  that zeus means sky cannot conceivably explain scores of details in the very composite legend of zeussay the story of zeus demeter and the ram  moreover we decline to admit that if a divine name means swift its bearer must be the wind or the sunlight  nor if the name means white is it necessarily a synonym of dawn or of lightning or of clear air or what not  but a mythologist who makes language and names the fountain of myth will go on insisting that myths can only be studied by people who know the language in which they are told  mythologists who believe that human nature is the source of myths will go on comparing all myths that are accessible in translations by competent collectors  mr max muller says we seldom find mythology as it were in situas it lived in the minds and unrestrained utterances of the people  we generally have to study it in the works of mythographers or in the poems of later generations when it had long ceased to be living and intelligible  the myths of greece and rome in hyginus or ovid are likely to be as misleading as a hortus siccus would be to a botanist if debarred from his rambles through meadows and hedges 0c  nothing can be more true or more admirably stated  these remarks are indeed the charter so to speak of anthropological mythology and of folklore  the old mythologists worked at a hortus siccus at myths dried and pressed in thoroughly literary books greek and latin  but we now study myths in the unrestrained utterances of the people either of savage tribes or of the european folk the unprogressive peasant class the former and to some extent the latter still live in the mythopoeic state of mindregarding bees for instance as persons who must be told of a death in the family  their myths are still not wholly out of concord with their habitual view of a world in which an old woman may become a hare  as soon as learned jesuits like pere lafitau began to understand their savage flocks they said these men are living in ovids metamorphoses  they found mythology in situ  hence mythologists now study mythology in situin savages and in peasants who till very recently were still in the mythopoeic stage of thought  mannhardt made this idea his basis  mr max muller says 0d very naturally that i have been popularising the often difficult and complicated labours of mannhardt and others  in fact as is said later i published all my general conclusions before i had read mannhardt  quite independently i could not help seeing that among savages and peasants we had mythology not in a literary hortus siccus but in situ  mannhardt though he appreciated dr tylor had made i think but few original researches among savage myths and customs  his province was european folklore  what he missed will be indicated in the chapter on the firewalkone example among many  but this kind of mythology in situ in the unrestrained utterances of the people mr max muller tells us is no province of his  i saw it was hopeless for me to gain a knowledge at first hand of innumerable local legends and customs and it is to be supposed that he distrusted knowledge acquired by collectors grimm mannhardt campbell of islay and an army of others  a scholarlike knowledge of maori or hottentot mythology was also beyond him  we on the contrary take our maori lore from a host of collectors taylor white manning the pakeha maori tregear polack and many others  from them we flatter ourselves that we getas from grimm mannhardt islay and the restmythology in situ  we compare it with the dry mythologic blossoms of the classical hortus siccus and with greek ritual and temple legend and with marchen in the scholiasts and we think the comparisons very illuminating  they have thrown new light on greek mythology ritual mysteries and religion this much we think we have already done though we do not know maori and though each of us can hope to gather but few facts from the mouths of living peasants  examples of the results of our method will be found in the following pages  thus if the myth of the firestealer in greece is explained by misunderstood greek or sanskrit words in no way connected with robbery we shall show that the myth of the theft of fire occurs where no greek or sanskrit words were ever spoken  there we shall show the myth arose from simple inevitable human ideas  we shall therefore doubt whether in greece a common human myth had a singular causein a disease of language  it is with no enthusiasm that i take the opportunity of mr max mullers reply to me by name  since myth ritual and religion now out of print but accessible in the french of m marillier was published ten years ago i have left mythology alone  the general method there adopted has been applied in a much more erudite work by mr frazer the golden bough by mr farnell in cults of the greek states by mr jevons in his introduction to the history of religion by miss harrison in explanations of greek ritual by mr hartland in the legend of perseus and doubtless by many other writers  how much they excel me in erudition may be seen by comparing mr farnells passage on the bear artemis 0e with the section on her in this volume  mr max muller observes that mannhardts mythological researches have never been fashionable  they are now very much in fashion they greatly inspire mr frazer and mr farnell  they seemed to me and still seem to me too exclusive says mr max muller 0f  mannhardt in his second period was indeed chiefly concerned with myths connected as he held with agriculture and with treeworship  mr max muller too has been thought exclusiveas teaching he complains that the whole of mythology is solar  that reproach arose he says because some of my earliest contributions to comparative mythology were devoted exclusively to the special subject of solar myths 0g  but mr max muller also mentions his own complaints of the omnipresent sun and the inevitable dawn appearing in ever so many disguises  did they really appear  were the myths say the myths of daphne really solar  that is precisely what we hesitate to accept  in the same way mannhardts preoccupation with vegetable myths has tended i think to make many of his followers ascribe vegetable origins to myths and gods where the real origin is perhaps for ever lost  the cornspirit starts up in most unexpected places  mr frazer mannhardts disciple is very severe on solar theories of osiris and connects that god with the corn spirit  but mannhardt did not go so far  mannhardt thought that the myth of osiris was solar  to my thinking these resolutions of myths into this or that original sourcesolar nocturnal vegetable or what notare often very perilous  a myth so extremely composite as that of osiris must be a stream flowing from many springs and as in the case of certain rivers it is difficult or impossible to say which is the real fountainhead  one would respectfully recommend to young mythologists great reserve in their hypotheses of origins  all this of course is the familiar thought of writers like mr frazer and mr farnell but a tendency to seek for exclusively vegetable origins of gods is to be observed in some of the most recent speculations  i well know that i myself am apt to press a theory of totems too far and in the following pages i suggest reserves limitations and alternative hypotheses  il y a serpent et serpent a snake tribe may be a local tribe named from the snake river not a totem kindred  the history of mythology is the history of rash premature and exclusive theories  we are only beginning to learn caution  even the prevalent anthropological theory of the ghostorigin of religion might i think be advanced with caution as mr jevons argues on other grounds till we know a little more about ghosts and a great deal more about psychology  we are too apt to argue as if the psychical condition of the earliest men were exactly like our own while we are just beginning to learn from prof william james that about even our own psychical condition we are only now realising our exhaustive ignorance  how often we men have thought certain problems settled for good  how often we have been compelled humbly to return to our studies philological comparative mythology seemed securely seated for a generation  her throne is tottering     our little systems have their day       they have their day and cease to be       they are but broken lights from thee    and thou we trust art more than they  but we need not hate each other for the sake of our little systems like the grammarian who damned his rivals soul for his theory of the irregular verbs  nothing i hope is said here inconsistent with the highest esteem for mr max mullers vast erudition his enviable style his unequalled contributions to scholarship and his awakening of that interest in mythological science without which his adversaries would probably never have existed  most of chapter xii appeared in the contemporary review and most of chapter xiii in the princeton review     regent mythology   mythology in 18601880   between 1860 and 1880 roughly speaking english people interested in early myths and religions found the mythological theories of professor max muller in possession of the field  these brilliant and attractive theories taking them in the widest sense were not of course peculiar to the right hon professor  in france in germany in america in italy many scholars agreed in his opinion that the science of language is the most potent spell for opening the secret chamber of mythology  but while these scholars worked on the same general principle as mr max muller while they subjected the names of mythical beingszeus helen achilles atheneto philological analysis and then explained the stories of gods and heroes by their interpretations of the meanings of their names they arrived at all sorts of discordant results  where mr max muller found a myth of the sun or of the dawn these scholars were apt to see a myth of the wind of the lightning of the thundercloud of the crepuscule of the upper air of what each of them pleased  but these ideasthe ideas of kuhn welcker curtius when he appeared in the discussion of schwartz of lauer of breal of many otherswere very little knownif known at allto the english public  captivated by the graces of mr max mullers manner and by a style so pellucid that it accredited a logic perhaps not so clear the public hardly knew of the divisions in the philological camp  they were unaware that as mannhardt says the philological school had won few sure gains and had discredited their method by a musterroll of variegated and discrepant hypotheses  now in all sciences there are differences of opinion about details  in comparative mythology there was with rare exceptions no agreement at all about results beyond this point greek and sanskrit german and slavonic myths were in the immense majority of instances to be regarded as mirrorpictures on earth of celestial and meteorological phenomena thus even the story of the earth goddess the harvest goddess demeter was usually explained as a reflection in myth of one or another celestial phenomenondawn stormcloud or something else according to taste  again greek or german myths were usually to be interpreted by comparison with myths in the rig veda  their origin was to be ascertained by discovering the aryan root and original significance of the names of gods and heroes such as saranyuerinnys daphnedahana atheneahana  the etymology and meaning of such names being ascertained the origin and sense of the myths in which the names occur should be clear  clear it was not  there were in most cases as many opinions as to the etymology and meaning of each name and myth as there were philologists engaged in the study  mannhardt who began in 1858 as a member of the philological school in his last public utterance 1877 described the method and results including his own work of 1858 as mainly failures  but long ere that the english cultivated public had most naturally accepted mr max muller as the representative of the school which then held the field in comparative mythology  his german and other foreign brethren with their discrepant results were only known to the general in england i am not speaking of english scholars by the references to them in the oxford professors own works  his theories were made part of the education of children and found their way into a kind of popular primers  for these reasons anyone in england who was daring enough to doubt or to deny the validity of the philological system of mythology in general was obliged to choose mr max muller as his adversary  he must strike as it were the shield of no hospitaler of unsteady seat but that of the templar himself  and this is the cause of what seems to puzzle mr max muller namely the attacks on his system and his results in particular  an english critic writing for english readers had to do with the scholar who chiefly represented the philological school of mythology in the eyes of england    autobiographical   like other inquiring undergraduates in the sixties i read such works on mythology as mr max muller had then given to the world i read them with interest but without conviction  the argument the logic seemed to evade one it was purely with me a question of logic for i was of course prepared to accept all of mr max mullers dicta on questions of etymologies  even now i never venture to impugn them only as i observe that other scholars very frequently differ toto caelo from him and from each other in essential questions i preserve a just balance of doubt i wait till these gentlemen shall be at one among themselves  after taking my degree in 1868 i had leisure to read a good deal of mythology in the legends of all races and found my distrust of mr max mullers reasoning increase upon me  the main cause was that whereas mr max muller explained greek myths by etymologies of words in the aryan languages chiefly greek latin slavonic and sanskrit i kept finding myths very closely resembling those of greece among red indians kaffirs eskimo samoyeds kamilaroi maoris and cahrocs  now if aryan myths arose from a disease of aryan languages it certainly did seem an odd thing that myths so similar to these abounded where nonaryan languages alone prevailed  did a kind of linguistic measles affect all tongues alike from sanskrit to choctaw and everywhere produce the same ugly scars in religion and myth    the ugly scars   the ugly scars were the problem  a civilised fancy is not puzzled for a moment by a beautiful beneficent sungod or even by his beholding the daughters of men that they are fair  but a civilised fancy is puzzled when the beautiful sungod makes love in the shape of a dog 5  to me and indeed to mr max muller the ugly scars were the problem  he has writtenwhat makes mythology mythological in the true sense of the word is what is utterly unintelligible absurd strange or miraculous  but he explained these blots on the mythology of greece for example as the result practically of old words and popular sayings surviving in languages after the original harmless symbolical meanings of the words and sayings were lost  what had been a poetical remark about an aspect of nature became an obscene or brutal or vulgar myth a stumbling block to greek piety and to greek philosophy  to myself on the other hand it seemed that the ugly scars were remains of that kind of taste fancy customary law and incoherent speculation which everywhere as far as we know prevails to various degrees in savagery and barbarism  attached to the hideous idols as mr max muller calls them of early greece and implicated in a ritual which religious conservatism dared not abandon the fables of perhaps neolithic ancestors of the hellenes remained in the religion and the legends known to plato and socrates  that this process of survival is a vera causa illustrated in every phase of evolution perhaps nobody denies  thus the phenomena which the philological school of mythology explains by a disease of language we would explain by survival from a savage state of society and from the mental peculiarities observed among savages in all ages and countries  of course there is nothing new in this i was delighted to discover the idea in eusebius as in fontenelle while for general application to singular institutions it was a commonplace of the last century 6a  moreover the idea had been widely used by dr e b tylor in primitive culture and by mr mclennan in his primitive marriage and essays on totemism    my criticism of mr max muller   this idea i set about applying to the repulsive myths of civilised races and to marchen or popular tales at the same time combating the theories which held the fieldthe theories of the philological mythologists as applied to the same matter  in journalism i criticised mr max muller and i admit that when comparing the mutually destructive competition of varying etymologies i did not abstain from the weapons of irony and badinage  the opportunity was too tempting  but in the most sober seriousness i examined mr max mullers general statement of his system his hypothesis of certain successive stages of language leading up to the mythopoeic confusion of thought  it was not a question of denying mr max mullers etymologies but of asking whether he established his historical theory by evidence and whether his inferences from it were logically deduced  the results of my examination will be found in the article mythology in the encyclopaedia britannica and in la mythologie 6b  it did not appear to me that mr max mullers general theory was valid logical historically demonstrated or selfconsistent my other writings on the topic are chiefly custom and myth myth ritual and religion with french and dutch translations both much improved and corrected by the translators and an introduction to mrs hunts translation of grimms marchen    success of anthropological method   during fifteen years the ideas which i advocated seem to have had some measure of success  this is doubtless due not to myself but to the works of mr j g frazer and of professor robertson smith  both of these scholars descend intellectually from a man less scholarly than they but perhaps more original and acute than any of us my friend the late mr j f mclennan  to mannhardt also much is owed and of course above all to dr tylor  these writers like mr farnell and mr jevons recently seek for the answer to mythological problems rather in the habits and ideas of the folk and of savages and barbarians than in etymologies and a disease of language  there are differences of opinion in detail i myself may think that vegetation spirits the corn spirit and the rest occupy too much space in the systems of mannhardt and other moderns  mr frazer again thinks less of the evidence for totems among aryans than i was inclined to do 7  but it is not perhaps an overstatement to say that explanation of myths by analysis of names and the lately overpowering predominance of the dawn and the sun and the night in mythological hypothesis have received a slight check  they do not hold the field with the superiority which was theirs in england between 1860 and 1880  this facta scarcely deniable factdoes not of course prove that the philological method is wrong or that the dawn is not as great a factor in myth as mr max muller believes himself to have proved it to be  science is inevitably subject to shiftings of opinion action and reaction    mr max mullers reply   in this state of things mr max muller produces his contributions to the science of mythology 8 which i propose to criticise as far as it is or may seem to me to be directed against myself or against others who hold practically much the same views as mine  i say that i attempt to criticise the book as far as it is or may seem to me to be directed against us because it is mr max mullers occasional habit to argue apparently around rather than with his opponents  he says we are told this or thatsomething which he does not acceptbut he often does not inform us as to who tells us or where  thus a reader does not know whom mr max muller is opposing or where he can find the adversarys own statement in his own words  yet it is usual in such cases and it is i think expedient to give chapter and verse occasionally i find that mr max muller is honouring me by alluding to observations of my own but often no reference is given to an opponents name or books and we discover the passages in question by accident or research  this method will be found to cause certain inconveniences     the story of daphne   mr max mullers method in controversy   as an illustration of the authors controversial methods take his observations on my alleged attempt to account for the metamorphosis of daphne into a laurel tree  when i read these remarks i p 4 i said mr max muller vanquishes me there for he gave no reference to my statement  i had forgotten all about the matter i was not easily able to find the passage to which he alluded and i supposed that i had said just what mr max muller seemed to me to make me sayno more and no less  thus     mr lang as usual has recourse to savages most useful when they    are really wanted  he quotes an illustration from the south pacific    that tuna the chief of the eels fell in love with ina and asked her    to cut off his head  when his head had been cut off and buried two    cocoanut trees sprang up from the brain of tuna  how is this may i    ask to account for the story of daphne  everybody knows that    stories of the growing of plants out of the scattered members of    heroes may be found from ancient egypt to the wigwams of the    algonquins but these stories seem hardly applicable to daphne whose    members as far as i know were never either severed or scattered  i thought perhaps hastily that i must have made the story of tuna account for the story of daphne  mr max muller does not actually say that i did so but i understood him in that sense and recognised my error  but some guardian genius warning me i actually hunted up my own observations 10a  well i had never said as i conceived my critic to imply that the story of tuna accounts for the story of daphne  that was what i had not said  i had observed as to interchange of shape between men and women and plants our information so far as the lower races are concerned is less copiousthan in the case of stones  i then spoke of plant totems of one kin with human beings of plantsouls 10b of indian and egyptian plants animated by human souls of a tree which became a young man and made love to a yurucari girl of metamorphosis into vegetables in samoa 10c of an ottawa myth in which a man became a plant of maize and then of the story of tuna 10d  next i mentioned plants said to have sprung from dismembered gods and heroes all this i said all of it proves that savages mythically regard human life as on a level with vegetable no less than with animal life turning to the mythology of greece we see that the same rule holds good  metamorphosis into plants and flowers is extremely common and i of course attributed the original idea of such metamorphoses to the general savage habit of levelling up of regarding all things in nature as all capable of interchanging their identities  i gave as classical examples daphne myrrha hyacinth narcissus and the sisters of phaethon  next i criticised mr max mullers theory of daphne  but i never hinted that the isolated mangaian story of tuna or the stories of plants sprung from mangled men accounted by themselves for the story of daphne  mr max muller is not content with giving a very elaborate and interesting account of how the story of tuna arose i 57  he keeps tuna in hand and at the peroration of his vast work ii 831 warns us that before we compare myths in unrelated languages we need a very accurate knowledge of their dialects    to prevent accidents like that of tuna mentioned in the beginning  what accident  that i explained the myth of daphne by the myth of tuna  but that is precisely what i did not do  i explained the greek myth of daphne 1 as a survival from the savage mental habit of regarding men as on a level with stones beasts and plants or 2 as a tale moulded by poets on the same model 11 the latter is the more probable case for we find daphne late in artificial or mythographic literature in ovid and hyginus  in ovid the river god pentheus changes daphne into a laurel  in hyginus she is not changed at all the earth swallows her and a laurel fills her place  now i really did believeperhaps any rapid reader would have believedwhen i read mr max muller that i must have tried to account for the story of daphne by the story of tuna  i actually wrote in the first draft of this work that i had been in the wrong  then i verified the reference which my critic did not give with the result which the reader has perused  never could a reader have found out what i did really say from my critic for he does not usually when he deals with me give chapter and verse  this may avoid an air of personal bickering but how inconvenient it is  let me not be supposed to accuse mr max muller of consciously misrepresenting me  of that i need not say that he is absolutely incapable  my argument merely took in his consciousness the form which is suggested in the passage cited from him    tuna and daphne   to do justice to mr max muller i will here state fully his view of the story of tuna and then go on to the story of daphne  for the sake of accuracy i take the liberty of borrowing the whole of his statement i 47  i must dwell a little longer on this passage in order to show the real difference between the ethnological and the philological schools of comparative mythology  first of all what has to be explained is not the growing up of a tree from one or the other member of a god or hero but the total change of a human being or a heroine into a tree and this under a certain provocation  these two classes of plantlegends must be carefully kept apart  secondly what does it help us to know that people in mangaia believed in the change of human beings into trees if we do not know the reason why  this is what we want to know and without it the mere juxtaposition of stories apparently similar is no more than the old trick of explaining ignotum per ignotius  it leads us to imagine that we have learnt something when we really are as ignorant as before  if mr a lang had studied the mangaian dialect or consulted scholars like the rev w w gillit is from his myths and songs from the south pacific that he quotes the story of tunahe would have seen that there is no similarity whatever between the stories of daphne and of tuna  the tuna story belongs to a very well known class of aetiological plantstories which are meant to explain a no longer intelligible name of a plant such as snakeshead stiefmutterchen c it is in fact a clear case of what i call disease of language cured by the ordinary nostrum of folketymology  i have often been in communication with the rev w w gill about these south pacific myths and their true meaning the preface to his collection of myths and songs from the south pacific was written by me in 1876 and if mr a lang had only read the whole chapter which treats of these treemyths p 77 seq he would easily have perceived the real character of the tuna story and would not have placed it in the same class as the daphne story he would have found that the white kernel of the cocoanut was in mangaia called the brains of tuna a name like many more such names which after a time require an explanation  considering that cocoanut was used in mangaia in the sense of head testa the kernel or flesh of it might well be called the brain  if then the white kernel had been called tunas brain we have only to remember that in mangaia there are two kinds of cocoanut trees and we shall then have no difficulty in understanding why these twin cocoanut trees were said to have sprung from the two halves of tunas brain one being red in stem branches and fruit whilst the other was of a deep green  in proof of these trees being derived from the head of tuna we are told that we have only to break the nut in order to see in the sprouting germ the two eyes and the mouth of tuna the great eel the lover of ina  for a full understanding of this very complicated myth more information has been supplied by mr gill  ina means moon inamae aitu the heroine of our story means inawhohadadivine aitu lover and she was the daughter of kui the blind  tuna means eel and in mangaia it was unlawful for women to eat eels so that even now as mr gill informs me his converts turn away from this fish with the utmost disgust  from other stories about the origin of cocoanut trees told in the same island it would appear that the sprouts of the cocoanut were actually called eels heads while the skulls of warriors were called cocoanuts  taking all these facts together it is not difficult to imagine how the story of tunas brain grew up and i am afraid we shall have to confess that the legend of tuna throws but little light on the legend of daphne or on the etymology of her name  no one would have a word to say against the general principle that much that is irrational absurd or barbarous in the veda is a survival of a more primitive mythology anterior to the veda  how could it be otherwise    criticism of tuna and daphne   now 1 as to daphne we are not invariably told that hers was a case of the total change of a heroine into a tree  in ovid 14 she is thus changed  in hyginus on the other hand the earth swallows her and a tree takes her place  all the authorities are late  here i cannot but reflect on the scholarly method of mannhardt who would have examined and criticised all the sources for the tale before trying to explain it however daphne was not mangled a tree did not spring from her severed head or scattered limbs  she was metamorphosed or was buried in earth a tree springing up from the place  2  i think we do know why the people of mangaia believe in the change of human beings into trees  it is one among many examples of the savage sense of the intercommunity of all nature  antiquity made its division between man and the world in a very different sort than do the moderns 15a  i illustrate this mental condition fully in m r r i 4656  why savages adopt the major premise human life is on a level with the life of all nature philosophers explain in various ways  hume regards it as an extension to the universe of early mans own consciousness of life and personality  dr tylor thinks that the opinion rests upon a broad philosophy of nature 15b  m lefebure appeals to psychical phenomena as i show later see fetishism  at all events the existence of these savage metaphysics is a demonstrated fact  i established it 15c before invoking it as an explanation of savage belief in metamorphosis  3  the tuna story belongs to a very well known class of aetiological plantstories aetiological assigning a cause for the plant its peculiarities its name c which are meant to explain a no longer intelligible name of a plant c  i also say these myths are nature myths so far as they attempt to account for a fact in naturenamely for the existence of certain plants and for their place in ritual 16  the reader has before him mr max mullers view  the white kernel of the cocoanut was locally styled the brains of tuna  that name required explanation  hence the story about the fate of tuna  cocoanut was used in mangaia in the sense of head testa  so it is now in england  see bells life passim as the chicken got home on the cocoanut    the explanation   on the whole either cocoanut kernels were called brains of tuna because cocoanuthead and a head has brainsand well somehow i fail to see why brains of tuna in particular  or there being a story to the effect that the first cocoanut grew out of the head of the metamorphosed tuna the kernel was called his brains  but why was the story told and why of tuna  tuna was an eel and women may not eat eels and ina was the moon who a mangaian selene loved no latmian shepherd but an eel  seriously i fail to understand mr max mullers explanation  given the problem to explain a no longer intelligible plantnamebrains of tunaapplied not to a plant but to the kernel of a nut this name is explained by saying that the moon ina loved an eel cut off his head at his desire and buried it  thence sprang cocoanut trees with a fanciful likeness to a human faceface of tunaon the nut  but still why tuna  how could the moon love an eel except on my own general principle of savage levelling up of all life in all nature  in my opinion the mangaians wanted a fable to account for the resemblance of a cocoanut to the human heada resemblance noted as i show in our own popular slang  the mangaians also knew the moon in her mythical aspect as ina and tuna whatever his name may mean mr max muller does not tell us was an eel 17  having the necessary savage major premise in their minds all life is on a level and interchangeable the mangaians thought well to say that the headlike cocoanut sprang from the head of her lover an eel cut off by ina  the myth accounts i think for the peculiarities of the cocoanut rather than for the name brains of tuna for we still ask why of tuna in particular  why tuna more than rangoa or anyone else  we shall have to confess that the legend of tuna throws but little light on the legend of daphne or on the etymology of her name  i never hinted that the legend of tuna threw light on the etymology of the name of daphne  mangaian and greek are not allied languages  nor did i give the tuna story as an explanation of the daphne story  i gave it as one in a mass of illustrations of the savage mental propensity so copiously established by dr tylor in primitive culture  the two alternative explanations which i gave of the daphne story i have cited no mention of tuna occurs in either    disease of language and folketymology   the tuna story is described as a clear case of disease of language cured by the ordinary nostrum of folketymology  the disease showed itself i suppose in the presence of the mangaian words for brain of tuna  but the story of tuna gives no folketymology of the name tuna  now to give an etymology of a name of forgotten meaning is the sole object of folk etymology  the plantname snakes head given as an example by mr max muller needs no etymological explanation  a story may be told to explain why the plant is called snakes head but a story to give an etymology of snakes head is superfluous  the tuna story explains why the cocoanut kernel is called brains of tuna but it offers no etymology of tunas name  on the other hand the story that marmalade really marmalet is so called because queen mary found comfort in marmalade when she was seasickhence mariemalade hence marmaladegives an etymological explanation of the origin of the word marmalade  here is a real folketymology  we must never confuse such myths of folketymology with myths arising on the philological hypothesis from disease of language  thus daphne is a girl pursued by apollo and changed into a daphne plant or laurel or a laurel springs from the earth where she was buried  on mr max mullers philological theory daphnedahana and meant the burning one  apollo may be derived from a sanskrit form apavaryan or apavalyan though how greeks ever heard a sanskrit word if such a word as apavalyan ever existed we are not told and may mean one who opens the gate of the sky ii 692696 18  at some unknown date the ancestors of the greeks would say the opener of the gates of the sky apavalyan ie the sun pursues the burning one dahana ie the dawn  the greek language would retain this poetic saying in daily use till in the changes of speech apavalyan ceased to be understood and became apollo while dahana ceased to be understood and became daphne  but the verb being still understood the phrase ran apollo pursues daphne  now the greeks had a plant laurel called daphne  they therefore blended plant daphne and heroines name daphne and decided that the phrase apollo pursues daphne meant that apollo chased a nymph daphne who to escape his love turned into a laurel  i cannot give mr max mullers theory of the daphne story more clearly  if i misunderstand it that does not come from want of pains  in opposition to it we urge that 1 the etymological equations daphnedahana apolloapavalyan are not generally accepted by other scholars  schroder in fact derives apollo from the vedic saparagenya worshipful an epithet of agni who is fire ii 688 and so on daphnedahana is no less doubted  of course a greek simply cannot be derived from a sanskrit word as is stated though both may have a common origin just as french is not derived from italian  2 if the etymologies were accepted no proof is offered to us of the actual existence as a vera causa of the process by which a saying apollo pursues daphne remains in language while the meaning of the words is forgotten  this process is essential but undemonstrated  see the chapter here on the riddle theory  3 these processes if demonstrated which they are not must be carefully discriminated from the actual demonstrable process of folketymology  the marmalade legend gives the etymology of a word marmalade the daphne legend does not give an etymology  4 the theory of daphne is of the kind protested against by mannhardt where he warns us against looking in most myths for a mirrorpicture on earth of celestial phenomena 20a  for these reasons among others i am disinclined to accept mr max mullers attempt to explain the story of daphne    mannhardt on daphne   since we shall presently find mr max muller claiming the celebrated mannhardt as a sometime deserter of philological comparative mythology who returned to his old colours i observe with pleasure that mannhardt is on my side and against the oxford professor  mannhardt shows that the laurel daphne was regarded as a plant which like our rowan tree averts evil influences  moreover the laurel like the maibaum was looked on as a being with a spirit  this is the safest result which myth analysis can extract from the story of daphne a nymph pursued by apollo and changed into a laurel  it is a result of the use of the laurel in his ritual 20b  in 1877 a year after mannhardt is said by mr max muller to have returned to his old colours he repeats this explanation 21a  in the same work p 20 he says that there is no reason for accepting max mullers explanation about the sungod and the dawn wo jeder thatliche anhalt dafur fehlt  for this opinion we might also cite the sanskrit scholars whitney and bergaigne 21b     the question of allies   athanasius   mr max muller protests most justly against the statement that he like st athanasius stands alone contra mundum  if ever this phrase fell from my pen in what connection i know not it is as erroneous as the position of st athanasius is honourable  mr max mullers ideas in various modifications are doubtless still the most prevalent of any  the anthropological method has hardly touched i think the learned contributors to roschers excellent mythological lexicon  dr brinton whose american researches are so useful seems decidedly to be a member of the older school  while i do not exactly remember alluding to athanasius i fully and freely withdraw the phrase  but there remain questions of allies to be discussed    italian critics   mr max muller asks 22 what would mr andrew lang say if he read the words of signer canizzaro in his genesi ed evoluzione del mito 1893 lang has laid down his arms before his adversaries  mr lang would smile  and what would mr max muller say if he read the words of professor enrico morselli lang gives no quarter to his adversaries who for the rest have long been reduced to silence 23  the right hon professor also smiles no doubt  we both smile  solvuntur risu tabulae    a dutch defender   the question of the precise attitude of professor tiele the accomplished gifford lecturer in the university of edinburgh 1897 is more important and more difficult  his remarks were made in 1885 in an essay on the myth of cronos and were separately reprinted in 1886 from the revue de lhistoire des religions which i shall cite  where they refer to myself they deal with custom and myth not with myth ritual and religion 1887  it seems best to quote ipsissimis verbis mr max mullers comments on professor tieles remarks  he writes i viii  let us proceed next to holland  professor tiele who had actually been claimed as an ally of the victorious army declaresje dois melever au nom de la science mythologique et de lexactitude    centre une methode qui ne fait que glisser sur des problemes de premiere importance  see further on p 35  and again  ces braves gens qui pour peu quils aient lu un ou deux livres de mythologie et danthropologie et un ou deux recits de voyages ne manqueront pas de se mettre a comparer a tort et a travers et pour tout resultat produiront la confusion  again i 35  besides signer canizzaro and mr horatio hale the veteran among comparative ethnologists professor tiele in his le mythe de kronos 1886 has very strongly protested against the downright misrepresentations of what i and my friends have really written  professor tiele had been appealed to as an unimpeachable authority  he was even claimed as an ally by the ethnological students of customs and myths but he strongly declined that honour 1 c p 31  m lang ma fait 1honneur de me citer he writes comme un de ses allies et jai lieu de croire que m gaidoz en fait en quelque mesure autant  ces messieurs nont point entierement tort  cependant je dois melever au nom de la science mythologique et de 1exactitude dont elle ne peut pas plus se passer que les autres sciences contre une methode qui ne fait que glisser sur des problemes de premiere importance c  speaking of the whole method followed by those who actually claimed to have founded a new school of mythology he says p 21  je crains toutefois que ce qui sy trouve de vrai ne soit connu depuis longtemps et que la nouvelle ecole ne peche par exclusionisme tout autant que les ainees quelle combat avec tant de conviction  that is exactly what i have always said  what is there new in comparing the customs and myths of the greeks with those of the barbarians  has not even plato done this  did anybody doubt that the greeks nay even the hindus were uncivilised or savages before they became civilised or tamed  was not this commonsense view so strongly insisted on by fontenelle and vico in the eighteenth century carried even to excess by such men as de brosses 17091771  and have the lessons taught to de brosses by his witty contemporaries been quite forgotten  must his followers be told again and again that they ought to begin with a critical examination of the evidence put before them by casual travellers and that mythology is as little made up of one and the same material as the crust of the earth of granite only    reply   professor tiele wrote in 1885  i do not remember having claimed his alliance though i made one or two very brief citations from his remarks on the dangers of etymology applied to old proper names 25a  to citations made by me later in 1887 professor tiele cannot be referring 25b  thus i find no proof of any claim of alliance put forward by me but i do claim a right to quote the professors published words  these i now translate25c  what goes before shows adequately that i am an ally much more than an adversary of the new school whether styled ethnological or anthropological  it is true that all the ideas advanced by its partisans are not so new as they seem  some of usi mean among those who without being vassals of the old school were formed by ithad not only remarked already the defects of the reigning method but had perceived the direction in which researches should be made they had even begun to say so  this does not prevent the young school from enjoying the great merit of having first formulated with precision and with the energy of conviction that which had hitherto been but imperfectly pointed out  if henceforth mythological science marches with a firmer foot and loses much of its hypothetical character it will in part owe this to the stimulus of the new school    braves gens   professor tiele then bids us leave our cries of triumph to the servum imitatorum pecus braves gens and so forth as in the passage which mr max muller unless i misunderstand him regards as referring to the new school and notably to m gaidoz and myself though such language ought not to apply to m gaidoz because he is a scholar  i am left to uncovenanted mercies    professor tiele on our merits   the merits of the new school professor tiele had already stated26  if i were reduced to choose between this method and that of comparative philology i would prefer the former without the slightest hesitation this method alone enables us to explain the fact such a frequent cause of surprise that the greeks like the germans    could attribute to their gods all manner of cruel cowardly and dissolute actions  this method alone reveals the cause of all the strange metamorphoses of gods into animals plants and even stones     in fact this method teaches us to recognise in all these oddities the survivals of an age of barbarism long overpast but lingering into later times under the form of religious legends the most persistent of all traditions     this method enfin can alone help us to account for the genesis of myths because it devotes itself to studying them in their rudest and most primitive shape        destruction and construction   thus writes professor tiele about the constructive part of our work  as to the destructiveor wouldbe destructivepart he condenses my arguments against the method of comparative philology  to resume the whole house of comparative philological mythology is builded on the sand and her method does not deserve confidence since it ends in such divergent results  that is professor tieles statement of my destructive conclusions and he adds so far i have not a single objection to make  i can still range myself on mr langs side when he takes certain distinctions into which it is needless to go here 27    allies or not   these are several of the passages on which in 1887 i relied as evidence of the professors approval which i should have added is only partial it is he who unsolicited professes himself much more our ally than our adversary  it is he who proclaims that mr max midlers central hypothesis is erroneous and who makes no objection to my idea that it is builded on the sand  it is he who assigns essential merits to our method and i fail to find that he strongly declines the honour of our alliance  the passage about braves gens explicitly does not refer to us    our errors   in 1887 i was not careful to quote what professor tiele had said against us  first as to our want of novelty  that merit i think i had never claimed  i was proud to point out that we had been anticipated by eusebius of caesarea by fontenelle and doubtless by many others  we repose as professor tiele justly says on the researches of dr tylor at the same time it is professor tiele who constantly speaks of the new school while adding that he himself had freely opposed mr max mullers central hypothesis a disease of language in dutch periodicals  the professor also censures our exclusiveness our narrowness our songs of triumph our use of parody m gaidoz republished an old one not to my own taste i have also been guilty of the great gladstone myth and our charge that our adversaries neglect ethnological material  on this i explain myself later 28a    uses of philology   our method says professor tiele cannot answer all the questions which the science of mythology must solve or at least must study  certainly it makes no such pretence  professor tiele then criticises sir george cox and mr robert brown junior for their etymologies of poseidon  indiscreet followers are not confined to our army alone  now the use of philology we learn is to discourage such etymological vagaries as those of sir g cox 28b  we also discourage themseverely  but we are warned that philology really has discovered some undeniably certain etymologies of divine names well i also say philology alone can tell whether zeus asterios or adonis or zeus labrandeus is originally a semitic or a greek divine name here she is the pythoness we must all consult 29a  and is it my fault that even in this matter the pythonesses utter such strangely discrepant oracles  is athene from a zend root benfey a greek root curtius or to be interpreted by sanskrit ahana max muller  meanwhile professor tiele repeats that in a search for the origin of myths and above all of obscene and brutal myths philology will lead us far from our aim  now if the school of mr max muller has a mot dordre it is says professor tiele to call mythology a disease of language 29b but adds mr max mullers learned dutch defender mythologists while using philology for certain purposes must shake themselves free of course from the false hypothesis mr max mullers which makes of mythology a mere maladie du langage  this professor is rather a dangerous defender of mr max muller  he removes the very cornerstone of his edifice which tiele does not object to our describing as founded on the sand  mr max muller does not cite as far as i observe these passages in which professor tiele in my view and in fact abandons for certain uses his system of mythology  perhaps professor tiele has altered his mind and while keeping what mr max muller quotes braves gens and so on has withdrawn what he said about the false hypothesis of a disease of language  but my own last book about myths was written in 18861887 shortly after professor tieles remarks were published 1886 as i have cited them    personal controversy   all this matter of alliances may seem and indeed is of a personal character and therefore unimportant  professor tieles position in 1885 86 is clearly defined  whatever he may have published since he then accepted the anthropological or ethnological method as alone capable of doing the work in which we employ it  this method alone can discover the origin of ancient myths and alone can account for the barbaric element that old puzzle in the myths of civilised races  this the philological method useful for other purposes cannot do and its central hypothesis can only mislead us  i was not aware i repeat that i ever claimed professor tieles alliance as he followed by mr max muller declares  they cannot point as a proof of an assertion made by professor tiele 188586 to words of mine which did not see the light till 1887 in myth ritual and religion i pp 24 43 44  not that i deny professor tieles statement about my claim of his alliance before 188586  i merely ask for a reference to this claim  in 1887 30 i cited his observations already quoted on the inadequate and misleading character of the philological method when we are seeking for the origin of a myth or the physical explanation of the oldest myths or trying to account for the rude and obscene element in the divine legends of civilised races  i added the professors applause of the philological method as applied to other problems of mythology for example the genealogical relations of myths     the philological method alone can answer here aided doubtless by historical and archaeological researches as to the interrelations of races  this approval of the philological method i cited the reader will find the whole passage in the revue vol xii p 260  i remarked however that this will seem a very limited province though in this province philology is the pythoness we must all consult in this sphere she is supreme when her high priests are of one mind  thus i did not omit to notice professor tieles comments on the merits of the philological method  to be sure he himself does not apply it when he comes to examine the myth of cronos are the god and his myth original or imported  i have not approached this question because it does not seem to me ripe in this particular case 31a  mr lang has justly rejected the opinion of welcker and mr max muller that cronos is simply formed from zeuss epithet greek 31b  this opinion however mr max muller still thinks the most likely ii 507  my other citation of professor tiele in 1887 says that our pretensions are not unacknowledged by him and after a long quotation of approving passages i add the method is thus applauded by a most competent authority and it has been warmly accepted pray note the distinction by m gaidoz 31c  i trust that what i have said is not unfair professor tieles objections not so much to our method as to our manners and to my own use of the method in a special case have been stated or will be stated later  probably i should have put them forward in 1887 i now repair my error  my sole wish is to be fair if mr max muller has not wholly succeeded in giving the full drift of professor tieles remarks i am certain that it is from no lack of candour    the story of cronos   professor tiele now devotes fifteen pages to the story of cronos and to my essay on that theme  he admits that i was right in regarding the myth as extraordinarily old and that in greece it must go back to a period when greeks had not passed the new zealand level of civilisation  now the new zealanders were cannibals  but we are the victims of a great illusion if we think that a mere comparison of a maori and greek myth explains the myth  i only profess to explain the savagery of the myth by the fact admitted that it was composed by savages  the maori story is a myth of the creation of light  i for my part say it is a myth of the severance of heaven and earth 32a  and so it is  no being said in maori fiat lux  light is not here created  heaven lay flat on earth all was dark somebody kicked heaven up the already existing light came in  here is no creation de la lumiere  i ask professor tiele do you sir create light when you open your window shutters in the morning  no you let light in  the maori tale is also un mythe primitif de laurore a primitive dawn myth  dawn again here i lose professor tiele  has the myth of cronos the same sense  probably not as the maori story to my mind has not got it either  but professor tiele says the myth of cronos has precisely the opposite sense 32b  what is the myth of cronos  ouranos heaven married gaea earth  ouranos hid his children from the light in the hollows of earth hesiod  so too the new zealand gods were hidden from light while heaven rangi lay flat on papa earth  the children were concealed between the hollows of their parents breasts  they did not like it for they dwelt in darkness  so cronos took an iron sickle and mutilated ouranos in such a way enfin as to divorce him a thoro  thus i say were heaven and earth practically divorced  the greek gods now came out of the hollows where they had been like the new zealand gods hidden from the light    professor tiele on sunset myths   no says professor tiele the story of cronos has precisely the opposite meaning  the new zealand myth is one of dawn the greek myth is one of sunset  the mutilated part of poor ouranos is le phallus du ciel le soleil which falls into the cosmic ocean and then of course all is dark  professor tiele may be right here i am indifferent  all that i wanted to explain was the savage complexion of the myth and professor tiele says that i have explained that and xii 264 he rejects the etymological theory of mr max muller  i say that in my opinion the second part of the cronos myth the child swallowing performances of cronos was probably a worldwide marchen or tale attracted into the cycle of which cronos was the centre without any particular reason beyond the law which makes detached myths crystallise round any celebrated name  professor tiele says he does not grasp the meaning of or believe in any such law  well why is the worldwide tale of the cyclops told about odysseus  it is absolutely out of keeping and it puzzles commentators in fact here was a hero and there was a tale and the tale was attracted into the cycle of the hero the very last man to have behaved as odysseus is made to do 34  but cronos was an odious ruffian  the worldwide tale of swallowing and disgorging the children was attracted to his too notorious name by grace of congruity  does professor tiele now grasp my meaning saisir    our lack of scientific exactness   i do not here give at full length professor tieles explanation of the meaning of a myth which i do not profess to explain myself  thus drops of the blood of ouranos falling on earth begat the melies usually rendered nymphs of the ashtrees  but professor tiele says they were really bees hesychius greekgreekthat is to say stars everybody has observed that the stars rise up off the earth like the bees sprung from the blood of ouranos  in myth ritual and religion i 299315 i give the competing explanations of mr max muller of schwartz cronosstorm god preller cronosharvest god of others who see the sun or time in cronos while

souterrains  il habite les profondeurs sous la terre he is also le dieu du ciel nocturne  it may have been remarked that i declined to add to this interesting collection of plausible explanations of

as the sun is the mutilated part of ouranos tiele or is according to others the stone which cronos swallowed and which acted as an emetic    my lack of explanation of cronos   now i have offered no explanation at all of who cronos was what he was god of from what race he was borrowed from what language his name was derived  the fact is that i do not know the truth about these important debated questions  therefore after speaking so kindly of our method and rejecting the method of mr max muller professor tiele now writes thus and this mr max muller does cite as we have seen     mr lang and m gaidoz are not entirely wrong in claiming me as an    ally  but i must protest in the name of mythological science and of    the exactness as necessary to her as to any of the other sciences    against a method which only glides over questions of the first    importance name origin province race of cronos and which to    most questions can only reply with a smile cest chercher raison ou    il ny en a pas    my crime   now what important questions was i gliding over  in what questions did i not expect to find reason  why in this savage fatras about cronos swallowing his children about blooddrops becoming bees mr max muller says melian nymphs and bees being stars and all the rest of a prehistoric marchen worked over again and again by the later fancy of greek poets and by greek voyagers who recognised cronos in moloch  in all this i certainly saw no reason but i have given in tabular form the general if inharmonious conclusions of more exact and conscientious scholars their variegated hypotheses as mannhardt says in the case of demeter  my error rebuked by professor tiele is the lack of that scientific exactitude exhibited by the explanations arranged in my tabular form    my reply to professor tiele   i would reply that i am not engaged in a study of the cult of cronos but of the revolting element in his myth his swallowing of his children taking a stone emetic by mistake and disgorging the swallowed children alive the stone being on view at delphi long after the christian era  now such stories of divine feats of swallowing and disgorging are very common i show in savage myth and popular marchen the bushmen have kwai hemm who swallows the sacred mantis insect  he is killed and all the creatures whom he has swallowed return to light  such stories occur among australians kaffirs red men in guiana in greenland and so on  in some cases among savages  night conceived as a person or one star which obscures another star is said to swallow it  therefore i say natural phenomena explained on savage principles might give the data of the swallowing myth of cronos 37that is the myth of cronos may be probably is originally a naturemyth  on this principle cronos would be ad hoc the night professor tiele does not allude to this effort at interpretation  but i come round to something like the view of kuhn  cronos ad hoc is the midnight sky which professor tiele also regards as one of his several aspects  it is not impossible i think that if the swallowing myth was originally a naturemyth it was suggested by night  but the question i tried to answer was why did the greeks of all people tell such a disgusting story  and i replied with professor tieles approval that they inherited it from an age to which such follies were natural an age when the ancestors of the greeks were on or under the maori stage of culture  now the maoris a noble race with poems of great beauty and speculative power were cannibals like cronos  to my mind scientific exactitude is rather shown in confessing ignorance than in adding to the list of guesses    conclusion as to professor tiele   the learned professors remarks on being much more my ally than my opponent were published before my myth ritual and religion in which i 24 25 i cited his agreement with me in the opinion that the philological method mr max mullers is inadequate and misleading when it is a question of discovering the origin of a myth  i also quoted his unhesitating preference of ours to mr max mullers method i 43 44  i did not cite a tithe of what he actually did say to our credit  but i omitted to quote what it was inexcusable not to add that professor tiele thinks us too exclusive that he himself had already before us combated mr max mullers method in dutch periodicals that he blamed our songs of triumph and our levities that he thought we might have ignorant campfollowers that i glided over important questions bees blooddrops stars melian nymphs the phallus of ouranos c and showed scientific inexactitude in declining chercher raison ou il ny en a pas  none the less in professor tieles opinion our method is new or is not new illuminating successful and alone successful for the ends to which we apply it and finally we have shown mr max mullers method to be a house builded on the sand  that is the gist of what professor tiele said  mr max muller like myself quotes part and omits part  he quotes twice professor tieles observations on my deplorable habit of gliding over important questions  he twice says that we have actually claimed the professor as an ally of the victorious army the ethnological students of custom and myth and once adds but he strongly declined that honour  he twice quotes the famous braves gens passage excepting only m gaidoz as a scholar from a censure explicitly directed at our possible campfollowers as distinguished from ourselves  but if mr max muller quotes professor tieles remarks proving that in his opinion the army is really victorious if he cites the acquiescence in my opinion that his mythological house is builded on the sands or professor tieles preference for our method over his own or professor tieles volunteered remark that he is much more our ally than our adversary i have not detected the passages in contributions to the science of mythology  the reader may decide as to the relative importance of what i left out and of what mr max muller omitted  he says professor tiele and i differ on several points but we perfectly understand each other and when we have made a mistake we readily confess and correct it i 37  the two scholars i thought differed greatly  mr max mullers warcry slogan mot dordre is to professor tiele a false hypothesis  our method which mr max muller combats so bravely is all that professor tiele has said of it  but if all this is not conspicuously apparent in our adversarys book it does not become me to throw the first stone  we are all in fact inclined unconsciously to overlook what makes against our argument  i have done it and to the best of my belief mr max muller has not avoided the same error     mannhardt   mannhardts attitude   professor tiele it may appear really fights for his own hand and is not a thorough partisan of either side  the celebrated mannhardt too doubtless the most original student of folklore since grimm might at different periods of his career have been reckoned an ally now by philologists now by the new school  he may be said in fact to have combined what is best in the methods of both parties  both are anxious to secure such support as his works can lend    moral character impeached   mr max muller avers that his moral character seems to be aimed at by critics who say that he has no right to quote mannhardt or oldenberg as his supporters 1 xvi  now without making absurd imputations i do not reckon mannhardt a thorough partisan of mr max muller  i could not put our theory so well as mannhardt puts it  the study of the lower races is an invaluable instrument for the interpretation of the survivals from earlier stages which we meet in the full civilisation of cultivated peoples but which arose in the remotest fetishism and savagery  like mr max muller i do not care for the vague word fetishism otherwise mannhardts remark exactly represents my own position the anthropological position 42a  now mr max muller does not like that position  that position he assails  it was mannhardts however when he wrote the book quoted and so far mannhardt was not absolutely one of mr max mullers supportersunless i am one  i have even been accused says mr max muller of intentionally ignoring or suppressing mannhardts labours  how charitable 1 xvii  i trust from our authors use of the word todtschweigen that this uncharitable charge was made in germany    mannhardt   mannhardt for a time says mr max muller expressed his mistrust in some of the results of comparative mythology 1 xvii  indeed i myself quote him to that very effect 42b  not only some of the results but the philological method itself was distrusted by mannhardt as by curtius  the failure of the method in its practical working lies in a lack of the historical sense says mannhardt 42c  mr max muller may have probably has referred to these sayings of mannhardt or if he has not no author is obliged to mention everybody who disagrees with him  mannhardts method was mainly that of folklore not of philology he examined peasant customs and rites as survivals of the oldest paganism  mr frazer applies mannhardts rich lore to the explanation of greek and other rites in the golden bough that entrancing book  such was mannhardts position as i shall prove at large when he was writing his most famous works  but he returned at last to his old colours 1 xvii in die lettischen sonnenmythen 1875  in 1880 mannhardt died mr max muller does not say whether mannhardt before a decease deeply regretted recanted his heretical views about the philological method and his expressed admiration of the study of the lower races as an invaluable instrument  one would gladly read a recantation so important  but mr max muller does tell us that if i did not refer to his work in my previous contributions to the science of mythology the reason was simple enough  it was not as has been suggested my wish to suppress it todtschweigen but simply my want of knowledge of the materials with which he dealt german popular customs and traditions and therefore the consciousness of my incompetence to sit in judgment on his labours  again we are told that there was no need of criticism or praise of mannhardt  he had mr frazer as his prophetbut not till ten years after his death    mannhardts letters   mannhardts state of mind with regard to the general principles of comparative philology has been so exactly my own says mr max muller that he cites mannhardts letters to prove the fact  but as to the application to myth of the principles of comparative philology mannhardt speaks of the lack of the historical sense displayed in the practical employment of the method  this at least is not exactly mr max mullers own view  probably he refers to the later period when mannhardt returned to his old colours  the letters of mannhardt cited in proof of his exact agreement with mr max muller about comparative philology do not as far as quoted mention the subject of comparative philology at all 1 xviiixx  possibly philology is here a slip of the pen and mythology may be meant  mannhardt says to mullenhoff may 2 1876 that he has been uneasy at the extent which sun myths threaten to assume in my comparisons  he is opening a new point of view materials rush in so that the sad danger seemed inevitable of everything becoming everything  in mr max mullers own words written long ago he expressed his dread not of everything becoming everything a truly heraclitean state of affairs but of the omnipresent sun and the inevitable dawn appearing in ever so many disguises  have we not he asks arrived both at the same conclusion  really i do not know  had mannhardt quite cashiered the cornspirit who perhaps had previously threatened to become everything  he is still in great vigour in mr frazers golden bough and mr frazer is mannhardts disciple  but where all this time is there a reference by mannhardt to the general principles of comparative philology  where does he accept the omnipresent sun and the inevitable dawn  why he says the reverse he says in this letter that he is immeasurably removed from accepting them at all as mr max muller accepts them  i am very far from looking upon all myths as psychical reflections of physical phenomena still less as of exclusively solar or meteorological phenomena like kuhn schwartz max muller and their school  what a queer way of expressing his agreement with mr max muller  the professor expostulates with mannhardt 1 xxwhere has any one of us ever done this  well when mannhardt said all myths he wrote colloquially  shall we say that he meant most myths a good many myths a myth or two here and there  whatever he meant he meant that he was still more than very far removed from looking upon all myths as mr max muller does  mannhardts next passage i quote entire and textually from mr max mullers translation     i have learnt to appreciate poetical and literary production as an    essential element in the development of mythology and to draw and    utilise the consequences arising from this state of things  who has    not  but on the other hand i hold it as quite certain that a    portion of the older myths arose from nature poetry which is no longer    directly intelligible to us but has to be interpreted by means of    analogies  nor does it follow that these myths betray any historical    identity they only testify to the same kind of conception and    tendency prevailing on similar stages of development  of these nature    myths some have reference to the life and the circumstances of the    sun and our first steps towards an understanding of them are helped    on by such nature poetry as the lettish which has not yet been    obscured by artistic and poetical reflexion  in that poetry mythical    personalities confessedly belonging to a solar sphere are transferred    to a large number of poetical representatives of which the    explanation must consequently be found in the same solar sphere of    nature  my method here is just the same as that applied by me to the    treecult  mr max muller asks where is there any difference between this the latest and final system adopted by mannhardt and my own system which i put forward in 1856 1 xxi    how mannhardt differs from mr max muller   i propose to show wherein the difference lies  mannhardt says my method is just the same as that applied by me to the treecult  what was that method  mannhardt in the letter quoted by mr max muller goes on to describe it but mr max muller omits the description probably not realising its importance  for mannhardts method is the reverse of that practised under the old colours to which he is said to have returned    mannhardts method   my method is here the same as in the treecult  i start from a given collection of facts of which the central idea is distinct and generally admitted and consequently offers a firm basis for explanation  i illustrate from this and from wellfounded analogies  continuing from these i seek to elucidate darker things  i search out the simplest radical ideas and perceptions the germcells from whose combined growth mythical tales form themselves in very different ways  mr frazer gives us a similar description of mannhardts method whether dealing with sun myths or tree myths 46  mannhardt set himself systematically to collect compare and explain the living superstitions of the peasantry  now mr max muller has just confessed as a reason for incompetence to criticise mannhardts labours my want of knowledge of the materials with which he dealtthe popular customs and traditions of germany  and yet he asks where there is any difference between his system and mannhardts  mannhardts is the study of rural survival the system of folklore  mr max mullers is the system of comparative philology about which in this place mannhardt does not say one single word  mannhardt interprets some myths arising from nature poetry no longer intelligible to us by analogies mr max muller interprets them by etymologies  the difference is incalculable not that mannhardt always abstains from etymologising    another claim on mannhardt   while maintaining that all comparative mythology must rest on comparison of names as its most certain basis a system which mannhardt declares explicitly to be so far a failure mr max muller says it is well known that in his last nay posthumous essay mannhardt no mean authority returned to the same conviction  i do not know which is mannhardts very last essay but i shall prove that in the posthumous essays mannhardt threw cold water on the whole method of philological comparative mythology  however as proof of mannhardts return to mr max mullers convictions our author cites mythologische forschungen pp 86113    what mannhardt said   in the passages here produced as proof of mannhardts conversion he is not investigating a myth at all or a name which occurs in mythology  he is trying to discover the meaning of the practices of the lupercalia at rome  in february says dionysius of halicarnassus the romans held a popular festival and lads ran round naked save for skins of victims whipping the spectators  mannhardt in his usual way collects all the facts first and then analyses the name luperci  this does not make him a philological mythologist  to take a case in point at selkirk and queensferry the bounds are ridden or walked by burleymen or burrymen 48  after examining the facts we examine the words and ask why burley or burry men  at queensferry by a folk etymology one of the lads wears a coat stuck over with burrs  but boroughmen seems the probable etymology  as we examine the names burley or burry men so mannhardt examines the name luperci and if a true etymology can be discovered it will illustrate the original intention of the lupercalia p 86  he would like to explain the lupercalia as a popular play representing the spirits of vegetation opposing the spirits of infertility  but we do not forget that our whole theory of the development of the rite rests on a hypothesis which the lack of materials prevents us from demonstrating  he would explain luperci as lupiherciwolfgoats over this we need not linger but how does all this prove mannhardt to have returned to the method of comparing greek with vedic divine names and arriving thence at some celestial phenomenon as the basis of a terrestrial myth  yet he sometimes does this    my relations to mannhardt   if anything could touch and move an unawakened anthropologist it would be the conversion of mannhardt  my own relations with his ideas have the interest of illustrating mental coincidences  his name does not occur i think in the essay the method of folklore in the first edition of my custom and myth  in that essay i take as an example of the method the scottish and northumbrian kernababy the puppet made out of the last gleanings of harvest  this i compared to the greek demeter of the harvesthome with sheaves and poppies in her hands in the immortal seventh idyll of theocritus  our kernababy i said is a stunted survival of our older maiden a regular image of the harvest goddess and i compared greek  next i gave the parallel case from ancient peru and the odd accidental coincidence that there the maize was styled mama cora greek  in entire ignorance of mannhardts cornspirit or cornmother i was following mannhardts track  indeed mr max muller has somewhere remarked that i popularise mannhardts ideas  naturally he could not guess that the coincidence was accidental and also inevitable  two men unknown to each other were using the same method on the same facts    mannhardts return to his old colours   if then mannhardt was reconverted it would be a potent argument for my conversion  but one is reminded of the reconversion of prince charles  in 1750 he deserted the errors of the church of rome for those of the church of england  later he returned or affected to return to the ancient faith  a certain cardinal seemed contented therewith and as the historian remarks was clearly a man not difficult to please  mr max muller reminds me of the good cardinal  i do not feel so satisfied as he does of mannhardts reconversion    mannhardts attitude to philology   we have heard mannhardt in a letter partly cited by mr max muller describe his own method  he begins with what is certain and intelligible a mass of popular customs  these he explains by analogies he passes from the known to the obscure  philological mythologists begin with the unknown the name of a god  this they analyse extract a meaning and proceeding to the known fit the facts of the gods legend into the sense of his name  the methods are each others opposites yet the letter in which mannhardt illustrates this fact is cited as a proof of his return to his old colours    irritating conduct of mannhardt   nothing irritates philological mythologists so much nothing has injured them so much in the esteem of the public which goes into these things a little as the statement that their competing etymologies and discrepant interpretations of mythical names are mutually destructive  i have been told that this is a mean argument  but if one chemical analyst found bismuth where another found iridium and a third found argon the public would begin to look on chemistry without enthusiasm still more so if one chemist rarely found anything but inevitable bismuth or omnipresent iridium  now mannhardt uses this mean argument    mannhardt on demeter erinnys   in a posthumous work mythologische forschungen 1884 the work from which mr max muller cites the letter to mullenhoff mannhardt discusses demeter erinnys  she is the arcadian goddess who in the form of a mare became mother of despoina and the horse arion by poseidon 51a her anger at the unhandsome behaviour of poseidon caused demeter to be called erinnysto be angry being greek in arcadiana folketymology clearly  mannhardt first dives deep into the sources for this fable 51b  arion he decides is no mythological personification but a poetical ideal bezeichnung of the warhorse  legend is ransacked for proof of this  poseidon is the lord of wind and wave  now there are waves of corn under the wind as well as waves of the sea  when the suabian rustic sees the wave running over the corn he says da lauft das pferd and greeks before homer would say in face of the billowing corn greek there run horses  and homer himself 51c says that the horses of erichthonius children of boreas ran over cornfield and sea  we ourselves speak of seawaves as white horses  so to be brief mannhardt explains the myth of demeter erinnys becoming as a mare a mother by poseidon as a horse thus poseidon hippies or poseidon in horses form rushes through the growing grain and weds demeter and he cites peasant proverbs such as das korn heirathet das korn feiert hochzeit p 264  this is the germ of the arcadian saga     the arcadian myth of demeter erinnys is undeniably a blending of the    epic tradition of the ideal warhorse with the local cult of    demeter     it is a probable hypothesis that the belief in the    wedding of demeter and poseidon comes from the sight of the waves    passing over the cornfield    52  it is very neat  but a certain myth of loki in horseform comes into memory and makes me wonder how mannhardt would have dealt with that too liberal narrative  loki as a mare he being a male god became by the horse of a giant the father of sleipnir odins eightfooted steed  mr w a craigie supplies this note on lokis analogy with poseidon as a horse in the waves of corn     in north jutland when the vapours are seen going with a wavy motion    along the earth in the heat of summer they say loki is sowing oats    today or loki is driving his goats     nboats in danish are havre which suggests on hafrar goats    modern icelandic has hafraroats but the word is not found in the old    language  is loki a cornspirit    mannhardts mean argument   mannhardt now examines the explanations of demeter erinnys and her legend given by preller e curtius o muller a kuhn w sonne max muller e burnouf de gubernatis schwartz and h d muller  here he cries is a variegated list of hypotheses  demeter is     stormcloud    sun goddess    earth and moon goddess    dawn    night  poseidon is     sea    storm god    cloudhidden sun    rain god  despoina is     rain    thunder    moon  arion the horse is     lightning    sun    thunderhorse  erinnys is     stormcloud    red dawn  mannhardt decides after this exhibition of guesses that the demeter legends cannot be explained as refractions of any natural phenomena in the heavens p 275  he concludes that the myth of demeter erinnys and the parallel vedic story of saranyu who also had an amour as a mare are incongruous and that neither sheds any light on the other  he protests against the whole tendency to find prototypes of all aryan myths in the veda and to think that with a few exceptions all mythology is a terrestrial reflection of celestial phenomena p 280  he then goes into the contending etymologies of demeter and decides for the man was mortal and had been a philologer in favour of his own guess greekgreekcornmother p 294  this essay on demeter was written by mannhardt in the summer of 1877 a year after the letter which is given as evidence that he had returned to his old colours  the essay shows him using the philological string of variegated hypotheses as anything but an argument in favour of the philological method  on the other hand he warns us against the habit so common in the philological school of looking for prototypes of all aryan myths in the veda and of finding in most myths a reflection on earth of phenomena in the heavens erinnys being either stormcloud or dawn according to the taste and fancy of the inquirer  we also find mannhardt in 1877 starting from the knownlegend and rural survival in phrase and customand so advancing to the unknownthe name demeter  the philologists commence with the unknown the old name demeter erinnys explain it to taste and bring the legend into harmony with their explanation  i cannot say then that i share mr max mullers impression  i do not feel sure that mannhardt did return to his old colours    why mannhardt is thought to have been converted   mannhardts friend mullenhoff had an aversion to solar myths  he said 54 i deeply mistrust all these combinations of the new socalled comparative mythology  mannhardt was preparing to study lithuanian solar myths based on lithuanian and lettish marriage songs  mullenhoff and scherer seem to have thought this work too solar for their taste mannhardt therefore replied to their objections in the letter quoted in part by mr max muller  mannhardt was not the man to neglect or suppress solar myths when he found them merely because he did not believe that a great many other myths which had been claimed as celestial were solar like every sensible person he knew that there are numerous real obvious confessed solar myths not derived from a disease of language these arise from 1 the impulse to account for the doings of the sun by telling a story about him as if he were a person 2 from the natural poetry of the human mind 55  what we think they are not shown to arise from is forgetfulness of meanings of old words which ex hypothesi have become proper names  that is the theory of the philological school and to that theory to these colours i see no proof in the evidence given that mannhardt had returned  but the scalded child dreads cold water and mullenhoff apparently dreaded even real solar myths  mr max muller on the other hand if i do not misinterpret him supposes that mannhardt had returned to the philological method partly because he was interested in real solar myths and in the natural poetry of illiterate races    mannhardts final confession   mannhardts last work published in his life days was antike wald und feldkulte 1877  in the preface dated november 1 1876 after the famous letter of may 1876 he explains the growth of his views and criticises his predecessors  after doing justice to kuhn and his comparisons of european with indian myths he says that in his opinion comparative indogermanic mythology has not yet borne the expected fruits  the assured gains shrink into very few divine names such as dyauszeustius parjanyperkunas bhagabug varunauranus c  i wish he had completed the list included in c  other equations as sarameyahermeias saranyudemeter erinnys he fears will not stand close criticism  he dreads that jeux desprit geistvolle spiele des witzes may once more encroach on science  then after a lucid statement of mr max mullers position he says ich vermag dem von m muller aufgestellten principe wenn uberhaupt eine so doch nur eine sehr beschrankte geltung zuzugestehen     to the principle of max muller i can only assign a very limited    value if any value at all 56     taken all in all i consider the greater part of the results hitherto    obtained in the field of indogermanic comparative mythology to be as    yet a failure premature or incomplete my own efforts in german    myths 1858 included  that i do not however throw out the babe    with the bath as the proverb goes my essay on lettish sun myths in    bastianhartmanns ethnological journal will bear witness  such is mannhardts conclusion  taken in connection with his still later essay on demeter it really leaves no room for doubt  there i think he does throw out the child with the bath throw the knife after the handle  i do not suppose that mr max muller ever did quote mannhardt as one of his supporters but such a claim if really made would obviously give room for criticism    mannhardt on solar myths   what the attitude of mannhardt was in 1877 and later we have seen  he disbelieves in the philological system of explaining myths by etymological conjectures  he disbelieves in the habit of finding in myths of terrestrial occurrences reflections of celestial phenomena  but earlier in his long essay die lettischen sonnenmythen in zeitschrift fur ethnologie 1875 he examines the lettish popular songs about the sun the suns daughters the godsons and so forth  here of course he is dealing with popular songs explicitly devoted to solar phenomena in their poetical aspect  in the lettish sunsongs and sunmyths of the peasants we see he says a mythworld in process of becoming in an early state of development as in the veda p 325  but we may reply in the veda myths are already fullgrown or even decadent  already there are unbelievers in the myths  thus we would say in the veda we have 1 myths of nature formed in the remote past and 2 poetical phrases about heavenly phenomena which resemble the naturepoetry of the letts but which do not become fullgrown myths  the lett songs also have not developed into myths of which as in the apollo and daphne story by mr max mullers hypothesis the original meaning is lost  in the lett songs we have a mass of naturepicturesthe boat and the apples of the sun the red cloak hung on the oaktree and so on pictures by which it is sought to make elemental phenomena intelligible by comparison with familiar things  behind the phenomena are in popular belief personagesmythical personagesthe sun as a magnified nonnatural man or woman the suns mother daughters and other heavenly people  their conduct is motived in a human way  stories are told about them the sun kills the moon who revives  all this is perfectly familiar everywhere  savages in their fables account for solar lunar and similar elemental processes on the theory that the heavenly bodies are and act like human beings  the eskimo myth of the spots on the moon marks of ashes thrown by the sun in a love quarrel is an excellent example  but in all this there is no disease of language  these are frank naturemyths aetiological giving a fabulous reason for facts of nature    mannhardt on marchen   but mannhardt goes farther  he not only recognises as everyone must do the sun as explicitly named when he plays his part in myth or popular tale marchen  he thinks that even when the sun is not named his presence and reference to him and derivation of the incidents in marchen from solar myth may sometimes be detected with great probability pp 326 327  but he adds not that every marchen contains a reference to nature that i am far from asserting p 327  now perhaps nobody will deny that some incidents in marchen may have been originally suggested by naturemyths  the allswallowing and alldisgorging beast wolf or ogre may have been derived from a view of night as the allswallower  but to disengage natural phenomena mythically stated from the human tangle of marchen to find natural phenomena in such a palimpsest as perraults courtly and artificial version of a french popular tale is a delicate and dangerous task  in many stories a girl has three ballsone of silver one of gold one of diamondwhich she offers in succession as bribes  this is a perfectly natural invention  it is perilous to connect these balls gifts of ascending value with the solar apple of iron silver and gold p 103 and note 5  it is perilous and it is quite unnecessary  some onegubernatis i thinkhas explained the naked sword of aladdin laid between him and the sultans daughter in bed as the silver sickle of the moon  really the sword has an obvious purpose and meaning and is used as a symbol in proxymarriages  the blood shed by achilles in his latest victories is elsewhere explained as red clouds round the setting sun which is conspicuously childish  mannhardt leans at least in this direction    the two brothers   mannhardt takes the old egyptian tale of the two brothers bitiou and anepou  this fable as old in actual written literature as moses is a complex of half the marchen plots and incidents in the world  it opens with the formula of potiphars wife  the falsely accused brother flies and secretes his life or separable soul in a flower of the mystic vale of acacias  this affair of the separable soul may be studied in mr hartlands perseus and it animates as we shall see mr frazers theory of the origin of totemism  a golden lock of the wicked wifes hair is then borne by the nile to the kings palace in egypt  he will insist on marrying the lady of the lock  here we are in the cinderella formula en plein which may be studied in african and santhal shapes in miss coxes

dealing with a literary version of the marchen accommodated to royal tastes and egyptian ideas of royalty by a royal scribe the courtly perrault of the egyptian roisoleil  who can say what he

and puts it in water  bitiou revives  he changes himself into the sacred bull apisa feature in the story which is practically possible in egypt alone  the bull tells the king his story but the wicked

protests a grands cris against these identifications when made by others than mannhardt who says the marchen is an old obscure solar myth p 242  to others the story of bitiou seems an egyptian literary complex based on a popular set of tales illustrating furens quid femina possit and illustrating the world wide theory of the separable life dragging in formulas from other marchen and giving to all a thoroughly classical egyptian colouring 61a  solar myths we think have not necessarily anything to make in the matter    the golden fleece   mannhardt reasons in much the same way about the golden fleece  this is a peculiarly greek feature interwoven with the worldwide marchen of the lad the giants helpful daughter her aid in accomplishing feats otherwise impossible and the pursuit of the pair by the father  i have studied the storyas it occurs in samoa among red indian tribes and elsewherein a fartravelled tale 61b  in our late greek versions the quest of the fleece of gold occurs but in no other variants known to me  there is a lamb a boy changed into a lamb in romaic  his fleece is of no interest to anybody  out of his body grows a tree with a golden apple  sunyarns occur in popular songs  mannhardt pp 282 283 abounds in solar explanations of the fleece of gold hanging on the oak tree in the dark aeaean forest  idyia wife of the colchian king is clearly the dawn  aia is

colchis is the suntree of the lettish songs  perseus is a hero of light born in the dark tower night from the shower of gold sunrays  we can but say it may be so but who could explain all the complex perseussaga as a statement about elemental phenomena  or how can the fartravelled tale of the lad and the giants daughter be interpreted to the same effect above all in the countless examples where no fleece of gold occurs  the greek tale of jason is made up of several marchen as is the odyssey by epic poets  these marchen have no necessary connection with each other they are tagged on to each other and localised in greece and on the euxine 62a  a poetic popular view of the sun may have lent the peculiar and elsewhere absent incident of the quest of the fleece of gold on the shores of the black sea  the old epic poets may have borrowed from popular songs like the lettish chants p 328  a similar dubious adhesion may be given by us in the case of castor and polydeuces morning and evening stars and helen dawn 62b and the hesperides p 234  the germs of the myths may be popular poetical views of elemental phenomena  but to insist on elemental allegories through all the legends of the dioskouroi and of the trojan war would be to strain a hypothesis beyond the breakingpoint  much very much is epic invention unverkennbar das werk der dichter p 328    mannhardts approach to mr max muller   in this essay on lettish sunsongs 1875 mannhardt comes nearest to mr max muller  he cites passages from him with approval cf pp 314 322 his explanations by aid of sunsongs of certain features in greek mythology are plausible and may be correct  but we turn to mannhardts explicit later statement of his own position in 1877 and to his posthumous essays published in 1884 and on the whole we find in my opinion much more difference from than agreement with the oxford professor whose dawndaphne and other equations mannhardt dismisses and to whose general results in mythology he assigns a value so restricted it is a popular delusion that the anthropological mythologists deny the existence of solar myths or of naturemyths in general  these are extremely common  what we demur to is the explanation of divine and heroic myths at large as solar or elemental when the original sense has been lost by the ancient narrators and when the elemental explanation rests on conjectural and conflicting etymologies and interpretations of old proper namesathene hera artemis and the rest  nevertheless while mannhardt in his works on treecult and on field and wood cult and on the corn demon has wandered far from his old colourswhile in his posthumous essays he is even more of a deserter his essay on lettish sunmyths shows an undeniable tendency to return to mr max mullers camp  this was what made his friends so anxious  it is probably wisest to form our opinion of his final attitude on his preface to his last book published in his lifetime  in that the old colours are not exactly his chosen banner nor can the flag of the philological school be inscribed tandem triumphans  in brief mannhardts return to his old colours 187576 seems to have been made in a mood from which he again later passed away  but either modern school of mythology may cite him as an ally in one or other of his phases of opinion     philology and demeter erinnys   mr max muller on demeter erinnys   like mannhardt our author in his new treatise discusses the strange old arcadian myth of the horsedemeter erinnys ii 537  he tells the unseemly tale and asks why the earth goddess became a mare  then he gives the analogous myth from the rigveda 65 which as it stands is quite unintelligible  but yaska explains that saranyu daughter of tvashtri in the form of a mare had twins by vivasvat in the shape of a stallion  their offspring were the asvins who are more or less analogous in their helpful character to castor and pollux  now can it be by accident that saranyu in the veda is erinnys in greek  to this equation as we saw mannhardt demurred in 1877  who was saranyu yaska says the night that was yaskas idea  mr max muller adds i think he is right and that saranyu is the grey dawn ii 541  but the bewildered reader exclaims dawn is one thing and night is quite another  so yaska himself was intelligent enough to observe night is the wife of aditya she vanishes at sunrise  however night in mr max mullers system has just got to be dawn a position proved thus yaska makes this clear by saying that the time of the asvins sons of saranyu is after midnight but that when darkness prevails over light that is madhyama when light prevails over darkness that is aditya both being asvins  they the asvins are in fact darkness and light and therefore i understand saranyu who is night and not an asvin at all is dawn  to make this perfectly clear remember that the husband of saranyu whom she leaves at sunrise isi give you three guessesis the sun  the suns wife leaves the sun at sunrise 66  this is proved for aditya is vivasvatthe sun and is the husband of saranyu ii 541  these methods of proving night to be dawn while the substitute for both in the bed of the sun may have been meant for the gloaming ii 542 do seem to be geistvolle spiele des witzes ingenious jeux desprit as mannhardt says rather than logical arguments  but we still do not know how the horse and mare came in or why the statue of demeter had a horses head  this seems simply to be due to the fact that quite apart from this myth the sun had in india at least often been conceived as a horse     and the dawn had been likened to a mare  but how does this explain the problem  the vedic poets cited ii 542 either referred to the myth which we have to explain or they used a poetical expression knowing perfectly well what they meant  as long as they knew what they meant they could not make an unseemly fable out of a poetical phrase  not till after the meaning was forgotten could the myth arise  but the myth existed already in the veda  and the unseemliness is precisely what we have to account for that is our enigma  once more demeter is a goddess of earth not of dawn  how then does the explanation of a hypothetical dawnmyth apply to the earth  well perhaps the story the unseemly story was first told of erinnys who also is the inevitable dawn or of deo and this name of deo or dyava was mixed up with a hypokoristic form of demeter deo and thus led to the transference of her story to demeter  i know this will sound very unlikely to greek scholars yet i see no other way out of our difficulties ii 545  phonetic explanations follow  to my mind says our author there is no chapter in mythology in which we can so clearly read the transition of an auroral myth of the veda into an epic chapter of greece as in the chapter of saranyu or surama and the asvins ending in the chapter of helena and her brothers the greek ii 642  here as regards the asvins and the dioskouroi mannhardt may be regarded as mr max mullers ally but compare his note a f u w k p xx    my theory of the horse demeter   mannhardt i think ought to have tried at an explanation of myths so closely analogous as those two one indian one greek in which a goddess in the shape of a mare becomes mother of twins by a god in the form of a stallion  as mr max muller well says if we look about for analogies we find nothing as far as i know corresponding to the well marked features of this barbarous myth among any of the uncivilised tribes of the earth  if we did how we should rejoice  why then should we not rejoice when we find the allusion in rig veda x 17 1  i do rejoice  the song of triumph as professor tiele says will be found in m r r ii 266 note where i give the vedic and other references  i even asked why mr max muller did not produce this proof of the identity of saranyu and demeter erinnys in his selected essays pp 401 492  i cannot explain why this tale was told both of erinnys and of saranyu granting the certainty of the etymological equation saranyuerinnys which mannhardt doubted the chances against fortuitous coincidence may be reckoned by algebra and mr edgeworths trillions of trillions feebly express it  two goddesses indian and greek have ex hypothesi the same name and both as mares are mothers of twins  though the twins in india the asvins in greek an ideal warhorse and a girl differ in character still the coincidence is evidential  explain it i cannot and clearly as the confession may prove my lack of scientific exactness i make it candidly  if i must offer a guess it is that greeks and indians of india inherited a very ordinary savage idea  the gods in savage myths are usually beasts  as beasts they beget anthropomorphic offspring  this is the regular rule in totemism  in savage myths we are not told a god apollo or zeus or poseidon put on beast shape and begat human sons and daughters helen the telmisseis and so on  the god in savage myths was a beast already though he could of course shift shapes like any medicineman or modern witch who becomes a hare  this is not the exception but the rule in savage mythology  anyone can consult my myth ritual and religion or mr frazers work totemism for abundance of evidence  to loki a male god prosecuting his amours as a female horse i have already alluded and in m r r give cases from the satapatha brahmana  the saranyuerinnys myth dates i presume from this savage state of fancy but why the story occurred both in greece and india i protest that i cannot pretend to explain except on the hypothesis that the ancestors of greek and vedic peoples once dwelt together had a common stock of savage fables and a common or kindred language  after their dispersion the fables admitted discrepancies as stories in oral circulation occasionally do  this is the only conjecture which i feel justified in suggesting to account for the resemblances and incongruities between the myths of the mare demetererinnys and the mare saranyu     totemism   totemism   to the strange and widely diffused institution of totemism our author often returns  i shall deal here with his collected remarks on the theme the more gladly as the treatment shows how very far mr max muller is from acting with a shadow of unfairness when he does not refer to special passages in his opponents books  he treats himself and his own earlier works in the same fashion thereby perhaps weakening his argument but also demonstrating his candour were any such demonstration required  on totems he opens i 7  when we come to special cases we must not imagine that much can be gained by using such general terms as animism totemism fetishism c as solvents of mythological problems  to my mind all such general terms not excluding even darwinism or puseyism seem most objectionable because they encourage vague thought vague praise or vague blame  it is for instance quite possible to place all worship of animal gods all avoidance of certain kinds of animal food all adoption of animal names as the names of men and families under the wide and capacious cover of totemism  all theriolatry would thus be traced back to totemism  i am not aware however that any egyptologists have adopted such a view to account for the animal forms of the egyptian gods sanskrit scholars would certainly hesitate before seeing in indra a totem because he is called vrishabha or bull or before attempting to explain on this ground the abstaining from beef on the part of orthodox hindus i 7    totemism defined   i think i have defined totemism 71 and the reader may consult mr frazers work on the subject or mr maclennans essays or totemism in the encyclopaedia britannica  however i shall define totemism once more  it is a state of society and cult found most fully developed in australia and north america in which sets of persons believing themselves to be akin by blood call each such set by the name of some plant beast or other class of objects in nature  one kin may be wolves another bears another cranes and so on  each kin derives its kinname from its beast plant or what not pays to it more or less respect usually abstains from killing eating or using it except in occasional sacrifices is apt to claim descent from or relationship with it and sometimes uses its effigy on memorial pillars carved pillars outside huts tattooed on the skin and perhaps in other ways not known to me  in australia and north america where rules are strict a man may not marry a woman of his own totem and kinship is counted through mothers in many but not in all cases  where all these notes are combined we have totemism  it is plain that two or three notes of it may survive where the others have perished may survive in ritual and sacrifice 72a and in bestial or semibestial gods of certain nomes or districts in ancient egypt 72b in pictish names 72c in claims of descent from beasts or gods in the shape of beasts in the animals sacred to gods as apollo or artemis and so on  such survivals are possible enough in evolution but the evidence needs careful examination animal attributes and symbols and names in religion are not necessarily totemistic  mr max muller asks if any egyptologists have adopted the totem theory  he is apparently oblivious of professor sayces reference to a prehistoric age when the religious creed of egypt was still totemism  dr codrington is next cited for the apparent absence of totemism in the solomon islands and polynesia and professor oldenberg as denying that animal names of persons and clans necessarily imply totemism  who says that they do  clan chattan with its cat crest may be based not on a totem but on a popular etymology  animal names of individuals have nothing to do with totems  a man has no business to write on totemism if he does not know these facts    what a totem is   though our adversary now abandons totems he returns to them elsewhere i 198202  totem is the corruption of a term used by north american indians in the sense of clanmark or signboard ododam  the totem was originally a rude emblem of an animal or other object placed by north american indians in front of their settlements    the evidence for signboards   our authors evidence for signboards is from an ottawa indian and is published from his ms by mr hoskyns abrahall 73  the testimony is of the greatest merit for it appears to have first seen the light in a canadian paper of 1858  now in 1858 totems were only spoken of in lafitau long and such old writers and in coopers novels  they had not become subjects of scientific dispute so the evidence is uncontaminated by theory  the indians were we learn divided into local tribes and these into sections or families according to their ododamsdevices signs in modern usage coats of arms  perhaps crests would be a better word  all people of one ododam apparently under male kinship lived together in a special section of each village at the entrance to the enclosure was the figure of an animal or some other sign set up on the top of one of the posts  thus everybody knew what family dwelt in what section of the village  some of the families were called after their ododam  but the family with the bear ododam were called big feet not bears  sometimes parts of different animals were quartered my suggestion and one ododam was a small hawk and the fins of a sturgeon  we cannot tell of course on the evidence here whether big feet suggested bear or vice versa or neither  but mr frazer has remarked that periphrases for sacred beasts like big feet for bear are not uncommon  nor can we tell what couple of ancestors a small hawk and a sturgeons fins represent unless perhaps a hawk and a sturgeon 74a  for all this mr max muller suggests the explanation that people who marked their abode with crow or wolf might come to be called wolves or crows 74b  again people might borrow beast names from the prevalent beast of their district as arkades greek bears and so evolve the myth of descent from callisto as a shebear  all this however is only guesswork  the snake indians worship no snake  the snake indians are not a totem group but a local tribe named from the snake river as we say an ettrick man  once more the namegiving beast say great hare is explained by dr brinton as the inevitable dawn 74c  hasty writers remarks dr brinton say that the indians claim descent from different wild beasts  for evidence i refer to that hasty writer mr frazer and his book totemism  for a newly sprung up modern totem our author alludes to a boat among the mandans their totem or tutelary object of worship  an object of worship of course is not necessarily a totem  nor is a totem by the definition as a rule one of a class of objects anything but a natural object  mr max muller wishes that those who write about totems and totemism would tell us exactly what they mean by these words  i have told him and indicated better sources  i apply the word totemism to the widely diffused savage institution which i have defined    more about totems   the origin of totemism is unknown to me as to mr mclennan and dr robertson smith but mr max muller knows this origin  a totem is a clanmark then a clanname then the name of the ancestor of a clan and lastly the name of something worshipped by a clan i 201  all this applies in the first instance to red indians only  yes and clan applies in the first instance to the scottish clans only  when mr max muller speaks of clans among the red indians he uses a word whose connotation differs from anything known to exist in america  but the analogy between a scottish clan and an american totemkin is close enough to justify mr max muller in speaking of red indian clans  by parity of reasoning the analogy between the australian kobong and the american totem is so complete that we may speak of totemism in australia  it would be childish to talk of totemism in north america kobongism in australia pacarissaism in the realm of the incas totems kobongs and pacarissas all amounting to the same thing except in one point  i am not aware that australian blacks erect or that the subjects of the incas or that african and indian and asiatic totemists erected sign boards anywhere as the ottawa writer assures us that the ottawas do or used to do  and if they dont how do we know that kobongs and pacarissas were developed out of signboards    heraldry and totems   the ottawas are armigeri are heraldic so are the natives of vancouvers island who have wooden pillars with elaborate quarterings  examples are in south kensington museum  but this savage heraldry is not nearly so common as the institution of totemism  thus it is difficult to prove that the heraldry is the origin of totemism which is just as likely or more likely to have been the origin of savage heraldic crests and quarterings  mr max muller allows that there may be other origins    gods and totems   our author refers to unnamed writers who call indra or ammon a totem i 200  this is a foolish liberty with language  why should not all the gods of egypt with their heads of bulls and apes and cats be survivals of totemisms  why not indeed  professor sayce remarks they were the sacred animals of the clans survivals from an age when the religion of egypt was totemism  in egypt the gods themselves are totemdeities ie personifications or individual representations of the sacred character and attributes which in the purely totem stage of religion were ascribed without distinction to all animals of the holy kind  so says dr robertson smith  he and mr sayce are scholars not mere unscholarly anthropologists 76    an objection   lastly ii 403 when totems infected even those who ought to have been proof against this infantile complaint which is not even a disease of language of a respectable type then the objection that a totem meant originally a clanmark was treated as scholastic pedantry  alas i fear with justice  for if i call mr arthur balfour a tory will mr max muller refute my opinion by urging that a tory meant originally an irish rapparee or whatever the word did originally mean  mr max muller decides that we never find a religion consisting exclusively of a belief in fetishes or totems or ancestral spirits here at last we are in absolute agreement  so much for totems and sign boards  only a weak fanatic will find a totem in every animal connected with gods sacred names and religious symbols  but totemism is a fact whether totem originally meant a clanmark or signboard in america or not  and like mr sayce mr frazer mr rhys dr robertson smith i believe that totemism has left marks in civilised myth ritual and religion and that these survivals not a disease of language explain certain odd elements in the old civilisations    a weak brother   our authors habit of omitting references to his opponents has here caused me infinite inconvenience  he speaks of some eccentric person who has averred that a fetish is a totem inhabited by an ancestral spirit  to myself it seems that you might as well say abracadabra is gas and gaiters  as no reference was offered i invented a wild surmise that mr max muller had conceivably misapprehended mr frazers theory of the origin of totems  had our author only treated himself fairly he would have referred to his own anthropological religion pp 126 and 407 where the name of the eccentric definer is given as that of herr lippert 78  then came into my mind the words of professor tiele beware of weak brethrensuch as herr lippert seems as far as this definition is concerned to be  nobody knows the origin of totemism  we find no race on its way to becoming totemistic though we find several in the way of ceasing to be so  they are abandoning female kinship for paternity their rules of marriage and taboo are breaking down perhaps various totem kindreds of different crests and names are blending into one local tribe under the name perhaps of the most prosperous totemkin  but we see no race on its way to becoming totemistic so we have no historical evidence as to the origin of the institution  mr mclennan offered no conjecture professor robertson smith offered none nor have i displayed the spirit of scientific exactitude by a guess in the dark  to gratify mr max muller by defining totemism as mr mclennan first used the term is all that i dare do  here one may remark that if mr max muller really wants an accurate definition of totemism the works of mclennan frazer robertson smith and myself are accessible and contain our definitions he does not produce these definitions and criticise them he produces dr lipperts and criticises that  an argument should be met in its strongest and most authoritative form  define what you mean by a totem says professor max muller in his gifford lectures of 1891 p 123  he had to look no further for a definition an authoritative definition than to totem in the encyclopaedia britannica or to mclennan  yet his large and intelligent glasgow audience and his readers may very well be under the impression that a definition of totem is still to seek like prince charlies religion  controversy simply cannot be profitably conducted on these terms  the best representatives of anthropology are now engaged not so much in comparing as in discriminating 79  why not refer then to the results of their discriminating efforts  to treat all animal worship as due to totemism is a mistake  do we make it    mr frazer and myself   there is or was a difference of opinion between mr frazer and myself as to the causes of the appearance of certain sacred animals in greek religion  my notions were published in myth ritual and religion 1887 mr frazers in the golden bough 1890  necessarily i was unaware in 1887 of mr frazers still unpublished theory  now that i have read it he seems to me to have the better logic on his side and if i do not as yet wholly agree with him it is because i am not yet certain that both of our theories may not have their proper place in greek mythology    greek totemism   in c and m p 106 i describe the social aspects of totemism  i ask if there are traces of it in greece  suppose for arguments sake that in prehistoric greece the mouse had been a totem as it is among the oraons of bengal 80  in that case 1 places might be named from a mouse tribe 2 mice might be held sacred per se 3 the mouse name might be given locally to a god who superseded the mouse in pride of place 4 images of the mouse might be associated with that of the god 5 and used as a local badge or mark 6 myths might be invented to explain the forgotten cause of this prominence of the mouse  if all these notes occur they would raise a presumption in favour of totemism in the past of greece  i then give evidence in detail proving that all these six facts do occur among greeks of the troads and sporadically elsewhere  i add that granting for the sake of argument that these traces may point to totemism in the remote past the mouse though originally a totem need not have been an aryan totem p 116  i offer a list of other animals closely connected with apollo giving him a beasts name wolf ram dolphin and associated with him in myth and art  in m r r i apply similar arguments in the case of artemis and the bear of dionysus and the bull demeter and the pig and so forth moreover i account for the myths of descent of greek human families from gods disguised as dogs ants serpents bulls and swans on the hypothesis that kindreds who originally in totemistic fashion traced to beasts sans phrase later explained their own myth to themselves by saying that the paternal beast was only a god in disguise and en bonne fortune  this hypothesis at least colligates the facts and brings them into intelligible relationship with widelydiffused savage institutions and myths    the greek mousetotem   my theory connecting apollo smintheus and the placenames derived from mice with a possible prehistoric mousetotem gave me i confess considerable satisfaction  but in mr frazers golden bough ii 129 132 is published a group of cases in which mice and other vermin are worshipped for prudential reasonsto get them to go away  in the classical review vol vi 1892 mr ward fowler quotes aristotle and aelian on plagues of mice like the recent invasion of voles on the border sheepfarms  he adopts the theory that the sacred mice were adored by way of propitiating them  thus apollo may be connected with mice not as a god who superseded a mousetotem but as an expeller of mice like the wormkilling heracles and the locustheracles and the locustapollo 81a  the locust is still painted red salaamed to and set free in india by way of propitiating his companions 81b  thus the mouseapollo smintheus would be merely a god noted for his usefulness in getting rid of mice and any worship given to mice feeding them placing their images on altars their stamp on coins naming places after them and so on would be mere acts of propitiation  there would be no mousetotem in the background  i do not feel quite convincedthe mouse being a totem and a sacred or tabooed animal in india and egypt 82a  but i am content to remain in a balance of opinion  that the mouse is the night gubernatis or the lightning grohmann i am disinclined to believe  philologists are very apt to jump at contending meteorological explanations of mice and such small deer without real necessity and an anthropologist is very apt to jump at an equally unnecessary and perhaps equally undemonstrated totem    philological theory   philological mythologists prefer to believe that the forgotten meaning of words produced the results that the wolfborn apollo greek originally meant lightborn apollo 82b and that the wolf came in from a confusion between greek light and greek a wolf  i make no doubt that philologists can explain sminthian apollo the dogapollo and all the rest in the same way and account for all the other peculiarities of placenames myths works of art local badges and so forth  we must then i suppose infer that these six traits of the mouse already enumerated tally with the traces which actual totemism would or might leave surviving behind it or which propitiation of mice might leave behind it by a chance coincidence determined by forgotten meanings of words  the greek analogy to totemistic facts would be explained 1 either by asking for a definition of totemism and not listening when it is given or 2 by maintaining that savage totemism is also a result of a worldwide malady of language which in a hundred tongues produced the same confusions of thought and consequently the same practices and institutions  nor do i for one moment doubt that the ingenuity of philologists could prove the name of every beast and plant in every language under heaven to be a name for the inevitable dawn max muller or for the inevitable thunder or storm or lightning kuhn schwartz  but as names appear to yield storm lightning night or dawn with equal ease and certainty according as the scholar prefers dawn or storm i confess that this demonstration would leave me sceptical  it lacks scientific exactitude    mr frazer on  animals in greek religion   in the golden bough ii 37 mr frazer whose superior knowledge and acuteness i am pleased to confess has a theory different from that which i following mclennan propounded before the golden bough appeared greece had a bullshaped dionysus 83a  there is left no room to doubt that in rending and devouring a live bull at his festival his worshippers believed that they were killing the god eating his flesh and drinking his blood 83b  mr frazer concludes that there are two possible explanations of dionysus in his bull aspect 1  this was an expression of his character as a deity of vegetation especially as the bull is a common embodiment of the cornspirit in northern europe 84a 2  the other possible explanation appears to be the view taken by mr lang who suggests that the bullformed dionysus had either been developed out of or had succeeded to the worship of a bulltotem 84b  now anthropologists are generally agreed i think that occasional sacrifices of and communion in the flesh of the totem or other sacred animals do occur among totemists 84c  but mr frazer and i both admit and indeed are eager to state publicly that the evidence for sacrifice of the totem and communion in eating him is very scanty  the fact is rather inferred from rites among peoples just emerging from totemism see the case of the californian buzzard in bancroft than derived from actual observation  on this head too much has been taken for granted by anthropologists  but i learn that direct evidence has been obtained and is on the point of publication  the facts i may not anticipate here but the evidence will be properly sifted and bias of theory discounted  to return to my theory of the development of dionysus into a totem or of his inheritance of the rites of a totem mr frazer says of course this is possible but it is not yet certain that aryans ever had totemism 84d  now in writing of the mouse i had taken care to observe that in origin the mouse as a totem need not have been aryan but adopted people who think that the aryans did not pass through a stage of totemism female kin and so forth can always fall back to account for apparent survivals of such things among aryans on prearyan conquered peoples such as the picts  aryans may be enticed by these bad races and become pictis ipsis pictiores    aryan totems    generally speaking and how delightfully characteristic of us all is this i see totems in greek sacred beasts where mr frazer sees the cornspirit embodied in a beast and where mr max muller sees in the case of indra called the bull words meaning simply male manly strong an animal simile 85a  here of course mr max muller is wholly in the right when a vedic poet calls indra strong bull or the like  such poetic epithets do not afford the shadow of a presumption for vedic totemism even as a survival  mr frazer agrees with me and mr max muller in this certainty  i myself say if in the shape of indra there be traces of fur and feather they are not very numerous nor very distinct but we give them for what they may be worth  i then give them 85b  to prove that i do not force the evidence i take the vedic text 85c  his mother a cow bore indra an unlicked calf  i then give sayanas explanation  indra entered into the body of dakshina and was reborn of her  she also bore a cow  but this legend i say has rather the air of being an invention apres coup to account for the vedic text of calf indra born from a cow than of being a genuine ancient myth  the vedic myth of indras amours in shape of a ram i say will doubtless be explained away as metaphorical  nay i will go further  it is perfectly conceivable to me that in certain cases a poetic epithet applied by a poet to a god say bull ram or snake might be misconceived and might give rise to the worship of a god as a bull or snake or ram  further if civilised ideas perished and if a race retained a bullgod born of their degradation and confusion of mind they might eat him in a ritual sacrifice  but that all totemistic races are totemistic because they all first metaphorically applied animal names to gods and then forgot what they had meant and worshipped these animals sans phrase appears to me to be if not incredible still greatly in want of evidence    mr frazer and i   it is plain that where a people claim no connection by descent and blood from a sacred animal are neither of his name nor kin the essential feature of totemism is absent  i do not see that eaters of the bull dionysus or cultivators of the pig demeter 86 made any claim to kindred with either god  their towns were not allied in name with pig or bull if traces of such a belief existed they have been sloughed off  thus mr frazers explanation of greek pigs and bulls and all their odd rites as connected with the beast in which the cornspirit is incarnate holds its ground better than my totemistic suggestion  but i am not sure that the cornspirit accounts for the sminthian mouse in all his aspects nor for the arcadian and attic bearrites and myths of artemis  mouse and bear do appear in mr frazers catalogue of forms of the cornspirits taken from mannhardt 87  but the arcadians as we shall see claimed descent from a bear and the mouse placenames and badges of the troad yield a hint of the same idea  the many greek family claims to descent from gods as dogs bulls ants serpents and so on may spring from gratitude to the cornspirit  does mr frazer think so  nobody knows so well as he that similar claims of descent from dogs and snakes are made by many savage kindreds who have no agriculture no corn and of course no cornspirits  these remarks i trust are not undiscriminating and naturally i yield the bull dionysus and the pig demeter to the cornspirit vice totem superseded  but i do hanker after the arcadian bear as at least a possible survival of totemism  the scottish school inspector removed a picture of behemoth as a fabulous animal from the wall of a school room  but not being sure of the natural history of the unicorn he just let him bide and gave the puir beast the benefit o the doubt  will mr frazer give the arcadian bear the benefit of the doubt  i am not at all bigoted in the opinion that the greeks may have once been totemists  the strongest presumption in favour of the hypothesis is the many claims of descent from a god disguised as a beast  but the institution if ever it did exist among the ancestors of the greeks had died out very long before homer  we cannot expect to find traces of the prohibition to marry a woman of the same totem  in rome we do find traces of exogamy as among totemists  formerly they did not marry women connected with them by blood 88a  but we do not find and would not expect to find that the blood was indicated by the common totem    mr frazer on origin of totemism   mr frazer has introduced the term sextotems in application to australia  this is connected with his theory of the origin of totemism i cannot quite approve of the term sextotems  if in australia each sex has a protecting animalthe men a bat the women an owlif the slaying of a bat by a woman menaces the death of a man if the slaying of an owl by a woman may cause the decease of a man all that is very unlike totemism in other countries  therefore i ask mr frazer whether in the interests of definite terminology he had not better give some other name than totem to his australian sex protecting animals  he might take for a local fact a local name and say sex kobong  once more for even we anthropologists have our bickerings i would hesitate dislike of this passage in mr frazers work 88b  when a savage names himself after an animal calls it his brother and refuses to kill it the animal is said to be his totem  distinguo  a savage does not name himself after his totem any more than mr frazer named himself by his clanname originally norman  it was not as when miss betty amory named herself blanche by her own will and fantasy  a savage inherits his totem name usually through the mothers side  the special animal which protects an individual savage zapotec tona guatemalan nagual north america manitou medicine is not that savages totem 89a  the nagual tona or manitou is selected for each particular savage at birth or puberty in various ways in america north and central by a dream in a fast or after a dream posthypnotic suggestion  but a savage is born to his kintotem  a man is born a wolf of the delawares his totem is the wolf he cannot help himself  but after or in his medicine fast and sleep he may choose a dormouse or a squirrel for his manitou tona nagual or private protecting animal  these are quite separate from totems as mr max muller also points out  of totems i for one must always write in the sense of mr mclennan who introduced totemism to science  thus to speak of sextotems or to call the protecting animal of each individual a totem is i fear to bring in confusion and to justify mr max mullers hard opinion that totemism is illdefined  for myself i use the term in the strict sense which i have given and in no other  mr mclennan did not profess as we saw to know the origin of totems  he once made a guess in conversation with me but he abandoned it  professor robertson smith did not know the origin of totems  the origin of totems is as much a problem as the origin of local gods 89b  mr max muller knows the origin signboards are the origin or one origin  but what was the origin of signboards  we carry the pictures of saints on our banners because we worship them we dont worship them because we carry them as banners says de brosses an acute man  did the indians worship totems because they carved them on signboards if they all did so or did they carve them on signboards because they worshipped them    mr frazers theory   the australian respects his sextotem because the life of his sex is bound up in its life  he speaks of it as his brother and calls himself as distinguished by his sex by its name  as a man he is a bat as a woman his wife is an owl  as a member of a given human kin he may be a kangaroo perhaps his wife may be an emu  but mr frazer derives totemism all the world over from the same origin as he assigns to sex totems  in these the life of each sex is bound up therefore they are by each sex revered  therefore totemism must have the same origin substituting kin or tribe for sex  he gives examples from australia in which killing a mans totem killed the man 90  i would respectfully demur or suggest delay  can we explain an american institution a fairly worldwide institution totemism by the local peculiarities of belief in isolated australia  if in america to kill a wolf was to kill uncas or chingachgook i would incline to agree with mr frazer  but no such evidence is adduced  nor does it help mr frazer to plead that the killing of an americans nagual or of a zulus ihlozi kills that zulu or american  for a nagual as i have shown is one thing and a totem is another nor am i aware that zulus are totemists  the argument of mr frazer is based on analogy and on a special instance that instance of the australians is so archaic that it may show totemism in an early form  mr frazers may be a correct hypothesis but it needs corroboration  however mr frazer concludes the totem if i am right is simply the receptacle in which a man keeps his life  yet he never shows that a choctaw does keep his life in his totem  perhaps the choctaw is afraid to let out so vital a secret  the less reticent australian blurts it forth  suppose the hypothesis correct  men and women keep their lives in their naguals private sacred beasts  but why on this score should a man be afraid to make love to a woman of the same nagual  have red indian women any naguals  i never heard of them  since writing this i have read miss kingsleys travels in west africa there the bushsouls which she mentions p 459 bear analogies to totems being inherited sacred animals connected with the life of members of families  the evidence though vaguely stated favours mr frazers hypothesis to which miss kingsley makes no allusion     the validity of anthropological evidence   anthropological evidence   in all that we say of totemism as later of fetishism we rely on an enormous mass of evidence from geographers historians travellers settlers missionaries explorers traders civil servants and european officers of native police in australia and burmah  our witnesses are of all ages from herodotus to our day of many nations of many creeds of different theoretical opinions  this evidence so worldwide so diversified in source so old and so new mr max muller impugns  but before meeting his case let us clear up a personal question    positions one never held      it is not pleasant writes our author to have to defend positions    which one never held nor wishes to hold and i am therefore all the    more grateful to those who have pointed out the audacious    misrepresentations of my real opinion in comparative mythology and    have rebuked the flippant tone of some of my eager critics i 26    27  i must here confess to the belief that no gentleman or honest man ever consciously misrepresents the ideas of an opponent  if it is not too flippant an illustration i would say that no bowler ever throws consciously and wilfully his action however may unconsciously develop into a throw  there would be no pleasure in argument cricket or any other sport if we knowingly cheated  thus it is always unconsciously that adversaries pervert garble and misrepresent each others opinions unconsciously not audaciously  if people would start from the major premise that misrepresentations if such exist are unconscious errors much trouble would be spared    positions which i never held   thus mr max muller never dreamed of audaciously misrepresenting me when in four lines he made two statements about my opinions and my materials which are at the opposite pole from the accurate i 12 when i speak of the vedic rishis as primitive i do not mean what mr a lang means when he calls his savages primitive  but i have stated again and again that i dont call my savages primitive  thus contemporary savages may be degraded they certainly are not primitive 93a  one thing about the past of contemporary savages we do know it must have been a long past 93b  we do not wish to call savages primitive 93c  all this was written in reply to the very proper caution of dr fairbairn that savages are not primitive  of course they are not that is of the essence of my theory  i regret the use of the word primitive even in primitive culture  savages as a rule are earlier more backward than civilised races as of course mr max muller admits where language is concerned 94  now after devoting several pages to showing in detail how very far from primitive even the australian tribes are might i if i were illnatured not say that mr max muller audaciously misrepresents me when he avers that i call my savages primitive  but he never dreamed of misrepresenting me he only happened not to understand my position  however as he complains in his own case it is not pleasant to have to defend positions which one never held i 26 and indeed i shall defend no such position  my adversary next says that my savages are of the nineteenth century it is of the essence of my theory that my savages are of many different centuries  those described by herodotus strabo dio cassius christoval de moluna sahagun cieza de leon brebeuf garoilasso de la vega lafitau nicholas damascenus leo africanus and a hundred others are not of the nineteenth century  this fact is essential because the evidence of old writers from herodotus to egede corroborates the evidence of travellers indian civil servants and missionaries of today by what dr tylor when defending our materials calls the test of recurrence  professor millar used the same argument in his origin of rank in the last century  thus mr max muller unconsciously misrepresents me and my savages when he says that my savages are of the nineteenth century  the fact is the reverse  they are of many centuries  these two unconscious misrepresentations occur in four consecutive lines    anthropological evidence   in connection with this topic the nature of anthropological evidence mr max muller i 205207 repeats what he has often said before  thus he cites dr codringtons remarks most valuable remarks on the difficulty of reporting correctly about the ideas and ways of savages  i had cited the same judicious writer to the same effect 95 and had compiled a number of instances in which the errors of travellers were exposed and their habitual fallacies were detected  fifteen closely printed pages were devoted by me to a criterion of evidence and a reply to mr max mullers oftrepeated objections     when i said we find dr codrington taking the same precautions in    melanesia as mr sproat took among the ahts and when his account of    melanesian myths reads like a close copy of mr sproats account of    aht legends and when both are corroborated as to the existence of    analogous savage myths by the collections of bleek and hahn and    gill and castren and rink in far different corners of the world    while the modern testimony of these scholarly men is in harmony with    that of the old jesuit missionaries and of untaught adventurers who    have lived for many years with savages surely it will be admitted    that the difficulty of ascertaining savage opinion has been to a    great extent overcome  i also cited at length dr tylors masterly argument to the same effect an argument offered by him to a great historian apparently    mr max mullers method of controversy   now no member of the reading public perusing mr max muller on anthropological evidence i 2426 205207 could guess that his cautions about evidence are not absolutely new to us  he could not guess that dr tylor replied to them before they were made by our present critic i think and that i did the same with great elaboration  our defence of our evidence is not noticed by mr max muller  he merely repeats what he has often said before on the subject exactly as if anthropologists were ignorant of it and had not carefully studied assimilated profited by it and answered it  our critic and monitor might have said i have examined your test of recurrences and what else you have to urge and for such and such reasons i must reject it then we could reconsider our position in this new light  but mr max muller does not oblige us in this way    mr max muller on our evidence   in an earlier work the gifford lectures for 1891 96 our author had devoted more space to a criticism of our evidence  to this then we turn pp 169180 413436  passing mr max mullers own difficulties in understanding a mohawk which the mohawk no doubt also felt in understanding mr max muller we reach p 172 the fables about godless savages  these it is admitted are exploded among scholars in anthropology  so we do at least examine evidence  mr max muller now fixes on a flagrant case some fables about the godless mincopies of the andaman islands  but he relies on the evidence of mr man  so do i as far as it seems beyond doubt 97a  mr man is a careful observer a student of language and perfectly trustworthy  these are the reasons for which i trust him  but when mr man says that the mincopies have a god puluga who inhabits a stone house in the sky i remark here the idea of the stone house is necessarily borrowed from our stone houses at port blair 97b  when mr man talks of pulugas onlybegotten son a sort of archangel medium between puluga and the angels i hesitate a doubt  did not this idea reach the mincopie mind from the same quarter as the stone house especially as pulugas wife is a green shrimp or an eel  at all events it is right to bear in mind that as the stone house of the mincopie heaven is almost undeniably of european origin the onlybegotten mediating son of puluga and the green shrimp may bear traces of christian teaching  caution is indicated  does mr max muller so strict about evidence boggle at the stone house the only son the shrimp  not he he never hints at the shrimp  does he point out that one anthropologist has asked for caution in weighing what the mincopies told mr man  very far from that he complains that the old story is repeated again and again about the godless andamans 97c the intelligent glasgow audience could hardly guess that anthropologists were watchful and knew pretty well what to believe about the mincopies perhaps in glasgow they do not read us anthropologists much  on p 413 our author returns to the charge  he observes as i have also observed the often contradictory nature of our evidence  here i may offer an anecdote  the most celebrated of living english philosophers heard that i was at one time writing a book on the ghostly in history anthropology and society old or new savage or civilised  he kindly dictated a letter to me asking how i could give time and pains to any such marvels  for he argued the most unveracious fables were occasionally told about himself in newspapers and social gossip  if evidence cannot be trusted about a living and distinguished british subject how can it be accepted about hallucinations  i replied with respect that on this principle nothing could be investigated at all  history justice trade everything would be impossible  we must weigh and criticise evidence  as my friendly adviser had written much on savage customs and creeds he best knew that conflicting testimony even on his own chosen theme is not peculiar to ghost stories  in a world of conflicting testimony we live by criticising it  thus when mr max muller says that i call my savages primitive and when i on the other hand quote passages in which i explicitly decline to do so the evidence as to my views is contradictory  yet the truth can be discovered by careful research  the application is obvious  we must not despair of truth  as our monitor says we ought to discard all evidence that does not come to us either from a man who was able himself to converse with native races or who was at least an eyewitness of what he relates  precisely that is our method  i for one do not take even a ghost story at second hand much less anything so startling as a savage rite  and we discount and allow for every bias and prejudice of our witnesses  i have made a list of these idola in m r r ii 334344  mr max muller now gives a list of inconsistencies in descriptions of australian blacks  they are not blacks they have a dash of copper colour  well i never said that they had the sooty tinge of the african negro  did anybody  mr ridley thinks that all natives are called murri  mr curr says no  important  we must reserve our judgment  missionaries say the blacks are devoid of moral ideas  what missionaries  what anthropologist believes such nonsense  there are differences of opinion about landed property communal or private  the difference rages among historians of civilised races  so also as to portable property  mr curr mr max mullers witness agrees here with those whose works i chiefly rely on  mr mclennan has built a whole social theory on the statement a single statement made by sir george grey and contradicted by mr curr  mr mclennan would be i think rather surprised at this remark but what would he do  why he would reexamine the whole question decide by the balance of evidence and reject modify or retain his theory accordingly  all sciences have to act in this way therefore almost all scientific theories are fluctuating  nothing here is peculiar to anthropology  a single word or two or three will prove or disprove a theory of phonetic laws  even phonetics are disputable ground  in defence of my late friend mr mclennan i must point out that if he built a whole social theory on a single statement of sir george greys and if mr curr denies the truth of the statement mr frazer has produced six or seven witnesses to the truth of that very statement in other parts of the world than australia 100  to this circumstance we may return  mr max muller next produces mr currs opinions about the belief in a god and morality among australians  here he really contradicts himself  the disputable evidence about australian marriage laws is next shown to be disputable  that is precisely why dr tylor is applying to it his unrivalled diligence in accurate examination  we await his results  finally the contradictory evidence as to tasmanian religion is exposed  we have no codrington or bleek for tasmania  the tasmanians are extinct and science should leave the evidence as to their religion out of her accounts  we cannot crossexamine defunct tasmanians  from all this it follows that anthropologists must sift and winnow their evidence like men employed in every other branch of science  and who denies it  what anthropologist of mark accepts as gospel any casual travellers tale    the test of recurrences   even for travellers tales we have a use we can apply to them dr tylors test of recurrences     if two independent visitors to different countries say a mediaeval    mahommedan in tartary and a modern englishman in dahomey or a jesuit    missionary in brazil and a wesley an in the fiji islands agree in    describing some analogous art or rite or myth among the people they    have visited it becomes difficult or impossible to set down such    correspondence to accident or wilful fraud  a story by a bushranger    in australia may perhaps be objected to as a mistake or an invention    but did a methodist minister in guinea conspire with him to cheat the    public by telling the same story there  the whole passage should be read it was anticipated by professor millar in his origin of rank and has been restated by myself 101a  thus i wrote in 1887 it is to be regretted that mr max muller entirely omits to mention    the corroboration which is derived from the undesigned coincidence of independent testimony  in 18911892 he still entirely omits to mention to his glasgow audience the strength of his opponents case  he would serve us better if he would criticise the test of recurrences and show us its weak points    bias of theory   yes our critic may reply but mr curr thinks that there is a strong tendency in observers abroad if they have become acquainted with a new and startling theory that has become popular at home to see confirmations of it everywhere  so i had explicitly stated in commenting on dr tylors test of recurrences 101b  travellers and missionaries have begun to read anthropological books and their evidence is therefore much more likely to be biassed now by anthropological theories than it was of old  so mr mclennan in the very earliest of all writings on totemism said as the totem has not till now got itself mixed up with speculations the observers have been unbiassed  mr mclennan finally declined to admit any evidence as to the savage marriage laws collected after his own theory and other theories born from it had begun to bias observers of barbaric tribes  it does not quite seem to me that mr max muller makes his audience acquainted with these precautions of anthropologists with their sedulous sifting of evidence and watchfulness against the theoretical bias of observers  thus he assails the faible not the fort of our argument and may even seem not to be aware that we have removed the faible by careful discrimination  what opinion must his readers who know not mr mclennans works entertain about that acute and intrepid pioneer a man of warm temper i admit a man who threw out his daringly original theory at a heat using at first such untrustworthy materials as lay at hand but a man whom disease could not daunt and whom only death prevented from building a stately edifice on the soil which he was the first to explore  our author often returns to the weakness of the evidence of travellers and missionaries    concerning missionaries   here is an example of a vivacite in our censor  with regard to ghosts and spirits among the melanesians our authorities whether missionaries traders or writers on ethnology are troubled by no difficulties i 207  yet on this very page mr max muller has been citing the difficulties which do trouble a missionary dr codrington  and for my own part when i want information about melanesian beliefs it is to dr codringtons work that i go 103  the doctor himself a missionary ex hypothesi untroubled by difficulties has just been quoted by mr max muller and by myself as a witness to the difficulties which trouble himself and us  what can mr max muller possibly mean  am i wrong  was dr codrington not a missionary  at all events he is the authority on melanesia a high authority i 206     the philological method in anthropology   mr max muller as ethnologist   our author is apt to remonstrate with his anthropological critics and to assure them that he also has made studies in ethnology  i am not such a despairer of ethnology as some ethnologists would have me  he refers us to the assistance which he lent in bringing out dr hahns tsunigoam 1881 mr gills myths and songs from the south pacific 1876 and probably other examples could be added  but my objection is not that we should be ungrateful to mr max muller for these and other valuable services to anthropology but that when he has got his anthropological material he treats it in what i think the wrong way or approves of its being so treated  here indeed is the irreconcilable difference between two schools of mythological interpretation  given dr hahns book on hottentot manners and religion the anthropologist compares the hottentot rites beliefs social habits and general ideas with those of other races known to him savage or civilised  a hottentot custom which has a meaning among hottentots may exist where its meaning is lost among greeks or other aryans  a story of a hottentot god quite a natural sort of tale for a hottentot to tell may be told about a god in greece where it is contrary to the greek spirit  we infer that the greeks perhaps inherited it from savage ancestors or borrowed it from savages    names of savage gods   this is the method and if we can also get a scholar to analyse the names of hottentot gods we are all the luckier that is if his processes and inferences are logical  may we not decide on the logic of scholars  but just as mr max muller points out to us the dangers attending our evidence we point out to him the dangers attending his method  in dr hahns book the doctor analyses the meaning of the name tsunigoam and other names discovers their original sense and from that sense explains the myths about hottentot divine beings  here we anthropologists first ask mr max muller before accepting dr hahns etymologies to listen to other scholars about the perils and difficulties of the philological analysis of divine names even in aryan languages  i have already quoted his defender dr tiele  the philological method is inadequate and misleading when it is a question of 1 discovering the origin of a myth or 2 the physical explanation of the oldest myths or 3 of accounting for the rude and obscene element in the divine legends of civilised races  to the two former purposes dr hahn applies the philological method in the case of tsunigoam  other scholars agree with dr tiele  mannhardt as we said held that mr max mullers favourite etymological equations sarameyahermeias saranyudemetererinnys kentaurosgandharvas and others would not stand criticism  the method in its practical working shows a lack of the historical sense said mannhardt  curtiusa scholar as mr max muller declares i 32says it is especially difficult to conjecture the meaning of proper names and above all of local and mythical names 106a  i do not see that it is easier when these names are not greek but hottentot or algonquin  thus achilles may as easily mean holder of the people as holder of stones ie a rivergod  or does greek suggest aqua achelous the river  leto mother of apollo cannot be from greek as mr max muller holds ii 514 515 to which mr max muller replies perhaps not as far as the phonetic rules go which determine the formation of appellative nouns  it indeed would be extraordinary if it were    the phonetic rules in hottentot may also suggest difficulties to a south african curtius  other scholars agree with curtiusagree in thinking that the etymology of mythical names is a sandy foundation for the science of mythology  the difficult task of interpreting mythical names has so far produced few certain results says otto schrader 106b  when dr hahn applies the process in hottentot we urge with a friendly candour these cautions from scholars on mr max muller    a hottentot god   in custom and myth p 207 i examine the logic by which dr hahn proves tsunigoam to be the red dawn  one of his steps is to say that few means sore or wounded and that a wound is red so he gets his red in red dawn  but of tsu in the sense of red he gives not one example while he does give another word for red or bloody  this may be scholarly but it is not evidence and this is only one of many perilous steps on ground extremely scabreux got over by a series of logical leaps  as to our quarrel with mr max muller about his friends treatment of ethnological materials it is this we do not believe in the validity of the etymological method when applied to many old divine names in greek still less in hottentot    cause of our scepticism   our scepticism is confirmed by the extraordinary diversity of opinion among scholars as to what the right analysis of old divine names is  mr max muller writes i 18 i have never been able to extract from my critics the title of a single book in which my etymologies and my mythological equations had been seriously criticised by real scholars we might answer why tell you what you know very well  for i 50 you say that while signer canizzaro calls some of your equations irrefutably demonstrated other scholars declare these equations are futile and impossible  do these other scholars criticise your equations not seriously  or are you ignorant of the names of their works  another case  our author says that many objections were raised to his equation of atheneahanadawn ii 378 400 c  have the objections ceased  here are a few scholars who do not or did not accept atheneahana welcker benfey curtius preller furtwangler schwartz and now bechtel i 378  mr max muller thinks that he is right but till scholars agree what can we do but wait    phonetic bickerings   the evidence turns on theories of phonetic laws as they worked in pre homeric greece  but these laws as they apply to common ordinary words need not we are told be applied so strictly to proper names as of gods and heroes  these are a kind of comets and their changes cannot be calculated like the changes of vulgar words which answer to stars i 298  mr max muller formerly agreed with curtius that phonetic rules should be used against proper names with the same severity as against ordinary nouns and verbs  benfey and welcker protested so does professor victor henry  it is not fair to demand from mythography the rigorous observation of phonetics i 387  this may be called backsliding our author confesses and it does seem rather a goas youplease kind of method    phonetic rules   mr max muller argues at length and to my ignorance persuasively in favour of a genial laxity in the application of phonetic rules to old proper names  do they apply to these as strictly as to ordinary words this is a question that has often been asked    but it has never been boldly answered i 297  mr max muller cannot have forgotten that curtius answered boldlyin the negative  without such rigour all attempts at etymology are impossible  for this very reason ethnologists and mythologists should make themselves acquainted with the simple principles of comparative philology 109  but it is not for us to settle such disputes of scholars  meanwhile their evidence is derived from their private interpretations of old proper names and they differ among themselves as to whether in such interpretations they should or should not be governed strictly by phonetic laws  then what mr max muller calls the usual bickerings begin among scholars i 416  and mr max muller connects ouranos with vedic varuna while wackernagel prefers to derive it from greek urine and this from greeksk varshayami to rain ii 416 417 and so it goes on for years with a glorious uncertainty  if mr max mullers equations are scientifically correct the scholars who accept them not must all be unscientific  or else this is not science at all    basis of a science   a science in its early stages while the validity of its working laws in application to essential cases is still undetermined must of course expect bickerings  but philological mythologists are actually trying to base one science mythology on the still shifting and sandy foundations of another science phonetics  the philologists are quarrelling about their equations and about the application of their phonetic laws to mythical proper names  on the basis of this shaking soil they propose to build another science mythology  then pleased with the scientific exactitude of their evidence they object to the laxity of ours    philology in actionindra   as an example of the philological method with a vedic god take indra  i do not think that science is ever likely to find out the whole origins of any god  even if his name mean sky dyaus zeus we must ask what mode of conceiving sky is original  was sky thought of as a person and if so as a savage or as a civilised person as a god sans phrase as the inanimate visible vault of heaven as a totem or how  indra like other gods is apt to evade our observation in his origins  mr max muller asks what should we gain if we called indra    a totem  who does  if we derive his name from the same root as indu raindrop then his startingpoint was the rain i 131  roth preferred idh indh to kindle and later his taste and fancy led him to ir or irv to have power over  he is variously regarded as god of bright firmament of air of thunderstorm personified and so forth 110  his name is not detected among other aryan gods and his birth may be after the aryan separation ii 752  but surely his name even so might have been carried to the greeks  this at least should not astonish mr max muller  one had supposed that dyaus and zeus were separately developed by peoples of india and greece from a common preseparation aryan root  one had not imagined that the greeks borrowed divine names from sanskrit and from india  but this too might happen ii 506 mr max muller asks why should not a cloud or air goddess of india whether called svara or urvasi have supplied the first germs from which greek descended  why not indeed if prehistoric greeks were in touch with india  i do not say they were not  why should not a vedic or sanskrit goddess of india supply the first germs of a greek goddess ii p 506  why because greek gods have never been vedic gods but both greek and vedic gods have started from the same germs ii 429  our author has answered his own question but he seems at intervals to suppose contrary to his own principles as i understand them that greek may be derived from vedic divine names or at least divine names in sanskrit  all this is rather confusing    obscuring the veda   if indra is called bull that at first only meant strong ii 209 yet some very thoughtful scholars see traces of totemism in indra 111a  mr max muller thinks that this theory is obscuring the veda by this kind of light from the dark continent america it seems  indra is said to have been born from a cow like the african heitsi eibib 111b  there are unholy stories about indra and rams  but i for one as i have said already would never deny that these may be part of the pleasant unconscious poetry of the vedic hymnists  indras legend is rich in savage obscenities they may or may not be survivals from savagery  at all events one sees no reason why we should not freely compare parallel savageries and why this should obscure the veda comparisons are illuminating     criticism of fetishism   mischief of comparisons in comparative mythology   not always are comparisons illuminating it seems  our author writes it may be saidin fact it has been saidthat there can at all events be no harm in simply placing the myths and customs of savages side by side with the myths and customs of hindus and greeks  this in fact is the method of the science of institutions  but experience shows that this is not so i 195  so we must not should not simply place the myths and customs of savages side by side with those of hindus and greeks  it is taboo    dr oldenberg   now dr oldenberg it seems uses such comparisons of savage and aryan faiths  dr oldenberg is i 209 one of several very thoughtful scholars who do so who break mr max mullers prohibition  yet ii 220 no true scholar would accept any comparison between savage fables and the folklore of homer and the vedas as really authoritative until fully demonstrated on both sides  well it is fully demonstrated or a very thoughtful scholar like dr oldenberg would not accept it  or it is not demonstrated and then dr oldenberg though a very thoughtful is not a true scholar    comparisons when odious   once more mr max muller deprecates the making of comparisons between savage and vedic myths i 210 and then i 220 he deprecates the acceptance of these very comparisons as really authoritative until fully demonstrated  now how is the validity of the comparisons to be fully demonstrated if we are forbidden to make them at all because to do so is to obscure the veda by light from the dark continent    a question of logic   i am not writing quips and cranks i am dealing quite gravely with the authors processes of reasoning  no true scholar does what very thoughtful scholars do  no comparisons of savage and vedic myths should be made but yet when fully demonstrated true scholars would accept them i 209 220  how can comparisons be demonstrated before they are made  and made they must not be    scholars   it would be useful if mr max muller were to define scholar real scholar true scholar very thoughtful scholar  the latter may err and have erredlike general councils and like dr oldenberg who finds in the veda remnants of the wildest and rawest essence of religion totemism and the rest i 210  i was wont to think that scholar as used by our learned author meant philological mythologist as distinguished from notscholar that is anthropological mythologist but now very thoughtful scholars even dr oldenberg mr rhys dr robertson smith and so on use the anthropological method so scholar needs a fresh definition  the notscholars the anthropologists have in fact converted some very thoughtful scholars  if we could only catch the true scholar  but that we cannot do till we fully demonstrate comparisons which we may not make for fear of first obscuring the veda by this kind of light from the dark continent    anthropology and the mysteries   it is not my affair to defend dr oldenberg whose comparisons of vedic with savage rites i have never read i am sorry to say  one is only arguing that the method of making such comparisons is legitimate  thus i 232 controversy it seems still rages among scholars as to the object of the eleusinian mysteries  does not the scholars conscience warn us against accepting whatever in the myths and customs of the zulus seems to suit our purposeof explaining features in the eleusinia  if zulu customs and they alone contained eleusinian parallels even the anthropologists conscience would whisper caution  but this is not the case  north american australian african and other tribes have mysteries very closely and minutely resembling parts of the rites of the eleusinia dionysia and thesmophoria  thus lobeck a scholar describes the rhombos used in the dionysiac mysteries citing clemens alexandrinus 114  thanks to dr tylors researches i was able to show what lobeck knew not that the rhombos australian turndun bullroarer is also used in australian african american and other savage religious mysteries  now should i have refrained from producing this wellattested matter of fact till i knew australian american and african languages as well as i know greek  what century will it be when there will be scholars who know the dialects of the australian blacks as well as we know the dialects of greece i 232 asks our author  and what in the name of eleusis have dialects to do with the circumstance that savages like greeks use rhombi in their mysteries  there are abundant other material facts visible palpable objects and practices which savage mysteries have in common with the greek mysteries 115  if observed by deaf men when used by dumb men instead of by scores of europeans who could talk the native languages these illuminating rites of savages would still be evidence  they have been seen and described often not by a casual native informant who perhaps casually invented greek rites and falsely attributed them to his tribesmen but by educated europeans    abstract ideas of savages   mr max muller defends with perfect justice the existence of abstract ideas among contemporary savages  it appears that somebody or other has saidwe have been told i 291that all this the mangaian theory of the universe must have come from missionaries  the ideas are as likely to have come from hegel as from a missionary  therefore instead of looking for idols or for totems and fetishes we must learn and accept what the savages themselves are able to tell us      yes we must learn and accept it so i have always urged  but if the savages tell us about totems are they not then casual native informants  if a maori tells you as he does of traditional hymns containing ideas worthy of heraclitus is that quite trustworthy whereas if he tells you about his idols and taboos that cannot possibly be worthy of attention    perception of the infinite   from these extraordinary examples of abstract thought in savages our author goes on to say that his theory of the perception of the infinite as the origin of religion was received with a storm of unfounded obloquy i 292  i myself criticised the hibbert lectures in mind 116 on reading the essay over i find no obloquy and no storm  i find however that i deny what our author says that i assert the primitiveness of contemporary savages  in that essay which of course our author had no reason to read much was said about fetishism a topic discussed by mr max muller in his hibbert lectures  fetishism is as he says an ill word and has caused much confusion    fetishism and anthropological method   throughout much of his work our authors object is to invalidate the anthropological method  that method sets side by side the customs ideas fables myths proverbs riddles rites of different races  of their languages it does not necessarily take account in this process nobody as we shall see knows the languages of all or of most of the races whose ideas he compares  now the learned professor establishes the harm done by our method in a given instance  he seems to think that if a method has been misapplied therefore the method itself is necessarily erroneous  the case stands thus de brosses 117a first compared the socalled fetishes of the gold coast with greek and roman amulets and other material objects of old religions  but he did this we learn without trying to find out why a negro made a fetish of a pebble shell or tigers tail and without endeavouring to discover whether the negros motives really were the motives of his postulated fetish worship in greece rome or palestine    origin of fetishes   if so tant pis pour monsieur le president  but how does the unscientific conduct attributed to de brosses implicate the modern anthropologist  do we not try to find out and really succeed sometimes in finding out why a savage cherishes this or that scrap as a fetish  i give a string of explanations in custom and myth pp 229 230  sometimes the socalled fetish had an accidental which was taken to be a causal connection with a stroke of good luck  sometimes the thingan oddshaped stone sayhad a superficial resemblance to a desirable object and so was thought likely to aid in the acquisition of such objects by sympathetic magic 117b  other fetishes are revealed in dreams or by ghosts or by spirits appearing in semblance of animals 118a    telekinetic origin of fetishism   as i write comes in melusine viii 7 with an essay by m lefebure on les origines du fetichisme  he derives some fetishistic practices from what the melanesians call mana which says mr max muller may often be rendered by supernatural or magic power present in an individual a stone or in formulas or charms i 294  how asks mr lefebure did men come to attribute this vis vivida to persons and things  because in fact he says such an unexplored force does really exist and display itself  he then cites mr crookes observations on scientifically registered telekinetic performances by daniel dunglas home he cites despine on madame schmitzbaud 118b with examples from dr tylor p de la rissachere dr gibier 118c and other authorities good or bad grouping then his facts under the dubious title of le magnetisme m lefebure finds in savage observation of such facts the chief cause of fetishism  some of m lefebures facts of objects moving untouched were certainly frauds like the tricks of eusapia  but even if all the facts recorded were frauds such impostures performed by savage conjurers who certainly profess 118d to produce the phenomena might originate or help to originate the respect paid to fetishes and the belief in mana but probably major elliss researches into the religion of the tshispeaking races throw most light on the real ideas of african fetishists  the subject is vast and complex  i am content to show that whatever de brosses did we do not abandon a search for the motives of the savage fetishist  indeed de brosses himself did seek and find at least one african motive the conjurers jongleurs persuade them that little instruments in their possession are endowed with a living spirit so far fetishism is spiritualism    civilised fetishism   de brosses did not look among civilised fetishists for the motives which he neglected among savages i 196  tant pis pour monsieur le president  but we and our method no more stand or fall with de brosses and his than mr max mullers etymologies stand or fall with those in the cratylus of plato  if in a civilised people ancient or modern we find a practice vaguely styled fetishistic we examine it in its details  while we have talismans amulets gamblers fetiches i do not think that except among some children we have anything nearly analogous to gold coast fetishism as a whole  some one seems to have called the palladium a fetish  i dont exactly know what the palladium called a fetish by somebody was  the hasta fetialis has been styled a fetishan apparent abuse of language  as to the holy cross qua fetish why discuss such freethinking credulities  modern anthropologiststylor frazer and the restare not under the censure appropriate to the illogical    more mischiefs of comparison   the nemesis i 196 of de brosses errors did not stay in her ravaging progress  fetishism was represented as the very beginning of religion first among the negroes then among all races  as i for one persistently proclaim that the beginning of religion is an inscrutable mystery the nemesis has somehow left me scatheless propitiated by my piety  i said long ago the train of ideas which leads man to believe in and to treasure fetishes is one among the earliest springs of religious belief 120a  but from even this rather guarded statement i withdraw  no man can watch the idea of god in the making or in the beginning 120b    still more nemesis   the new nemesis is really that which i have just put far from menamely that modern savages represent everywhere the eocene stratum of religion  they probably represent an early stage in religion just as teste  mr max muller they represent an early stage in language in savage languages we see what we can no longer expect to see even in the most ancient sanskrit or hebrew  we watch the childhood of language with all its childish pranks 120c  now if the tongues spoken by modern savages represent the childhood and childish pranks of language why should the beliefs of modern savages not represent the childhood and childish pranks of religion  i am not here averring that they do so nor even that mr max muller is right in his remark on language  the australian blacks have been men as long as the prussian nobility  their language has had time to outgrow childish pranks but apparently it has not made use of its opportunities according to our critic  does he know why  one need not reply to the charge that anthropologists if they are meant regard modern savages as just evolved from the earth or the sky or from monkeys i 197  savages have a farstretching unknown history behind them  the past of savages i say must have been a long past 121  so once more the nemesis of de brosses fails to touch meand of course to touch more learned anthropologists  there is yet another nemesisthe postulate that aryans and semites or rather their ancestors must have passed through the savage state  dr tylor writesso far as history is to be our criterion progression is primary and degradation secondary  culture must be gained before it can be lost  now a person who has not gained what dr tylor calls culture not in mr arnolds sense is a man without tools instruments or clothes  he is certainly so far like a savage is very much lower in culture than any race with which we are acquainted  as a matter of hypothesis anyone may say that man was born with everything handsome about him  he has then to account for the savage elements in greek myth and rite    for us or against us   we now hear that the worst and last penalty paid for de brosses audacious comparison of savage with civilised superstitions is the postulate that aryan and semitic peoples have passed through a stage of savagery  however different the languages customs and myths the colour and the skulls of these modern savages might be from those of aryan and semitic people the latter must once have passed through the same stage must once have been what the negroes of the west coast of africa are today  this postulate has not been and according to its very nature cannot be proved  but the mischief done by acting on such postulates is still going on and in several cases it has come to thisthat what in historical religions such as our own is known to be the most modern the very last outcome namely the worship of relics or a belief in amulets has been represented as the first necessary step in the evolution of all religions i 197  i really do not know who says that the prehistoric ancestors of aryans and semites were once in the same stage as the negroes of the west coast of africa are today  these honest fellows are well acquainted with coined money with the use of firearms and other resources of civilisation and have been in touch with missionaries miss kingsley traders and tourists  the ancestors of the aryans and semites enjoyed no such advantages  mr max muller does not tell us who says that they did  but that the ancestors of all mankind passed through a stage in which they had to develop for themselves tools languages clothes and institutions is assuredly the belief of anthropologists  a race without tools language clothes pottery and social institutions or with these in the shape of undeveloped speech stone knives and possum or other skins is what we call a race of savages  such we believe the ancestors of mankind to have beenat any rate after the fall  now when mr max muller began to write his book he accepted this postulate of anthropology i 15  when he reached i 197 he abandoned and denounced this postulate  i quote his acceptance of the postulate i 15     even mr a lang has to admit that we have not got much beyond    fontenelle when he wrote in the last century     why are the legends myths about men beasts and gods so wildly    incredible and revolting     the answer is that the earliest men    were in a state of almost inconceivable ignorance and savagery and    that the greeks inherited their myths from people in the same savage    stage en un pareil etat de sauvagerie  look at the kaffirs and    iroquois if you want to know what the earliest men were like and    remember that the very iroquois and kaffirs have a long past behind    themthat is to say are polite and cultivated compared to the    earliest men of all  here is an uncompromising statement by fontenelle of the postulate that the greeks an aryan people must have passed through the same stage as modern savageskaffirs and iroquoisnow occupy  but i 15 mr max muller eagerly accepts the postulate     there is not a word of fontenelles to which i should not gladly    subscribe there is no advice of his which i have not tried to follow    in all my attempts to explain the myths of india and greece by an    occasional reference to polynesian or african folklore  well if mr max muller gladly subscribes in p 15 to the postulate of an original universal stage of savagery whence civilised races inherit their incredibly repulsive myths why in pp 197 198 does he denounce that very postulate as not proven not capable of being proved very mischievous and one of the evils resulting from our method of comparing savage and civilised rites and beliefs  i must be permitted to complain that i do not know which is mr max mullers real opinionthat given with such hearty conviction in p 15 or that stated with no less earnestness in pp 197 198  i trust that i shall not be thought to magnify a mere slip of the pen  both passagesthough as far as i can see selfcontradictoryappear to be written with the same absence of levity  fontenelle i own speaks of greeks not semites as being originally savages  but i pointed out 124 that he considered it safer to hedge by making an exception of the israelites  there is really nothing in genesis against the contention that the naked toolless mean and frivolous adam was a savage    the fallacy of admits   as the purpose of this essay is mainly logical i may point out the existence of a fallacy not marked i think in handbooks of logic  this is the fallacy of saying that an opponent admits what on the contrary he has been the first to point out and proclaim  he is thus suggested into an attitude which is the reverse of his own  some onei am sorry to say that i forget who he wasshowed me that fontenelle in de lorigine des fables 125a briefly stated the anthropological theory of the origin of myths or at least of that repulsive element in them which makes mythology mythological as mr max muller says  i was glad to have a predecessor in a past less remote than that of eusebius of caesarea  a briefer and better system of mythology i wrote could not be devised but the mr casaubons of this world have neglected it and even now it is beyond their comprehension 125b  to say this in this manner is not to admit that we have not got much beyond fontenelle  i do not want to get beyond fontenelle  i want to go back to his forgotten commonsense and to apply his ideas with method and criticism to a range of materials which he did not possess or did not investigate  now on p 15 mr max muller had got as far as accepting fontenelle on pp 197 198 he burns as it were that to which he had gladly subscribed    conclusion as to our method   all this discussion of fetishes arose out of our authors selection of the subject as an example of the viciousness of our method  he would not permit us simply to place side by side savage and greek myths and customs because it did harm i 195 and the harm done was proved by the nemesis of de brosses  now first a method may be a good method yet may be badly applied  secondly i have shown that the nemesis does not attach to all of us modern anthropologists  thirdly i have proved unless i am under some misapprehension which i vainly attempt to detect and for which if it exists i apologise humbly that mr max muller on p 15 accepts the doctrine which he denounces on p 197 126  again i am entirely at one with mr max muller when he says p 210 we have as yet really no scientific treatment of shamanism  this is a pressing need but probably a physician alone could do the worka physician double with a psychologist  see however the excellent pages in dr tylors primitive culture and in mr william jamess principles of psychology on mediumship     the riddle theory   what the philological theory needs   the great desideratum of the philological method is a proof that the disease of language ex hypothesi the most fertile source of myths is a vera causa  do simple poetical phrases descriptive of heavenly phenomena remain current in the popular mouth after the meanings of appellatives bright one dark one c have been forgotten so that these appellatives become proper namesapollo daphne c  mr max muller seems to think some proof of this process as a vera causa may be derived from folk riddles    the riddle theory   we now come therefore to the authors treatment of popular riddles devinettes so common among savages and peasants  their construction is simple anything in nature you please is described by a poetical periphrasis and you are asked what it is  thus geistiblindr asks     what is the dark one    that goes over the earth    swallows water and wood    but is afraid of the wind c  or we find     what is the gold spun from one window to another  the answers the obvious answers are 1 mist and 2 sunshine  in mr max mullers opinion these riddles could not but lead to what we call popular myths or legends  very probably but this does not aid us to accept the philological method  the very essence of that method is the presumed absolute loss of the meaning of eg the dark one  before there can be a myth ex hypothesi the words dark one must have become hopelessly unintelligible must have become a proper name  thus suppose for arguments sake only that cronos once meant dark one and was understood in that sense  people as in the norse riddle just cited said cronos ie the dark onemeaning mist swallows water and wood then they forgot that cronos was their old word for the dark one and was mist but they kept up and understood all the rest of the phrase about what mist does  the expression now ran cronos whatever that may be swallows water and wood  but water comes from mist and water nourishes wood therefore cronos swallows his children  such would be the development of a myth on mr max mullers system  he would interpret cronos swallows his children by finding if he could the original meaning of cronos  let us say that he did discover it to mean the dark one  then he might think cronos meant night mist he would hardly guess  that is all very clear but the point is thisin devinettes or riddles the meaning of the dark one is not lost     thy riddle is easy    blind gest    to read  heidrick answers  what the philological method of mythology needs is to prove that such poetical statements about natural phenomena as the devinettes contain survived in the popular mouth and were perfectly intelligible except just the one mot denigmesay the dark one  that call it cronosdark one and that alone became unintelligible in the changes of language and so had to be accepted as a proper name cronosa god who swallows things at large  where is the proof of such endurance of intelligible phrases with just the one central necessary word obsolete and changed into a mysterious proper name  the world is full of proper names which have lost their meaningathene achilles artemis and so on but we need proof that poetical sayings or riddles survive and are intelligible except one word which being unintelligible becomes a proper name  riddles of course prove nothing of this kind     thy riddle is easy    blind gest    to read  yet mr max muller offers the suggestion that the obscurity of many of these names of mythical gods and heroes may be due    to the riddles to which they had given rise and which would have ceased to be riddles if the names had been clear and intelligible like those of helios and selene i 92  people he thinks in making riddles would avoid the ordinary appellatives and the use of littleknown names in most mythologies would thus find an intelligible explanation  again we can see how essential it was that in such mythological riddles the principal agents should not be called by their regular names  this last remark indeed is obvious  to return to the norse riddle of the dark one that swallows wood and water  it would never do in a riddle to call the dark one by his ordinary name mist  you would not amuse a rural audience by asking what is the mist that swallows wood and water  that would be even easier than mr burnands riddle for very hot weather     my first is a boot my second is a jack  conceivably mr max muller may mean that in riddles an almost obsolete word was used to designate the object  perhaps instead of the dark one a peasant would say what is the rooky one  but as soon as nobody knew what the rooky one meant the riddle would cease to existrooky one and all  you cannot imagine several generations asking each other     what is the rooky one that swallows  if nobody knew the answer  a man who kept boring people with a mere sell would be scouted and with the death of the answerless riddle the difficult word rooky would die  but mr max muller says riddles would cease to be riddles if the names had been clear and intelligible the reverse is the fact  in the riddles he gives there are seldom any names but the epithets and descriptions are as clear as words can be     who are the mother and children in a house all having bald headsthe    moon and stars  language cannot be clearer  yet the riddle has not ceased to be a riddle as mr max muller thinks it must do though the words are clear and intelligible  on the other hand if the language is not clear and intelligible the riddle would cease to exist  it would not amuse if nobody understood it  you might as well try to make yourself socially acceptable by putting conundrums in etruscan as by asking riddles in words not clear and intelligible in themselves though obscure in their reference  the difficulty of a riddle consists not in the obscurity of words or names but in the description of familiar things by terms clear as terms denoting their appearance and action  the mist is described as dark swallowing one that fears the wind and so forth  the words are pellucid  thus ordinary appellatives i 99 are not avoided in riddles though names sun mist cannot be used in the question because they give the answer to the riddle  for all these reasons ancient riddles cannot explain the obscurity of mythological names  as soon as the name was too obscure the riddle and the name would be forgotten would die together  so we know as little as ever of the purely hypothetical process by which a riddle or popular poetical saying remains intelligible in a language while the mot denigme becoming unintelligible turns into a proper namesay cronos yet the belief in this process as a vera causa is essential to our authors method  here mr max muller warns us that his riddle theory is not meant to explain the obscurities of all mythological names  this is a stratagem that should be stopped from the very first  it were more graceful to have said a misapprehension  another stratagem i myself must guard against  i do not say that no unintelligible strings of obsolete words may continue to live in the popular mouth  old hymns ritual speeches and charms may and do survive though unintelligible  they are reckoned all the more potent because all the more mysterious  but an unintelligible riddle or poetical saying does not survive so we cannot thus account for mythology as a disease of language    mordvinian mythology   still in the very natural and laudable pursuit of facts which will support the hypothesis of a disease of language mr max muller turns to mordvinian mythology  we have the accounts of real scholars about mordvinian prayers charms and proverbs i 235  the mordvinians ugrian tribes have the usual departmental naturegodsas chkai god of the sun chisun  he lives in the sun or is the sun i 236  his wife is the earth or earth goddess vediava  they have a large family given to incest  the morals of the mordvinian gods are as lax as those of mordvinian mortals  compare the myths and morals of samos and the samian hera  athwart the decent god chkai comes the evil god chaitanobviously shaitan a mahommedan contamination  there are plenty of minor gods and spirits good and bad  dawn was a mordvinian girl in australia she was a lubra addicted to lubricity  how does this help philological mythology  mr max muller is pleased to find solar and other elemental gods among the mordvinians  but the discovery in no way aids his special theory nobody has ever denied that gods who are the sun or live in the sun are familiar and are the centres of myths among most races  i give examples in c and m pp 104 133 new zealand and north america and in m r r i 124135 america africa australia aztec hervey islands samoa and so on  such naturemythsof sun sky earthare perhaps universal but they do not arise from disease of language  these myths deal with natural phenomena plainly and explicitly  the same is the case among the mordvinians  the few names preserved to us are clearly the names of the agents behind the salient phenomena of nature in some cases quite intelligible in others easily restored to their original meaning the meanings of the names not being forgotten but obvious there is no disease of language  all this does not illustrate the case of greek divine names by resemblance but by difference  real scholars know what mordvinian divine names mean  they do not know what many greek divine names meanas hera artemis apollo athene there is even much dispute about demeter  no anthropologist i hope is denying that naturemyths and naturegods exist  we are only fighting against the philological effort to get at the elemental phenomena which may be behind hera artemis athene apollo by means of contending etymological conjectures  we only oppose the philological attempt to account for all the features in a gods myth as manifestations of the elemental qualities denoted by a name which may mean at pleasure dawn storm clear air thunder wind twilight water or what you will  granting chkai to be the sun does that explain why he punishes people who bake bread on friday 237  our opponent does not seem to understand the portee of our objections  the same remarks apply to the statement of finnish mythology here given and familiar in the kalewala  departmental divine beings of natural phenomena we find everywhere or nearly everywhere in company of course with other elements of belieftotemism worship of spirits perhaps with monotheism in the background  that is as much our opinion as mr max mullers  what we are opposing is the theory of disease of language and the attempt to explain by philological conjectures gods and heroes whose obscure names are the only sources of information  helios is the sungod he is or lives in the sun  apollo may have been the sungod too but we still distrust the attempts to prove this by contending guesses at the origin of his name  moreover if all greek gods could be certainly explained by undisputed etymologies as originally elemental we still object to such logic as that which turns saranyu into grey dawn  we still object to the competing interpretations by which almost every detail of very composite myths is explained as a poetical description of some elemental process or phenomenon  apollo may once have been the sun but why did he make love as a dog    lettish mythology   these remarks apply equally well to our authors dissertation on lettish mythology ii 430 et seq  the meaning of statements about the sun and sky is not to be mistaken in the mythology of the letts  so here is no disease of language  the meaning is not to be mistaken  sun and moon and so on are spoken of by their natural unmistakable names or in equally unmistakable poetical periphrases as in riddles  the daughter of the sun hung a red cloak on a great oaktree  this can hardly have been meant for anything but the red of the evening or the setting sun sometimes called her red cloak ii 439  exactly so and the australians of encounter bay also think that the sun is a woman  she has a lover among the dead who has given her a red kangaroo skin and in this she appears at her rising 135  this tale was told to mr meyer in 1846 before mr max mullers dawn had become inevitable as he says  the lettish and australian myths are folkpoetry they have nothing to do with a disease of language or forgotten meanings of words which become proper names  all this is surely distinct  we proclaim the abundance of poetical naturemyths we disable the hypothesis that they arise from a disease of language    the chances of fancy   one remark has to be added  mannhardt regarded many or most of the philological solutions of gods into dawn or sun or thunder or cloud as empty jeux desprit  and justly for there is no name named among men which a philologist cannot easily prove to be a synonym or metaphorical term for wind or weather dawn or sun  whatever attribute any word connotes it can be shown to connote some attribute of dawn or sun  here parody comes in and gives a not overstrained copy of the method applying it to mr gladstone dr nansen or whom you please  and though a jest is not a refutation a parody may plainly show the absolutely capricious character of the philological method     artemis   i do not here examine our authors constructive work  i have often criticised its logical method before and need not repeat myself  the etymologies of course i leave to be discussed by scholars  as we have seen they are at odds on the subject of phonetic laws and their application to mythological names  on the mosses and bogs of this debatable land some of them propose to erect the science of comparative mythology  meanwhile we look on waiting till the mosses shall support a ponderous edifice  our authors treatment of artemis however has for me a peculiar interest ii 733743  i really think that it is not mere vanity which makes me suppose that in this instance i am at least one of the authors whom mr max muller is writing about without name or reference  if so he here sharply distinguishes between me on the one hand and classical scholars on the other a point to which we shall return  he saysi cite textually ii 732    artemis   the last of the great greek goddesses whom we have to consider is artemis  her name we shall see has received many interpretations but none that can be considered as well establishednone that even if it were so would help us much in disentangling the many myths told about her  easy to understand as her character seems when we confine our attention to homer it becomes extremely complicated when we take into account the numerous local forms of worship of which she was the object  we have here a good opportunity of comparing the interpretations put forward by those who think that a study of the myths and customs of uncivilised tribes can help us towards an understanding of greek deities and the views advocated by classical scholars 138 who draw their information first of all from greek sources and afterwards only from a comparison of the myths and customs of cognate races more particularly from what is preserved to us in ancient vedic literature before they plunge into the whirlpool of illdefined and unintelligible kafir folklore  the former undertake to explain artemis by showing us the progress of human intelligence from the coarsest spontaneous and primitive ideas to the most beautiful and brilliant conception of poets and sculptors  they point out traces of hideous cruelties amounting almost to cannibalism and of a savage cult of beasts in the earlier history of the goddess who was celebrated by dances of young girls disguised as bears or imitating the movements of bears c  she was represented as greek and this idea we are told was borrowed from the east which is a large term  we are told that her most ancient history is to be studied in arkadia where we can see the goddess still closely connected with the worship of animals a characteristic feature of the lowest stage of religious worship among the lowest races of mankind  we are then told the old story of lykaon the king of arkadia who had a beautiful daughter called kallisto  as zeus fell in love with her hera from jealousy changed her into a bear and artemis killed her with one of her arrows  her child however was saved by hermes at the command of zeus and while kallisto was changed to the constellation of the ursa her son arkas became the ancestor of the arkadians  here we are told we have a clear instance of men being the descendants of animals and of women being changed into wild beasts and starsbeliefs well known among the cahrocs and the kamilarois        here i recognise mr max mullers version of my remarks on artemis 139a  our author has just remarked in a footnote that schwartz does not mention the title of the book where his evidence has been given  it is an inconvenient practice but with mr max muller this reticence is by no means unusual  he does not mention the book where my evidence is given  anthropologists are here unless i am mistaken contrasted with classical scholars who draw their information first of all from greek sources  i need not assure anyone who has looked into my imperfect works that i also drew my information about artemis first of all from greek sources in the original  many of these sources to the best of my knowledge are not translated one homer i have translated myself with professor butcher and messrs leaf and myers my old friends  the idea and representation of artemis as greek manybreasted we are told was borrowed from the east a large term  i say she is even blended in ritual with a monstrous manybreasted divinity of oriental religion 139b  is this large term too vague  then consider the artemis of ephesus and the alabaster statuette of the goddess in roschers lexikon p 558  compare for an occidental parallel the many breasted goddess of the maguey plant in mexico 140  our author writes we are told that artemiss most ancient history is to be studied in arkadia  my words are the attic and arcadian legends of artemis are confessedly among the oldest  why should attic and the qualifying phrase be omitted    otfried muller   mr max muller goes onciting as i also do otfried mullerotfried muller in 1825 treated the same myth without availing himself of the light now to be derived from the cahrocs and the kamilarois  he quoted pausanias as stating that the tumulus of kallisto was near the sanctuary of artemis kalliste and he simply took kallisto for an epithet of artemis which as in many other cases had been taken for a separate personality  otfried also pointed out as we both say that at brauron in attica artemis was served by young maidens called greek bears and he concluded this cannot possibly be a freak of chance but the metamorphosis of kallisto has its foundation in the fact that the animal the bear was sacred to the goddess  thus it is acknowledged that artemis under her name of callisto was changed into a shebear and had issue arkaswhence the arcadians  mr max muller proceeds ii 734he otfried did not go so far as some modern mythologists who want us to believe that originally the animal the shebear was the goddess and that a later worship had replaced the ancient worship of the animal pur et simple  did i then tell anybody that originally the shebear was the goddess no i gave my reader not a dogma but the choice between two alternative hypotheses  i said it will become probable that the shebear actually was the goddess at an extremely remote period or at all events that the goddess succeeded to and threw her protection over an ancient worship of the animal ii 212 213  mr max mullers error it will be observed consists in writing and where i wrote or  to make such rather essential mistakes is human to give references is convenient and not unscholarly  in fact this is mr max mullers own opinion for he next reports his anonymous author myself as saying we are now told though without any reference to pausanias or any other greek writers that the young maidens the greek when dancing around artemis were clad in bearskins and that this is a pretty frequent custom in the dances of totemic races  in support of this however we are not referred to really totemic races    but to the hirpi of italy and to the greek in egypt  of course i never said that the greek danced around artemis  i did say after observing that they were described as playing the bear they even in archaic ages wore bearskins for which i cited claus 141a and referred to suchier 141b including the reference in brackets   to indicate that i borrowed it from a book which i was unable to procure 142a  i then gave references for the classical use of a saffron vest by the greek    beast dances   for the use of beastskins in such dances among totemists i cite bancroft iii 168 and m r r ii 107 robinson 142b same authority  i may now also refer to robertson smith 142c the meaning of such a disguise a fishskin among the assyrians is well known from many savage rituals it means that the worshipper presents himself as a fish as a bear or what not 142d  doubtless i might have referred more copiously to savage rituals but really i thought that savage dances in beastskins were familiar from catlins engravings of mandan and nootka wolf or buffalo dances  i add that the brauronian rites point to a time when the goddess was herself a bear having suggested an alternative theory and added confirmation 142e  but i here confess that while beastdances and wearing of skins of sacred beasts are common to prove these sacred beasts to be totems is another matter  it is so far inferred rather than demonstrated  next i said that the evolution of the bear into the classical artemis almost escapes our inquiry  we find nothing more akin to it than the relation borne by the samoan gods to the various totems in which they are supposed to be manifest  this mr max muller quotes of course without reference or marks of quotation and adds pace dr codrington  have i incurred dr codringtons feud  he doubts or denies totems in melanesia  is samoa in melanesia par exemple 143a  our author i 206 says that dr codrington will have no totems in his islands  but samoa is not one of the doctors fortunate isles  for samoa i refer not to dr codrington but to mr turner 143b  in samoa the clans revere each its own sacred animals but combine with it the belief that the spiritual deity reveals itself in each separate animal 143c  i expressly contrast the samoan creed with pure totemism 143d  so much for our authors success in stating and criticising my ideas  if he pleases i will not speak of samoan totems but of samoan sacred animals  it is better and more exact    the view of classical scholars   they ii 735 begin by pointing out artemiss connection with apollo and the moon  so do i  if apollo soon disengages himself from the sun     artemis retains as few traces of any connection with the moon 143e if apollo was of solar origin asks the author ii 735 what could his sister artemis have been from the very beginning if not some goddess connected with the moon  very likely quis negavit  then our author like myself loc cit dilates on artemis as sister of apollo  her chapels i say are in the wild wood she is the abbess of the forest nymphs chaste and fair the maiden of the precise life how odd  the classical scholar and i both say the same things and i add a sonnet to artemis in this aspect rendered by me from the hippolytus of euripides  could a classical scholar do more  our author then says that the greek sportsman surprised the beasts in their lairs by night  not very sportsmanlike  i dont find it in homer or in xenophon  oh for exact references  the moon the nocturnal sportswoman is artemis here we have also the authority of theodore de banville diane court dans la noire foret  and the nocturnal hunt is dians so she is protectress of the chase  exactly what i said 144a  all this being granted by me beforehand though possibly that might not be guessed from my critic our author will explain artemiss human sacrifice of a girl in a fawnskinbloodshed bear and allwith no aid from kamilarois cahrocs and samoans    mr max mullers explanation   greek races traced to zeususually disguised for amorous purposes as a brute  the arcadians had an eponymous heroic ancestor areas they also worshipped artemis  artemis as a virgin could not become a mother of areas by zeus or by anybody  callisto was also artemis  callisto was the mother of areas  but to save the character of artemis callisto was now represented as one of her nymphs  then areas reminding the arcadians of greek a bear while they knew the bear constellation what was more natural than that callisto should be changed into an arktos a shebear    placed by zeus her lover in the sky as the bear  nothing could be more natural to a savage they all do it 144b  but that an aryan a greek should talk such nonsense as to say that he was the descendant of a bear who was changed into a star and all merely because areas reminded the arcadians of arktos seems to me an extreme test of belief and a very unlikely thing to occur    wider application of the theory   let us apply the explanation more widely  say that a hundred animal names are represented in the known totemkindreds of the world  then had each such kin originally an eponymous hero whose name like that of areas in arcady accidentally reminded his successors of a beast so that a hundred beasts came to be claimed as ancestors  perhaps this was what occurred the explanation at all events fits the wolf of the delawares and the other ninetynine as well as it fits the arcades  by a curious coincidence all the names of eponymous heroes chanced to remind people of beasts  but whence come the names of eponymous heroes  from their tribes of courseion from ionians dorus from dorians and so on therefore in the hundred cases the names of the tribes derive from names of animals  indeed the names of totemkins are the names of animalswolves bears cranes  mr max muller remarks that the name arcades may come from greek a bear i 738 so the arcadians proselenoi the oldest of races men before the moon may bebears so of course in this case they would necessarily be bears before they invented areas an eponymous hero whose name is derived from the pre existing tribal name  his name then could not before they invented it remind them of a bear  it was from their name greek bears that they developed his name areas as in all such cases of eponymous heroes  i slightly incline to hold that this is exactly what occurred  a bearkin claimed descent from a bear and later developing an eponymous hero areas regarded him as son of a bear  philologically it is possible i say no more    the bear dance   the dances of the maidens called greek would receive an easy interpretation  they were arkades and why not greek bears  and if greek why not clad in bearskins and all the rest ii 738  this is our authors explanation it is also my own conjecture  the arcadians were bears knew it and possibly danced a bear dance as mandans or nootkas dance a buffalo dance or a wolf dance  but all such dances are not totemistic  they have often other aims  one only names such dances totemistic when performed by people who call themselves by the name of the animal represented and claim descent from him  our author says genially if anybody prefers to say that the arctos was something like a totem of the arcadians    why not  but if the arctos was a totem that fact explains the callisto story and attic bear dance while the philological theorymr max mullers theorydoes not explain it  what is oddest of all mr max muller as we have seen says that the bear dancing girls were arkades  now we hear of no bear dances in arcadia the dancers were athenian girls  this indeed is the point  we have a bear callisto artemis in arcady where a folk etymology might explain it by stretching a point  but no etymology will explain bear dances to artemis in attica  so we find bears doubly connected with artemis  the athenians were not arcadians  as to the meaning and derivation of artemis or artamis our author knows nothing ii 741  i say even greek greek bear has occurred to inventive men  possibly i invented it myself though not addicted to etymological conjecture     the firewalk   the method of psychical research   as a rule mythology asks for no aid from psychical research  but there are problems in religious rite and custom where the services of the cendrillon of the sciences the despised youngest sister may be of use as an example i take the famous mysterious old firerite of the hirpi or wolfkin of mount soracte  i shall first following mannhardt and making use of my own trifling researches in ancient literature describe the rite itself    mount soracte   everyone has heard of mount soracte white with shining snow the peak whose distant cold gave zest to the blazing logs on the hearth of horace within sight of his windows was practised by men calling themselves wolves hirpi a rite of extreme antiquity and enigmatic character  on a peak of soracte now monte di silvestre stood the ancient temple of soranus a sabine sungod 148a  virgil 148b identifies soranus with apollo  at the foot of the cliff was the precinct of feronia a sabine goddess  mr max muller says that feronia corresponds to the vedic bhuranyu a name of agni the vedic firegod ii 800  mannhardt prefers of course a derivation from far grain as in confarreatio the ancient roman bridecake form of marriage  feronia matersanskrit bharsani mata getreide mutter 149a  it is a pity that philologists so rarely agree in their etymologies  in greek the goddess is called anthephorus philostephanus and even persephoneprobably the persephone of flowers and garlands 149b    hirpi sorani   once a year a fete of soranus and feronia was held in the precinct of the goddess at soracte  the ministrants were members of certain local families called hirpi wolves  pliny says 149c a few families styled hirpi at a yearly sacrifice walk over a burnt pile of wood yet are not scorched  on this account they have a perpetual exemption by decree of the senate from military and all other services  virgil makes aruns say 149d highest of gods apollo guardian of soracte thou of whom we are the foremost worshippers thou for whom the burning pile of pinewood is fed while we strong in faith walk through the midst of the fire and press our footsteps in the glowing mass    strabo gives the same facts  servius the old commentator on virgil confuses the hirpi not unnaturally with the sabine clan the hirpini he says 149e varro always an enemy of religious belief writes that the hirpini when about to walk the fire smear the soles of their feet with a drug medicamentum  silius italicus v 175 speaks of the ancient rite when the holy bearer of the bow apollo rejoices in the kindled pyres and the ministrant thrice gladly bears entrails to the god through the harmless flames  servius gives an aetiological myth to account for the practice  wolves came and carried off the entrails from the fire shepherds following them were killed by mortal vapours from a cave thence ensued a pestilence because they had followed the wolves an oracle bade them play the wolf ie live on plunder whence they were called hirpi wolves an attempt to account for a wolf clanname there is also a story that when the grave of feronia seemed all on fire and the people were about carrying off the statue it suddenly grew green again 150a  mannhardt decides that the socalled wolves leaped through the sungods fire in the interest of the health of the community  he elucidates this by a singular french popular custom held on st johns eve at jumieges the brethren of the green wolf select a leader called green wolf there is an ecclesiastical procession cure and all a souper maigre the lighting of the usual st johns fire a dance round the fire the capture of next years green wolf a mimicry of throwing him into the fire a revel and next day a loaf of pain benit above a pile of green leaves is carried about 150b  the wolf thinks mannhardt is the vegetationspirit in animal form  many examples of the cornwolf in popular custom are given by mr frazer in the golden bough ii 36  the hirpi of soracte then are so called because they play the part of cornwolves or korndamonen in wolf shape but mannhardt adds this seems at least to be the explanation  he then combats kuhns theory of feronia as lightning goddess 151a  he next compares the strange arcadian cannibal rites on mount lycaeus 151b    mannhardts deficiency   in all this ingenious reasoning mannhardt misses a point  what the hirpi did was not merely to leap through light embers as in the roman palilia and the parallel doings in scotland england france and elsewhere at midsummer st johns eve  the hirpi would not be freed from military service and all other state imposts for merely doing what any set of peasants do yearly for nothing  nor would varro have found it necessary to explain so easy and common a feat by the use of a drug with which the feet were smeared  mannhardt as mr max muller says ventured himself little among red skins and black skins  he read dr tylor and appreciated the method of illustrating ancient rites and beliefs from the living ways of living savages 151c  but in practice he mainly confined himself to illustrating ancient rites and beliefs by survival in modern rural folklore  i therefore supplement mannhardts evidence from european folklore by evidence from savage life and by a folklore case which mannhardt did not know    the firewalk   a modern student is struck by the cool way in which the ancient poets geographers and commentators mention a startling circumstance the fire walk  the only hint of explanation is the statement that the drug or juice of herbs preserved the hirpi from harm  that theory may be kept in mind and applied if it is found useful  virgils theory that the ministrants walk pietate freti corresponds to mrs wesleys belief when after praying she waded the flames to rescue her children from the burning parsonage at epworth  the hypothesis of iamblichus when he writes about the ecstatic or possessed persons who cannot be injured by fire is like that of modern spiritualiststhe spirit or daemon preserves them unharmed  i intentionally omit cases which are vaguely analogous to that of the hirpi  in icelandic sagas in the relations of the old jesuit missionaries in the travels of pallas and gmelin we hear of medicine men and berserks who take liberties with redhot metal live coals and burning wood  thus in the icelandic flatey book vol i p 425 we read about the fighting evangelist of iceland a story of thangbrandr and the foreign berserkir  the berserkir said i can walk through the burning fire with my bare feet  then a great fire was made which thangbrandr hallowed and the berserkir went into it without fear and burned his feetthe christian spell of thangbrandr being stronger than the heathen spell of the berserkir  what the saga says is not evidence and some of the other tales are merely traditional  others may be explained perhaps by conjuring  the mediaeval ordeal by fire may also be left on one side  in 1826 lockhart published a translation of the church service for the ordeal by fire a document given he says by busching in die vorzeit for 1817  the accused communicates before carrying the redhot iron bar or walking on the redhot ploughshare  the consecrated wafer is supposed to preserve him from injury if he be guiltless  he carries the iron for nine yards after which his hands are sealed up in a linen cloth and examined at the end of three days  if he be found clear of scorch or scar glory to god  lockhart calls the service one of the most extraordinary records of the craft the audacity and the weakness of mankind 153  the fraud is more likely to have lain in the pretended failure to find scorch or scar than in any method of substituting cold for hot iron or of preventing the metal from injuring the subject of the ordeal  the rite did not long satisfy the theologians and jurists of the middle ages it has been discussed by lingard in his history of england and by dr e b tylor in primitive culture  for the purpose of the present inquiry i also omit all the rites of leaping sportfully and of driving cattle through light fires  of these cases from the roman palilia or parilia downwards there is a useful collection in brands popular antiquities under the heading midsummer eve  one exception must be made for a passage from torreblancas demonologia p 106  people are said pyras circumire et transilire in futuri mali averruncationeto go round about and leap over lighted pyres for the purpose of averting future evils as in mannhardts theory of the hirpi  this may be connected with the bulgarian rite to be described later but as a rule in all these instances the fire is a light one of straw and no sort of immunity is claimed by the people who do not walk through but leap across it  these kinds of analogous examples then it suffices merely to mention for the others in all affairs of this sort the wide diffusion of a tale of miracle is easily explained  the fancy craves for miracles and the universal mode of inventing a miracle is to deny the working on a given occasion of a law of nature  gravitation was suspended men floated in air inanimate bodies became agile or fire did not burn  no less natural than the invention of the myth is the attempt to feign it by conjuring or by the use of some natural secret  but in the following modern instances the miracle of passing through the fire uninjured is apparently feigned with considerable skill or is performed by the aid of some secret of nature not known to modern chemistry  the evidence is decidedly good enough to prove that in europe india and polynesia the ancient rite of the hirpi of soracte is still a part of religious or customary ceremony    fijian firewalk   the case which originally drew my attention to this topic is that given by mr basil thomson in his south sea yarns p 195  mr thomson informs me that he wrote his description on the day after he witnessed the ceremony a precaution which left no room for illusions of memory  of course in describing a conjuring trick one who is not an expert records not what actually occurred but what he was able to see and the chances are that he did not see and therefore omits an essential circumstance while he misstates other circumstances  i am informed by mrs steel the author of the potters thumb and other stories of indian life that in watching an indian conjurer she generally or frequently detects his method  she says that the conjurer often begins by whirling rapidly before the eyes of the spectators a small polished skull of a monkey and she is inclined to think that the spectators who look at this are in some way more easily deluded  these facts are mentioned that i may not seem unaware of what can be said to impugn the accuracy of the descriptions of the fire rite as given by mr thomson and other witnesses  mr thomson says that the wesleyan missionaries have nearly made a clean sweep of all heathen ceremonial in fiji  but in one corner of fiji the island of nbengga a curious observance of mythological origin has escaped the general destruction probably because the worthy iconoclasts had never heard of it  the myth tells how the ancestor of the clan received the gift of firewalking from a god and the existence of the myth raises a presumption in favour of the antiquity of the observance        once every year the masawe a dracaena that grows in profusion on the grassy hillsides of the island becomes fit to yield the sugar of which its fibrous root is full  to render it fit to eat the roots must be baked among hot stones for four days  a great pit is dug and filled with large stones and blazing logs and when these have burned down and the stones are at white heat the oven is ready for the masawe  it is at this stage that the clan na ivilankata favoured of the gods is called on to leap into the oven rikata na lovo and walk unharmed upon the hot stones that would scorch and wither the feet of any but the descendants of the dauntless tui nkualita  twice only had europeans been fortunate enough to see the masawe cooked and so marvellous had been the tales they told and so cynical the scepticism with which they had been received that nothing short of another performance before witnesses and the photographic camera would have satisfied the average old hand  as we steamed up to the chiefs village of waisoma a cloud of blue smoke rolling up among the palms told us that the fire was newly lighted  we found a shallow pit nineteen feet wide dug in the sandy soil a stones throw from highwater mark in a small clearing among the cocoanuts between the beach and the dense forest  the pit was piled high with great blazing logs and round stones the size of a mans head  mingled with the crackling roar of the fire were loud reports as splinters flew off from the stones warning us to guard our eyes  a number of men were dragging up more logs and rolling them into the blaze while above all on the very brink of the fiery pit stood jonathan dambea directing the proceedings with an air of noble calm  as the stones would not be hot enough for four hours there was ample time to hear the tradition that warrants the observance of the strange ceremony we were to see  when we were at last summoned the fire had been burning for more than four hours  the pit was filled with a whitehot mass shooting out little tongues of white flame and throwing out a heat beside which the scorching sun was a pleasant relief  a number of men were engaged with long poles to which a loop of thick vine had been attached in noosing the pieces of unburnt wood by twisting the pole like a horses twitch until the loop was tight and dragging the log out by main force  when the wood was all out there remained a conical pile of glowing stones in the middle of the pit  ten men now drove the butts of green saplings into the base of the pile and held the upper end while a stout vine was passed behind the row of saplings  a dozen men grasped each end of the vine and with loud shouts hauled with all their might  the saplings like the teeth of an enormous rake tore through the pile of stones flattening them out towards the opposite edge of the pit  the saplings were then driven in on the other side and the stones raked in the opposite direction then sideways until the bottom of the pit was covered with an even layer of hot stones  this process had taken fully half an hour but any doubt as to the heat of the stones at the end was set at rest by the tongues of flame that played continually among them the cameras were hard at work and a large crowd of people pressed inwards towards the pit as the moment drew near  they were all excited except jonathan who preserved even in the supreme moment the air of holy calm that never leaves his face  all eyes are fixed expectant on the dense bush behind the clearing whence the shadrachs meshachs and abednegos of the pacific are to emerge  there is a cry of vutu  vutu and forth from the bush two and two march fifteen men dressed in garlands and fringes  they tramp straight to the brink of the pit  the leading pair show something like fear in their faces but do not pause perhaps because the rest would force them to move forward  they step down upon the stones and continue their march round the pit planting their feet squarely and firmly on each stone  the cameras snap the crowd surges forward the bystanders fling in great bundles of green leaves  but the bundles strike the last man of the procession and cut him off from his fellows so he stays where he is trampling down the leaves as they are thrown to line the pit in a dense cloud of steam from the boiling sap  the rest leap back to his assistance shouting and trampling and the pit turns into the mouth of an inferno filled with dusky frenzied fiends half seen through the dense volume that rolls up to heaven and darkens the sunlight  after the leaves palmleaf baskets of the dracaena root are flung to them more leaves and then bystanders and every one join in shovelling earth over all till the pit is gone and a smoking mound of fresh earth takes its place  this will keep hot for four days and then the masawe will be cooked  as the procession had filed up to the pit by a preconcerted arrangement with the noble jonathan a large stone had been hooked out of the pit to the feet of one of the party who poised a pockethandkerchief over it and dropped it lightly upon the stone when the first man leapt into the oven and snatched what remained of it up as the last left the stones during the fifteen or twenty seconds it lay there every fold that touched the stone was charred and the rest of it scorched yellow  so the stones were not cool  we caught four or five of the performers as they came out and closely examined their feet  they were cool and showed no trace of scorching nor were their anklets of dried treefern leaf burnt this jonathan explained is part of the miracle for dried treefern is as combustible as tinder and there were flames shooting out among the stones  sceptics had affirmed that the skin of a fijians foot being a quarter of an inch thick he would not feel a burn  whether this be true or not of the ball and heel the instep is covered with skin no thicker than our own and we saw the men plant their insteps fairly on the stone        mr thomsons friend jonathan said that young men had been selected because they would look better in a photograph and being inexperienced they were afraid  a stranger would share the gift if he went in with one of the tribe  some years ago a man fell and burned his shoulders  any trick  here jonathans ample face shrunk smaller and a shadow passed over his candid eye  mr thomson concludes perhaps the na ivilankata clan have no secret and there is nothing wonderful in their performance but miracle or not i am very glad i saw it  the handkerchief dropped on the stone is alive to testify to it  mr thomsons photograph of the scene is illdeveloped and the fumes of steam somewhat interfere with the effect  a rough copy is published in folklore for september 1895 but the piece could only be reproduced by a delicate drawing with the brush  the parallel to the rite of the hirpi is complete except that redhot stones not the pyre of pineembers is used in fiji  mr thomson has heard of a similar ceremony in the cook group of islands  as in ancient italy so in fiji a certain clan have the privilege of firewalking it is far enough from fiji to southern india as it is far enough from mount soracte to fiji  but in southern india the klings practise the rite of the hirpi and the na ivilankata  i give my informants letter exactly as it reached me though it has been published before in longmans magazine    kling firewalk   dear sirobserving from your note in longmans magazine that you have mislaid my notes re firewalking i herewith repeat them  i have more than once seen it done by the klings as the lowcaste tamilspeaking hindus from malabar are called in the straits settlements  on one occasion i was present at a firewalking held in a large tapioca plantation in province wellesley before many hundreds of spectators all the hindu coolies from the surrounding estates being mustered  a trench had been dug about twenty yards long by six feet wide and two deep  this was piled with faggots and small wood four or five feet high  this was lighted at midday and by four pm the trench was a bed of redhot ashes the heat from which was so intense that the men who raked and levelled it with long poles could not stand it for more than a minute at a time  a few yards from the end of the trench a large hole had been dug and filled with water  when all was ready six men ordinary coolies dressed only in their dholis or loincloths stepped out of the crowd and amidst tremendous excitement and a horrible noise of conches and drums passed over the burning trench from end to end in single file at a quick walk plunging one after the other into the water  not one of them showed the least sign of injury  they had undergone some course of preparation by their priest not a brahman but some kind of devildoctor or medicineman and as i understood it they took on themselves and expiated the sins of the kling community for the past year a big job if thieving and lying count probably not  they are not however always so lucky for i heard that on the next occasion one of the men fell and was terribly burnt thus destroying the whole effect of the ceremony  i do not think this to be any part of the brahmanical religion though the ordeal by fire as a test of guilt is or was in use all over india  the fact is that the races of southern india where the aryan element is very small have kept all their savage customs and devilworship under the form of brahmanism  another curious feat i saw performed at labuan deli in sumatra on the chinese new year  a chinaman of the coolie class was squatted stark naked on the roadside holding on his knees a brass pan the size of a washhand basin piled a foot high with redhot charcoal  the heat reached ones face at two yards but if it had been a tray of ices the man couldnt have been more unconcerned  there was a crowd of chinese round him all eagerly asking questions and a pile of coppers accumulating beside him  a chinese shopkeeper told me that the man told fortunes but from the circumstance of a gamblinghouse being close by i concluded that his customers were getting tips on a system  hoping these notes may be of service to you i remain yours truly stephen ponder        in this rite the firepit is thrice as long at a rough estimate as that of the fijians  the fire is of wooden embers not heated stones  as in fiji a man who falls is burned clearly suggesting that the feet and legs but not the whole body are in some way prepared to resist the fire  as we shall find to be the practice in bulgaria the celebrants place their feet afterwards in water  as in bulgaria drums are beaten to stimulate the firewalkers  neither here nor in fiji are the performers said to be entranced like the bulgarian nistinares 161  on the whole the kling rite which the klings i am informed also practise in the islands whither they are carried as coolies so closely resembles the fijian and the tongan that one would explain the likeness by transmission were the ceremony not almost as like the rite of the hirpi for the tongan fireritual the source is the polynesian societys journal vol ii  no 2 pp 105108  my attention was drawn to this by mr laing writing from new zealand  the article is by miss tenira henry of honolulu a young lady of the island  the council of the society not having seen the rite do not guarantee the truth of the story but willingly publish it for the sake of the incantation  miss henry begins with a description of the tiplant dracaena terminalis which requires to be well baked before being eaten  she proceeds thus  the tiovens are frequently thirty feet in diameter and the large stones heaped upon small logs of wood take about twentyfour hours to get properly heated  then they are flattened down by means of long green poles and the trunks of a few bananatrees are stripped up and strewn over them to cause steam  the tiroots are then thrown in whole accompanied by short pieces of aperoot arum costatum that are not quite so thick as the ti but grow to the length of six feet and more the oven is then covered over with large leaves and soil and left so for about three days when the ti and the ape are taken out well cooked and of a rich lightbrown colour  the ape prevents the ti from getting too dry in the oven  there is a strange ceremony connected with the uum ti or tioven that used to be practised by the heathen priests at raiatea but can now be performed by only two individuals tupua and taero both descendants of priests  this ceremony consisted in causing people to walk in procession through the hot oven when flattened down before anything had been placed in it and without any preparation whatever barefooted or shod and on their emergence not even smelling of fire  the manner of doing this was told by tupua who heads the procession in the picture to monsieur morne lieutenant de vaisseau who also took the photograph 163 of it about two years ago at uturoa raiatea which being on bad paper was copied off by mr barnfield of honolulu  all the white residents of the place as well as the french officers were present to see the ceremony which is rarely performed nowadays  no one has yet been able to solve the mystery of this surprising feat but it is to be hoped that scientists will endeavour to do so while those men who practise it still live    tupuas incantation used in walking over the uumtitranslation   hold the leaves of the tiplant before picking them and say o hosts of gods awake arise  you and i are going to the tioven tomorrow  if they float in the air they are gods but if their feet touch the ground they are human beings  then break the tileaves off and look towards the direction of the oven and say o hosts of gods go tonight and tomorrow you and i shall go  then wrap the tileaves up in han hibiscus leaves and put them to sleep in the marae where they must remain until morning and say in leaving  arise awake  o hosts of gods  let your feet take you to the tioven fresh water and salt water come also  let the dark earthworm and the light earthworm go to the oven  let the redness and the shades of fire all go  you will go you will go tonight and tomorrow it will be you and i we shall go to the uumti  this is for the night  when the tileaves are brought away they must be tied up in a wand and carried straight to the oven and opened when all are ready to pass through then hold the wand forward and say  o men spirits who heated the oven let it die out  o dark earthworms  o light earthworms fresh water and salt water heat of the oven and redness of the oven hold up the footsteps of the walkers and fan the heat of the bed  o cold beings let us lie in the midst of the oven  o greatwomanwhosetfiretotheskies hold the fan and let us go into the oven for a little while  then when all are ready to walk in we say     holder of the first footstep    holder of the second footstep    holder of the third footstep    holder of the fourth footstep    holder of the fifth footstep    holder of the sixth footstep    holder of the seventh footstep    holder of the eighth footstep    holder of the ninth footstep    holder of the tenth footstep    o greatwomanwhosetfiretotheskies all is covered  then everybody walks through without hurt into the middle and around the oven following the leader with the wand beating from side to side  the greatwomanwhosetfiretotheskies was a highborn woman in olden times who made herself respected by the oppressive men when they placed women under so many restrictions  she is said to have had the lightning at her command and struck men with it when they encroached on her rights  all the above is expressed in old tahitian and when quickly spoken is not easily understood by the modern listener  many of the words though found in the dictionary are now obsolete and the arrangement of others is changed  oe and tana are never used now in place of the plural outou and tatou but in old folklore it is the classical style of addressing the gods in the collective sense  tahutahu means sorcery and also to kindle a fire        so far miss henry on this occasion and the archaic nature of the hymn with the reference to a mythical leader of the revolt of women deserves the attention of anthropologists apart from the singular character of the rite described  in the third number of the journal vol ii the following editorial note is published     miss tenira henry authorises us to say that her sister and her    sisters little child were some of those who joined in the uumti    ceremony referred to in vol ii p 108 and in the preceding note    and actually walked over the redhot stones  the illustration of the    performance given in the last number of the journal it appears is    actually from a photograph taken by lieutenant morne the original of    which miss henry has sent us for inspectioneditor    corroborative evidence   the following corroborative account is given in the journal from a source vaguely described as a pamphlet published in san francisco by mr hastwell  the natives of raiatea have some performances so entirely out of the ordinary course of events as to institute sic inquiry relative to a proper solution  on september 20 1885 i witnessed the wonderful and to me inexplicable performance of passing through the fiery furnace  the furnace that i saw was an excavation of three or four feet in the ground in a circular form sloping upwards and about thirty feet across  the excavation was filled with logs and wood and then covered with large stones  a fire was built underneath and kept burning for a day  when i witnessed it on the second day the flames were pouring up through the interstices of the rocks which were heated to a red and white heat  when everything was in readiness and the furnace still pouring out its intense heat the natives marched up with bare feet to the edge of the furnace where they halted for a moment and after a few passes of the wand made of the branches of the tiplant by the leader who repeated a few words in the native language they stepped down on the rocks and walked leisurely across to the other side stepping from stone to stone  this was repeated five times without any preparation whatever on their feet and without injury or discomfort from the heated stones there was not even the smell of fire on their garments        mr n j tone in the same periodical ii 3193 says that he arrived just too late to see the same rite at bukit mestajam in province wellesley straits settlements he did see the pit and the fire and examined the naked feet quite uninjured of the performers  he publishes an extract to this effect from his diary  the performers i believe were klings  nothing is said to indicate any condition of trance or other abnormal state in the firewalkers    the firewalk in trinidad   mr henry e st clair writing on september 14 1896 says in trinidad british west indies the rite is performed annually about this time of the year among the indian coolie immigrants resident in the small village of peru a mile or so from port of spain  i have personally witnessed the passing and the description given by mr ponder tallies with what i saw except that so far as i can remember the number of those who took part in the rite was greater than six  in addition there is this circumstance which was not mentioned by that gentleman each of the passers carried one or two lemons which they dropped into the fire as they went along  these lemons were afterwards eagerly scrambled for by the bystanders who so far as i can recollect attributed a healing influence to them    bulgarian firewalk   as to the bulgarian rite dr schischmanof writes to me     i am sure the observance will surprise you i am even afraid that you    will think it rather fantastic but you may rely on my information    the danse de feu was described long ago in a bulgarian periodical by    one of our best known writers  what you are about to read only    confirms his account  what i send you is from the recueil de folk    lore de litterature et de science vol vi p 224 edited with my    aid and that of my colleague mastov by the minister of public    instruction  how will you explain these hauts faits de lextase    religieuse  i cannot imagine  for my part i think of the    selfmutilations and tortures of dervishes and fakirs and wonder if    we have not here something analogous  the article in the bulgarian serial is called the nistinares  the word is not bulgarian possibly it is romaic  the scene is in certain villages in turkey on the bulgarian frontier and not far from the town of bourgas on the euxine in the department of lozen grad  the ministrants nistinares have the gift of firewalking as a hereditary talent they are specially just and the gift is attributed as to a god in fiji in bulgaria to st constantine and st helena     these just ones feel a desire to dance in the flames during the    month of may they are filled at the same time with some unknown    force which enables them to predict the future  the best nistinare    is he who can dance longest in the live flame and utter the most    truthful prophecies  the nistinares may be of either sex  on may 1 the nistinares hold a kind of religious festival at the house of one of their number  salutations are exchanged and presents of food and raki are made to the chief nistinare  the holy icones of saints are wreathed with flowers and perfumed with incense  arrangements are made for purifying the holy wells and springs  on may 21 the day of st helena and st constantine the parish priest says mass in the grey of dawn  at sunrise all the village meets in festal array the youngest nistinare brings from the church the icones of the two saints and drums are carried behind them in procession  they reach the sacred well in the wood which the priest blesses  this is parallel to the priestly benediction on fountain sunday of the well beneath the fairy tree at domremy where jeanne darc was accused of meeting the good ladies 169  everyone drinks of the water and there is a sacrifice of rams ewes and oxen  a festival follows as was the use of domremy in the days of the maid then all return to the village the holy drum which hangs all the year before st helena in the church is played upon  a mock combat between the icones which have visited the various holy wells is held  meanwhile in each village pyres of dry wood amounting to thirty fifty or even a hundred cartloads have been piled up  the wood is set on fire before the procession goes forth to the hallowing of the fountains  on returning the crowd dances a horo round dance about the glowing logs  heaps of embers pineus acervus are made and water is thrown on the ground  the musicians play the tune called lair nistinar  a nistinare breaks through the dance turns blue trembles like a leaf and glares wildly with his eyes  the dance ends and everybody goes to the best point of view  then the wildest nistinare seizes the icon turns it to the crowd and with naked feet climbs the pyre of glowing embers  the music plays and the nistinare dances to the tune in the fire  if he is so disposed he utters prophecies  he dances till his face resumes its ordinary expression then he begins to feel the burning he leaves the pyre and places his feet in the mud made by the libations of water already described  the second nistinare then dances in the fire and so on  the predictions apply to villages and persons sometimes sinners are denounced or repairs of the church are demanded in this queer parish council  all through the month of may the nistinares call out for fire when they hear the nistinare music playing  they are very temperate men and women  except in may they do not clamour for fire and cannot dance in it  in this remarkable case the alleged gift is hereditary is of saintly origin and is only exercised when the nistinare is excited and apparently entranced by music and the dance as is the manner also of medicinemen among savages  the rite with its sacrifices of sheep and oxen is manifestly of heathen origin  they pass through the fire to st constantine but the observance must be far older than bulgarian christianity  the report says nothing as to the state of the feet of the nistinares after the firedance  medical inspection is desirable and the photographic camera should be used to catch a picture of the wild scene  my account is abridged from the french version of the bulgarian report sent by dr schischmanof    indian firewalk   since these lines were written the kindness of mr tawney librarian at the india office has added to my stock of examples  thus mr stokes printed in the indian antiquary ii p 190 notes of evidence taken at an inquest on a boy of fourteen who fell during the firewalk was burned and died on that day  the rite had been forbidden but was secretly practised in the village of periyangridi  the firepit was 27 feet long by 75 feet broad and a span in depth  thirteen persons walked through the hot wood embers which in mr stokess opinion who did not see the performance would hardly injure the tough skin of the sole of a labourers foot yet killed a boy  the treading was usually done by men under vows perhaps vows made during illness  one at least walked because it is my duty as pujari  another says i got down into the fire at the east end meditating on draupati walked through to the west and up the bank  draupati is a goddess wife of the pandavas  mr stokes reports that according to the incredulous experienced firewalkers smear their feet with oil of the green frog  no report is made as to the condition of their feet when they emerge from the fire  another case occurs in opperts work the original inhabitants of india p 480  as usual a pit is dug filled with faggots  when these have burned down a little and while the heat is still unbearable in the neighbourhood of the ditch those persons who have made the vow    walk    on the embers in the pit without doing themselves as a rule much harm  again in a case where butter is poured over the embers to make a blaze one of the tribal priests in a state of religious afflatus walks through the fire  it is said that the sacred fire is harmless but some admit that a certain preservative ointment is used by the performers  a chant used at mirzapur as in fiji is cited 171  in these examples the statements are rather vague  no evidence is adduced as to the actual effect of the fire on the feet of the ministrants  we hear casually of ointments which protect the feet and of the thickness of the skins of the firewalkers and of the unapproachable heat but we have nothing exact no trace of scientific precision  the government puts down but does not really investigate the rite    psychical parallels   i now very briefly and under all reserves allude to the only modern parallel in our country with which i am acquainted  we have seen that iamblichus includes insensibility to fire among the privileges of graeco egyptian mediums 172  the same gift was claimed by daniel dunglas home the notorious american spiritualist  i am well aware that as eusapia paladino was detected in giving a false impression that her hands were held by her neighbours in the dark therefore when mr crookes asserts that he saw home handle fire in the light his testimony on this point can have no weight with a logical public  consequently it is not as evidence to the fact that i cite mr crookes but for another purpose  mr crookess remarks i heard and i can produce plenty of living witnesses to the same experiences with d d home     i several times saw the fire test both at my own and at other    houses  on one occasion he called me to him when he went to the fire    and told me to watch carefully  he certainly put his hand in the    grate and handled the redhot coals in a manner which would have been    impossible for me to have imitated without being severely burnt  i    once saw him go to a bright wood fire and taking a large piece of    redhot charcoal put it in the hollow of one hand and covering it    with the other blow into the extempore furnace till the coal was    white hot and the flames licked round his fingers  no sign of    burning could be seen then or afterwards on his hands  on these occasions home was or was understood to be entranced like the bulgarian nistinares  among other phenomena the white handkerchief on which home laid a redhot coal was not scorched nor on analysis did it show any signs of chemical preparation  home could also like the fijians communicate his alleged immunity to others present for example to mr s c hall  but it burned and marked a man i know  home entranced and handling a redhot coal passed it to a gentleman of my acquaintance whose hand still bears the scar of the scorching endured in 1867  immunity was not always secured by experimenters  i only mention these circumstances because mr crookes has stated that he knows no chemical preparation which would avert the ordinary action of heat  mr clodd on the authority of sir b w richardson has suggested diluted sulphuric acid so familiar to klings hirpi tongans and fijians  but mr clodd produced no examples of successful or unsuccessful experiment 173  the nescience of mr crookes may be taken to cover these valuable properties of diluted sulphuric acid unless mr clodd succeeds in an experiment which if made on his own person i would very willingly witness  merely for completeness i mention dr dozouss statement 174 that he timed by his watch bernadette the seer of lourdes while for fifteen minutes she in an ecstatic condition held her hands in the flame of a candle  he then examined her hands which were not scorched or in any way affected by the fire  this is called at lourdes the miracle du cierge  here ends my list of examples in modern and ancient times of a rite which deserves though it probably will not receive the attention of science  the widely diffused religious character of the performance will perhaps be admitted as demonstrated  as to the method by which the results are attained whether by a chemical preparation or by the influence of a certain mental condition or by thickness of skin or whether all the witnesses fable with a singular unanimity shared by photographic cameras i am unable even to guess  on may 21 in bulgaria a scientific observer might come to a conclusion  at present i think it possible that the jewish passing through the fire may have been a harmless rite    conclusion as to firewalk   in all these cases and others as to which i have firsthand evidence there are decided parallels to the rite of the hirpi and to biblical and ecclesiastical miracles  the savage examples are rites and appear intended to secure good results in food supplies fiji or general well being perhaps by expiation for sins as in the attic thargelia  the bulgarian rite also aims at propitiating general good luck    psychical research   but how is the firewalk done  that remains a mystery and perhaps no philologist folklorist anthropologist or physiologist has seriously asked the question  the medicamentum of varro the green frog fat of india the diluted sulphuric acid of mr clodd are guesses in the air and mr clodd has made no experiment  the possibility of plunging the hand unhurt in molten metal is easily accounted for and is not to the point  in this difficulty psychical research registers and no more the wellattested performances of d d home entranced like the nistinares the well observed and timed miracle du cierge at lourdesbernadette being in an ecstatic condition the biblical story of shadrach meshach and abednego in the fiery furnace the researches of iamblichus the case of madame shchapoff carefully reported 175 and other examples  there is no harm in collecting examples and the question remains are all those rites from those of virgils hirpi to bulgaria of today based on some actual but obscure and scientifically neglected fact in nature  at all events for the soranusferonia rite philology only supplies her competing etymologies folklore her modern rural parallels anthropology her savage examples psychical research her cases at firsthand  anthropology had neglected the collection of these perhaps because the firewalk is impossible     the origin of death   yama   this excursus on the firewalk has been introduced as an occasion arose less because of controversy about a neglected theme than for the purpose of giving something positive in a controversial treatise  for the same reason i take advantage of mr max mullers remarks on yama the first who died to offer a set of notes on myths of the origin of death  yama in our authors opinion is the setting sun i 45 ii 563  agni fire is the first who was born as the other twin yama he was also the first who died ii 568  as the setting sun he was the first instance of death  kuhn and others judging from a passage in the atharva veda xviii 3 13 have however inferred that yama was really a human being and the first of mortals  he is described in the atharva as the gatherer of men who died the first of mortals who went forward the first to that world  in the atharva we read of reverence to yama to death who first approached the precipice finding out the path for many  the myth of yama is perfectly intelligible if we trace its roots back to the sun of evening ii 573  mr max muller then proposes on this head to consult the traditions of real naturvolker savages  the harvey islanders speak of dying as following the suns track  the maoris talk of going down with the sun ii 574  no more is said here about savage myths of the first who died  i therefore offer some additions to the two instances in which savages use a poetical phrase connecting the suns decline with mans death    the origin of death   civilised man in a scientific age would never invent a myth to account for gods great ordinance of death  he regards it as a fact obvious and necessarily universal but his own children have not attained to his belief in death  the certainty and universality of death do not enter into the thoughts of our little ones     for in the thought of immortality    do children play about the flowery meads  now there are still many childlike tribes of men who practically disbelieve in death  to them death is always a surprise and an accidentan unnecessary irrelevant intrusion on the living world natural deaths are by many tribes regarded as supernatural says dr tylor  these tribes have no conception of death as the inevitable eventual obstruction and cessation of the powers of the bodily machine the stopping of the pulses and processes of life by violence or decay or disease  to persons who regard death thus his intrusion into the world for death of course is thought to be a person stands in great need of explanation  that explanation as usual is given in myths    death regarded as unnatural   but before studying these widely different myths let us first establish the fact that death really is regarded as something nonnatural and intrusive  the modern savage readily believes in and accounts in a scientific way for violent deaths  the spear or club breaks or crushes a hole in a man and his soul flies out  but the deaths he disbelieves in are natural deaths  these he is obliged to explain as produced by some supernatural cause generally the action of malevolent spirits impelled by witches  thus the savage holds that violence apart and the action of witches apart man would even now be immortal  there are rude races of australia and south america writes dr tylor 178 whose intense belief in witchcraft has led them to declare that if men were never bewitched and never killed by violence they would never die at all  like the australians the africans will inquire of their dead what sorcerer slew them by his wicked arts  the natives says sir george grey speaking of the australians do not believe that there is such a thing as death from natural causes  on the death of an australian native from disease a kind of magical coroners inquest is held by the conjurers of the tribe and the direction in which the wizard lives who slew the dead man is ascertained by the movements of worms and insects  the process is described at full length by mr brough smyth in his aborigines of victoria i 98102  turning from australia to hindustan we find that the puwarrees according to hebers narrative attribute all natural deaths to a supernatural causenamely witchcraft that is the puwarrees do not yet believe in the universality and necessity of death  he is an intruder brought by magic arts into our living world  again in his ethnology of bengal pp 199 200 dalton tells us that the hos an aboriginal nonaryan race are of the same opinion as the puwarrees  they hold that all disease in men or animals is attributable to one of two causes the wrath of some evil spirit or the spell of some witch or sorcerer  these superstitions are common to all classes of the population of this province  in the new hebrides disease and death are caused as mr codrington found by tamates or ghosts 179  in new caledonia according to erskine death is the result of witchcraft practised by members of a hostile tribe for who would be so wicked as to bewitch his fellowtribesman  the andaman islanders attribute all natural deaths to the supernatural influence of e rem chaugala or to jurnwin two spirits of the jungle and the sea  the death is avenged by the nearest relation of the deceased who shoots arrows at the invisible enemy  the negroes of central africa entertain precisely similar ideas about the nonnaturalness of death  mr duff macdonald in africana writes every man who dies what we call a natural death is really killed by witches  it is a far cry from the blantyre mission in africa to the eskimo of the frozen north but so uniform is human nature in the lower races that the eskimo precisely agree as far as theories of death go with the africans the aborigines of india the andaman islanders the australians and the rest  dr rink 180a found that sickness or death coming about in an accidental manner was always attributed to witchcraft and it remains a question whether death on the whole was not originally accounted for as resulting from magic  pere paul le jeune writing from quebec in 1637 says of the red men je nen voy mourir quasi aucun qui ne pense estre ensorcele 180b  it is needless to show how these ideas survived into civilisation  bishop jewell denouncing witches before queen elizabeth was so far mentally on a level with the eskimo and the australian  the familiar and voluminous records of trials for witchcraft whether at salem or at edinburgh prove that all abnormal and unwonted deaths and diseases in animals or in men were explained by our ancestors as the results of supernatural mischief  it has been made plain and the proof might be enlarged to any extent that the savage does not regard death as gods great ordinance universal and inevitable and natural  but being curious and inquisitive he cannot help asking himself how did this terrible invader first enter a world where he now appears so often  this is properly speaking a scientific question but the savage answers it not by collecting facts and generalising from them but by inventing a myth that is his invariable habit  does he want to know why this tree has red berries why that animal has brown stripes why this bird utters its peculiar cry where fire came from why a constellation is grouped in one way or another why his race of men differs from the whitesin all these and in all other intellectual perplexities the savage invents a story to solve the problem  stories about the origin of death are therefore among the commonest fruits of the savage imagination  as those legends have been produced to meet the same want by persons in a very similar mental condition it inevitably follows that they all resemble each other with considerable closeness  we need not conclude that all the myths we are about to examine came from a single original source or were handed aboutwith flint arrowheads seeds shells beads and weaponsin the course of savage commerce  borrowing of this sort mayor rather mustexplain many difficulties as to the diffusion of some myths  but the myths with which we are concerned now the myths of the origin of death might easily have been separately developed by simple and ignorant men seeking to discover an answer to the same problem    why men are mortal   the myths of the origin of death fall into a few categories  in many legends of the lower races men are said to have become subject to mortality because they infringed some mystic prohibition or taboo of the sort which is common among untutored peoples  the apparently untrammelled polynesian or australian or african is really the slave of countless traditions which forbid him to eat this object or to touch that or to speak to such and such a person or to utter this or that word  races in this curious state of ceremonial subjection often account for death as the punishment imposed for breaking some taboo  in other cases death is said to have been caused by a sin of omission not of commission  people who have a complicated and minute ritual like so many of the lower races persuade themselves that death burst on the world when some passage of the ritual was first omitted or when some custom was first infringed  yet again death is fabled to have first claimed us for his victims in consequence of the erroneous delivery of a favourable message from some powerful supernatural being or because of the failure of some enterprise which would have resulted in the overthrow of death or by virtue of a pact or covenant between death and the gods thus it will be seen that death is often though by no means invariably the penalty of infringing a command or of indulging in a culpable curiosity  but there are cases as we shall see in which death as a tolerably general law follows on a mere accident  some one is accidentally killed and this gives death a lead as they say in the huntingfield over the fence which had hitherto severed him from the world of living men  it is to be observed in this connection that the first of men who died is usually regarded as the discoverer of a hitherto unknown country the land beyond the grave to which all future men must follow him  bin dir woor among the australians was the first man who suffered death and he like yama in the vedic myth became the columbus of the new world of the dead    savage deathmyths   let us now examine in detail a few of the savage stories of the origin of death  that told by the australians may be regarded with suspicion as a refraction from a careless hearing of the narrative in genesis  the legend printed by mr brough smyth 183a was told to mr bulwer by a black fellow far from sharp and this black fellow may conceivably have distorted what his tribe had heard from a missionary  this sort of refraction is not uncommon and we must always guard ourselves against being deceived by a savage corruption of a biblical narrative  here is the myth such as it isthe first created man and woman were told by whom we do not learn not to go near a certain tree in which a bat lived  the bat was not to be disturbed  one day however the woman was gathering firewood and she went near the tree  the bat flew away and after that came death  more evidently genuine is the following legend of how death got a lead into the australian world  the child of the first man was wounded  if his parents could heal him death would never enter the world  they failed  death came  the wound in this legend was inflicted by a supernatural being  here death acts on the principle ce nest que le premier pas qui coute and the premier pas was made easy for him  we may continue to examine the stories which account for death as the result of breaking a taboo  the ningphos of bengal say they were originally immortal 183b  they were forbidden to bathe in a certain pool of water  some one greatly daring bathed and ever since ningphos have been subject to death  the infringement not of a taboo but of a custom caused death in one of the many melanesian myths on this subject men and women had been practically deathless because they cast their old skins at certain intervals but a grandmother had a favourite grandchild who failed to recognise her when she appeared as a young woman in her new skin  with fatal goodnature the grandmother put on her old skin again and instantly men lost the art of skinshifting and death finally seized them 184    the greek myth   the greek myth of the origin of death is the most important of those which turn on the breaking of a prohibition  the story has unfortunately become greatly confused in the various poetical forms which have reached us  as far as can be ascertained death was regarded in one early greek myth as the punishment of indulgence in forbidden curiosity  men appear to have been free from death before the quarrel between zeus and prometheus  in consequence of this quarrel hephaestus fashioned a woman out of earth and water and gave her to epimetheus the brother of the titan  prometheus had forbidden his brother to accept any gift from the gods but the bride was welcomed nevertheless  she brought her tabooed coffer this was opened and menwho according to hesiod had hitherto lived exempt from maladies that bring down fatewere overwhelmed with the diseases that stalk abroad by night and day  now in hesiod works and days 70100 there is nothing said about unholy curiosity  pandora simply opened her casket and scattered its fatal contents  but philodemus assures us that according to a variant of the myth it was epimetheus who opened the forbidden coffer whence came death  leaving the myths which turn on the breaking of a taboo and reserving for consideration the new zealand story in which the origin of death is the neglect of a ritual process let us look at some african myths of the origin of death  it is to be observed that in these as in all the myths of the most backward races many of the characters are not gods but animals  the bushman story lacks the beginning  the mother of the little hare was lying dead but we do not know how she came to die  the moon then struck the little hare on the lip cutting it open and saying cry loudly for your mother will not return as i do but is quite dead  in another version the moon promises that the old hare shall return to life but the little hare is sceptical and is hit in the mouth as before  the hottentot myth makes the moon send the hare to men with the message that they will revive as he the moon does  but the hare loses his memory as he runs to quote the french proverb which may be based on a form of this very tale and the messenger brings the tidings that men shall surely die and never revive  the angry moon then burns a hole in the hares mouth  in yet another hottentot version the hares failure to deliver the message correctly caused the death of the moons mother bleek bushman folklore 185  compare sir james alexanders expedition ii 250 where the namaquas tell this tale  the fijians say that the moon wished men to die and be born again like herself  the rat said no let them die like rats and they do 186    the serpent   in this last variant we have death as the result of a failure or transgression  among the more backward natives of south india lewins wild races of south india the serpent is concerned in a suspicious way with the origin of death  the following legend might so easily arise from a confused understanding of the mohammedan or biblical narrative that it is of little value for our purpose  at the same time even if it is only an adaptation it shows the characteristics of the adapting mindgod had made the world trees and reptiles and then set to work to make man out of clay  a serpent came and devoured the still inanimate clay images while god slept  the serpent still comes and bites us all and the end is death  if god never slept there would be no death  the snake carries us off while god is asleep  but the oddest part of this myth remains  not being able always to keep awake god made a dog to drive away the snake by barking  and that is why dogs always howl when men are at the point of death  here we have our own rural superstition about howling dogs twisted into a south indian myth of the origin of death  the introduction of death by a pure accident recurs in a myth of central africa reported by mr duff macdonald  there was a time when the man blessed by sancho panza had not yet invented sleep  a woman it was who came and offered to instruct two men in the still novel art of sleeping  she held the nostrils of one and he never awoke at all and since then the art of dying has been facile    dualistic myths   a not unnatural theory of the origin of death is illustrated by a myth from pentecost island and a red indian myth  in the legends of very many races we find the attempt to account for the origin of death and evil by a simple dualistic myth  there were two brothers who made things one made things well the other made them ill  in pentecost island it was tagar who made things well and he appointed that men should die for five days only and live again  but the malevolent suque caused men to die right out 187  the red indian legend of the same character is printed in the annual report of the bureau of ethnology 187980 p 45  the younger of the cinauav brothers who were wolves said when a man dies send him back in the morning and let all his friends rejoice  not so said the elder the dead shall return no more  so the younger brother slew the child of the elder and this was the beginning of death    economic myth   there is another and a very quaint myth of the origin of death in banks island  at first in banks island as elsewhere men were immortal  the economical results were just what might have been expected  property became concentrated in the hands of the fewthat is of the first generationswhile all the younger people were practically paupers  to heal the disastrous social malady qat the maker of things who was more or less a spider sent for matethat is death  death lived near a volcanic crater of a mountain where there is now a byway into hadesor panoi as the melanesians call it  death came and went through the empty forms of a funeral feast for himself  tangaro the fool was sent to watch mate and to see by what way he returned to hades that men might avoid that path in future  now when mate fled to his own place this great fool tangaro noticed the path but forgot which it was and pointed it out to men under the impression that it was the road to the upper not to the under world  ever since that day men have been constrained to follow mates path to panoi and the dead 188  another myth is somewhat different but like this one attributes death to the imbecility of tangaro the fool    maui and yama   the new zealand myth of the origin of death is pretty well known as dr tylor has seen in it the remnants of a solar myth and has given it a solar explanation  it is an audacious thing to differ from so cautious and learned an anthropologist as dr tylor but i venture to give my reasons for dissenting in this case from the view of the author of primitive culture i 335  maui is the great hero of maori mythology he was not precisely a god still less was he one of the early elemental gods yet we can scarcely regard him as a man  he rather answers to one of the race of titans and especially to prometheus the son of a titan maui was prematurely born and his mother thought the child would be no credit to her already numerous and promising family  she therefore as native women too often did in the southsea islands tied him up in her long tresses and tossed him out to sea  the gales brought him back to shore one of his grandparents carried him home and he became much the most illustrious and successful of his household  so far maui had the luck which so commonly attends the youngest and leastconsidered child in folklore and mythology  this feature in his myth may be a result of the very widespread custom of jungsten recht borough english by which the youngest child is heir at least of the family hearth  now unluckily at the baptism of maui for a pagan form of baptism is a maori ceremony his father omitted some of the karakias or ritual utterances proper to be used on such occasions  this was the fatal original mistake whence came mans liability to death for hitherto men had been immortal  so far what is there solar about maui  who are the suns brethrenand maui had many  how could the sun catch the sun in a snare and beat him so as to make him lame  this was one of mauis feats for he meant to prevent the sun from running too fast through the sky  maui brought fire indeed from the underworld as prometheus stole it from the upperworld but many men and many beasts do as much as the myths of the world and it is hard to see how the exploit gives maui a solar character  maui invented barbs for hooks and other appurtenances of early civilisation with which the sun has no more to do than with patent safetymatches  his last feat was to attempt to secure human immortality for ever  there are various legends on this subject    maui myths   some say maui noticed that the sun and moon rose again from their daily death by virtue of a fountain in hades hinenuitepo where they bathed  others say he wished to kill hinenuitepo conceived of as a woman and to carry off her heart  whatever the reason maui was to be swallowed up in the giant frame of hades or night and if he escaped alive death would never have power over men  he made the desperate adventure and would have succeeded but for the folly of one of the birds which accompanied him  this little bird which sings at sunset burst out laughing inopportunely wakened hinenuitepo and she crushed to death maui and all hopes of earthly immortality  had he only come forth alive men would have been deathless  now except that the bird which laughed sings at sunset what is there solar in all this  the sun does daily what maui failed to do 190a passes through darkness and death back into light and life  not only does the sun daily succeed where maui failed but it was his observation of this fact which encouraged maui to risk the adventure  if maui were the sun we should all be immortal for mauis ordeal is daily achieved by the sun  but dr tylor says 190b it is seldom that solar characteristics are more distinctly marked in the several details of a myth than they are here to us the characteristics seem to be precisely the reverse of solar throughout the cycle of maui he is constantly set in direct opposition to the sun and the very point of the final legend is that what the sun could do maui could not  literally the one common point between maui and the sun is that the little bird the tiwakawaka which sings at the daily death of day sang at the eternal death of maui  without pausing to consider the tongan myth of the origin of death we may go on to investigate the legends of the aryan races  according to the satapatha brahmana death was made like the gods and other creatures by a being named prajapati  now of prajapati half was mortal half was immortal  with his mortal half he feared death and concealed himself from death in earth and water  death said to the gods what hath become of him who created us  they answered fearing thee hath he entered the earth  the gods and prajapati now freed themselves from the dominion of death by celebrating an enormous number of sacrifices  death was chagrined by their escape from the nets and clubs which he carries in the aitareya brahmana  as you have escaped me so will men also escape he grumbled  the gods appeased him by the promise that in the body no man henceforth for ever should evade death  every one who is to become immortal shall do so by first parting with his body    yama   among the aryans of india as we have already seen death has a protomartyr tama the first of men who reached the river spying out a path for many  in spying the path yama corresponds to tangaro the fool in the myth of the solomon islands  but yama is not regarded as a maleficent being like tangaro  the rig veda x 14 speaks of him as king yama who departed to the mighty streams and sought out a road for many and again the atharva veda names him the first of men who died and the first who departed to the celestial world  with him the blessed fathers dwell for ever in happiness  mr max muller as we said takes yama to be a character suggested by the setting suna claim which is also put forward as we have seen for the maori hero maui  it is yama according to the rig veda who sends the birdsa pigeon is one of his messengers compare the white bird of the oxenhamsas warnings of approaching death  among the iranian race yima appears to have been the counterpart of the vedic yama  he is now king of the blessed originally he was the first of men over whom death won his earliest victory    inferences   that yama is mixed up with the sun in the rig veda seems certain enough  most phenomena most gods shade into each other in the vedic hymns  but it is plain that the conception of a first man who died is as common to many races as it is natural  death was regarded as unnatural yet here it is among us  how did it come  by somebody dying first and establishing a bad precedent  but need that somebody have been originally the sun as mr max muller and dr tylor think in the cases of yama and maui  this is a point on which we may remain in doubt for death in itself was certain to challenge inquiry among savage philosophers and to be explained by a human rather than by a solar myth human too rather than a result of disease of language is probably the myth of the firestealer    the stealing of fire   the worldwide myth explaining how man first became possessed of firenamely by stealing itmight well serve as a touchstone of the philological and anthropological methods  to mr max muller the interest of the story will certainly consist in discovering connections between greek and sanskrit names of firegods and of fire bringing heroes  he will not compare the firemyths of other races all over the world nor will he even try to explain whyin almost all of these myths we find a thief of fire a firestealer  this does not seem satisfactory to the anthropologist whose first curiosity is to know why fire is everywhere said to have been obtained for men by sly theft or flat burglary  of course it is obvious that a myth found in australia and america cannot possibly be the result of disease of aryan languages not spoken in those two continents  the myth of firestealing must necessarily have some other origin    fire totems   mr max muller after a treatise on agni and other firegods consecrates two pages to fire totems  if we are assured that there are some dark points left and that these might be illustrated and rendered more intelligible by what are called fire totems among the red indians of north america let us have as much light as we can get ii 804  alas i never heard of fire totems before  probably some one has been writing about them somewhere unless we owe them to mr max mullers own researches  of course he cites no authority for his fire totems  the fire totem we are told would thus naturally have become the god of the indians  we are toldwhere and by whom  not a hint is given on the subject so we must leave the doctrine of fire totems to its mysterious discoverer  if others prefer to call prometheus a fire totem no one would object if only it would help us to a better understanding of prometheus ii 810  who are the others who speak of a greek culturehero by the impossibly fantastic name of a fire totem    prometheus   mr max muller follows kuhn in his explanation of prometheus the fire stealer but he does not follow him all the way  kuhn tried to account for the myth that prometheus stole fire and mr max muller does not try 194  kuhn connects prometheus with the sanskrit pramantha the stick used in producing fire by drilling a pointed into a flat piece of wood  the greeks of course made prometheus mean foresighted providens but let it be granted that the germans know better  pramantha next is associated with the verb mathnami to rub or grind and that again with greek greek to learn  we too talk of a student as a grinder by a coincidence  the root manth likewise means to rob and we can see in english how a firestick a firerubber might become a firerobber a stealer of fire  a somewhat similar confusion in old aryan languages converted the firestick into a person the thief of fire prometheus while a greek misunderstanding gave to prometheus pramantha firestick the meaning of foresighted with the word for prudent foresight greek  this roughly stated is the view of kuhn 195a  mr max muller concludes that prometheus the producer of fire is also the firegod a representative of agni and necessarily of the inevitable dawnof agni as the deus matutinus a frequent character of the vedic agni the agni aushasa or the daybreak ii 813  but mr max muller does not say one word about prometheus as the fire stealer  now that he stole fire is of the essence of his myth and this myth of the original procuring of fire by theft occurs all over the world  as australian and american savages cannot conceivably have derived the myth of firestealing from the root manth and its double sense of stealing and rubbing there must be some other explanation  but this fact could not occur to comparative mythologists who did not compare probably did not even know similar myths wherever found    savage myths of firestealing   in la mythologie pp 185195 i have put together a small collection of savage myths of the theft of fire 195b  our text is the line of hesiod theogony 566 prometheus stole the farseen ray of unwearied fire in a hollow stalk of fennel  the same stalk is still used in the greek isles for carrying fire as it was of oldwhence no doubt this feature of the myth 195c  how did prometheus steal fire  some say from the altar of zeus others that he lit his rod at the sun 196a  the australians have the same fable fire was obtained by a black fellow who climbed by a rope to the sun  again in australia fire was the possession of two women alone  a man induced them to turn their backs and stole fire  a very curious version of the myth occurs in an excellent book by mrs langloh parker 196b  there was no fire when rootoolgar the crane married gooner the kangaroo rat  rootoolgar idly rubbing two sticks together discovered the art of firemaking this we will keep secret they said from all the tribes  a fire stick they carried about in their comebee  the tribes of the bush discovered the secret and the firestick was stolen by reeargar the hawk  we shall be told of course that the hawk is the lightning or the dawn  but in this savage jungle book all the characters are animals and reeargar is no more the dawn than is the kangaroo rat  in savage myths animals not men play the leading roles and the firestealing bird or beast is found among many widely scattered races  in normandy the wren is the firebringer 196c  a bird brings fire in the andaman isles 196d  among the ahts a fish owned fire other beasts stole it the raven hero of the thlinkeets yehl stole fire  among the cahrocs two old women possessed it and it was stolen by the coyote  are these theftuous birds and beasts to be explained as firegods  probably not will any philologist aver that in cahroc thlinkeet  australian andaman and so forth the word for rub resembled the word for rob and so produced by a disease of language the myth of the firestealer    origin of the myth of firestealing   the myth arose from the nature of savage ideas not from unconscious puns  even in a race so civilised as the homeric greeks to make fire was no easy task  homer speaks of a man in a lonely upland hut who carefully keeps the embers alive that he may not have to go far afield in search of the seed of fire 197  obviously he had no ready means of striking a light  suppose then that an early savage loses his seed of fire  his nearest neighbours far enough off may be hostile  if he wants fire as they will not give it he must steal it just as he must steal a wife  people in this condition would readily believe like the australian blacks that the original discoverers or possessors of a secret so valuable as fire would not give it away that others who wanted it would be obliged to get it by theft  in greece in a civilised race this very natural old idea survives though fire is not the possession of a crane or of an old woman but of the gods and is stolen not by a hawk or a coyote but by prometheus the culturehero and demiurge whether his name foresighted is a mistaken folketymology from the root manth or not we have in the ancient inevitable idea that the original patentees of fire would not willingly part with their treasure the obvious origin of the myth of the firestealer  and this theory does not leave the analogous savage myths of firestealing unexplained and out in the cold as does the philological hypothesis 198  in this last instance as in others the origin of a worldwide myth is found not in a disease of language but in a form of thought still natural  if a foreign power wants what answers among us to the exclusive possession of fire or wants the secret of its rivals new explosive it has to steal it     conclusion   here ends this gentle and joyous passage of arms  i showed first why anthropological students of mythology finding the philological school occupying the ground were obliged in england to challenge mr max muller  i then discoursed of some inconveniences attending his method in controversy  next i gave a practical example the affair of tuna and daphne  this led to a comparison of the philological and the anthropological ways of treating the daphne myth  the question of our allies then coming up i stated my reasons for regarding prof tiele rather as an ally than an adversary the reason being his own statement  presently i replied to prof tieles criticism of my treatment of the myth of cronos  after a skirmish on italian fields i gave my reasons for disagreeing with mr max mullers view of mannhardts position  his theory of demeter erinnys was contrasted with that of mr max muller  totemism occupied us next and the views of mr max muller and mr j g frazer were criticised  then i defended anthropological and criticised philological evidence  our method of universal comparison was next justified in the matter of fetishism  the riddle theory of mr max muller was presently discussed  then followed a review of our contending methods in the explanation of artemis of the firewalk of death myths and of the firestealer  thus a number of points in mythological interpretation have been tested on typical examples  much more might be said on a book of nearly 900 pages  many points might be taken much praise were mine worth anything might be given but i have had but one object to defend the method of anthropology from a running or dropping fire of criticism which breaks out in many points all along the line through contributions to the science of mythology  if my answer be desultory and wandering remember the sporadic sharpshooting of the adversary  for adversary we must consider mr max muller so long as we use different theories to different results  if i am right if he is wrong in our attempts to untie this old gordian knot he loses little indeed  that fame of his the most steady and brilliant light of all which crown the brows of contemporary scholars is the wellearned reward not of mythological lore nor of cunning fence in controversy but of wide learning and exquisitely luminous style  i trust that i have imputed no unfairness made no charge of conscious misrepresentation to accidents of exposition we are all liable have struck no foul blow hazarded no discourteous phrase  if i have done so i am thereby even more than in my smattering of unscholarly learning an opponent more absolutely unworthy of the right hon professor than i would fain believe myself     appendix a the firewalk in spain   one study occasionally illustrates another  in examining the history of the earl marischal who was exiled after the rising of 1715 i found in a letter of a correspondent of dalembert that the earl met a form of the firewalk in spain  there then existed in the peninsula a hereditary class of men who by dint of charms permitted by the inquisition could enter fire unharmed  the earl marischal said that he would believe in their powers if he were allowed first to light the fire and then to look on  but the firewalkers would not gratify him as not knowing what kind of fire a heretic might kindle     appendix b mr macdonell on vedic mythology   too late for use here came vedic mythology from grundriss der indoarischen philologie 201 by mr a macdonell the representative of the historic house of lochgarry  this even a nonscholar can perceive to be a most careful and learned work  as to philological equations between names of greek and vedic gods mr macdonell writes dyausgreek is the only one which can be said to be beyond the range of doubt  as to the connection of prometheus with sanskrit pramantha he says greek has every appearance of being a purely greek formation while the indian verb math to twirl is found compounded only with nis never with pra to express the art of producing fire by friction  see above p 194  if mr macdonell is right here the greek myth of the firestealer cannot have arisen from a disease of language  but scholars must be left to reconcile this last typical example of their ceaseless differences in the matter of etymology of names     footnotes   0a  chips iv 62  0b  chips iv p xxxv  0c  chips iv pp vi vii  0d  ibid iv p xv  0e  cults of the greek states
