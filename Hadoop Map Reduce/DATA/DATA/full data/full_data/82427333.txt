michael  mich nothing nothing boy i merely take a great interest in the czars life and movements and i knew you could tell me all about the palace every poor student of medicine in moscow knows all about kings houses it is their duty is it not  alexis aside can michael suspect me there is something strange in his manner tonight why doesnt she come the whole fire of revolution seems fallen into

he is as tripping of speech as if he were some young aristocrat but for my own part i care not for the stops so that the sense be plain  alex reading the past has belonged to the tyrant and he has defiled it ours is the future and we shall make it holy ay let us make the future holy let there be one revolution at least which is not bred in crime nurtured in murder  mich they have spoken to us

tyranny against a peoples life  mich what has the tyrant8 done now  vera tomorrow martial law is to be proclaimed in russia  omnes martial law we are lost we are lost  alex martial law impossible  mich fool nothing is impossible in russia but reform  vera ay martial law the last right to which the people clung has been taken from them without trial without appeal without accuser even our brothers will be taken from their houses shot in the streets like dogs sent away to die in the snow to starve in the dungeon to rot in the mine do you know what martial law means it means the strangling of a whole nation 9the streets will be filled with soldiers night and day there will be sentinels at every door9 no man dare walk abroad now but the spy or the traitor cooped up in the dens we hide in meeting by stealth speaking with bated breath what good can we do now for russia  pres we can suffer at least  vera we have done that too much already the hour is now come to annihilate and to revenge  pres up to this the people have borne everything  vera because they have understood nothing but now we the nihilists have given them the tree of knowledge to eat of and the day of silent suffering is over for russia  mich martial law vera this is fearful tidings you bring  pres it is the death warrant of liberty in russia  vera or the tocsin of10 revolution  mich are you sure it is

must be about this that the council meet tomorrow it has not yet been signed  alex it shall not be while i have a tongue to plead with  mich or while i have hands to smite with  vera martial law o god how easy it is for a king to kill his people by thousands but we cannot rid ourselves of one crowned man in europe what is there of awful majesty in these men which makes the hand unsteady the dagger treacherous the pistolshot harmless are they not men of like passions with ourselves vulnerable to the same diseases of flesh and blood not different from our own what made olgiati tremble at the supreme crisis of that roman life 11and guidos nerve fail him when he should have been of iron and of steel a plague i say on these fools of naples berlin and spain11 methinks that if i stood face to face with one of the crowned men my eye would see more clearly my aim be more sure my whole body gain a strength and power that was not my own oh to think what stands between us and freedom in europe a few old men wrinkled feeble tottering dotards whom a boy could strangle for a ducat or a woman stab in a nighttime and these are the things that keep us from democracy that keep us from liberty but now methinks the brood of men is dead and the dull earth grown sick of childbearing else would no crowned dog pollute gods air by living  omnes try us try us try us  mich we shall try thee too some day vera  vera i pray god thou mayest have i not strangled whatever nature is in me and shall i not keep my oath  mich to president martial law president come there is no time to be lost we have

what spies there are in the university here o alexis you must go you see how desperate suffering has made us there is no room here for a nature like yours you must not come again  alex why do you think so poorly of me why should i live while my brothers suffer  vera you spake to me of your mother once you said you loved her oh think of her  alex i have no mother now but russia my life is hers to take or give away but tonight i am here to see you they tell me you are leaving for novgorod tomorrow  vera i must they are getting fainthearted there and i would fan the flame of this revolution into such a blaze that the eyes of all kings in europe shall be blinded if martial law is passed they will need me all the more there there is no limit it seems to the tyranny of one man but there shall be a limit to the suffering of a whole people  alex god knows it i am with you but you must not go 15the police are watching every train for you15 when you are seized they have orders to place you without trial in the lowest dungeon of the palace16 i know itno matter how 17oh think how without you the sun goes from our life how the people will lose their leader and liberty her priestess17

great white czar whose hands are red with the blood of the people he has murdered whose soul is black with his iniquity is the cleverest conspirator of us all oh how could russia bear two hearts like yours and his  alex vera the emperor was not always like this there was a time when he loved the people it is that devil whom god curse prince paul maraloffski who has brought him to this tomorrow i swear it i shall plead for the people to the emperor  vera plead to the czar foolish boy it is only those who are sentenced to death that ever see our czar besides what should he care for a voice that pleads for mercy the cry of a strong nation in its agony has not moved that heart of stone  alex aside yet shall i plead to him they can but kill me  prof here are the proclamations vera do you think

allowed to go out into the world  prince paul my dear count for romantic young people like he is the world always looks best at a distance and a prison where ones allowed to order ones own dinner is not at all a bad place enter the czarevitch the courtiers rise ah good afternoon prince your highness is looking a little pale today  czare slowly after a pause i want change of air  prince paul smiling a most revolutionary sentiment your imperial father would highly disapprove of any reforms with the thermometer in russia  czare bitterly my imperial father had kept me for six months in this dungeon of a palace this morning he has me suddenly woke up to see some wretched nihilists hung it sickened me the bloody butchery though it was a noble thing to see how well these men can die  prince paul when you are as old as i am prince you will understand that there are few things easier than to live badly and to die well  czare easy to die well a lesson experience cannot have taught you whatever you may know of a bad life  prince paul shrugging his shoulders experience the name men give to their mistakes i never commit any  czare bitterly no crimes are more in your line  prince petro to the czarevitch the emperor was a good deal agitated about your late appearance at the ball last night prince  1count r laughing i believe he thought the nihilists had broken into the palace and carried you off  baron raff if they had you would have missed a charming dance1  prince paul and2 an excellent supper gringoire really excelled himself in his salad ah you may laugh baron but to make a good salad is a much more difficult thing than cooking accounts to make a good salad is to be a brilliant diplomatistthe problem is so entirely the same in both cases to know exactly how much oil one must put with ones vinegar  baron raff a cook and a diplomatist an excellent parallel if i had a son who was a fool id make him one or the other  prince paul i see your father did not hold the same opinion baron but believe me you are wrong to run down cookery for myself the only immortality i desire is to invent a new sauce i have never had time enough to think seriously about it but i feel it is in me i feel it is in me  czare you have certainly missed your metier3 prince paul the cordon bleu would have suited you much better than the grand cross of honour but you know you could never have worn your white apron well you would have soiled it too soon your hands are not clean enough  prince paul bowing que voulez vous i manage your fathers business  czare bitterly you mismanage my fathers business you mean evil genius of his life that you are before you came there was some love left in him it is you who have embittered his nature poured into his ear the poison of treacherous counsel made him hated by the whole people made him what he isa tyrant  the courtiers look significantly at each other  prince paul calmly i see your highness does want change of air but i have been an eldest son myself lights a cigarette i know what it is when a father wont die to please one  the czarevitch goes to the top of the stage and leans against the window looking out  prince petro to baron raff foolish boy 4he will be sent into exile or worse if he is not careful4  baron raff yes5 what a mistake it is to be sincere  prince petro the only folly you have never committed baron  baron raff one has only one head you know prince  prince paul my dear baron your head is the last thing any one would wish to take from you pulls out snuffbox and offers it to prince petrovitch  prince petro thanks prince thanks  prince paul very delicate isnt it i get it direct from paris but under this vulgar republic everything has degenerated over there cotelettes √† limp√©riale vanished of course with the bourbon and omelettes went out with the orleanists la belle france is entirely ruined prince through bad morals and worse cookery enter the marquis de poivrard ah marquis i trust madame la marquise is well  marquis de p you ought to know better than i do prince paul you see more of her  prince paul bowing perhaps i see more in her marquis your wife is really a charming woman so full of esprit and so satirical too she talks continually of you when we are together  prince petro looking at the clock his majesty is a little late today is he not  prince paul what has happened to you my dear petrovitch you seem quite out of sorts you havent quarrelled with your cook i hope what a tragedy that would be for you you would lose all your friends  prince petro i fear i wouldnt be so fortunate as that you forget i would still have my purse6 but you are wrong for once my chef and i are on excellent7 terms  prince paul then your creditors or mademoiselle vera sabouroff have been writing to you i find both of them such excellent correspondents but really you neednt be alarmed i find the most violent proclamations from the executive committee as they call it left all over my house i never read them they are so badly spelt as a rule  prince petro wrong again prince the nihilists leave me alone for some reason or other  prince paul aside ah true i forgot indifference is the revenge the world takes on mediocrities  prince petro i am bored with life8 prince since the opera season ended i have been a perpetual martyr to ennui  prince paul the maladie du si√®cle you want a new excitement prince let me seeyou have been married twice already suppose you tryfalling in love for once  baron r prince i have been thinking a good deal lately  prince paul interrupting you surprise me very much baron  baron r i cannot understand your nature  prince paul smiling if my nature had been made to suit your comprehension rather than my own requirements i am afraid i would have made a very poor figure in the world  count r there seems to be nothing in life about which you would not jest  prince paul ah my dear count life is much too important a thing ever to talk seriously about it  czare coming back from the window i dont think prince pauls nature is such a mystery he would stab his best friend for the sake of writing an epigram on his tombstone or experiencing a new sensation  prince paul parbleu i would sooner lose my best friend than my worst enemy to have friends you know one need only be goodnatured but when a man has no enemy left there must be something mean about him  czare bitterly if to have enemies is a measure of greatness then you must be a colossus indeed prince  prince paul yes i know im the most hated man in russia except your father 9except your father of course9 prince he doesnt seem to like it much by the way but i do i assure you bitterly i love to drive through the streets and see how the canaille scowl at me from every corner it makes me feel i am a power in russia one man against a hundred millions besides i have no ambition to be a popular hero to be crowned with laurels one year and pelted with stones the next i prefer dying peaceably in my own bed  czare and after death  prince paul shrugging his shoulders heaven is a despotism i shall be at home there  czare do you never think of the people and their rights  prince paul the people and their rights bore me i am sick of both in these modern days to be vulgar illiterate common and vicious seems to give a man a marvellous infinity of rights that his honest fathers never dreamed of believe me prince in good democracy every man should be an aristocrat but these people in russia who seek to thrust us out are no better than the animals in ones preserves and made to be shot at most of them  czare excitedly if they are10 common illiterate vulgar no better than the beasts of the field who made them so  enter aidedecamp  aidedecamp his imperial majesty the emperor prince paul looks at the czarevitch and smiles  enter the czar surrounded by his guard  czare rushing forward to meet him sire  czar nervous and frightened dont come too near me boy dont come too near me i say there is always something about an heir to a crown unwholesome to his father who is that man over there i dont know him what is he doing is he a conspirator have you searched him give him till tomorrow to confess then hang himhang him  prince paul sire you are anticipating history this is count petouchof your new ambassador to berlin he is come to kiss hands on his appointment  czar to kiss my hand there is some plot in it he wants to poison me there kiss my sons hand it will do quite as well  prince paul signs to count petouchof to leave the room exit petouchof and the guards czar sinks down into his chair the courtiers remain silent  prince paul approaching sire will your majesty  czar what do you startle me like that for no i wont watches the courtiers nervously why are you clattering your sword sir to count rouvaloff take it off i shall have no man wear a sword in my presence looking at czarevitch least of all my son to prince paul you are not angry with me prince you wont desert me will you say you wont desert me what do you want you can have anythinganything  prince paul bowing very low sire tis enough for me to have your confidence aside i was afraid he was going to revenge himself and give me another decoration  czar returning to his chair well gentlemen  marq de poiv sire i have the honour to present to you a loyal address from your subjects in the province of archangel expressing their horror at the last attempt on your majestys life  prince paul the last attempt but two you ought to have said marquis dont you see it is dated three weeks back  czar they are good people in the province of archangelhonest loyal people they love me very muchsimple loyal people give them a new saint it costs nothing well alexis turning to the czarevitchhow many traitors were hung this morning  czare there were three men strangled sire  czar there should have been three11 thousand i would to god that this people had but one neck that i might strangle them with one noose did they tell anything whom did they implicate what did they confess  czare nothing sire  czar they should have been tortured then why werent they tortured must i always be fighting in the dark am i never to know from what root these traitors spring  czare what root should there be of discontent among the people but tyranny and injustice amongst their rulers  czar what did you say boy tyranny tyranny am i a tyrant im not i love the people im their father im called so in every official proclamation have a care boy have a care you dont seem to be cured yet of your foolish tongue goes over to prince paul and puts his hand on his shoulder prince paul tell me were there many people there this morning to see the nihilists hung  prince paul hanging is of course a good deal less of a novelty in russia now sire than it was three or four years ago and you know how easily the people get tired even of their best amusements but the square and the tops of the houses were really quite crowded were they not prince to the czarevitch who takes no notice  czar thats right all loyal citizens should be there it shows them what to look forward to did you arrest any one in the crowd  prince paul yes sire a woman for cursing your name the czarevitch starts anxiously she was the mother of the two criminals  czar looking at czarevitch she should have blessed me for having rid her of her children send her to prison  czare the prisons of russia are too full already sire there is no room in them for any more victims  12czar they dont die fast enough then you should put more of them into one cell at once you dont keep them long enough in the mines if you do theyre sure to die but youre all too merciful im too merciful myself send her to siberia12 she is sure to die on the way enter an aidedecamp whos that whos that  aidedecamp a letter for his imperial majesty  czar to prince paul i wont open it there may be something in it  prince paul it would be a very disappointing letter sire if there wasnt takes letter himself and reads it  prince petro to count rouvaloff it must be some sad news i know that smile too well  prince paul from the chief of the police at archangel sire the governor of the province was shot this morning by a woman as he was entering the courtyard of his own house the assassin has been seized  czar i never trusted the people of archangel its a nest of nihilists and conspirators take away their saints they dont deserve them  prince paul your highness would punish them more severely by giving them an extra one three governors shot in two months smiles to himself sire permit me to recommend your loyal subject the marquis de poivrard as the new governor of your province of archangel  marq de poiv hurriedly sire i am unfit for this post  prince paul marquis you are too modest believe me there is no man in russia i would sooner see governor of archangel than yourself whispers to czar  czar quite right prince paul you are always right see that the marquiss letters are made out at once  prince paul he can start tonight sire i shall really miss you very much marquis i always liked your taste in wines and wives extremely  marq de poiv to the czar start tonight sire prince paul whispers to the czar  czar yes marquis tonight it is better to go at once  prince paul i shall see that madame la marquise is not too lonely while you are away so you need not be alarmed for her  count r to prince petrovitch i should be more alarmed for myself  czar the governor of archangel shot in his own courtyard by a woman im not safe here im not safe anywhere with that she devil of the revolution vera sabouroff here in moscow prince paul is that woman still here  prince paul they tell me she was at the grand dukes ball last night i can hardly believe that but she certainly had intended to leave for novgorod today sire the police were watching every train for her but for some reason or other she did not go some traitor must have warned her but i shall catch her yet a chase after a beautiful woman is always exciting  czar you must hunt her down with bloodhounds and when she is taken i shall hew her limb from limb i shall stretch her on the rack till her pale white body is twisted and curled like paper in the fire  prince paul oh we shall have another hunt immediately for her sire prince alexis will assist us i am sure  czare you never require any assistance to ruin a woman prince paul  czar vera the nihilist in moscow o god13 were it not better to die at once the dogs death they plot for me than to live as i live now never to sleep or if i do to dream such horrid dreams that hell itself were peace when matched with them to trust none but those i have bought to buy none worth trusting to see a traitor in every smile poison in every dish a dagger in every hand to lie awake at night listening from hour to hour for the stealthy creeping of the murderer for the laying of the damned mine you are all spies you are all spies you worst of allyou my own son which of you is it who hides these bloody proclamations under my own pillow or at the table where i sit which of ye all is the judas who betrays me o god o god methinks there was a time once in our war with england when nothing could make me afraid this with more calm and pathos i have ridden into the crimson heart of war and borne back an eagle which those wild islanders had taken from us men said i was brave then my father gave me the iron cross of valour oh could he see me now with this cowards livery ever in my cheek sinks into his chair i never knew any love when i was a boy i was ruled by terror myself how else should i rule now starts up but i will have revenge i will have revenge for every hour i have lain awake at night waiting for the noose or the dagger they shall pass years in siberia centuries in the mines ay i shall have revenge  czare father have mercy on the people give them what they ask  prince paul and begin sire with your own head they have a particular liking for that  czar the people the people a tiger which i have let loose upon myself but i will fight with it to the death 14i am done with half measures14 i shall crush these nihilists at a blow there shall not be a man of them ay or a woman either left alive in russia 15am i emperor for15 nothing that a woman should hold me at bay vera sabouroff shall be in my power i swear it before a week is ended 16though i burn my whole city to find her16 she shall be flogged by the knout stifled in the fortress strangled in the square  czare o god  czar for two years her hands have been clutching at my throat for two years she has made my life a hell but i shall have revenge martial law prince martial law over the whole empire that will give me revenge a good measure prince eh a good measure  prince paul and an economical one too sire it would carry off your surplus population in six months and save you many expenses in courts of justice they will not be needed now  czar quite right there are too many people in russia too much money spent on them too much money in courts of justice ill shut them up  czare sire reflect before  czar when can you have the proclamations ready prince paul  prince paul they have been printed for the last six months sire i knew you would need them  czar thats good thats very good let us begin at once ah prince if every king in europe had a minister like you  czare there would be less kings in europe than there are  czar in frightened whisper to prince paul what does he mean do you trust him his prison hasnt cured him yet shall i banish him shall i whispers the emperor paul did it the empress catherine there17 points to picture on the wall did it why shouldnt i  prince paul your majesty there is no need for alarm the prince is a very ingenuous young man he pretends to be devoted to the people and lives in a palace preaches socialism and draws a salary that would support a province hell find out one day that the best cure for republicanism is the imperial crown and will cut up the bonnet rogue of democracy to make decorations for his prime minister  czar you are right if he really loved the people he could not be my son  prince paul if he lived with the people for a fortnight their bad dinners would soon cure him of his democracy shall we begin sire  czar at once read the proclamation gentlemen be seated alexis alexis i say come and hear it it will be good practice for you you will be doing it yourself some day  czare i have heard too much of it already takes his seat at the table count rouvaloff whispers to him  czar what are you whispering about there count rouvaloff  count r i was giving his royal highness some good advice your majesty  prince paul count rouvaloff is the typical spendthrift sire he is always giving away what he needs most lays papers before the czar i think sire you will approve of thislove of the people father of his people martial law and the usual allusions to providence in the last line all it requires now is your imperial majestys signature  czare sire  prince paul hurriedly i promise your majesty to crush every nihilist in russia in six months if you sign this proclamation every nihilist in russia  czar say that again to crush every nihilist in russia to crush this woman their leader who makes war upon me in my own city prince paul maraloffski i create you marechale of the whole russian empire to help you to carry out martial law  czar give me the proclamation i will sign it at once  prince paul points on paper here sire  czare starts up and puts his hands on the paper stay i tell you stay the priests have taken heaven from the people and you would take the earth away too  prince paul we have no time prince now this boy will ruin everything the pen sire  czare what is it so small a thing to strangle a nation to murder a kingdom to wreck an empire who are we who dare lay this ban of terror on a people have we less vices than they have that we bring them to the bar of judgment before us  prince paul what a communist the prince is he would have an equal distribution of sin as well as of property  czare warmed by the same sun nurtured by the same air fashioned of flesh and blood like to our own wherein are they different to us save that they starve while we surfeit that they toil while we idle that they sicken while we poison that they die while we strangle  czar how dare  czare i dare all for the people but you would rob them of common rights of common men  czar the people have no rights  czare then they have great wrongs father they have won your battles for you from the pine forests of the baltic to the palms of india they have ridden on victorys mighty wings in search of your glory boy as i am in years i have seen wave after wave of living men sweep up the heights of battle to their death ay and snatch perilous conquest from the scales of war when the bloody crescent seemed to shake above our eagles  czar somewhat moved those men are dead what have i to do with them  czare nothing the dead are safe you18 cannot harm them now they sleep their last long sleep some in turkish waters others by the windswept heights of norway and the dane but these the living our brothers what have you done for them they asked you for bread you gave them a stone they sought for freedom you scourged them with scorpions you have sown the seeds of this revolution yourself  prince paul and are we not cutting down the harvest  czare oh my brothers better far that ye had died in the iron hail and screaming shell of battle than to come back to such a doom as19 this the beasts of the forests have their lairs and the wild beasts their caverns but the people of russia conquerors of the world have not where to lay their heads  prince paul they have the headsmans block  czare the headsmans block ay you have killed their souls at your pleasure you would kill their bodies now  czar insolent boy have you forgotten who is emperor of russia  czare no the people reign now by the grace of god20 you should have been their shepherd you have fled away like the hireling and let the wolves in upon them  czar take him away take him away prince paul  czare god hath given this people tongues to speak with you would cut them out that they may be dumb in their agony silent in their torture but god hath given them hands to smite with and they shall smite ay from the sick and labouring womb of this unhappy land some revolution like a bloody child shall21 rise up and slay you  czar leaping up devil assassin why do you beard me thus to my face  czare because i22 am a nihilist the ministers start to their feet there is dead silence for a few minutes  czar a nihilist a nihilist scorpion whom i have nurtured traitor whom i have fondled is this your bloody secret prince paul maraloffski marechale of the russian empire arrest the czarevitch  ministers arrest the czarevitch  czar a nihilist if you have sown with them you shall reap with them if you have talked with them you shall rot with them if you have lived with them with them you shall die  prince petro die  czar a plague on all sons i say there should be no more marriages in russia when one can breed such vipers as you are arrest the czarevitch i say  prince paul czarevitch by order of the emperor i demand your sword czarevitch gives up sword prince paul places it on the table foolish boy you are not made for a conspirator you have not learned to hold your tongue heroics are out of place in a palace  czar sinks into his chair with his eyes fixed on the czarevitch o god  czare if i am to die for the people i am ready one nihilist more or less in russia what does that matter  prince paul aside a good deal i should say to the one nihilist  23czare the mighty brotherhood to which i belong has a thousand such as i am ten thousand better still the czar starts in his seat the star of freedom is risen already and far off i hear the mighty wave democracy break on these cursed shores23  prince paul to prince petrovitch in that case you and i had better learn how to swim  czare father emperor imperial master i plead not for my own life but for the lives of my brothers the people  prince paul bitterly your brothers the people prince are not content with their own lives they always want to take their neighbours too  czar standing up i am sick of being afraid i have done with terror now from this day i proclaim war against the peoplewar to their annihilation as they have dealt with me so shall i deal with them i shall grind them to powder and strew their dust upon the air there shall be a spy in every mans house a traitor on every hearth a hangman in every village a gibbet in every square plague leprosy or fever shall be less deadly than my wrath i will make every frontier a graveyard every province a lazarhouse and cure the sick by the sword i shall have peace in russia though it be the peace of the dead who said i was a coward who said i was afraid see thus shall i crush this people beneath my feet takes up sword of czarevitch off table and tramples on it  czare father beware the sword you tread on may turn and wound you the people suffer long but vengeance comes at last vengeance with red hands and bloody purpose  prince paul bah the people are bad shots they always miss one  czare there are times when the people are instruments of god  czar ay and when kings are gods scourges for the people oh my own son in my own house my own flesh and blood against me take him away take him away bring in my guards enter the imperial guard czar points to czarevitch who stands alone at the side of the stage to the blackest prison in moscow let me never see his face again

romantic emperor  gen kotemk you are quite right to call him romantic baron a week ago i found him amusing himself in a garret with a company of strolling players today his whim is all the convicts in siberia are to be recalled and political prisoners as he calls them amnestied  prince petro political prisoners why half of them are no better than common murderers  count r and the other half much worse  baron raff oh you wrong them surely count wholesale trade has always been more respectable than retail  count r but he is really too romantic he objected yesterday to my having the monopoly of the salt tax he said the people had a right to have cheap salt  marq de poiv oh thats nothing but he actually disapproved of a state banquet every night because there is a famine in the southern provinces the young czar enters unobserved and overhears the rest  prince petro quelle b√©tise the more starvation there is among the people the better it teaches them selfdenial an excellent virtue baron an excellent virtue  baron raff i have often heard so i have often heard so  gen kotemk he talked of a parliament too in russia and said the people should have deputies to represent them  baron raff as if there was not enough brawling in the streets already but we must give the people a room to do it in but messieurs the worst is yet to come he threatens a complete reform in the public service on the ground that the people are too heavily taxed  marq de poiv he cant be serious there what is the use of the people except2 to get money out of but talking of taxes my dear baron you must really let me have forty thousand roubles tomorrow my wife says she must have a new diamond bracelet  count r aside to baron raff ah to match the one prince paul gave her last week i suppose  prince

r then i shall wait for the resurrection  prince petro yes but en attendant what are we to do  baron raff what have we always done in russia when a czar suggests reformsnothing you forget we are diplomatists men of thought should have nothing to do with action reforms in russia are very tragic but they always end in a farce  count r i wish prince paul were here 3by the bye i think this boy is rather ungrateful to him if that clever old prince had not proclaimed him emperor at once without giving him time to think about it he would have given up his crown i believe to the first cobbler he met in the street  prince petro but do you think baron that prince paul is really going3  baron raff he is exiled  prince petro yes but is he going  baron raff i am sure of it at least he told me he had sent two telegrams already to paris about his dinner  count r ah that settles the matter  czar coming forward prince paul better send a third telegram and order counting them six extra places  baron raff the devil  czar no baron the czar traitors there would be no bad kings in the world if there were no bad ministers like you it is men such as you who wreck mighty empires on the rock of their own greatness our mother russia hath no need of such unnatural sons you can make no atonement now it is too late for that the grave cannot give back your dead nor the gibbet your martyrs but i shall be more merciful to you i give you your lives that is the curse i would lay on you but if there is a man of you found in moscow by tomorrow night your heads will be off your shoulders  baron raff you remind us wonderfully sire of your imperial father  czar i banish you all from russia your estates are confiscated to the people you may carry your titles with you reforms in russia baron always end in a farce you will have a good opportunity prince petrovitch of practising selfdenial that excellent virtue that excellent virtue so baron you think a parliament in russia would be merely a place for brawling well i will see that the reports of each session are sent to you regularly  baron raff sire you are adding another horror to exile  czar but you will have such time for literature now you forget you are diplomatists men of thought should have nothing to do with action  prince petro sire we did but jest  czar then i banish you for your bad jokes bon voyage messieurs4 if you value your lives you will catch the first train for paris exeunt ministers russia is well rid of such men as these they are the jackals that follow in the lions track 5they have no courage themselves
