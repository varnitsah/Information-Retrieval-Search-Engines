or fly headed for the old briarpatch  frontispiece  he dodged and jumped and all the time the shadow followed him  that night old man coyote started for the old pasture  the quickest way for me to know is for you to tell me replied jimmy     chapter i  peter rabbit loses his appetite  good appetite youll always find depends upon your state of mind                               peter rabbit  peter rabbit had lost his appetite now when peter rabbit loses his appetite something is very wrong indeed with him peter has boasted that he can eat any time and all the time in fact the two things that peter thinks most about are his stomach and satisfying his curiosity and nearly all of the scrapes that peter has gotten into have been because of those two things so when peter loses his appetite or his curiosity there is surely something the matter with him  ever since old man coyote had come to live on the green meadows peter had been afraid to go very far from the dear old briarpatch where he makes his home and where he always feels safe now there wasnt any reason why he should go far from the dear old briarpatch there was plenty to eat in it and all around it for sweet clover grew almost up to the very edge of it and you know peter is very fond of sweet clover so there was plenty for peter to eat without running any risk of danger with nothing to do but eat and sleep peter should have grown fat and contented but he didnt  now that is just the way with a lot of people the more they have and the less they have to worry about the more discontented they become and at last they are positively unhappy there was little danny meadow mouse living out on the green meadows he was happy all the livelong day and yet he had no safe castle like the dear old briarpatch where he could always be safe every minute of every day danny had to keep his eyes wide open and his wits working their very quickest for any minute he was likely to be in danger old man coyote or reddy fox or granny fox or digger the badger or mr blacksnake was likely to come creeping through the grass any time and they are always hungry for a fat meadow mouse and as if that werent worry enough danny had to watch the sky too for old whitetail the marsh hawk or his cousin redtail or blacky the crow each of whom would be glad of a meadow mouse dinner yet in spite of all this danny was happy and never once lost his appetite  but peter rabbit with nothing to worry him so long as he stayed in the old briarpatch couldnt eat and grew more and more unhappy  i dont know whats the matter with me i really dont know whats the matter with me said peter as he turned up his nose at a patch of sweet tender young clover i think ill go and cut some new paths through the old briarpatch  now though he didnt know it that was the very best thing he could do it gave him something to think about for two or three days he was very busy cutting new paths and his appetite came back but when he had made all the paths he wanted and there was nothing else to do he lost his appetite again he just sat still all day long and moped and thought and thought and thought the trouble with peter rabbits thinking was that it was all about himself and how unhappy he was of course the more he thought about this the more unhappy he grew  if i only had some one to talk to id feel better said he to himself that reminded him of johnny chuck and what good times they used to have together when johnny lived on the green meadows then he thought of how happy johnny seemed with his little family in his new home in the old orchard in spite of all the worries his family made him and right then peter found out what was the matter with him  i believe im just lonesome said peter yes sir thats whats the matter with me      it isnt good to be alone      ive often heard my mother say      it makes one selfish grouchy cross      and quite unhappy all the day      one needs to think of other folks      and not of just ones self alone      to find the truest happiness      and joy and real content to own  now that ive found out what is the trouble with me the question is what am i going to do about it     chapter ii  peter rabbit plans a journey   its a long jump that makes no landing                                       peter rabbit  the trouble with me is that im lonesome repeated peter rabbit as he sat in the dear old briarpatch yes sir thats the only thing thats wrong with me im just tired of myself and thats why ive lost my appetite and now i know whats the matter what am i going to do about it if i were sure absolutely sure that old man coyote meant what he said about our being friends id start out this very minute to call on all my old friends my my my it seems an age since i visited the smiling pool and saw grandfather frog and jerry muskrat and billy mink and little joe otter mr coyote sounded as if he really meant to leave me alone but butwell perhaps he did mean it when he saw me sitting here safe among the brambles but if i should meet him out in the open he might change his mind andoh dear his teeth are terrible long and sharp  peter sat a little longer thinking and thinking then a bright idea popped into his head he kicked up his heels  ill do it said  he ill make a journey thats what ill do ill make a journey and see the great world      by staying here and sitting still      im sure ill simply grow quite ill      a change of scene is what i need      to be from all my trouble freed  of course if peter had really stopped to think the matter over thoroughly he would have known that running away from one kind of trouble is almost sure to lead to other troubles but peter is one of those who does his thinking afterward peter is what is called impulsive that is he does things and then thinks about them later and often wishes he hadnt done them so now the minute the idea of making a journey popped into his head he made up his mind that he would do it and that was all there was to it you see peter never looks ahead if he could get rid of the trouble that bothered him now which you know was nothing but lonesomeness he wouldnt worry about the troubles he might get into later  now the minute peter made up his mind to make a journey he began to feel better his lost appetite returned and the first thing he did was to eat a good meal of sweet clover  let me see said he as he filled his big stomach i believe ill visit the old pasture its a long way off and ive never been there but ive heard sammy jay say that its a very wonderful place and i dont believe it is any more dangerous than the green meadows and the green forest now that old man coyote and reddy and granny fox are all living here ill start tonight when i am sure that old man coyote is nowhere around and i wont tell a soul where i am going  so peter settled himself and tried to sleep the long day away but his mind was so full of the long journey he was going to make that he couldnt sleep much and when he did have a nap he dreamed of wonderful sights and adventures out in the great world  at last he saw jolly round red mr sun drop down to his bed behind the purple hills old mother west wind came hurrying back from her days work and gathered her children the merry little breezes into her big bag and then she too started for her home behind the purple hills a little star came out and winked at peter and then way over on the edge of the green forest he heard old man coyote laugh peter grinned that was what he had been waiting for since it meant that old man coyote was so far away that there was nothing to fear from him  peter hopped out from the dear safe old briarpatch looked this way and that way and then with his heart in his mouth started towards the old pasture as fast as he could go lippertylippertylip     chapter iii  hooty the owl changes his hunting grounds    a full stomach makes a pleasant day  an empty stomach turns the whole world gray                            peter rabbit  hooty the owl sat on the tiptop of a tall dead tree in the green forest while the black shadows crept swiftly among the trees he was talking to himself it wouldnt have done for him to have spoken aloud what he was saying to himself for then the little people in feathers and fur on whom he likes to make his dinner would have heard him and known just where he was so he said it to himself and sat so still that he looked for all the world like a part of the tree on which he was sitting what he was saying was this  towhit towhoo towhit towhoo  will some one tell me what to do  my children have an appetite  that keeps me hunting all the night  and though their stomachs i may stuff  they never seem to have enough  towhit towhoo towhit towhoo  will some one tell me what to do  when it was dark enough he gave his fierce hunting callwhooohoo hoo whoohoo  now that is a terrible sound in the dark woods very terrible indeed to the little forest people because it sounds so fierce and hungry it makes them jump and shiver and that is just what hooty wants them to do for in doing it one of them is likely to make just the least scratching with his claws or to rustle a leaf if he does hooty whose ears are very very wonderful is almost sure to hear and with his great yellow eyes see him and thenhooty has his dinner  the very night when peter rabbit started on his journey to the old pasture hooty the owl had made up his mind that something had got to be done to get more food for those hungry babies of his up in the big hemlocktree in the darkest corner of the green forest hunting was very poor very poor indeed and hooty was at his wits end to know what he should do he had hooted and hooted in vain in the green forest and he had sailed back and forth over the green meadows like a great black shadow without seeing so much as a single mouse  its all because of old man coyote and granny and reddy fox said hooty angrily theyve spoiled the hunting yes sir thats just what they have done if i expect to feed those hungry babies of mine i must find new hunting grounds i believe ill go up to the old pasture perhaps ill have better luck up there  so hooty the owl spread his broad wings and started for the old pasture just a little while after peter rabbit had started for the same place of course he didnt know that peter was on his way there and of course peter didnt know that hooty even thought of the old pasture if he had perhaps he would have thought twice before starting anyway he would have kept a sharper watch on the sky but as it was his thoughts were all of old man coyote and granny fox and that is where peter made a very grave mistake a very grave mistake indeed as he was soon to find out    chaptee iv  the shadow with sharp claws   now whats the use pray tell me this    when all is said and done  a thousand things and one to learn    and then forget the one  for when that one alone you need    and nothing else will do  what good are all the thousand then    i do not see do you                               peter rabbit  forgetting leads to more trouble than almost anything under the sun peter rabbit knew this of course he knew it peter had had many a narrow escape just from forgetting something he knew just as well as you know that he might just as well not learn a thing as to learn it and then forget it but peter is such a happygolucky little fellow that he is very apt to forget and forgetting leads him into all kinds of difficulties just as it does most folks  now peter had learned when he was a very little fellow that when he went out at night he must watch out quite as sharply for hooty the owl as for either granny or reddy fox and usually he did but the night he started to make a journey to the old pasture his mind was so full of old man coyote and granny and reddy fox that he wholly forgot hooty the owl so as he scampered across the green meadows lippertylipperty lip as fast as he could go with his long ears and his big eyes and his wobbly nose all watching out for danger on the ground not once did he think that there might be danger from the sky above him  it was a moonlight night and peter was sharp enough to keep in the shadows whenever he could he would scamper as fast as he knew how from one shadow to another and then sit down in the blackest part of each shadow to get his breath and to look and listen and so make sure that no one was following him the nearer he got to the old pasture the safer he felt from old man coyote and granny and reddy fox when he scampered across the patches of moonshine his heart didnt come up in his mouth the way it had at first he grew bolder and bolder once or twice he stopped for a mouthful of sweet clover he was tired for he had come a long way but he was almost to the old pasture now and it looked very dark and safe for it was covered with bushes and brambles  plenty of hiding places there thought peter it really looks as safe as the dear old briarpatch no one will ever think to look for me way off here  just then he spied a patch of sweet clover out in the moonlight his mouth began to water ill just fill my stomach before i go into the old pasture for there may not be any clover there said peter  youd better be careful peter rabbit said a wee warning voice inside him  pooh said peter theres nothing to be afraid of way up here  a shadow drifted across the sweet clover patch peter saw it that must be made by a cloud crossing the moon said peter and he was so sure of it that he didnt even look up to see but boldly hopped out to fill his stomach just as he reached the patch of clover the shadow drifted over it again then all in a flash a terrible thought entered peters head he didnt stop to look up he suddenly sprang sideways and even as he did so sharp claws tore his coat and hurt him dreadfully he twisted and dodged and jumped and turned this way and that way and all the time the shadow followed him once again sharp claws tore his coat and made him squeal with pain  illustration he dodged and jumped and all the time the shadow followed him  at last when his breath was almost gone he reached the edge of the old pasture and dived under a friendly old bramblebush  oh sobbed peter i forgot all about hooty the owl besides i didnt suppose he ever came way up here     chapter v  in the old pasture   brambles never scratch those who understand and are considerate of them                                                       peter rabbit  peter rabbit sat under a friendly bramblebush on the edge of the old pasture and panted for breath while his heart went pitapat pita pat as if it would thump its way right through his sides peter had had a terrible fright there were long tears in his coat and he smarted and ached dreadfully where the cruel claws of hooty the owl had torn him and there he was in a strange place not knowing which way to turn for you know he never had visited the old pasture before  but peter had had so many narrow escapes in his life that he had learned not to worry over dangers that are past peter is what wise men call a philosopher that is a big word but its meaning is very simple a philosopher is one who believes that it is foolish to think about things that have happened except to learn some lesson from them and that the best thing to do is to make the most of the present peter had learned his lesson he was sure of that  i never never will forget again to watch out for hooty the owl said he to himself as he nursed his wounds and so perhaps it is a good thing that he so nearly caught me this time if he hadnt i might have forgotten all about him some time when he could catch me i certainly wouldnt have watched out for him way up here for i didnt think he ever came up to the old pasture but now i know he does mr hootyll have to be smarter than hes ever been before to catch me napping again my how i do smart and ache i know now just how danny meadow mouse felt that time hooty caught him and dropped him into the old briarpatch ouch well as my mother used to say      yesterday has gone away      make the most of just today  here i am up in the old pasture and the question is what shall i do next  peter felt a queer little thrill as he peeped out from under the friendly bramblebush very strange and wonderful it seemed of course he couldnt see very far because the old pasture was all overgrown with bushes and briars and they made the very blackest of black shadows in the moonlight peter wondered what dangers might be awaiting him there but somehow he didnt feel much afraid no sir he didnt feel much afraid you see those briars looked good to him for briars are always friendly to peter and unfriendly to those who would do harm to peter so when he saw them he felt almost at home  peter drew a long breath then he cried ouch you see he had forgotten for a minute how sore he was he was eager to explore this new wonderland for sammy jay had told him wonderful tales about it and he knew that here old granny fox and reddy fox had found safety when farmer browns boy had hunted for them so hard on the green meadows and in the green forest he felt sure that there must be the most splendid hiding places and it seemed as if he certainly must start right out to see them for you know peter is very very curious but the first move he made brought another ouch from him and he made up a wry face  i guess the best thing for me to do is to stay right where i am said he for here i am safe under this friendly old bramble  so with a sigh peter settled down to make himself as comfortable as he could and once as far far away on the green meadows he heard the voice of old man coyote peter even smiled  i havent anything to fear from him anyway for hell never think of coming way up here said he     chapter vi  peter rabbit is still lonesome        a sympathetic word or two      a wondrous help is when youre blue      so pity him who sits alone      his aches and troubles to bemoan                                          peter rabbit  all the rest of that night peter sat under a friendly old bramblebush on the edge of the old pasture and nursed the sore places made by the claws of hooty the owl at last jolly round red mr sun began to climb up in the blue blue sky just as he does every day peter looked up at him and he felt sure that mr sun winked at him somehow it made him feel better the fact is peter was beginning to feel just a wee wee bit homesick it is bad enough to be in a strange place alone but to be sore and to smart and ache as peter did makes that lonesome feeling a whole lot harder to bear it is dreadful not to have any one to speak to but to look around and not see a single thing you have ever seen beforemy my my it certainly does give you a strange sinking feeling way down inside  before that long night was over peter felt as if his heart had gone way down to his very toes yes sir thats the way he felt every time he moved at all he cried ouch he just knew that he was growing more stiff and sore every minute then he began to wonder what he should do for something to eat for he was in a strange place you remember and that made him think of all his private little paths through the dear old briarpatch the little paths he had made all himself and which no one used but himself excepting danny meadow mouse when he came for a visit  perhaps i shall never never see them again moaned peter and two big tears filled his eyes and were just ready to drop  at that moment he looked up and saw jolly round red mr sun wink peter tried to wink back and that made the two tears fall but there were no more tears to follow you see that wink had made all the difference in the world peters heart had jumped right back where it belonged mr sun was one of his oldest friends and you know   when trouble comes a friendly face  makes bright the very darkest place  and so just as he made bright all the old pasture mr sun also made bright the dark little corners in peters heart just because he was an old friend to be sure peter was still lonesome but it was a different kind of lonesomeness he hadnt anybody to talk to which is always a dreadful thing to peter but he had only to look up to catch a friendly wink and somehow that not only made him feel better inside but it seemed to make his aches and smarts better too     chapter vii  peter finds tracks    every day is different from every other day  and always there is something new to see along the way                                         peter rabbit  peter rabbit had sat still just as long as he could he was stiff and lame and sore from the wounds made by hooty the owl but his curiosity wouldnt let him sit still a minute longer he just had to explore the old pasture so with many a wry face and many an ouch he limped out from the shelter of the friendly old bramblebush and started out to see what the old pasture was like  now hooty the owl had taught peter wisdom with his torn clothes and his aches and smarts he couldnt very well forget to be careful first he made sure that there was no danger near and this time he took pains to look all around in the sky as well as on the ground then he limped out to the very patch of sweet clover where hooty had so nearly caught him the night before  a good breakfast said peter will make a new rabbit of me you know peter thinks a great deal of his stomach so he began to eat as fast as he could stopping every other mouthful to look and listen i know its a bad habit to eat fast said he but its a whole lot worse to have an empty stomach so he ate and ate and ate as fast as he could make his little jaws go which is very fast indeed  when peters stomach was stuffed full he gave a great sigh of relief and limped back to the friendly old bramblebush to rest but he couldnt sit still long for he just had to find out all about the old pasture so pretty soon he started out to explore such a wonderful place as it seemed to peter there were clumps of bushes with little open spaces between just the nicest kind of playgrounds then there were funny spreading prickly junipertrees which made the very safest places to crawl out of harms way and to hide everywhere were paths made by cows very wonderful they seemed to peter who had never seen any like them before he liked to follow them because they led to all kinds of queer places  sometimes he would come to places where tall trees made him think of the green forest only there were never more than a few trees together once he found an old tumbledown stone wall all covered with vines and he shouted right out with delight  its a regular castle cried peter and he knew that there he would be safe from every one but shadow the weasel but he never was wholly safe from shadow the weasel anywhere so he didnt let that thought worry him by and by he came to a wet place called a swamp the ground was soft and there were little pools of water great ferns grew here just as they did along the bank of the laughing brook only more of them there were pretty birchtrees and wild cherrytrees it was still and dark and oh so peaceful peter liked that place and sat down under a big fern to rest he didnt hear a sound excepting the beautiful silvery voice of veery the thrush listening to it peter fell asleep for he was very tired  by and by peter awoke for a minute he couldnt think where he was then he remembered but for a long time he sat perfectly still thinking of his adventures and wondering if he would be missed down on the green meadows then all of a sudden peter saw something that made him sit up so suddenly that he cried ouch for he had forgotten all about how stiff and sore he was  what do you think peter saw tracks yes sir he saw tracks rabbit tracks in the soft mud and peter knew that he hadnt made them     chapter viii  the strange tracks in the old pasture    who has attentive ear and eye  will learn a lot if he but try                               peter rabbit  peter rabbit stared and stared at the tracks in the soft mud of the swamp in the old pasture he would look first at the tracks then at his own feet and finally back at the tracks again he scratched his long right ear with his long right hind foot then he scratched his long left ear with his long left hind foot all the time staring his hardest at those strange tracks they certainly were the tracks of a rabbit and it was equally certain that they were not his own  they are too big for mine and they are too small for jumper the hares besides jumper is in the green forest and not way off up here said peter to himself i wonderwell i wonder if he will try to drive me away  you see peter knew that if he had found a strange rabbit in his dear old briarpatch he certainly would have tried his best to drive him out for he felt that the old briarpatch belonged to him now he wondered if the maker of these tracks would feel the same way about the old pasture peter looked troubled as he thought it over then his face cleared  perhaps said he hopefully he is a new comer here too and if he is ill have just as much right here as he has perhaps he simply has big feet and isnt any bigger or stronger than i am and if thats the case id like to see him drive me out  peter swelled himself out and tried to look as big as he could when he said this but swelling himself out this way reminded him of how stiff and sore he was from the wounds given him by hooty the owl and he made a wry face you see he realized all of a sudden that he didnt feel much like fighting  my said peter i guess id better find out all about this other fellow before i have any trouble with him the old pasture looks big enough for a lot of rabbits and perhaps if i dont bother him he wont bother me i wonder what he looks like i believe ill follow these tracks and see what i can find  so peter began to follow the tracks of the strange rabbit and he was so interested that he almost forgot to limp they led him this way and they led him that way through the swamp and then out of it at the foot of a certain birchtree peter stopped  ha said he now i shall know just how big this fellow is  how was he to know why that tree was a kind of rabbit measuring stick yes sir that is just what it was you see rabbits like to keep a record of how they grow just as some little boys and girls do but as they have no doors or walls to stand against they use trees and this was the measuringtree of the rabbit whose tracks peter had been following peter stopped at the foot of it and sat down to think it over he knew what that tree meant perfectly well he had one or two measuringtrees of his own on the edge of the green forest he knew too that it was more than a mere measuringtree it was a kind of no trespassing sign it meant that some other rabbit had lived here for some time and felt that he owned this part of the old pasture peters nose told him that for the tree smelled very very strong of rabbitof the rabbit with the big feet this was because whoever used it for a measuringtree used to rub himself against it as far up as he could reach  peter hopped up close to it then he sat up very straight and stretched himself as tall as he could but he wisely took care not to rub against the tree you see he didnt want to leave his own mark there so he stretched and stretched but stretch as he would he couldnt make his wobbly little nose reach the mark made by the other rabbit  my sakes he is a big fellow exclaimed peter i guess i dont want to meet him until i feel better and stronger than i do now     chapter ix  an unpleasant surprise    legs are very useful when you want to run away  long sharp teeth are splendid if to fight you want to stay  but a far far greater blessing whether one may stay or quit  is a clever trusty quick and ever ready wit                                             peter rabbit  peter rabbit sat in a snug hidingplace in the old pasture and thought over what he had found out about the strange rabbit whose tracks he had followed they had led him to a rubbing or measuringtree where the strange rabbit had placed his mark and that mark was so high up on the tree that peter knew the strange rabbit must be a great deal bigger than himself  if hes bigger of course he is stronger thought peter and if he is both bigger and stronger of course it wont be the least bit of use for me to fight him then anyway im too stiff and sore to fight and then he has no business to think he owns the old pasture because he doesnt i have just as much right here as he has yes sir i have just as much right in this old pasture as he has and if he thinks he can drive me out he is going to find that he was never more mistaken in his life ill show him yes siree ill show him i guess my wits are as sharp as his and i wouldnt wonder if they are a little bit sharper  foolish peter rabbit there he was boasting and bragging to himself of what he would do to some one whom he hadnt even seen all because he had found a sign that told him the old pasture in which he had made up his mind to make his new home was already the home of some one else peter was like a lot of other people he wasnt fair no sir he wasnt fair he let his own desires destroy his sense of fair play it was all right for him to put up signs in the dear old briarpatch and the green forest warning other rabbits that they must keep away but it was all wrong for another rabbit to do the same thing in the old pasture oh my yes that was quite a different matter the very thought of it made peter very very angry when he thought of this other rabbit it was always as the stranger that shows just how unfair peter was because you see peter himself was really the stranger it was his first visit to the old pasture while it was very plain that the other had lived there for some time  but peter couldnt or wouldnt see that he had counted so much on having the old pasture to himself and doing as he pleased that he was too upset and disappointed to be fair if the other rabbit had been smaller than hewell that might have made a difference the truth is peter was just a wee bit afraid and perhaps it was that wee bit of fear that made him unfair and unjust anyway the longer he sat and thought about it the angrier he grew and the more he bragged and boasted to himself about what he would do  ill just keep out of sight until my wounds are healed and then well see who owns the old pasture thought peter  no sooner had this thought popped into his head than he received a surprise such an unpleasant surprise it was three heavy thumps right behind him peter knew what that meant of course he knew it meant that he must run or fight it meant that he had been so busy thinking about how smart he was going to be that he had forgotten to cover his own tracks and so the maker of the big tracks he had followed had found him out  thump thump thump there it was again peter knew by the sound that it was of no use to stay and fight especially when he was so sore and stiff there was nothing to do but run away he simply had to and that is just what he did do while his eyes were filled with tears of rage and bitterness     chapter x  peter rabbit almost decides to return home    i have no doubt that youve been told  how timid folks are sometimes bold                                     peter rabbit  in all his life peter rabbit had never been so disappointed here he was in the old pasture about which he had dreamed and thought so long and in reaching which he had had such a narrow escape from hooty the owl and yet he was unhappy the fact is peter was more unhappy than he could remember ever to have been before not only was he unhappy but he was in great fear and the worst of it was he was in fear of an enemy who could go wherever he could go himself  you see it was this way peter had expected to find some enemies in the old pasture he had felt quite sure that fierce old mr goshawk was to be watched for and perhaps mr redtail and one or two others of the hawk family he knew that granny and reddy fox had lived there once upon a time and might come back if things got too unpleasant for them on the green meadows now that old man coyote had made his home there but peter didnt worry about any of these dangers he was used to them was peter he had been dodging them ever since he could remember a friendly bramblebush a little patch of briars or an old stone wall near was all that peter needed to feel perfectly safe from these enemies but now he was in danger wherever he went for he had an enemy who could go everywhere he could and it seemed to peter that this enemy was following him all the time who was it why it was a great big old rabbit with a very short temper who because he had lived there for a long time felt that he owned the old pasture and that peter had no right there  now in spite of all his trouble peter had seen enough of the old pasture to think it a very wonderful place a very wonderful place indeed he had seen just enough to want to see more you know how very curious peter is it seemed to him that he just couldnt go back to the dear old briarpatch on the green meadows until he had seen everything to be seen in the old pasture so he couldnt make up his mind to go back home but stayed and stayed hoping each day that the old gray rabbit would get tired of hunting for him and would let him alone  but the old gray rabbit didnt do anything of the kind he seemed to take the greatest delight in waiting until peter thought that he had found a corner of the old pasture where he would be safe and then in stealing there when peter was trying to take a nap and driving him out twice peter had tried to fight but the old gray rabbit was too big for him he knocked all the wind out of poor peter with a kick from his big hind legs and then with his sharp teeth he tore peters coat  poor peter his coat had already been badly torn by the cruel claws of hooty the owl and old mother nature hadnt had time to mend it when he fought with the old gray rabbit after the second time peter didnt try to fight again he just tried to keep out of the way and he did too but in doing it he lost so much sleep and he had so little to eat that he grew thin and thin and thinner until with his torn clothes he looked like a scarecrow   and still he hated to give in   when there was still so much to see  persistence i was taught will win    and so i will persist said he  and he did persist day after day until at last he felt that he really must give it up he had stretched out wearily on a tiny sunningbank in the farthest corner of the old pasture and had just about made up his mind that he would go back that very night to the dear old briarpatch on the green meadows when a tiny rustle behind him made him jump to his feet with his heart in his mouth but instead of the angry face of the old gray rabbit he sawwhat do you think why two of the softest gentlest eyes peeping at him from behind a big fern     chapter xi  peter rabbit has a sudden change of mind    whatever you decide to do  make up your mind to see it through                                 peter rabbit  peter rabbit stared at the two soft gentle eyes peeping at him from behind the big fern just back of the sunningbank in the far corner of the old pasture he had so fully expected to see the angry face of the big gray old rabbit who had made life so miserable for him that for a minute he couldnt believe that he really saw what he did see and so he just stared and stared it was very rude of course it was it was very rude indeed it is always rude to stare at any one so it was no wonder that after a minute the two soft gentle eyes disappeared behind one of the great green leaves of the fern peter gave a great sigh then he remembered how rude he had been to stare so  ii beg your pardon said peter in his politest manner which is very polite indeed for peter can be very polite when he wants to be i beg your pardon i didnt mean to frighten you please forgive me  with the greatest eagerness peter waited for a reply you know it was because he had been so lonesome that he had left his home in the dear old briarpatch on the green meadows and since he had been in the old pasture he had been almost as lonesome for he had had no one to talk to so now he waited eagerly for a reply you see he felt sure that the owner of such soft gentle eyes must have a soft gentle voice and a soft gentle heart and there was nothing in the world that peter needed just then so much as sympathy but though he waited and waited there wasnt a sound from the big fern  perhaps you dont know who i am im peter rabbit and ive come up here from the green meadows and id like very much to be your friend continued peter after a while still there was no sound peter peeped from the corner of one eye at the place where he had seen the two soft gentle eyes but there was nothing to be seen but the gently waving leaf of the big fern peter didnt know just what to do he wanted to hop over to the big fern and peep behind it but he didnt dare to he was afraid that whoever was hiding there would run away  im very lonesome wont you speak to me said peter in his gentlest voice and he sighed a deep doleful sort of sigh still there was no reply peter had just about made up his mind that he would go over to the big fern when he saw those two soft gentle eyes peeping from under a different leaf it seemed to peter that never in all his life had he seen such beautiful eyes they looked so shy and bashful that peter held his breath for fear that he would frighten them away  after a time the eyes disappeared then peter saw a little movement among the ferns and he knew that whoever was there was stealing away he wanted to follow but something down inside him warned him that it was best to sit still so peter sat just where he was and kept perfectly still for the longest time  but the eyes didnt appear again and at last he felt sure that whoever they belonged to had really gone away then he sighed another great sigh for suddenly he felt more lonesome than ever he hopped over to the big fern and looked behind it there in the soft earth was a footprint the footprint of a rabbit and it was smaller than his own it seemed to peter that it was the most wonderful little footprint he ever had seen  i believe said peter right out loud that ill change my mind i wont go back to the dear old briarpatch just yet after all     chapter xii  peter learns something feom tommy tit    when you find a friend in trouble    pass along a word of cheer  often it is very helpful    just to feel a friend is near                               peter rabbit  hello peter rabbit what are you doing way up here and what are you looking so mournful about  peter gave a great start of pleased surprise that was the first friendly voice he had heard for days and days  hello yourself tommy tit shouted peter joyously my my my but i am glad to see you but what are you doing up here in the old pasture yourself  tommy tit the chickadee hung head down from the tip of a slender branch of a mapletree and winked a saucy bright eye at peter ive got a secret up here he said  now there is nothing in the world peter rabbit loves more than a secret but he cannot keep one to save him no sir peter rabbit can no more keep a secret than he can fly he means to his intentions are the very best in the world but  alas alack poor peters tongue is very very loosely hung and so because he must talk and will talk every chance he gets he cannot keep a secret people who talk too much never can  what is your secret asked peter eagerly  tommy tit looked down at peter and his sharp little eyes twinkled its a nest with six of the dearest little babies in the world in it he replied  oh how lovely cried peter where is it tommy tit  in a hollow birchstub replied tommy his eyes twinkling more than ever  but where is the hollow birchstub persisted peter  tommy laughed thats my real secret said he and if i should tell you it wouldnt be a secret at all now tell me what you are doing up here in the old pasture peter rabbit  peter saw that it was of no use to tease tommy tit for his secret so instead he poured out all his own troubles he told how lonesome he had been in the dear old briarpatch on the green meadows because he didnt dare to go about for fear of old man coyote and how at last he had decided to visit the old pasture he told how hooty the owl had nearly caught him on his way and then how ever since his arrival he had been hunted by the big gray old rabbit so that he could neither eat nor sleep and had become so miserable that at last he had made up his mind to go back to the dear old briarpatch  ho interrupted tommy tit i know him hes old jed thumper the oldest biggest crossest rabbit anywhere around hes lived in the old pasture so long that he thinks he owns it its a wonder that he hasnt killed you  i guess perhaps he would have only i can run faster than he can replied peter looking a little shamefaced because he had to own up that he ran away instead of fighting  tommy tit laughed thats the very wisest thing you could have done said he but why dont you go back to the dear old briarpatch in the green meadows  peter hesitated and looked a wee bit foolish finally he told tommy tit all about the two soft gentle eyes he had seen peeping at him from behind a big fern and how he wanted to know who the eyes belonged to  if thats all you want to know i can tell you said tommy tit jumping out into the air to catch a foolish little bug who tried to fly past those eyes belong to little miss fuzzytail and shes the favorite daughter of old jed thumper you take my advice peter rabbit and trot along home to the old briarpatch before you get into any more trouble theres my wife calling yes my dear im coming chickadee deedee  and with a wink and a nod to peter rabbit off flew tommy tit     chapter xiii  little miss fuzzytail   foolish questions waste time but wise questions lead to knowledge                                           peter rabbit  little miss fuzzytail peter said it over and over again as he sat on the sunningbank in the far corner of the old pasture where tommy tit the chickadee had left him  its a pretty name said peter yes sir its a pretty name its the prettiest name ive ever heard i wonder if she is just as pretty iithink she must be yes i am quite sure she must be peter was thinking of the soft gentle eyes he had seen peeping at him from behind the big fern and of the dainty little footprint he had found there afterward so he sat on the sunningbank dreaming pleasant dreams and wondering if he could find little miss fuzzytail if he should go look for her  now all the time although peter didnt know it little miss fuzzytail was very close by she was right back in her old hidingplace behind the big fern shyly peeping out at him from under a great leaf where she was sure he wouldnt see her she saw the long tears in peters coat made by the cruel claws of hooty the owl and she saw the places where her father old jed thumper had pulled the hair out with his teeth she saw how thin and miserable peter looked and tears of pity filled the soft gentle eyes of little miss fuzzytail for you see she had a very tender heart  hes got a very nice face thought miss fuzzytail and he certainly was very polite and i do love good manners and peter is such a nice sounding name it sounds so honest and good and true poor fellow poor peter rabbit here little miss fuzzytail wiped her eyes he looks so miserable i do wish i could do something for him iioh dear i do believe he is coming right over here i guess i better be going how he limps  once more the tears filled her soft gentle eyes as she stole away making not the least little sound when she was sure she was far enough away to hurry without attracting peters attention she began to run  i saw him talking to my old friend tommy tit the chickadee and i just know that tommy will tell me all about him she thought as she scampered along certain private little paths of her own  just as she expected she found tommy tit and his anxious little wife phoebe very busy hunting for food for six hungry little babies snugly hidden in a hollow near the top of the old birchstub tommy was too busy to talk then so little miss fuzzytail sat down under a friendly bramblebush to rest and wait and while she waited she carefully washed her face and brushed her coat until it fairly shone you see not in all the old pasture or the green forest was there so slim and trim and neat and dainty a rabbit as little miss fuzzytail and she was very very particular about her appearance  by and by tommy tit stopped to rest he looked down at miss fuzzytail and winked a saucy black eye miss fuzzytail winked back then both laughed for they were very good friends indeed  tell me tommy tit all about peter rabbit commanded little miss fuzzytail and tommy did     chapter xiv  some one fools old jed thumper   you cannot judge a persons temper by his size there is more meanness in the head of a weasel than in the whole of a bear                                                  peter rabbit  old jed thumper sat in his bullbriar castle in the middle of the old pasture scowling fiercely and muttering to himself he was very angry was old jed thumper he was so angry that presently he stopped muttering and began to chew rapidly on nothing at all but his temper which is a way angry rabbits have  the more he chewed his temper the angrier he grew he was big and stout and strong and gray he had lived so long in the old pasture that he felt that it belonged to him and that no other rabbit had any right there unless he said so yet here was a strange rabbit who had had the impudence to come up from the green meadows and refused to be driven away such impudence  of course it was peter rabbit of whom old jed thumper was thinking it was two days since he had caught a glimpse of peter but he knew that peter was still in the old pasture for he had found fresh tracks each day that very morning he had visited his favorite feeding ground only to find peters tracks there it had made him so angry that he had lost his appetite and he had gone straight back to his bullbriar castle to think it over at last old jed thumper stopped chewing on his temper he scowled more fiercely than ever and stamped the ground impatiently  ill hunt that fellow till i kill him or drive him so far from the old pasture that hell never think of coming back i certainly will he said aloud and started forth to hunt  now it would have been better for the plans of old jed thumper if he had kept them to himself instead of speaking aloud two dainty little ears heard what he said and two soft gentle eyes watched him leave the bullbriar castle he started straight for the far corner of the old pasture where although he didnt know it peter rabbit had found a warm little sunningbank but he hadnt gone far when from way off in the opposite direction he heard a sound that made him stop short and prick up his long ears to listen there it was againthump thump he was just going to thump back an angry reply when he thought better of it  if do that thought he ill only warn him and hell run away just as he has before  so instead he turned and hurried in the direction from which the thumps had come taking the greatest care to make no noise every few jumps he would stop to listen twice more he heard those thumps and each time new rage filled his heart and for a minute or two he chewed his temper  hes down at my blueberrypatch he muttered  at last he reached the blueberrypatch very softly he crept to a place where he could see and not be seen no one was there no sir no one was there he waited and watched and there wasnt a hair of peter rabbit to be seen he was just getting ready to go look for peters tracks when he heard that thump thump again this time it came from his favorite cloverpatch where he never allowed even his favorite daughter little miss fuzzytail to go anger nearly choked him as he hurried in that direction but when he got there just as before no one was to be seen  so all the morning long old jed thumper hurried from one place to another and never once caught sight of peter rabbit can you guess why well the reason was that all the time peter was stretched out on his warm sunningbank getting the rest he so much needed it was some one else who was fooling old jed thumper     chapter xv  a pleasant surprise for peter    sticks will break and sticks will bend  and all things bad will have an end                                      peter rabbit  all morning while someone was fooling old jed thumper the cross old rabbit who thought he owned the old pasture peter rabbit lay stretched out on the warm little sunningbank dreaming of soft gentle eyes and beautiful little footprints it was a dangerous place to go to sleep because at any time fierce mr goshawk might have come that way and if he had and had found peter rabbit asleep why that would have been the end of peter and all the stories about him  peter did go to sleep you see the sunningbank was so warm and comfortable and he was so tired and had had so little sleep for such a long time that in spite of all he could do he nodded and nodded and finally slipped off into dreamland  peter slept a long time for no one came to disturb him it was past noon when he opened his eyes and blinked up at jolly round red mr sun for a minute he couldnt remember where he was when he did he sprang to his feet and hastily looked this way and that way  my gracious exclaimed peter my gracious what a careless fellow i am its a wonder that old jed thumper didnt find me asleep my but im hungry seems as if i hadnt had a good square meal for a year  peter stopped suddenly and began to wrinkle his nose umm said he if i didnt know better i should say that there is a patch of sweet clover close by umm my my am i really awake or am i still dreaming i certainly do smell sweet clover  slowly peter turned his head in the direction from which the delicious smell seemed to come then he whirled around and stared as hard as ever he could his mouth gaping wide open in surprise he blinked rubbed his eyes then blinked again there could be no doubt of it there on the edge of the sunningbank was a neat little pile of tender sweet clover yes sir there it was  peter walked all around it looking for all the world as if he couldnt believe that it was real finally he reached out and nibbled a leaf of it it was real  there was no doubt in peters mind then some one had put it there while peter was asleep and peter knew that it was meant for him who could it have been  suddenly a thought popped into peters head he stopped eating and hopped over to the big fern from behind which he had first seen the two soft gentle eyes peeping at him the day before there in the soft earth was a fresh footprint and it looked very very much like the footprint of dainty little miss fuzzytail  peters heart gave a happy little jump he felt sure now who had put the clover there he looked wistfully about among the ferns but she was nowhere to be seen finally he hopped back to the pile of clover and ate it every bit and it seemed to him that it was the sweetest tenderest clover he had ever tasted in all his life     chapter xvi  peter rabbits lookingglass    if people by their looks are judged    as judged theyre sure to be  why each should always look his best    im sure you will agree                                 peter rabbit  for the first time in his life peter rabbit had begun to think about his clothes always he had been such a happygolucky fellow that it never had entered his head to care how he looked he laughed at sammy jay for thinking so much of that beautiful blueandwhite coat he wears and he poked fun at reddy fox for bragging so much about his handsome suit as for himself peter didnt care how he looked if his coat was whole or in rags and tags it was all the same to peter but now peter sitting on the edge of his sunningbank in the far corner of the old pasture suddenly realized that he wanted to be goodlooking yes sir he wanted to be goodlooking he wished that he were bigger he wished that he were the biggest and strongest rabbit in the world he wished that he had a handsome coat and it was all because of the soft gentle eyes of little miss fuzzytail that he had seen peeping out at him so often he felt sure that it was little miss fuzzytail herself who had left the pile of sweet clover close by his sunningbank the other day while he was asleep  the fact is peter rabbit was falling in love yes sir peter rabbit was falling in love all he had seen of little miss fuzzytail were her soft gentle eyes for she was very shy and had kept out of sight but ever since he had first seen them he had thought and dreamed of nothing else until it seemed as if there were nothing in the world he wanted so much as to meet her perhaps he would have wanted this still more if he had known that it was she who had fooled her father old jed thumper the big gray old rabbit so that peter might have the long nap on the sunningbank he so needed  ive just got to meet her ive just got to said peter to himself and right then he began to wish that he were big and finelooking  my i must be a sight he thought i wonder how i do look anyway i must hunt up a lookingglass and find out  now when peter rabbit thinks of doing a thing he wastes very little time it was that way now he started at once for the bit of swamp where he had first seen the tracks of old jed thumper he still limped from the wounds made by hooty the owl but in spite of this he could travel pretty fast and it didnt take him long to reach the swamp  there just as he expected he found a lookingglass what was it like why it was just a tiny pool of water yes sir it was a quiet pool of water that reflected the ferns growing around it and the branches of the trees hanging over it and peter rabbit himself sitting on the edge of it that was peters lookingglass  for a long time he stared into it at last he gave a great sigh my but i am a sight he exclaimed  he was his coat was ragged and torn from the claws of hooty the owl and the teeth of old jed thumper the white patch on the seat of his trousers was stained and dirty from sitting down in the mud there were burrs tangled in his waistcoat he was thin and altogether a miserable looking rabbit  it must be that miss fuzzytail just pities me she certainly cant admire me muttered peter as he pulled out the burrs  for the next hour peter was very busy he washed and he brushed and he combed when at last he had done all that he could he took another look in his lookingglass and what he saw was a very different looking rabbit  though i am homely lank and lean  i can at least be neat and clean  said he as he started back for the sunningbank     chapter xvii  peter meets miss fuzzytail    that this is true theres no denying  theres nothing in the world like trying                                        peter rabbit  peter rabbit was feeling better certainly he was looking better you see just as soon as old mother nature saw that peter was trying to look as well as he could and was keeping himself as neat and tidy as he knew how she was ready to help as she always is she did her best with the rents in his coat made by the claws of hooty the owl and the teeth of old jed thumper and so it wasnt long before peters coat looked nearly as good as new then too peter was getting enough to eat these days days and days had passed since he had seen old jed thumper and this had given him time to eat and sleep  peter wondered what had become of old jed thumper perhaps something has happened to him thought peter ii almost hope something has then being ashamed of such a wish he added something not very dreadful but which will keep him from hunting me for a while and trying to drive me out of the old pasture  now all this time peter had been trying to find little miss fuzzytail he was already in love with her although all he had seen of her were her two soft gentle eyes shyly peeping at him from behind a big fern he had wandered here and sauntered there looking for her but although he found her footprints very often she always managed to keep out of his sight you see she knew the old pasture so much better than he did and all the little paths in it that she had very little trouble in keeping out of his way then too she was very busy for it was she who was keeping her cross father old jed thumper away from peter because she was so sorry for peter but peter didnt know this if he had i am afraid that he would have been more in love than ever  the harder she was to find the more peter wanted to find her he spent a great deal of time each day brushing his coat and making himself look as fine as he could and while he was doing it he kept wishing over and over again that something would happen so that he could show little miss fuzzytail what a smart brave fellow he really was  but one day followed another and peter seemed no nearer than ever to meeting little miss fuzzytail he was thinking of this one morning and was really growing very downhearted as he sat under a friendly bramblebush when suddenly there was a sharp little scream of fright from behind a little junipertree  somehow peter knew whose voice that was although he never had heard it before he sprang around the little junipertree and what he saw filled him with such rage that he didnt once stop to think of himself there was little miss fuzzytail in the clutches of black pussy farmer browns cat who often stole away from home to hunt in the old pasture like a flash peter sprang over black pussy and as he did so he kicked with all his might the cat hadnt seen him coming and the kick knocked her right into the prickly junipertree of course she lost her grip on little miss fuzzytail who hadnt been hurt so much as frightened  by the time the cat got out of the junipertree peter and miss fuzzytail were sitting side by side safe in the middle of a bullbriar patch  oh how brave you are sobbed little miss fuzzytail  and this is the way that peter rabbit at last got his hearts desire     chapter xviii  tommy tit proves a friend indeed   nothing in all the world is so precious as a true friend                                           peter rabbit  after peter rabbit had saved little miss fuzzytail from black pussy the cat who belonged way down at farmer browns house and had no business hunting in the old pasture he went with her as near to her home as she would let him she said that it wasnt necessary that he should go a single step but peter insisted that she needed him to see that no more harm came to her miss fuzzytail laughed at that for she felt quite able to take care of herself it had been just stupid carelessness on her part that had given black pussy the chance to catch her she said and she was very sure that she never would be so careless again what she didnt tell peter was that she had been so busy peeping at him and admiring him that she had quite forgotten to watch out for danger for herself  finally she said that he could go part way with her but when they were almost within sight of the bullbriar castle of her father old jed thumper the big gray rabbit who thought he owned the old pasture she made peter turn back you see she was afraid of what old jed thumper might do to peter andwell the truth is she was afraid of what he might do to her if he should find out that she had made friends with peter  so peter was forced to go back but he took with him a half promise that she would meet him the next night up near his sunningbank in the far corner of the old pasture  after that there were many pleasant days for peter rabbit sometimes little miss fuzzytail would meet him and sometimes she would shyly hide from him but somehow somewhere he managed to see her every day and so all the time in peters heart was a little song    the sky is blue the leaves are green    the golden sunbeams peep between    my heart is joyful as can be    and all the world looks bright to me  and then one day old jed thumper found out all about how his daughter little miss fuzzytail and peter rabbit had become such good friends old jed thumper went into a terrible rage he chewed and chewed with nothing in his mouth that is nothing but his temper the way an angry rabbit will he vowed and declared that if he never ate another mouthful he would drive peter rabbit from the old pasture  my my my those were bad days for peter rabbit yes sir those certainly were bad days old jed thumper had found out how little miss fuzzytail had been fooling him by making him think peter was in parts of the old pasture in quite the opposite direction from where he really was worse still he found peters favorite sunningbank in the far corner of the old pasture and would hide near it and try to catch peter every time peter tried to get a few minutes rest there he did something worse than that  one day he saw fierce mr goshawk hunting he let mr goshawk almost catch him and then ducked under a bramblebush then he showed himself again and once more escaped in the same way so he led fierce mr goshawk to a point where mr goshawk could look down and see peter rabbit stretched out on his sunningbank trying to get a little rest right away mr goshawk forgot all about old jed thumper and sailed up in the sky from where he could swoop down on peter while old jed thumper chuckling to himself wickedly hid where he could watch what would happen  that certainly would have been the last of peter rabbit if it hadnt been for tommy tit the chickadee tommy saw mr goshawk and just in time warned peter and so mr goshawk got only his claws full of soft earth for his pains while old jed thumper once more chewed on nothing in rage and disappointment dear me dear me those certainly were dreadful days for peter rabbit and little miss fuzzytail you see all the time little miss fuzzytail was terribly worried for fear peter would be caught  illustration with caption that night old man coyote started for the old pasture     chapter xix  old man coyote pays a debt    some little seeds of goodness    youll find in every heart  to sprout and keep on growing    when once they get a start                               peter rabbit  matters went from bad to worse with peter rabbit and little miss fuzzytail peter would have made up his mind to go back to his old home in the dear old briarpatch on the green meadows but he felt that he just couldnt leave little miss fuzzytail and little miss fuzzytail couldnt make up her mind to go with peter because she felt that she just couldnt leave the old pasture which always had been her home so peter spent his days and nights ready to jump and run from jed thumper the gray old rabbit who thought he owned the old pasture and who had declared that he would drive peter out  now peter as you know had an old friend in the old pasture tommy tit the chickadee one day tommy took it into his head to fly down to the green meadows there he found everybody wondering what had become of peter rabbit for you remember peter had stolen away from the dear old briarpatch in the night and had told no one where he was going  now one of the first to ask tommy tit if he had seen peter rabbit was old man coyote tommy told him where peter was and of the dreadful time peter was having old man coyote asked a lot of questions about the old pasture and thanked tommy very politely as tommy flew over to the smiling pool to call on grandfather frog and jerry muskrat  that night after jolly round red mr sun had gone to bed behind the purple hills and the black shadows had crept over the green meadows old man coyote started for the old pasture now he had never been there before but he had asked so many questions of tommy tit and he is so smart anyway that it didnt take him long to go all through the old pasture and to find the bullbriar castle of old jed thumper who was making life so miserable for peter rabbit he wasnt at home but old man coyotes wonderful nose soon found his tracks and he followed them swiftly without making a sound pretty soon he came to a bramblebush and under it he could see old jed thumper for just a minute he chuckled a noiseless chuckle to himself then he opened his mouth and out came that terrible sound which had so frightened all the little people on the green meadows when old man coyote had first come there to live  ha ha ha ho ho ho  hee hee hee ha ho hee ho  old jed thumper never had heard anything like that before it frightened him so that before he thought what he was doing he had jumped out from under the bramblebush of course this was just what old man coyote wanted in a flash he was after him and then began such a race as the old pasture never had seen before round and round this way and that way along the cow paths raced old jed thumper with old man coyote at his heels until at last out of breath so tired that it seemed to him he couldnt run another step frightened almost out of his senses old jed thumper reached his bullbriar castle and was safe  then old man coyote laughed his terrible laugh once more and trotted over to the tumbledown stonewall in which his keen nose told him peter rabbit was hiding  one good turn deserves another and i always pay my debts peter rabbit said he you did me a good turn some time ago down on the green meadows when you told me how granny and reddy fox were planning to make trouble for me by leading bowser the hound to the place where i took my daily nap and now we are even i dont think that old gray rabbit will dare to poke so much as his nose out of his bullbriar castle for a week now i am going back to the green meadows good night peter rabbit and dont forget that i always pay my debts  good night and thank you mr coyote said peter and then when old man coyote had gone he added to himself in a shamefaced way i didnt believe him when he said that he guessed we would be friends     chapter xx  little miss fuzzytail whispers yes    love is a beautiful wonderful thing    theres nothing quite like it on all the      green earth   tis love in the heart teaches birdies to sing    and gives the wide world all its joy and      its mirth                                         peter rabbit  peter rabbit was finding this out always he had been happy for happiness had been born in him but the happiness he had known before was nothing to the happiness that was his when he found that he loved little miss fuzzytail and that little miss fuzzytail loved him peter was sure that she did love him although she wouldnt say so but love doesnt need words and peter had seen it shining in the two soft gentle eyes of little miss fuzzytail so peter was happy in spite of the trouble that old led thumper the big gray rabbit who was the father of little miss fuzzytail had made for him in the old pasture  he had tried very hard very hard indeed to get little miss fuzzytail to go back with him to the dear old briarpatch on the green meadows but in spite of all he could say she couldnt make up her mind to leave the old pasture which you know had been her home ever since she was born and peter couldnt make up his mind to go back there and leave her becausewhy because he loved her so much that he felt that he could never never be happy without her then when old jed thumper was hunting peter so hard that he hardly had a chance to eat or sleep had come old man coyote the wolf and given old jed thumper such a fright that for a week he didnt dare poke so much as his nose out of his bull briar castle  now although old man coyote didnt know it his terrible voice had frightened little miss fuzzytail almost as much as it had old jed thumper you see she never had heard it before she didnt even know what it was and all that night she had crouched in her most secret hidingplace shivering and shaking with fright the next morning peter had found her there she hadnt slept a wink and she was still too frightened to even go look for her breakfast  oh peter rabbit did you hear that terrible noise last night she cried  what noise asked peter just as if he didnt know anything about it  why that terrible voice cried little miss fuzzytail and shivered at the thought of it  what was it like asked peter  oh i cant tell you said little miss fuzzy tall it wasnt like anything i ever had heard before it was something like the voice of hooty the owl and the voice of dippy the loon and the voice of a little yelping dog all in one and it was just terrible  oh replied peter you must mean the voice of my friend old man coyote he came up here last night just to do me a good turn because i once did him a good turn  then he told all about how old man coyote had come to the green meadows to live and how he was smarter than even old granny fox but he didnt tell her how he himself had once been frightened almost out of a years growth by that terrible voice or that it was because he hadnt really believed that old man coyote was his friend that had led him to leave the old briarpatch and come up to the old pasture  isis he fond of rabbits asked little miss fuzzytail  peter was quite sure that he was  and do you think hell come up here hunting again she asked  peter didnt know but he suspected that he would  oh dear wailed little miss fuzzytail now i never never will feel safe again  then peter had a happy thought i tell you what said he the safest place in the world for you and me is my dear old briarpatch wont you go there now  little miss fuzzytail sighed and dropped a tear or two then she nestled up close to peter yes she whispered     chapter xxi  peter and little miss fuzzytail leave the old pasture    a danger past is a danger past    so why not just forget it  watch out instead for the one ahead    until youve safely met it                                         peter rabbit  as soon as little miss fuzzytail had agreed to go with him to make her home in the dear old briarpatch down on the green meadows peter rabbit fairly boiled over with impatience to start he had had so much trouble in the old pasture that he was afraid if they waited too long little miss fuzzytail might change her mind and if she should do thatwell peter didnt know what he would do  but peter who always had been so happygolucky with no one to think about but himself now felt for the first time responsibility thats a big word but it is a word that everybody has to learn the meaning of sometime johnny chuck learned it when he made a home for polly chuck in farmer browns orchard and tried to keep it a secret so that no harm would come to polly it means taking care of other people or other peoples things and feeling that you must take even greater care than you would of yourself or your own things so while peter himself would have been willing to take chances and might even have made the journey down to the dear old briarpatch in broad daylight he felt that that wouldnt do at all for little miss fuzzytail that he must avoid every possible chance of danger for her  so peter waited for a dark night not too dark you know but a night when there was no moon to make great patches of light but only the kindly little stars looking down and twinkling in the friendly way they have at last there was just such a night all the afternoon little miss fuzzytail went about in the old pasture saying goodby to her friends and visiting each one of her favorite little paths and hidingplaces and i suspect that in each one she dropped a tear or two for you see she felt sure that she never would see them again although peter had promised that he would bring her back to the old pasture for a visit whenever she wanted to come  at last it was time to start peter led the way very big and brave and strong and important he felt and very timid and frightened felt little miss fuzzytail hopping after him close at his heels you see she felt that she was going out into the great world of which she knew nothing at all  oh peter she whispered supposing we should meet reddy fox i wouldnt know where to run or hide  we are not going to meet reddy fox replied peter but if we should all you have to do is to just keep your eyes on the white patch on the seat of my trousers and follow me i have fooled reddy so many times that im not afraid of him  never in all his life had peter been so watchful and careful that was because he felt his responsibility every few jumps he would stop to sit up and look and listen then little miss fuzzytail would nestle up close to him and peters heart would swell with happiness and he would feel oh so proud and important once they heard the sharp bark of reddy fox but it was a long way off and peter smiled for he knew that reddy was hunting on the edge of the green forest  once a dim shadow swept across the meadow grass ahead of them peter dropped flat in the grass and kept perfectly still and little miss fuzzytail did just as he did as she had promised she would  whawhat was it she whispered  i think it was hooty the owl peter whispered back but he didnt see us after what seemed like a long long time they heard hootys fierce hunting call but it came from way back of them on the edge of the old pasture peter hopped to his feet  come on said he theres nothing to fear from him now  so slowly and watchfully peter led the way down across the green meadows while the little stars looked down and twinkled in the most friendly way and just as jolly round red mr sun started to kick off his bedclothes behind the purple hills they reached the dear old briar patch  here we are cried peter  oh im so glad cried little miss fuzzytail hopping along one of peters private little paths     chapter xxii  sammy jay becomes curious   learn all you can about others but keep your own affairs to yourself                                                  peter rabbit  of course it was sammy jay who first found out that peter rabbit was back in the dear old briarpatch sammy took it into his head to fly over there the very morning of peters homecoming indeed little miss fuzzytail hadnt had time to half see the clear old briarpatch which you know was to be her new home when peter saw sammy jay coming now peter was not quite ready to have all the world know that there was a mrs peter for of course that was what little miss fuzzytail was now that she had come to make her home with peter they wanted to keep by themselves for a little while and just be happy with each other so as soon as peter saw sammy jay headed towards the old briarpatch he hid little miss fuzzytail under the thickest sweetbriar bush and then hurried out to the nearest sweetclover patch  of course sammy jay saw him right away and of course sammy was very much surprised  hello peter rabbit whered you come from he shouted as he settled himself comfortably in a little poplartree growing on the edge of the old briarpatch  oh said peter with a very grand air ive been on a long journey to see the great world  which means said sammy jay with a chuckle that youve been in the old pasture all this time and let me tell you peter rabbit the old pasture is a very small part of the great world by the way tommy tit the chickadee was down here the other day and told us all about you he said that you had fallen in love with little miss fuzzytail and he guessed that you were going to make your home up there whats the matter did her father old jed thumper drive you out  no he didnt snapped peter angrily its none of your business what i came home for sammy jay but ill tell you just the same i came home because i wanted to  sammy chuckled for he dearly loves to tease peter and make him angry then the imp of mischief who seems always to live just under that smart cap of sammys prompted him to ask did you come home alone  now peter couldnt say yes for that would be an untruth and whatever faults peter may have he is at least truthful so he just pretended not to have heard sammys question  now when sammy had asked the question he had thought nothing about it it had just popped into his head by way of something to say but sammy jay is sharp and he noticed right away that peter didnt answer but began to talk about other things  ha ha thought sammy to himself i believe he didnt come alone i wonder now if he brought miss fuzzytail with him  right away sammy began to peer down into the old briarpatch twisting and turning so that he could see in every direction and all the time talking as fast as his tongue could go two or three times he flew out over the old briarpatch pretending to try to catch moths but really so that he could look down into certain hidingplaces the last time that he did this he spied little mrs peter who was you know miss fuzzytail at once sammy jay started for the green forest screaming at the top of his voice  peter rabbits married peter rabbits married     chapter xxiii  peter introduces mrs peter      its what you do for others      not what they do for you    that makes you feel so happy      all through and through and through                             peter rabbit  peter rabbit made a wry face as he listened to sammy jay shrieking at the top of his voice as he flew through the green forest and over the green meadows peter rabbits married peter rabbits married he saw the merry little breezes who you know are the children of old mother west wind start for the dear old briarpatch as soon as they heard sammy jay and he knew that they would be only the first of a lot of visitors he hurried to where mrs peter was hiding under a sweet briar bush  do you hear what that mischiefmaker sammy jay is screaming asked peter  mrs peter nodded dontdont you think it sounds kind ofwell kind of nice peter she asked in a bashful sort of way  peter chuckled it sounds more than kind of nice to me said he do you know i used to think that sammy jay never did and never could say anything nice but ive just changed my mind though he isnt saying it to be nice it really is the nicest thing ive ever heard him say we havent been able to keep our secret so i think the very best thing we can do is to invite everybody to call then we can get it over with and have a little time to ourselves here come the merry little breezes and i know that they will be glad to take the invitations for us  mrs peter agreed for she thought that anything peter did or suggested was just about right so the merry little breezes were soon skipping and dancing over the green meadows and through the green forest with this message  mr and mrs peter rabbit will be at home in the old briarpatch to their friends tomorrow afternoon at shadowtime  why did you make it at shadowtime asked mrs peter  because that will give all our friends a chance to come replied peter those who sleep through the day will have waked up and those who sleep through the night will not have gone to bed besides it will be safer for some of the smallest of them if the black shadows are about for them to hide in on their way here  how thoughtful you are said little mrs peter with a little sigh of happiness  of course every one who could walk creep or fly headed for the old briarpatch the next day at shadowtime for almost every one knows and loves peter rabbit and of course every one was very anxious to meet mrs peter from the smiling pool came billy mink little joe otter jerry muskrat spotty the turtle and old grandfather frog from the green forest came bobby coon unc billy possum and mrs possum prickly porky the porcupine whitefoot the woodmouse happy jack the gray squirrel chatterer the red squirrel blacky the crow sammy jay ol mistah buzzard mistah mockingbird and stickytoes the treetoad from the green meadows came danny meadow mouse old mr toad digger the badger jimmy skunk and striped chipmunk who lives near the old stone wall between the edge of the green meadows and the green forest johnny and polly chuck came down from the old orchard and drummer the woodpecker came from the same place  of course old man coyote paid his respects and when he came everybody but prickly porky and digger the badger and jimmy skunk made way for him with great respect granny and reddy fox and hooty the owl didnt call but they sat where they could look on and make fun you see peter had fooled all three so many times that they felt none too friendly  very proud looked peter as he stood under a bramblebush with mrs peter by his side and introduced her to his many friends and very sweet and modest and retiring looked little mrs peter as she sat beside him everybody said that she was too sweet for anything and when reddy fox overheard that remark he grinned and said  not for me she cant be too sweet for me and i hope ill have a chance to find out just how sweet she is  what do you suppose he meant     chapter xxiv  danny meadow mouse warns peter rabbit   good advice is always needed  but alas is seldom heeded                                   peter rabbit   danny meadow mouse waited until all the rest of peter rabbits friends had left the old briarpatch after paying their respects to peter and mrs peter he waited for two reasons did danny meadow mouse in the first place he had seen old granny fox and reddy fox hanging about a little way off and though they had disappeared after a while danny had an idea that they were not far away but were hiding so that they might catch him on his way home of course he hadnt the slightest intention of giving them the chance he had made up his mind to ask peter if he might spend the night in a corner of the old briarpatch and he was very sure that peter would say he might for he and peter are very good friends very good friends indeed  the second good reason danny had for waiting was this very friendship you see peter had been away from the green meadows so long that danny felt sure he couldnt know all about how things were there now and so he wanted to warn peter that the green meadows were not nearly as safe as before old man coyote had come there to live so danny waited and when all the rest of the callers had left he called peter to one side where little mrs peter couldnt hear danny stood up on his hind legs so as to whisper in one of peters ears  do you know that old man coyote is the most dangerous enemy we have peter rabbit do you know that he asked  peter rabbit shook his head i dont believe that danny said he his terrible voice has frightened you so that you just think him as bad as he sounds why old man coyote is a friend of mine  then he told danny how old man coyote had done him a good turn in the old pasture in return for a good turn peter had once done him and how he said that he always paid his debts  danny meadow mouse looked doubtful what else did he say he demanded nothing excepting that we were even now replied peter  ha said danny meadow mouse  the way he said it made peter turn to look at him sharply  ha said danny again if you are even why you dont owe him anything and he doesnt owe you anything watch out peter rabbit watch out i would stick pretty close to the old briarpatch with mrs peter if i were you i would indeed you used to think old granny fox pretty smart but old man coyote is smarter yes sir he is smarter and every one of the rest of us has got to be smarter than ever before to keep out of his clutches watch out peter rabbit if you and old man coyote are even now if you dont mind ill curl up in my old hiding place for the night i really dont dare go back home tonight  of course peter told danny meadow mouse that he was welcome to spend the night in the old briarpatch and thanked danny for his warning as he bade him goodnight but peter never carries his troubles with him for long and by the time he had rejoined little mrs peter he was very much inclined to laugh at dannys fear  what did that funny little meadow mouse have to say asked mrs peter  peter told her and then added but i dont believe we have anything to fear from old man coyote you know he is my friend  but i dont know that he is mine replied little mrs peter and the way she said it made peter look at her anxiously i believe danny meadow mouse is right she continued oh peter you will watch out wont you  and peter promised her that he would     chapter xxv  peter rabbits heedlessness     heedlessness is just the twin    of thoughtlessness you know  and where you find them both at once    there troubles sure to grow                                    peter rabbit  peter rabbit didnt mean to be heedless no indeed oh my no peter thought so much of mrs peter he meant to be so thoughtful that she never would have a thing to worry about but peter was heedless he always was heedless this is the worst of a bad habityou can try to let go of it but it wont let go of you  so it was with peter he had been heedless so long that now he actually didnt know when he was heedless  when there was nobody but himself to think about and no one to worry about him his heedlessness didnt so much matter if anything had happened to him then there would have been no one to suffer but now all this was changed you see there was little mrs peter at first peter had been perfectly content to stay with her in the dear old briar patch he had led her through all his private little paths and they had planned where they would make two or three more he had showed her all his secret hidingplaces and the shortest way to the sweetclover patch he had pointed out where the lone little path came down to the edge of the green forest and so out on to the green meadows he had shown her where the crooked little path came down the hill little mrs peter had been delighted with everything and not once had she complained of being homesick for the old pasture  but after a little while peter began to get uneasy you see in the days before old man coyote had come to live on the green meadows peter had come and gone about as he pleased of course he had had to watch out for granny and reddy fox but he had had to watch out for them ever since he was a baby so he didnt fear them very much in spite of their smartness he felt quite as smart as they and perhaps a little bit smarter anyway they never had caught him and he didnt believe they ever would so he had come and gone as he pleased and poked his nose into everybodys business and gossiped with everybody  of course it was quite natural that peter should want to call on all his old friends and visit the green forest the old orchard the laughing brook and the smiling pool probably mrs peter wouldnt have worried very much if it hadnt been for the warning left by danny meadow mouse  danny had said that old man coyote was more to be feared than all the hawk family and all the fox family together because he was smarter and slyer than any of them at first peter had looked very serious but after danny had gone back to his own home peter had laughed at danny for being so afraid and he began to go farther and farther away from the safe old briarpatch  one day he had ventured as far as halfway up the crooked little path he was thinking so hard of a surprise he was planning for little mrs peter that he forgot to watch out and almost ran into old man coyote before he saw him there was a hungry look such a hungry look in old man coyotes eyes as he grinned and said good morning that peter didnt even stop to be polite he remembered that jimmy skunks old house was near and he reached it just one jump ahead of old man coyote  i thought you said that we were friends panted peter as he heard mr coyote sniffing at the doorway  so we were until i had paid my debt to you now that ive paid that we are even and it is everybody watch out for himself replied old man coyote but dont forget that i always pay my debts peter rabbit     chapter xxvi  peter rabbit listens to mrs peter   safety first is a wise rule for those who would live long                                    peter rabbit  peter rabbit was glad enough to get back to the dear old briarpatch after his narrow escape from old man coyote by dodging into jimmy skunks old house halfway up the hill and little mrs peter was glad enough to have him you may be sure she had been watching peter when he so heedlessly almost ran into old man coyote and it had seemed to her as if her heart stopped beating until peter reached the safety of that old house of jimmy skunk just one jump ahead then she saw old man coyote hide in the grass near by and she was terribly terribly afraid that peter would be heedless again and come out thinking that mr coyote had gone  poor little mrs peter she was so anxious that she couldnt sit still she felt that she just had to do something to warn peter she stole out from the dear old briarpatch and halfway to where old man coyote was hiding he was so busy watching the doorway of the old house where peter was hiding that he didnt notice her at all little mrs peter found a bunch of tall grass behind which she could sit up and still not be seen so there she sat without moving for a long long time never once taking her eyes from old man coyote and the doorway of the old house by and by she saw peter poke his nose out to see if the way was clear old man coyote saw him too and began to grin it was a hungry wickedlooking grin and it made little mrs peter very very angry indeed  she waited just a minute longer to make sure that peter was where he could see her and then she thumped the ground very hard which you know is the way rabbits signal to each other peter heard it right away and thumped back that he would stay right where he was though right down in his heart peter thought that little mrs peter was just nervous and foolish for he was sure that old man coyote had given up and gone away long ago  now of course old man coyote heard those thumps and he knew just what they meant he knew that he never never could catch peter so long as mrs peter was watching him and ready to warn peter so he came out of his hidingplace with an ugly snarl and sprang toward little mrs peter just to frighten her he laughed as he watched her run and all breathless dive into the dear old briarpatch and then he trotted away to his favorite nappingplace  as soon as peter was sure that he was safe he started for home and there little mrs peter scolded him soundly for being so heedless and thoughtless  peter didnt have a word to say for a long time he sat thinking and thinking every once in a while scratching his head as if puzzled little mrs peter noticed it  whats the matter with you peter she asked finally  im just studying what old man coyote means by telling me one day that he is my friend and proving it by doing me a good turn and then trying to catch me the very next time he sees me i dont understand it said peter shaking his head  oh you dear old stupid replied little mrs peter now you listen to me you did old man coyote a good turn and he paid you back by doing you a good turn that made you even didnt it  peter nodded  well then you are right back where you started from and old man coyote doesnt see any reason why he should treat you any differently than at first and i dont see why he should either when i come to think it over i tell you what peter the thing for you to do is to keep doing good turns to old man coyote so that he will always be in debt to you then he will always be your friend  as little mrs peter stopped speaking peter sprang to his feet the very thing he cried its sort of a golden rule and i do believe it will work  of course it will replied little mrs peter     chapter xxvii  mistah mocker plays a joke on mrs peter    this little point remember please  theres little gained by those who tease                               peter rabbit  mistah mocker the mockingbird had been very late in coming up to the green meadows from way down south the truth is he had almost decided not to come you see he loves the sunny southland so much and all who live there love him so much that if it hadnt been for unc billy possum and ol mistah buzzard he never never would have thought of leaving even for a little while unc billy and ol mistah buzzard are particular friends of his very particular friends and he felt that he just had to come up for a little visit  now mistah mocker reached the green meadows just after peter rabbit had brought little mrs peter down from the old pasture to live with him in the dear old briarpatch he knew that little mrs peter didnt know anything about him for he never had visited the old pasture where she had spent her life but he knew all the bird people who do live there for he had met them in the sunny southland where they spent the winter  i believe ill go pay my respects to mrs peter said mistah mocker one day winking at ol mistah buzzard ol mistah buzzard chuckled and winked back  ah certnly hopes yoall will behave yoself right proper and not forget that yo is a member of one of the oldest families in the souf said he  mistah mocker looked quite solemn as he promised to behave himself but there was a twinkle in his eyes as he flew toward the old briarpatch there he hid in a thick tangle of vines now it happened that peter rabbit had gone over to the sweetclover patch and little mrs peter was quite alone somehow she got to thinking of her old home and for the first time she began to feel just a wee wee bit homesick it was just then that she heard a familiar voice little mrs peter pricked up her ears and smiled happily  thats the voice of tommy tit the chickadee and it must be that his wife is with him for i hear him calling phoebe phoebe how lovely of them to come down to see me so soon  just then she heard another voice a deep beautiful ringing voice a voice that she loved it was the voice of veery the thrush oh cried little mrs peter and then held her breath so as not to miss one note of the beautiful song hardly had the song ended when she heard the familiar voice of redeye the vireo little mrs peter clapped her hands happily it must be a surprise party by my old friends and neighbors of the old pasture she cried how good of them to come way down here and how glad i shall be to see them  with that little mrs peter hurried over to the tangle of vines from which all the voices seemed to come and eagerly peered this way and that way for a sight of her friends but all she saw was a stranger wearing a very sobercolored suit he was very polite and told her that he was an old friend of peter rabbit  if you are a friend of peter then you are a friend of mine said little mrs peter very prettily have you seen anybody in this tangle of vines since you arrived i am sure some friends of mine are here but i havent been able to find them  no said the stranger who was of course mistah mocker the mockingbird i havent seen any one here and i dont think there has been any one here but myself  oh yes indeed there has cried little mrs peter i heard their voices and i couldnt possibly be mistaken in those especially the beautiful voice of veery the thrush ii would like very much to find them  mistah mocker had the grace to look ashamed of himself when saw how disappointed little mrs peter was very softly he began to sing the song of veery the thrush  little mrs peter looked up quickly there it is she cried there she stopped with her mouth gaping wide open she suddenly realized that it was mistah mocker who was singing  iim very sorry he stammered i did it just for a joke and not to make you feel bad will you forgive me  yes replied little mrs peter if you will come here often at shadowtime and sing to me and mistah mocker promised that he would     chapter xxviii  news from the old briarpatch    to use your eyes is very wise    and much to be commended  but never see what cannot be    for such as you intended                            peter rabbit  jenny wren is a busybody yes sir she certainly is a busybody if there is anything going on in her neighborhood that she doesnt know about it isnt because she doesnt try to find out she is so small and spry that it is hard work to keep track of her and she pops out at the most unexpected times and places then before you can say a word she is gone  and in all the old orchard or on the green meadows there is not to be found another tongue so busy as that of jenny wren it is sharp sometimes but when she wants it to be so there is none smoother you see she is a great gossip is jenny wren a great gossip but if you get on the right side of jenny wren and ask her to keep a secret shell do it no one knows how to keep a secret better than she does  how it happened nobody knows but it did happen that when peter rabbit came home to the clear old briarpatch bringing mrs peter with him jenny wren didnt hear about it probably it was because the new home which she had just completed was so carefully hidden that the messengers sent by peter to invite all his friends to call didnt find it and afterward she was so busy with household affairs that she didnt have time to gossip anyway peter had been back some time before jenny wren knew it she was quite upset to think that she was the last to hear the news but she consoled herself with the thought that she had been attending strictly to her duties and now that her children were able to look out for themselves she could make up for lost time  just as soon as she could get away she started for the old briarpatch she wanted to hear all about peters adventures in the old pasture and to meet mrs peter but like a great many other busybodies she wanted to find out all she could about peters affairs and she thought that the surest way to do it was not to let peter know that she was about until she had had a chance to use her sharp little eyes all she wanted to so when she reached the old briarpatch she didnt make a sound it didnt take her long to find peter he was sitting under one of his favorite bramblebushes smiling to himself he smiled and smiled until jenny wren had to bite her tongue to keep from asking what was pleasing him so  illustration with caption the quickest way for me to know is for you to tell me replied jimmy  he looks tickled almost to death over something but very likely if i should ask him what it is he wouldnt tell me thought jenny wren i guess ill look around a bit first i wonder where mrs peter is  so leaving peter to smile to his hearts content she went peeking and peering through the old briarpatch of course it wasnt a nice thing to do not a bit nice but jenny wren didnt stop to think of that by and by she saw something that made her flutter all over with excitement she looked and looked until she could sit still no longer then she hurried back to where peter was sitting he was still smiling  oh peter rabbit its perfectly lovely she cried  peter looked up quickly and a worried look chased the smile away hello jenny wren where did you come from i havent seen you since i got back said he  ive been so busy that i havent had time to call before replied jenny i know what youve been smiling about peter and its perfectly splendid has everybody heard the news  no said peter nobody knows it but you and i dont want anybody else to know it just yet will you keep it a secret jenny wren  now jenny was just bursting with desire to spread the news but peter looked so anxious that finally she promised that she would keep it to herself and she really meant to but though peter looked greatly relieved as he watched her start for home he didnt smile as he had before i wish her tongue didnt wag so much said he     chapter xxix  jimmy skunk visits peter rabbit    its hard to keep a secret which you fairly ache to tell  so not to know such secrets is often quite as well                                         peter rabbit  on her way home from the old briarpatch jenny wren stopped to rest in a bush beside the crooked little path that comes down the hill when who should come along but jimmy skunk now just as usual jenny wren was fidgeting and fussing about and jimmy skunk grinned as he watched her  hello jenny wren said he what are you doing here  im resting on my way home from the old briarpatch if you must know jimmy skunk replied jenny wren changing her position half a dozen times while she was speaking  ho ho ho laughed jimmy skunk do you call that resting thats a joke jenny wren resting why you couldnt sit still and rest if you tried  i could so im resting right now so there jimmy skunk protested jenny wren in a very indignant tone of voice and hopped all over the little bush while she was speaking i guess if you knew what i know youd be excited too  well i guess the quickest way for me to know is for you to tell me replied jimmy im just aching to be excited  jimmy grinned for you know jimmy skunk never does get excited and never hurries no matter what happens  youll have to keep right on aching then replied jenny wren with a saucy flirt of her funny little tail theres great news in the old briarpatch and im the only one that knows it but ive promised not to tell  jimmy pricked up his ears news in the old briarpatch must have something to do with peter rabbit said he what has peter done now  ill never tell ill never tell cried jenny wren growing so excited that it seemed to jimmy as if there was danger that she would turn herself inside out i promised not to and i never will then for fear that she would in spite of herself she flew on her way home  jimmy watched her out of sight with a puzzled frown if i didnt know that she gets so terribly excited over nothing id think that there really is some news in the old briarpatch he muttered to himself anyway i havent anything better to do so i believe ill drop around that way and make peter rabbit a call  he found peter in some sweet clover just outside the old briarpatch and it struck jimmy that peter looked uncommonly happy he said as much  i am replied peter before he thought then he added hastily you see ive been uncommonly happy ever since i returned with mrs peter from the old pasture  but i hear theres great news over here in the old briarpatch persisted jimmy skunk what is it peter  peter pretended to be very much surprised great news he repeated great news why what news can there be over here who told you that  a little bird told me replied jimmy slyly  it must have been jenny wren said peter once more speaking before he thought  then there is news over here cried jimmy triumphantly what is it peter  but peter shook his head as if he hadnt the slightest idea and couldnt imagine jimmy coaxed and teased but all in vain finally he started for home no wiser than before  just the same i believe that jenny wren told the truth and that there is news over in the old briarpatch he muttered to himself something has happened over there and peter wont tell i wonder what it can be     chapter xxx  reddy fox learns the secret    nothing that you ever do    nothing good or nothing bad  but has effect on other folks    gives them pain or makes them glad                                   peter rabbit  of course jenny wren didnt mean to tell the secret of the old briar patch because she had promised peter rabbit that she wouldnt but she didnt see any harm in telling every one she met that there was a secret there at least that there was great news there and so because jenny wren is a great gossip it wasnt long before all the little people on the green meadows and in the green forest and around the smiling pool had heard it and were wondering what the news could be  after jimmy skunks visit came a whole string of visitors to the old briarpatch one would hardly have left before another would appear each one tried to act as if he had just happened around that way and didnt want to pass peters home without making a call but each one asked so many questions that peter knew what had really brought him there was the desire to find out what the news in the old briarpatch could be but peter was too smart for them and they all went away no wiser than they came that is all but one and that one was reddy fox  there isnt much going on in the green forest or on the green meadows that reddy doesnt know about he is sly is reddy fox and his eyes are sharp and his ears are keen so little happens that he doesnt see or hear about of course he heard the foolish gossip of jenny wren and he pricked up his ears  so theres news down in the old briarpatch is there a secret that jenny wren wont tell i think ill trot down there and make peter a call of course hell be glad to see me  reddy grinned wickedly as he said this to himself for he knew that there was no one for whom peter rabbit had less love unless it was old granny fox  so reddy trotted down to the old briarpatch peter saw him coming and scowled for he guessed right away what reddy was coming for and he made ready to answer all reddys questions and still tell him nothing as he had with all the others who had called  but reddy asked no questions he didnt once mention the fact that he had heard there was news in the old briarpatch he didnt once speak of jenny wren he just talked about the weather and the old pasture where peter had made such a long visit and all the time was as pleasant and polite as if he and peter were the dearest of friends  but while he was talking reddy was using those sharp eyes and those keen ears of his the best he knew how but the old briarpatch was very thick and he could see only a little way into it and out of it came no sound to hint of a secret there then reddy began to walk around the old briarpatch in quite the most matteroffact way but as he walked that wonderful nose of his was testing every little breath of air that came out of the old briarpatch at last he reached a certain place where a little stronger breath of air tickled his nose he stopped for a few minutes and slowly a smile grew and grew then without saying a word he turned and trotted back towards the green forest  peter rabbit watched him go then he joined mrs peter in the heart of the old briarpatch my dear he said with a sigh that was almost a sob reddy fox has found out our secret  never mind said little mrs peter brightly it would have to be found out soon anyway  trotting back up the lone little path reddy fox was grinning broadly it is news said he jenny wren was right it is news but i dont believe anybody else knows it yet and i hope they wont find it out right away least of all old man coyote what a wonderful thing a good nose is it tells me what my eyes cannot see nor my ears hear     chapter xxxi  blacky the crow has sharp eyes    mischief always waits to greet  idle hands and idle feet                               peter rabbit  that is what a lot of people say about blacky the crow of course it is true that blacky does get into a lot of mischief but if people really knew him they would find that he isnt as black as he looks in fact blacky the crow does a whole lot of good in his own peculiar way but people are always looking for him to do bad things and you know you most always see what you expect to see thus the good blacky does isnt seen while the bad is and so he has grown to have a reputation blacker than the coat he wears  but this doesnt worry blacky the crow no sir it doesnt worry him a bit you see he has grown used to it and then he is so smart that he is never afraid of being caught when he does do wrong things no one has sharper eyes than blacky and no one knows better how to use them there is very little going on in the green forest or on the green meadows that he misses when he is about  the day after reddy fox visited the old briarpatch and with his wonderful nose found out peter rabbits secret blacky just happened to fly over the old briarpatch on his way to farmer browns cornfield now being over the old briarpatch he could look right down into it and see all through it just as he reached it he remembered having heard sammy jay say something about gossipy little jenny wrens having said that there was great news there he hadnt thought much about it at the time but now that he was right there he might as well have a look for himself and see if there was any truth in it  so blacky the crow flew a little lower and his sharp eyes looked this way and that way through all the bramblebushes of the old briarpatch he saw peter rabbit right away and winked at him he thought peter looked worried and anxious  peter must have something on his mind thought blacky i wonder where mrs peter is  just then he caught sight of her under the thickest growing sweetbriar bush he had opened his mouth to shout hello mrs peter when he saw something that surprised him so that he didnt speak at all he almost forgot to flap his wings to keep himself in the air he hovered right where he was for a few minutes looking down through the brambles then with a hoarse chuckle he started for the smiling pool forgetting all about farmer browns cornfield caw caw caw he shrieked peter rabbits got a family peter rabbits got a family  reddy fox heard him and ground his teeth now old man coyote will know and will try to catch those young rabbits when they ought to be mine because i found out about them first he grumbled  jimmy skunk heard blacky and grinned broadly so thats the great news jenny wren found out said he i hope peter will take better care of his babies than he ever has of himself i must call at once  redtail the hawk heard and he smiled too but it wasnt a kindly smile like jimmy skunks i think young rabbit will taste very good for a change said he     chapter xxxii  peter rabbits nursery    with home the home you call your own    it really doesnt matter where  there is no place in all the world    that ever will or can compare                                 peter rabbit  the news was out at last thanks to blacky the crow peter rabbit had a family yes sir peter rabbit had a family right away the old briar patch became the most interesting place on the green meadows to all the little people who live there and in the nearby green forest of course all of peters friends called as soon as ever they could they found peter looking very proud and very important and very happy mrs peter looked just as proud and just as happy but she also looked very anxious you see while she was very glad to have so many friends call there were also other visitors that is they were not exactly callers but they hung around the outside of the old briarpatch and they seemed quite as much interested as the friends who really called indeed they seemed more interested  who were they why reddy fox was one then there was old man coyote also redtail the hawk and digger the badger and just at dusk hooty the owl they all seemed very much interested indeed but every time little mrs peter saw them she shivered you see she couldnt help thinking that there was a dreadful hungry look in their eyes and if the truth is to be told there probably was  but happygolucky peter rabbit didnt let this worry him hadnt he grown up from a teenyweeny baby and been smart enough to escape all these dangers which worried mrs peter so and if he could do it of course his own babies could do it with him to teach them and show them how besides they were too little to go outside of the old briarpatch now indeed they were too little to go outside their nursery which was in a clump of sweetbriar bushes in the very middle of the old briar patch and peter felt that there they were perfectly safe  it isnt time to worry yet said peter to little mrs peter as he saw the fright in her eyes as the shadow of redtail passed over them i dont believe in borrowing trouble time enough to worry when there is something to worry about and that wont be until these little scallawags of ours are big enough to run around and get into mischief did you ever see such beautiful babies in all your life  for a minute the worried look left little mrs peter and she gazed at the four little helpless babies fondly no she replied softly i never did oh peter they are perfectly lovely this one is the perfect image of you and im going to call him little pete and dont you think his brother looks like his grandfather i think well call him little jed  peter coughed behind his hand as if something had stuck in his throat he had no love for little jeds grandfather old jed thumper the big gray old rabbit who had tried so hard to drive him from the old pasture but he didnt say anything if mrs peter wanted to name this one little jed he wouldnt say a word aloud he said  i think my dear that this one looks just as you must have looked when you were little and so well call her fuzzy and her sister well call wuzzy continued peter was ever there such a splendid nursery for baby rabbits  i dont believe there ever was peter its better than my old nursery in the old pasture replied little mrs peter as with a sigh of perfect happiness she stretched out beside their four babies  and peter softly tiptoed away to the nearest sweetclover patch with his heart almost bursting with pride  of the doings of peter and mrs peter rabbit and their four children there are many more stories so many that one book will not hold all of them besides bowser the hound insists that i must write a book about him and i have promised to do it right away so the next book will be bowser the hound
