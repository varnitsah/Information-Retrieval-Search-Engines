6646356	twice told tales                        the prophetic pictures                        by nathaniel hawthorne   this story was suggested by an anecdote of stuart related in dunlaps history of the arts of designa most entertaining book to the general reader and a deeply interesting one we should think to the artist   but this painter cried walter ludlow with animation  he not only excels in his peculiar art but possesses vast acquirements in all other learning and science  he talks hebrew with dr mather and gives lectures in anatomy to dr boylston  in a word he will meet the best instructed man among us on his own ground  moreover he is a polished gentlemana citizen of the worldyes a true cosmopolite for he will speak like a native of each clime and country on the globe except our own forests whither he is now going  nor is all this what i most admire in him  indeed said elinor who had listened with a womans interest to the description of such a man  yet this is admirable enough  surely it is replied her lover but far less so than his natural gift of adapting himself to every variety of character insomuch that all menand all women too elinorshall find a mirror of themselves in this wonderful painter  but the greatest wonder is yet to be told  nay if he have more wonderful attributes than these said elinor laughing boston is a perilous abode for the poor gentleman  are you telling one of a painter or a wizard  in truth answered he that question might be asked much more seriously than you suppose  they say that he paints not merely a mans features but his mind and heart  he catches the secret sentiments and passions and throws them upon the canvas like sunshineor perhaps in the portraits of darksouled men like a gleans of infernal fire  it is an awful gift added walter lowering his voice from its tone of enthusiasm  i shall be almost afraid to sit to him  walter are you in earnest exclaimed elinor  for heavens sake dearest elinor do not let him paint the look which you now wear said her lover smiling though rather perplexed  there it is passing away now but when you spoke you seemed frightened to death and very sad besides  what were you thinking of  nothing nothing answered elinor hastily  you paint my face with your own fantasies  well come for me tomorrow and we will visit this wonderful artist  but when the young man had departed it cannot be denied that a remarkable expression was again visible on the fair and youthful face of his mistress  it was a sad and anxious look little in accordance with what should have been the feelings of a maiden on the eve of wedlock yet walter ludlow was the chosen of her heart  a look said elinor to herself  no wonder that it startled him if it expressed what i sometimes feel  i know by my own experience how frightful a look may be  but it was all fancy  i thought nothing of it at the timei have seen nothing of it sincei did but dream it  and she busied herself about the embroidery of a ruff in which she meant that her portrait should be taken  the painter of whom they had been speaking was not one of those native artists who at a later period than this borrowed their colors from the indians and manufactured their pencils of the furs of wild beasts perhaps if he could have revoked his life and prearranged his destiny he might have chosen to belong to that school without a master in the hope of being at least original since there were no works of art to imitate nor rules to follow  but he had been born and educated in europe  people said that he had studied the grandeur or beauty of conception and every touch of the master hand in all the most famous pictures in cabinets and galleries and on the walls of churches till there was nothing more for his powerful mind to learn  art could add nothing to its lessons but nature might he had therefore visited a world whither none of his professional brethren had preceded him to feast his eyes on visible images that were noble and picturesque yet had never been transferred to canvas  america was too poor to afford other temptations to an artist of eminence though many of the colonial gentry on the painters arrival had expressed a wish to transmit their lineaments to posterity by means of his skill  whenever such proposals were made he fixed his piercing eyes on the applicant and seemed to look him through and through  if he beheld only a sleek and comfortable visage though there were a goldlaced coat to adorn the picture and golden guineas to pay for it he civilly rejected the task and the reward  but if the face were the index of anything uncommon in thought sentiment or experience or if he met a beggar in the street with a white beard and a furrowed brow or if sometimes a child happened to look up and smile he would exhaust all the art on them that he denied to wealth  pictorial skill being so rare in the colonies the painter became an object of general curiosity  if few or none could appreciate the technical merit of his productions yet there were points in regard to which the opinion of the crowd was as valuable as the refined judgment of the amateur  he watched the effect that each picture produced on such untutored beholders and derived profit from their remarks while they would as soon have thought of instructing nature herself as him who seemed to rival her  their admiration it must be owned was tinctured with the prejudices of the age and country  some deemed it an offence against the mosaic law and even a presumptuous mockery of the creator to bring into existence such lively images of his creatures  others frightened at the art which could raise phantoms at will and keep the form of the dead among the living were inclined to consider the painter as a magician or perhaps the famous black man of old witch times plotting mischief in a new guise  these foolish fancies were more than half believed among the mob  even in superior circles his character was invested with a vague awe partly rising like smokewreaths from the popular superstitious but chiefly caused by the varied knowledge and talents which he made subservient to his profession  being on the eve of marriage walter ludlow and elinor were eager to obtain their portraits as the first of what they doubtless hoped would be a long series of family pictures  the day after the conversation above recorded they visited the painters rooms  a servant ushered them into an apartment where though the artist himself was not visible there were personages whom they could hardly forbear greeting with reverence  they knew indeed that the whole assembly were but pictures yet felt it impossible to separate the idea of life and intellect from such striking counterfeits  several of the portraits were known to them either as distinguished characters of the day or their private acquaintances  there was governor burnett looking as if he had just received an undutiful communication from the house of representatives and were inditing a most sharp response  mr cooke hung beside the ruler whom he opposed sturdy and somewhat puritanical as befitted a popular leader  the ancient lady of sir william phipps eyed them from the wall in ruff and farthingale an imperious old dame not unsuspected of witchcraft  john winslow then a very young man wore the expression of warlike enterprise which long afterwards made him a distinguished general  their personal friends were recognized at a glance  in most of the pictures the whole mind and character were brought out on the countenance and concentrated into a single look so that to speak paradoxically the originals hardly resembled themselves so strikingly as the portraits did  among these modern worthies there were two old bearded saints who had almost vanished into the darkening canvas  there was also a pale but unfaded madonna who had perhaps been worshipped in rome and now regarded the lovers with such a mild and holy look that they longed to worship too  how singular a thought observed walter ludlow that this beautiful face has been beautiful for above two hundred years  o if all beauty would endure so well  do you not envy her elinor  if earth were heaven i might she replied  but where all things fade how miserable to be the one that could not fade  this dark old st peter has a fierce and ugly scowl saint though he be continued walter  he troubles me  but the virgin looks kindly at us  yes but very sorrowfully methinks said elinor  the easel stood beneath these three old pictures sustaining one that had been recently commenced  after a little inspection they began to recognize the features of their own minister the rev dr colman growing into shape and life as it were out of a cloud  kind old man exclaimed elinor  he gazes at me as if he were about to utter a word of paternal advice  and at me said walter as if he were about to shake his head and rebuke me for some suspected iniquity  but so does the original  i shall never feel quite comfortable under his eye till we stand before him to be married  they now heard a footstep on the floor and turning beheld the painter who had been some moments in the room and had listened to a few of their remarks  he was a middleaged man with a countenance well worthy of his own pencil  indeed by the picturesque though careless arrangement of his rich dress and perhaps because his soul dwelt always among painted shapes he looked somewhat like a portrait himself  his visitors were sensible of a kindred between the artist and his works and felt as if one of the pictures had stepped from the canvas to salute them  walter ludlow who was slightly known to the painter explained the object of their visit  while he spoke a sunbeam was falling athwart his figure and elinors with so happy an effect that they also seemed living pictures of youth and beauty gladdened by bright fortune  the artist was evidently struck  my easel is occupied for several ensuing days and my stay in boston must be brief said he thoughtfully then after an observant glance he added but your wishes shall be gratified though i disappoint the chief justice and madam oliver  i must not lose this opportunity for the sake of painting a few ells of broadcloth and brocade  the painter expressed a desire to introduce both their portraits into one picture and represent them engaged in some appropriate action  this plan would have delighted the lovers but was necessarily rejected because so large a space of canvas would have been unfit for the room which it was intended to decorate  two halflength portraits were therefore fixed upon  after they had taken leave walter ludlow asked elinor with a smile whether she knew what an influence over their fates the painter was about to acquire  the old women of boston affirm continued he that after he has once got possession of a persons face and figure he may paint him in any act or situation whateverand the picture will be prophetic  do you believe it  not quite said elinor smiling  yet if he has such magic there is something so gentle in his manner that i am sure he will use it well  it was the painters choice to proceed with both the portraits at the same time assigning as a reason in the mystical language which he sometimes used that the faces threw light upon each other  accordingly he gave now a touch to walter and now to elinor and the features of one and the other began to start forth so vividly that it appeared as if his triumphant art would actually disengage them from the canvas  amid the rich light and deep shade they beheld their phantom selves  but though the likeness promised to be perfect they were not quite satisfied with the expression it seemed more vague than in most of the painters works he however was satisfied with the prospect of success and being much interested in the lovers employed his leisure moments unknown to them in making a crayon sketch of their two figures  during their sittings he engaged them in conversation and kindled up their faces with characteristic traits which though continually varying it was his purpose to combine and fix  at length he announced that at their next visit both the portraits would be ready for delivery  if my pencil will but be true to my conception in the few last touches which i meditate observed he these two pictures will be my very best performances  seldom indeed has an artist such subjects  while speaking he still bent his penetrative eye upon them nor withdrew it till they had reached the bottom of the stairs  nothing in the whole circle of human vanities takes stronger hold of the imagination than this affair of having a portrait painted  yet why should it be so  the lookingglass the polished globes of the andirons the mirrorlike water and all other reflecting surfaces continually present us with portraits or rather ghosts of ourselves which we glance at and straightway forget them  but we forget them only because they vanish  it is the idea of durationof earthly immortalitythat gives such a mysterious interest to our own portraits  walter and elinor were not insensible to this feeling and hastened to the painters room punctually at the appointed hour to meet those pictured shapes which were to be their representatives with posterity  the sunshine flashed after them into the apartment but left it somewhat gloomy as they closed the door  their eyes were immediately attracted to their portraits which rested against the farthest wall of the room  at the first glance through the dim light and the distance seeing themselves in precisely their natural attitudes and with all the air that they recognized so well they uttered a simultaneous exclamation of delight  there we stand cried walter enthusiastically fixed in sunshine forever  no dark passions can gather on our faces  no said elinor more calmly no dreary change can sadden us  this was said while they were approaching and had yet gained only an imperfect view of the pictures  the painter after saluting them busied himself at a table in completing a crayon sketch leaving his visitors to form their own judgment as to his perfected labors  at intervals he sent a glance from beneath his deep eyebrows watching their countenances in profile with his pencil suspended over the sketch  they had now stood some moments each in front of the others picture contemplating it with entranced attention but without uttering a word  at length walter stepped forwardthen backviewing elinors portrait in various lights and finally spoke  is there not a change said he in a doubtful and meditative tone yes the perception of it grows more vivid the longer i look  it is certainly the same picture that i saw yesterday the dressthe featuresall are the same and yet something is altered  is then the picture less like than it was yesterday inquired the painter now drawing near with irrepressible interest  the features are perfect elinor answered walter and at the first glance the expression seemed also hers  but i could fancy that the portrait has changed countenance while i have been looking at it  the eyes are fixed on mine with a strangely sad and anxious expression  nay it is grief and terror  is this like elinor  compare the living face with the pictured one said the painter  walter glanced sidelong at his mistress and started  motionless and absorbedfascinated as it werein contemplation of walters portrait elinors face had assumed precisely the expression of which he had just been complaining  had she practised for whole hours before a mirror she could not have caught the look so successfully  had the picture itself been a mirror it could not have thrown back her present aspect with stronger and more melancholy truth  she appeared quite unconscious of the dialogue between the artist and her lover  elinor exclaimed walter in amazement what change has come over you  she did not hear him nor desist from her fixed gaze till he seized her hand and thus attracted her notice then with a sudden tremor she looked from the picture to the face of the original  do you see no change in your portrait asked she  in minenone replied walter examining it  but let me see  yes there is a slight changean improvement i think in the picture though none in the likeness  it has a livelier expression than yesterday as if some bright thought were flashing from the eyes and about to be uttered from the lips  now that i have caught the look it becomes very decided  while he was intent on these observations elinor turned to the painter she regarded him with grief and awe and felt that he repaid her with sympathy and commiseration though wherefore she could but vaguely guess  that look whispered she and shuddered  how came it there  madam said the painter sadly taking her hand and leading her apart in both these pictures i have painted what i saw  the artistthe true artistmust look beneath the exterior  it is his gifthis proudest but often a melancholy oneto see the inmost soul and by a power indefinable even to himself to make it glow or darken upon the canvas in glances that express the thought and sentiment of years  would that i might convince myself of error in the present instance  they had now approached the table on which were heads in chalk hands almost as expressive as ordinary faces ivied churchtowers thatched cottages old thunderstricken trees oriental and antique costume and all such picturesque vagaries of an artists idle moments  turning them over with seeming carelessness a crayon sketch of two figures was disclosed  if i have failed continued he if your heart does not see itself reflected in your own portrait if you have no secret cause to trust my delineation of the other it is not yet too late to alter them  i might change the action of these figures too  but would it influence the event  he directed her notice to the sketch  a thrill ran through elinors frame a shriek was upon her lips but she stifled it with the selfcommand that becomes habitual to all who hide thoughts of fear and anguish within their bosoms  turning from the table she perceived that walter had advanced near enough to have seen the sketch though she could not determine whether it had caught his eye  we will not have the pictures altered said she hastily  if mine is sad i shall but look the gayer for the contrast  be it so answered the painter bowing  may your griefs be such fanciful ones that only your picture may mourn for them  for your joysmay they be true and deep and paint themselves upon this lovely face till it quite belie my art  after the marriage of walter and elinor the pictures formed the two most splendid ornaments of their abode  they hung side by side separated by a narrow panel appearing to eye each other constantly yet always returning the gaze of the spectator  travelled gentlemen who professed a knowledge of such subjects reckoned these among the most admirable specimens of modern portraiture while common observers compared them with the originals feature by feature and were rapturous in praise of the likeness  but it was on a third classneither travelled connoisseurs nor common observers but people of natural sensibilitythat the pictures wrought their strongest effect  such persons might gaze carelessly at first but becoming interested would return day after day and study these painted faces like the pages of a mystic volume  walter ludlows portrait attracted their earliest notice  in the absence of himself and his bride they sometimes disputed as to the expression which the painter had intended to throw upon the features all agreeing that there was a look of earnest import though no two explained it alike  there was less diversity of opinion in regard to elinors picture  they differed indeed in their attempts to estimate the nature and depth of the gloom that dwelt upon her face but agreed that it was gloom and alien from the natural temperament of their youthful friend a certain fanciful person announced as the result of much scrutiny that both these pictures were parts of one design and that the melancholy strength of feeling in elinors countenance bore reference to the more vivid emotion or as he termed it the wild passion in that of walter though unskilled in the art he even began a sketch in which the action of the two figures was to correspond with their mutual expression  it was whispered among friends that day by day elinors face was assuming a deeper shade of pensiveness which threatened soon to render her too true a counterpart of her melancholy picture  walter on the other hand instead of acquiring the vivid look which the painter had given him on the canvas became reserved and downcast with no outward flashes of emotion however it might be smouldering within  in course of time elinor hung a gorgeous curtain of purple silk wrought with flowers and fringed with heavy golden tassels before the pictures under pretence that the dust would tarnish their lines or the light din them  it was enough  her visitors felt that the massive folds of the silk must never be withdrawn nor the portraits mentioned in her presence  time wore on and the painter came again  he had been far enough to the north to see the silver cascade of the crystal hills and to look over the vast round of cloud and forest from the summit of new englands loftiest mountain  but he did not profane that scene by the mockery of his art  he had also lain in a canoe on the bosom of lake george making his soul the mirror of its loveliness and grandeur till not a picture in the vatican was more vivid than his recollection  he had gone with the indian hunters to niagara and there again had flung his hopeless pencil down the precipice feeling that he could as soon paint the roar as aught else that goes to make up the wondrous cataract  in truth it was seldom his impulse to copy natural scenery except as a framework for the delineations of the human form and face instinct with thought passion or suffering  with store of such his adventurous ramble had enriched him the stern dignity of indian chiefs the dusky loveliness of indian girls the domestic life of wigwams the stealthy march the battle beneath gloomy pinetrees the frontier fortress with its garrison the anomaly of the old french partisan bred in courts but grown gray in shaggy desertssuch were the scenes and portraits that he had sketched  the glow of perilous moments flashes of wild feeling struggles of fierce power love hate grief frenzy in a word all the wornout heart of the old earth had been revealed to him under a new form  his portfolio was filled with graphic illustrations of the volume of his memory which genius would transmute into its own substance and imbue with immortality  he felt that the deep wisdom in his art which he had sought so far was found  but amid stern or lovely nature in the perils of the forest or its overwhelming peacefulness still there had been two phantoms the companions of his way  like all other men around whom an engrossing purpose wreathes itself he was insulated from the mass of human kind he had no aimno pleasureno sympathiesbut what were ultimately connected with his art  though gentle in manner and upright in intent and fiction he did not possess kindly feelings his heart was cold no living creature could be brought near enough to keep him warm  for these two beings however he had felt in its greatest intensity the sort of interest which always allied him to the subjects of his pencil  he had pried into their souls with his keenest insight and pictured the result upon their features with his utmost skill so as barely to fall short of that standard which no genius ever reached his own severe conception  he had caught from the duskiness of the futureat least so he fancieda fearful secret and had obscurely revealed it on the portraits  so much of himselfof his imagination and all other powershad been lavished on the study of walter and elinor that he almost regarded them as creations of his own like the thousands with which he had peopled the realms of picture therefore did they flit through the twilight of the woods hover on the mist of waterfalls look forth from the mirror of the lake nor melt away in the noontide sun  they haunted his pictorial fancy not as mockeries of life nor pale goblins of the dead but in the guise of portraits each with the unalterable expression which his magic had evoked from the caverns of the soul  he could not recross the atlantic till he had again beheld the originals of those airy pictures  o glorious art thus mused the enthusiastic painter as he trod the street  thou art the image of the creators own  the innumerable forms that wander in nothingness start into being at thy beck  the dead live again  thou recallest them to their old scenes and givest their gray shadows the lustre of a better life at once earthly and immortal  thou snatchest back the fleeting moments of history  with thee there is no past for at thy touch all that is great becomes forever present and illustrious men live through long ages in the visible performance of the very deeds which made thorn what they are  o potent art as thou bringest the faintly revealed past to stand in that narrow strip of sunlight which we call now canst thou summon the shrouded future to meet her there  have i not achieved it  am i not thy prophet  thus with a proud yet melancholy fervor did he almost cry aloud as he passed through the toilsome street among people that knew not of his reveries nor could understand nor care for them  it is not good for man to cherish a solitary ambition  unless there be those around him by whose example be may regulate himself his thoughts desires and hopes will become extravagant and he the semblance perhaps the reality of a madman  reading other bosoms with an acuteness almost preternatural the painter failed to see the disorder of his own  and this should be the house said he looking up and down the front before he knocked  heaven help my brains  that picture  methinks it will never vanish  whether i look at the windows or the door there it is framed within them painted strongly and glowing in the richest tintsthe faces of the portraitsthe figures and action of the sketch  he knocked  the portraits  are they within inquired he of the domestic then recollecting himselfyour master and mistress  are they at home  they are sir said the servant adding as he noticed that picturesque aspect of which the painter could never divest himself and the portraits too  the guest was admitted into a parlor communicating by a central door with an interior room of the same size  as the first apartment was empty he passed to the entrance of the second within which his eyes were greeted by those living personages as well as their pictured representatives who had long been the objects of so singular an interest  he involuntarily paused on the threshold  they had not perceived his approach  walter and elinor were standing before the portraits whence the former had just flung back the rich and voluminous folds of the silken curtain holding its golden tassel with one hand while the other grasped that of his bride  the pictures concealed for months gleamed forth again in undiminished splendor appearing to throw a sombre light across the room rather than to be disclosed by a borrowed radiance  that of elinor had been almost prophetic  a pensiveness and next a gentle sorrow had successively dwelt upon her countenance deepening with the lapse of time into a quiet anguish  a mixture of affright would now have made it the very expression of the portrait  walters face was moody and dull or animated only by fitful flashes which left a heavier darkness for their momentary illumination  he looked from elinor to her portrait and thence to his own in the contemplation of which he finally stood absorbed  the painter seemed to hear the step of destiny approaching behind him on its progress towards its victims  a strange thought darted into his mind  was not his own the form in which that destiny had embodied itself and he a chief agent of the coming evil which he had foreshadowed  still walter remained silent before the picture communing with it as with his own heart and abandoning himself to the spell of evil influence that the painter had cast upon the features  gradually his eyes kindled while as elinor watched the increasing wildness of his face her own assumed a look of terror and when at last he turned upon her the resemblance of both to their portraits was complete  our fate is upon us howled walterdie  drawing a knife he sustained her as she was sinking to the ground and aimed it at her bosom  in the action and in the look and attitude of each the painter beheld the figures of his sketch  the picture with all its tremendous coloring was finished  hold madman cried he sternly  he had advanced from the door and interposed himself between the wretched beings with the same sense of power to regulate their destiny as to alter a scene upon the canvas  he stood like a magician controlling the phantoms which he had evoked  what muttered walter ludlow as he relapsed from fierce excitement into silent gloom  does fate impede its own decree  wretched lady said the painter  did i not warn you  you did replied elinor calmly as her terror gave place to the quiet grief which it had disturbed  buti loved him  is there not a deep moral in the tale  could the result of one or all our deeds be shadowed forth and set before us some would call it fate and hurry onward others be swept along by their passionate desires and none be turned aside by the prophetic pictures
