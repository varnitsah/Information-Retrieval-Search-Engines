7740167	john kebles parishes  a history of hursley and otterbourne     preface    to explain the present undertaking it should be mentioned that a history of hursley and north baddesley was compiled by the reverend john marsh curate of hursley in the year 1808  it was well and carefully done with a considerable amount of antiquarian knowledge it reached a second edition and a good deal of it was used in sketches of hampshire by john duthy esq  an interleaved copy received many annotations from members of the heathcote family there was a proposal that it should be reedited but ninety years could not but make a great difference in these days of progress so that not only had the narrative to be brought up to date but further investigations into the past brought facts to light which had been unknown to mr marsh  it was therefore judged expedient to rewrite the whole though whenever possible the former curates work has been respected and repeated but he paid little attention to the history of otterbourne and a good deal has been since disclosed rendering that village interesting  moreover the entire careers of john keble and sir william heathcote needed to be recorded in their relations to the parish and county  this has therefore here been attempted together with a record of the building of the three churches erected since 1837 and a history of the changes that have taken place though the writer is aware that there is no incident to tempt the readerno siege of the one castle no battle more important than the combat in the hayfield between mr coram and the penurious steward and till the last generation no striking character  but the record of a thousand peaceful years is truly a cause of thankfulness shared as it is by many thousand villages and we believe that a little investigation would bring to light in countless other places much that is well worth remembrance  for the benefit of those who take an interest in provincial dialect some specimens are appended which come from personal knowledge  the lists of birds and of flowers are both from the actual observation of long residents who have known the country before in many instances peculiarities have faded away before the march of progress  the writer returns many warm thanks to those who have given much individual assistance in the undertaking which could not have been attempted without such aid  c m yonge elderfield otterbourne 18th june 1898    chapter imerdon and otterbourne    the south downs of england descend at about eight miles from the sea into beds of clay diversified by gravel and sand and with an upper deposit of peaty boggy soil all having been brought down by the rivers of which the itchen and the test remain  on the western side of the itchen exactly at the border where the chalk gives way to the other deposits lies the ground of which this memoir attempts to speak  it is uneven ground varied by undulations with gravelly hills rising above valleys filled with clay and both alike favourable to the growth of woods  fossils of belemnite cockles cardium and lampshells terebratula have been found in the chalk and numerous echini with the pentagon star on their base are picked up in the gravels and called by the country people shepherds crownsor even fossil toads  large boulder stones are also scattered about the country exercising the minds of some observers who saw in certain of them druidical altars with channels for the flow of the blood while others discerned in these same grooves the scraping of the ice that brought them down in the glacial age  but we must pass the time when the zoophytes were at work on our chalk when the lampshells rode at anchor on shallow waves when the cockles sat at their doors in a rainbow frill and the belemnites spread their cuttlefish arms to the sea and darkened the water for their enemies with their store of ink  nor can we dwell on the deer which left their bones and horns in the black boggy soil near the river for unfortunately these were disinterred before the time when diggers had learnt to preserve them for museums and only reported that they had seen remains  of human times a broken quern was brought to light when digging the foundation of otterbourne grange and bits of pottery have come to light in various fields at hursley especially from the barrows on cranbury common  in 1882 and 1883 the dowager lady heathcote assisted by captain john thorp began to search the barrows on the left hand side of the high road from hursley to southampton and found all had been opened in the centre but scarcely searched at all on the sides  in july they found four or five urns of unbaked clay in one barrowof early british make very coarse all either full of black earth or calcined bones and all inverted and very rough in material with the exception of one which was of a finer material red and like a modern flowerpot in shape  several of these urns were deposited in the hartley museum southampton  of the roman times we know nothing but that part of the great roman road between caer gwent or venta belgarum as the romans called winchester and sorbiodunum old sarum  it can still be traced at hursley and fragments of another leading to clausentum southampton on the slope of otterbourne hill  in dr milners history of winchester written at the end of the last century he describes a medallion of mixed metal bearing the head of julius caesar which was dug up by a labourer at otterbourne in the course of making a new road  he thought it one of the plates carried on the roman standards of the maniples but alas on being sent in 1891 to be inspected at the british museum it was pronounced to be one of a cinquecento series of the twelve caesars  the masters of the world have left us few traces of their possession and in fact the whole district was probably scarcely inhabited but the trees and brushwood or heather of the southern country would have joined the chalk downs making part of what the west saxons called the jotunwald or giants wood and the river ytene and so itchen seems to have been named in like manner  these were the times when churches were built and the boundaries of estates became those of parishes  the manor of merdon which occupied the whole parish of hursley belonged to the bishops of winchester by a grant of oynegils first christian king  milner in his history of winchester wishes to bestow on merdon the questionable honour of having been the place where in the year 754 the west saxon king cenwulf was murdered by his brother in the house of his ladylove but mr marsh the historian of hursley proves at some length that merton in surrey was more likely to have been the scene of the tragedy  church property being exempted from william the conquerors great survey neither merdon nor hursley appears in domesday book though otterbourne and even the hundred of boyate or boviate as it is in the book appear there  it had once belonged as did baddesley first at first to one named chepney then to roger de mortimer that fierce norman warrior who was at first a friend and afterwards an enemy to william i  the entire district except the neighbourhood of merdon manor on the one hand and of the itchen on the other was probably either forest ground or downs but it escaped the being put under forest laws at the time when the district of ytene became the new forest  probably the king was able to ride over down heather and wood scarcely meeting an enclosure the whole way from winchester and we can understand his impatience of the squatters in the wilder parts though the cistercian abbey of beaulieu was yet to be founded indeed professor e a freeman does not accept the statement that there could possibly have been thirtynine village churches to be destroyed in the whole district of ytene  the tradition lingered to the present time at otterbourne that the corpse of william rufus was brought back in purkisss woodcart from minestead to winchester for burial in the cathedral along a track leading from hursley to otterbourne called at each end kings lane though it is not easy to see how the route could have lain through both points  the parish of hursley lies in the hundred of buddlesgate and division of fawley and the village is situated on the turnpikeroad leading from winchester to romsey and nearly at an equal distance from each of those places  the parishes by which hursley is surrounded were when mr marsh wrote sparsholt on the north farley on the northwest michelmersh and romsey on the west baddesley north stoneham and otterbourne on the south and compton and st cross on the east  the whole parish was then upwards of twentyeight miles in circumference and contained 10590 acres of land of which 2600 were in common 372 in roads and lanes about 1000 under growth of coppicewood and the rest either arable or pasture  the soil in the parish of hursley as may be supposed in so extensive a tract of land is of several different sorts in some parts it is light and shallow and of a chalky nature in others particularly on the east and west sides of the parish it is what is called strong land having clay for its basis and in others especially that of the commons and fields adjoining it consists principally of sand or gravel  towards the west it is entirely covered with wood not in general bearing trees of large size but some beautiful beechtrees and breaking into peaty boggy ground on the southern side  the northern side is of good rich loam favourable to the growth of fine trees and likewise forms excellent arable land  this continues along the valley of otterbourne along a little brook which falls into the itchen  it is for the most part of thick clay fit for brickmaking with occasional veins of sand and where otterbourne hill rises beds of gravel begin and extend to the borders of the itchen through a wooded slope known as otterbourne park  the boundaries of estates fixed those of parishes and otterbourne was curiously long and narrow touching on compton and twyford to the north and northwest on stoneham to the south and hursley to the west lying along the bank of the itchen  the churches of both parishes were probably built in the twelfth century for though hursley church has been twice if not three times rebuilt remains of early norman mouldings have been found built into the stonework of the tower  and on the wall of the old otterbourne church a very rude fresco came partially to light traced in red was a quatrefoil within a square the corners filled up with what had evidently been the four cherubic figures though only the winged ox was clearly traceable  within the quatrefoil was a seated figure with something like scales in one hand apparently representing our lord in his glory  the central compartment was much broken away but there was the outline of a man whom one in a hairy garment was apparently baptizing  the rest had disappeared  these paintings surmounted three acutelypointed arches with small piers and square on the side next the nave but on the other side slender shafts with bellshaped capitals carved with bold round mouldings and deep hollows  two corbels supporting the horizontal dripstone over the west window were also clear and sharply cut and the doorway on the south side had slender shafts and deep mouldings in one of which is the dogtooth moulding going even down to the ground on each side  this is still preserved in the entrance to the boys school  these remnants date the original building for about the thirteenth century  it may have been due to king stephens brother bishop henry de blois of winchester who is known to have raised the castle whose remains still exist on his manor of merdon where once there had been a roman encampment  so far as his work can be traced the first thing he would do would be to have a similar embankment thrown up and a parapet made along the top behind which menatarms would be stationed the ditch below having a stockade of sharp stakes  in the middle of the enclosure a well was begun which had to go deeper and deeper through the chalk till at last water was found at 300 feet deepa work that must have lasted a year or more  around the well leaving only a small courtyard were all the buildings of the castle meant for the bishops household and soldiers  the entrance to it all was probably over a drawbridge across the great ditch which on this side was not less than 60 feet deep and through a great gateway between two high square towers which must have stood where now there is a slope leading down from the level of the inner court to that surrounded by a bank  this slope is probably formed by the ruins of the gateway and tower having been pitched into the ditch as the readiest way of getting rid of them when the castle was dismantled afterwards  we are indebted to the late sir john cowell for the conjectural plan and description of the castle  as soon as the bishop had completed this much he would feel tolerably safe but he would not be satisfied  he could hardly have room in his castle for all his retainers and he could not command the country from it except towards the south therefore his next work was to make an embankment and the ditch on the outer side of it  it was then an unbroken semicircle jutting out as it were from the castle and protecting a sufficient space of ground for troops to encamp  in case of an enemy forcing their way into this the defenders could retreat into the castle by the drawbridge  the entrance was on the east side and in order to protect this and the back of the castle by which is meant the northern side another embankment was made and finished with a parapet  also as in case of this being carried by the enemy it would be impossible for the defenders in the northern part of the castle to run round the castle and into shelter by the main gateway he built a square tower exactly opposite to the ruin which yet remains and divided from it only by the great ditch  on either side of the towercutting the embankment across therefore at right angleswas a little ditch spanned by a drawbridge which if the defenders thought it necessary to retire to the tower could at any time be raised the foundations of the tower and the position of the ditches can still be distinctly traced  supposing further that it became impossible to hold the tower the besieged could retreat into the main body of the castle by means of another drawbridge across the great ditch which would lead them through the arch which can still be seen in the ruins though it is partially blocked up  the room on the east side of this passage was probably a guardroom  in some castles of this date there were also two or three tunnels bored through the earthwork from the inner courtyard to the bottom of the great ditch so as to provide additional ways of retreat for such men as might otherwise be cut off in those parts most distant from either of the great gates in order to secure the outlying defence  henry de blois must have been thinking of the many feudal castles of his native france  he was a magnificent prelate though involved in the wars of his brother and the empress matilda  the hospital of st cross and much of the beauty of romsey abbey are ascribed to him and he even endeavoured to obtain that winchester should be raised to the dignity of a metropolitan see  it does not appear that all his elaborate defences at merdon were ever called into practical use and when his brother king stephen died in 1154 he fled from england and the young henry ii in anger dismantled merdon together with his other castles of wolvesey and waltham nor were these fortifications ever restored  the king and bishop were reconciled and the latter spent a pious and penitent old age only taking one meal a day and spending the surplus in charity  he died in 1174    chapter iimediaeval gifts    it was considered in the middle ages that tithes might be applied to any church purpose and were not the exclusive right of the actual parish priest provided he obtained a sufficient maintenance which in those days of celibacy was not very expensive  the bishops and other patrons thus assigned the great tithes of corn of many parishes to religious foundations elsewhere only leaving the incumbent the smaller tithe from other cropsan arrangement which has resulted in many abuses  thus in 1301 when bishop sawbridge or points or as it was latinised de pontissara founded the college of st elizabeth in st stephens merdon by the itchen at winchester for the education of twelve poor boys by a provost and fellows he endowed it in part with the great tithe of hursley  the small tithes having been found insufficient for the maintenance of the vicar he united to hursley the rectory of otterbourne giving the great tithes to the vicar of hursley and in 1362 bishop edyngton confirmed the transaction  mr marsh thus relates the transaction  the living of hursley was anciently a rectory and as it is believed wholly unconnected with any other church or parish unfortunately however for the parishioners as well as for the minister it was about the year 1300 reduced to a vicarage and the great tithes appropriated to the college of st elizabeth in winchester  the small tithes which remained being inadequate to the support of the vicar and his necessary assistants the church of otterbourne was consolidated with that of hursley and the tithes of that parish both great and small were given to them to make up a sufficient maintenancean arrangement which in that dark age was thought not only justifiable but even laudable but which nevertheless deserves to this day to be severely censured since not only the minister but both the parishes and the cause of religion have suffered a serious and continued injury from it  the person by whom this appropriation was made was john de pontissara alias points bishop of winchester the founder of the college to which the tithes were granted it was however afterwards confirmed by william de edyngton by whom the vicars rights which before were probably undefined and perhaps the subject of contention were ascertained and secured to him by endowment  this instrument is still in being bearing the date of 1362  it may be seen in bishop edyngtons register part i fol 128 under the following marginal title ratificatio et confirmatio appropriationis ecclesiae de hursleghe et ordinationes vicarie ejusd  the following is a translation of it so far as the vicars interests are concerned in it the said vicar shall have and receive all and all manner of tithes great and small with all offerings and other emoluments belonging to the chapel of otterbourne situated within the parish of the said church viz of hursley  he shall also have and receive all offerings belonging to the church of hursley and all small tithes arising within the parish of the same viz the tithes of cheese milk honey wax pigs lambs calves eggs chickens geese pigeons flax apples pears and all other tithable fruits whatsoever of curtilages or gardens he shall also receive the tithes of mills already erected or that shall be erected  he shall also receive and have all personal tithes of all traders servants labourers and artificers whatsoever due to the said church  the said vicar shall also receive and have all mortuaries whatsoever live and dead of whatsoever things they may consist  the said vicar shall also receive and have all profit and advantage arising from the herbage of the churchyard  he shall also have and receive the tithes of all fishponds whatsoever within the said parish wheresoever made or that hereafter shall be made  the said vicar shall also have for his habitation the space on the south side of the churchyard measuring in length from the said churchyard and the rectorial house formerly belonging to the said church towards the south twentyseven perches and in breadth from the hedge and ditch between the said space and the garden of the aforesaid former rectory on the west towards the east sixteen perches and a half with the buildings erected thereon  besides the above john de pontissara allotted to the vicar the tithes of wool beans and vetches but of the first of these he was deprived by bishop edyngtons endowment and the latter have been so little cultivated that he has never yet derived any advantage from them though his right to this species of tithes cannot i suppose be questioned unless indeed they are comprehended under the term bladum and are consequently to be considered as the portion of the impropriator  the tithes given by the endowment to the president and chaplains of st elizabeth college aredecimae bladi cujuscunque generis foeni ac lanae and no other  the church of hursley is situated within the deanery of winchester and is a peculiar 17 a distinction which it enjoys probably in consequence of its having been formerly under the patronage of the bishop  the advantages of this are that it is not subject to the archdeacons jurisdiction that the minister is not obliged to attend his visitations and that he has the privilege of granting letters of administration to wills when the property conveyed by them lies within the limits of the vicarage  the value of the benefice as rated in the kings book is 9 pounds per annum and the tenths are of course 18s  these the incumbent is required to pay annually but he is exempted from the payment of the first fruits  the landtax with which the vicarage is charged is 14 pounds  1  25 per annum and the procurations and dietmoney payable on account of the bishops visitation amount to 12s 95d  the patronage of the living when a rectory belonged to the bishops of winchester and afterwards when reduced to a vicarage was expressly reserved to himself and his successors by william de edyngton and so long as they kept possession of the manor of merdon they continued patrons of the vicarage  this bishop edyngton the same who began the alteration of the cathedral is said to have built the second church of all saints at hurley the tower of which still remains  william of wykeham among his wider interests seems to have had little concern with hursley or otterbourne  the bishops possessed numerous manors in the diocese and these were really not only endowments but stations whence the episcopal duty of visitation could be performed  riding forth with his train of clergy chaplains almoners lawyers crossbearers and choristers besides his household of attendants the bishop entered a village where the bells were rung priest knight franklins and peasants came out with all their local display often a guild to receive him and other clergy gathered in mass was said difficulties or controversies attended to confirmation given to the young people and children and after a meal the bishop proceeded sometimes to a nobles castle or a convent but more often to another manor of his own where he was received by his resident steward or parkkeeper and took up his abode the neighbouring clergy coming in to pay their respects mention their grievances and hold counsel with him  his dues were in the meantime collected and his residence lasted as long as business ecclesiastical or secular required his presence or till he and his train had eaten up the dues in kind that came in  whether the visit was welcome or not depended a good deal on the character of the prelate and the hold he kept on his subordinates the great courtly bishops like william of wykeham generally sent their suffragans titular bishops in partibus infidelium to perform their duties  one of the parkkeepers of merdon was judged worthy of a latin epitaph probably the work of a chaplain or of a winchester scholar to whom he had endeared himself   hic in humo stratus john bowland est tumulatus vir pius et gratus et ab omnibus hinc peramatus custos parcorum praestans quondam fuit horum de merdon quorum et wintoniae dominorum hic quinqgenis hinc octenis rite deemptis    cum plausu gentis custos erat in eis  festum clementis tempus fuerat morientis mille quadringentis annis christi redimentis quadris his junctis simul et cum septuagintis    hunc cum defunctis protege christe tuis   here laid in the ground john bowland hath sepulture a man of faith and kindliness and hence by all beloved he was aforetime the excellent guardian of this park belonging to certain lords of merdon and winchester he for lit in 50 years8 being taken away precisely    with the applause of all the community was guardian among them  the festival of clement was his date of dying in years one thousand four hundred after christs redemption adding to these four  years and seventy    him o christ befriend with those who are thine   unlike hursley or rather the manor of merdon otterbourne had many different possessors in succession and is even at the present day divided into various holdings on different tenures  in 1244 walter and john de brompton sons of sir bryan de brompton lived at hayswode a name now lost or changed into otterbourne park the wood spreading over the east side of the hill  at the same time sir henry de capella was possessor of the manor but in 1265 it had passed by what means we do not know to sir francis de bohuna very early specimen of this christian name which was derived from the sobriquet of the saint of assisi whose christian name was john  from the son of sir francis in 1279 simon the draper obtained the manor of otterbourne for 600 merks and a quit rent of a pair of gilt spurs valued at six pence  simon seems to have assumed the gilt spurs himself for he next appears as sir simon de wynton  indeed it seems that knighthood might be conferred on the possessors of a certain amount of land  wynton in two more generations has lengthened into wynchester when in 1379 the manor is leased to hugh croans merchant and isabella his wife for their lives paying after the first twentyfive years 100 pounds per annum  and two years later william de winchester conveyed the manor over to hugh croans or crans  the great bishop william of wykeham bought it in 1386 and gave it to his cousin bearing the same name  it continued in the wykeham family till 1458 when william fiennes or fenys lord say and sele the son of him who was murdered by jack cades mob being married to the heiress margaret wykeham sold it to bishop waynflete for 600 pounds  the bishops treasurer was hugh pakenham and being one of the feoffees to whom the manor was conveyed for the bishop he pretended that he had bought it for himself and absconded with some of the title deeds but eventually he died in magna miseria in sanctuary at st martins le grand westminster  his son john renounced the pretended claim and very generously the bishop gave him 40 pounds  in 1481 good bishop waynflete made over the property to his newly founded college of st mary magdalen at oxford in whose possession it has remained ever since except small portions which have been enfranchised from time to time  it includes otterbourne hill with common land on the top and wood upon the slope as well as various meadows and plough lands  the manor house still bearing the name of the moat house was near the old church in the meadows and entirely surrounded with its own moat  it must have been a house of some pretension in the sixteenth century for there is a handsome double staircase a rough fresco in one room and in the lowest there was a panel over the fireplace with a painting representing apparently a battle between turks and austrians  the president of magdalen college on progress always held his court there  the venerable dr rowth in extreme old age was the last who did so  since his time the bridge crossing the moat fell in and choked it it became a marsh the farm was united to another the picture removed and the only inhabitants are such a labourers family as may be impervious to the idea that it is haunted  simon the draper otherwise sir simon de wynton granted a plot of land to the northwest of the manor house to adam de lecke in villeinage and later in freehold to john de otterbourne reserving thirteen shillings rent  by this last it was rented on his wife alice from whom it passed through several hands to john colpoys in the year of henry vi and twentytwo years later this same john colpoys agreed with the warden and fellows of winchester college to enfeoff them of one messuage four tofts twenty acres of arable land and eighteen acres of meadow to the intent that they should on the 7th day of april in every year celebrate the obits of alice his deceased wife of john giles and maud his wife her parents of sir john shirborne and of joan parke and of colpoys himself and joan his then wife after their respective deaths  these obits namely anniversaries of deaths when masses were to be offered for the person recollected were to be secured by the fee of a shilling to the warden on each occasion sixpence to each fellow and chaplain and likewise to the schoolmaster twopence to each lay clerk sixpence to the sacrist for wax candles and a mark or thirteen and fourpence to be spent in a pittance extra course in the college hall  the indenture by which colpoys hoped to secure perpetual masses in remembrance of his relations and himself is in perfect preservation with seals attached in the muniment chamber of winchester college  the property has continued ever since in the possession of the college of st mary winchester though the masses ceased to be celebrated after the reformation  in those days the rector of hursley was john de ralegh probably a kinsman of the bishop of that name  before this however bishop richard toclive had a dispute with the knights of st john who claimed the almshouse of noble poverty at st cross as hospitallers  they had unfortunately a reputation for avarice and toclive bought them off by giving them the impropriation of merton and hursleigh 25 for 53 marks a year  paganus de lyskeret styled presbyter was collated in 1280  it appears that at this time there was a perpetual vicar established in the church of hursley as well as a rector and that he was instituted by the bishop had a certain fixed maintenance assigned to him and was independent of the rector  in the register of john de pontissera bishop of winton may now be seen what is there called the ordinatio episcopi inter rectorem et vicarium de hurslegh  it is therein settled that the vicar shall have a house as described and other emoluments and that the rector shall pay to him forty shillings per annum  the vicar at this time was johannes de sta fide  the deed of settlement was executed in hyde abbey in the year 1291 philip de barton john de ffleming william de wenling and others being witnesses to it  vide regist de pontissera fol 10 forty shillings or five marks was it appears the stipend usually assigned to vicars and curates at this time the vicar being really what we now call a curate  hugo de welewyck styled clericus succeeded in 1296 on the resignation of paganus and was the last rector the benefice having in his time been reduced to a vicarage by the appropriation of the rectorialhouse tithes and glebe to the college of st elizabeth the pretences assigned for this act for true reasons they could scarcely be since in all cases of appropriation and consolidation they appear to have been almost exactly the same were the unfinished state of the college buildings and the insufficiency of the revenues for the maintenance of the society owing to wars sickness pestilence and the like  but notwithstanding this serious deprivation and loss a vicar it appears was still continued in the church hugh de welewyck having presented two viz henricus de lyskeret in 1300 and roger de la vere in 1302 of whom the latter was certainly appointed after the appropriation  william de ffarlee was collated vicar of hursley on the death of welewyck in 1348  william de middleton was collated in 1363    chapter iiireformation times    the rectorial tithe of hursley having been given to st elizabeths college and apparently some rights over merdon the chancellor wriothesley obtained that on the confiscation of monastic property the manor should be granted to him  stephen gardiner had been bishop since 1531 a man who though he had consented to the kings assumption of the royal supremacy grieved over the fact as an error all his life  he appeared at the bar of the house of commons and pleaded the rights of his see to which merdon had belonged for 1300 years  it was probably in consequence of his pleading that wriothesley restored the manor but when gardiner was illegally deposed by the regency of edward vi on 14th february 1550 john poynet a considerable scholar but a man of disgraceful life obtained the appointment to the see by alienating various estates to the seymour family and merdon was resumed by the crown  it was then granted to sir philip hobby who had been one of king henrys privy councillors and had been sent on an embassy to portugal attended by ten gentlemen of his own retinue wearing velvet coats with chains of gold  already had come to the hamlet of slackstead in hursley parish another reformer thomas sternhold who had been gentleman of the bedchamber to henry viii and had put thirtyseven psalms into english verse in hopes of improving the morals of the court  john hopkins and robert wisdom completed the translation of the psalms which fuller in his history says was at first derided and scoffed at as piety rather than poetry adding that the good gentleman had drunk more of jordan than of helicon  in his worthies however he says he was afterwards saith my author ab intimo cubiculo to king edward the sixth though i am not satisfied whether thereby he meant gentleman of his privy chamber or groom of his bedchamber  he was a principal instrument of translating the psalms into english metre the first twentysix and sevenandthirty in all 28 being by him performed  yet had he other assistance in that work  many a bitter scoff hath since been passed on their endeavours by some wits which might have been better employed  some have miscalled these their translations geneva gigs ie jigs and which is the worst father or mother rather the expression on our virgin queen as falsely as other things have been charged upon her  some have not sticked to say that david hath been as much persecuted by bungling translators as by saul himself  some have made libellous verses in abuse of them and no wonder if songs were made on the translators of the psalms seeing drunkards made them on david the author thereof  but let these translations be beheld by impartial eyes and they will be allowed to go in equipage with the best poems in that age however it were to be wished that some bald rhymes therein were bettered till which time such as sing them must endeavour to amend them by singing them with understanding heads and gracious hearts whereby that which is bad metre on earth will be made good music in heaven  as for our thomas sternhold it was happy for him that he died before his good master anno 1549 in the month of august so probably preventing much persecution which had happened unto him if surviving in the reign of queen mary  such was fullers judgment and that of the author he quotes nevertheless the version of the psalms being printed with the prayerbook took such a strong hold of the nation that in 1798 hannah more was accused of dissent because the version of tate and brady was used in her schools  mr keble preferred it to this latter as more like the hebrew and some of his versions curiously enough proceeding from the same parish remind us of these simple old translators  the old hundredth and in some degree the 23rd and the opening of the 18th still hold their place probably in virtue of the music to which they are wedded  bishop gardiner recovered the manor of merdon with his liberty on queen marys accession  then it was that philip of spain rode through one of these villages probably otterbourne soaked through with rain on his way to his illstarred marriage with mary  gardiner was no persecutor and sternholds widow lived on at slackstede  on his death queen mary gave the diocese to john white the same who preached to elizabeth on a living dog being better than a dead lion  hobby then claimed the manor but bishop white made a strenuous resistance appealing to gardiners former plea and supported by the attorney general story who is said to have been an enemy of sir philip hobby  the case was argued in the house of lords and given against the bishop though under the protest of several of the lords spiritual who dreaded the like treatment  story was prosecuted by the commons for pleading before the lords fled to the netherlands and was trepanned on board an english ship and put to death as a traitor  bishop white was deprived the next year and retired to his sisters house at south warnborough where he died  queen elizabeth is said to have visited him  merdon was thus in 1558 for ever alienated from the diocese of winchester  sir philip hobby is said to have first built the lodge as it was called of hursley park about a quarter of a mile from merdon castle which had become ruinous  those were the days when the massive walls and minute comfortless chambers were deserted defence being less thought of than convenience in our happy country and indeed sir philip seems to have used hursley as a residence instead of only a shelter on a tour  he died at bisham aged 53 on the 31st of may 1558 soon after his victory over the see of winchester and is there buried as well as his elder brother sir thomas  he left no children and was succeeded by his brother william who had married the widow of sternhold  on her death the following memorial was erected over a stone bearing the coat on a chevron embattled between three griffins heads erased three roses and on a brass the inscription      if ever chaste or honest godly lyfe myght merit prayse  of everlastyng fame forget not then  that worthy sternholds wife our hobbies make   anne horswell cald by name from whome alas  to sone for hers here left hath god her soule  deth her lyfe byreft    anno 1559   his property at hursley descended to his son giles hobby esq who it appears clearly by the register and other records was living in the parish very early in the seventeenth century  his last wife was ann the daughter of sir thomas clarke knight of avyngton 32 in berkshire to whom he sold the castle and manor of merdon reserving however to himself and wife a lifeholding in the lodge and park when this sale was made does not appear but it is supposed to have been before the year 1602 as sir thomas was then living at merdon and his son married in that year at hursley  giles hobby died in the year 1626 and his wife in 1630  they were both buried at hursley probably in the church but no monument appears to have been erected to their memory  sir thomas clarke may be considered as the next lord of merdon though he was never in possession of either the lodge or the park and held only for a few years what he did possess  so long however as he continued proprietor of the manor it is said that he lived at merdon i suppose at the castle a part of which was probably then standing and habitable  sir thomas it would seem kept the demesne lands in his own occupation requiring the tenants or copyholders of the manor according to ancient usage to perform the customary service of reaping and housing his crops  1 the days employed in this service were called haydobyn days 2 and during their continuance the lord was obliged to provide breakfast and dinner for the workmen  richard morley in his manuscript gives a very curious account of a quarrel which occurred on one of these occasions another time says he upon a haydobynday 320 or 340 reapers the cart brought afield for them a hogshead of porridge which stunk and had worms swimming in it  the reapers refused to work without better provisions  mr coram of cranbury would not suffer them to work  mr pye sir thomas clarkes steward and coram drew their daggers and rode at each other through the wheat  at last lady clarke promised to dress for them two or three hogs of bacon twenty nobles work lost  he adds that a heire hire went for a man on the haydobyndays if able to carry a hooke afield  this haydobyn is supposed by mr marsh to be a corruption of the old word haydogtime 34 a word signifying a country dance  it seems that when the tenants were called on to perform work in hedging reaping or haymaking upon the lands of the lord of the manor in lieu of money rent he was bound to feed them through the day and generally to conclude with a merrymaking  so no doubt it had been in the good old days of the bishops and the much loved and lamented john bowland but harder times had come with sir thomas clarke when it required the interference of mr coram of cranbury to secure them even an eatable meal  no doubt such stout english resistance saved the days of compulsory labour from becoming a burden intolerable as in france  roger coram gent rented cranbury at 17 pounds  2s  cranbury is a low wooded hill then part of the manor of merdon nearly two miles to the southeast of hursley and in that parish though nearer to otterbourne  several tenements seem to have been there those in the valley being called long moor and pot kiln  shoveller is the first name connected with cranbury but mr roger coram the champion of the haymakers held it till his death when it passed to sir edward richards  on the other hand brambridge which stands in twyford parish but held part of the hundred of boyatt in otterbourne was in the hands of the roman catholic family of welles who seem to have had numerous retainers at highbridge allbrook and boyatt  swithun welles made brambridge a refuge for priests and two or three masses were said in his house each day  one ben beard a spy writes in 1584 that if certain priests were not at brambridge they would probably be at mr stranges at mapledurham where was a hollow place by the livery cupboard capable of containing two men  swithun welles went later to london and took a house in holborn where topcliffe the priestcatcher broke in on father genings saying mass and both he and mr welles were hanged together for what was adjudged in those days to be a treasonable offence implying disaffection to the queen 36  the modern house of brambridge affords no priests chambers  it is believed that an older one was burnt down and there is a very dim report that a priest was drowned in a stone basin in a neighbouring wood  the register of twyford church contains the record of a number of the welles family buried in the churchyard clandestinely by night  john wells mentioned in the athenae oxoniensis as an able man living at deptford retired to brambridge and died there in 1634  this accounts for there having been the roman catholic school at twyford whence alexander pope was expelled for some satirical verses on the master  the house is still known  the vicars of hursley at this period were john hynton presented by bishop gardiner but deprived in on account of his tenets  richard fox was presented in his place by william hobby  it must have been owing to the reforming zeal of this vicar of hursley that the frescoes in otterbourne church were as far as possible effaced whitewashed over and the ten commandments painted over them in old english lettering part of which was still legible in 1839 otterbourne was apparently still served by the vicar of hursley or his assistant  parish registers began at this date and here are the remarkable occurrences recorded at hursley   extraordinary occurrences etc  1582  a great hail storm happened at hursley baddesley and in the neighbourhood this year  the hailstones measured nine inches in circumference  1604  the plague made its appearance at anfield  it broke out in november and continued till the following february  many persons died of it and were not brought to the church but buried in the waste near their residence  1610  a person of the name of wooll hanged himself at gosport in the parish of hursley about this time  he was buried at the corner of newlands coppice and a stake was driven through his body  the place still bears the name of newlands coppice  1621  a planked thrashingfloor first laid down in the parish this year viz at merdon  chalkfloors used before  it was reckoned a memorable improvement  1629  a great fall of snow in october  it was nearly half a foot deep and remained on the ground three or four days  1635  a copyholder was hanged for murder this year  his copyhold was seized by the lord as forfeited but afterwards recovered viz in 1664    chapter ivpuritan times    after his dispute with the haymakers sir thomas clarke sold merdon to william brock a lawyer from whom it passed to john arundel and then to sir nathanael napier whose son sir gerald parted with it again to richard maijor the son of the mayor of southampton  this was in 1638 and for some time the lodge at hursley was lent to mr kingswell mr maijors fatherinlaw who died there in 1639 after which time mr maijor took up his abode there  he seems to have been a shrewd active man and a staunch protestant for when there was a desire to lease out cranbury he as lord of the manor stipulated that it should be let only to a protestant of the church of england not to a papist  the neighbourhood of the welleses at brambridge probably moved him to make this condition  the person who applied for the lease was dr john young dean of winchester who purchased the copyhold of cranbury before 1643 and retired thither when he was expelled from his deanery and other preferments in the evil times of the commonwealth and there died leaving his widow in possession  whether the lady was molested by mr maijor we do not know  he was no favourite with richard morley who rented the forge in hursley the farm of ratlake and anvyle as ampfield was then spelt and thought him a severe lord to his copyholders  morley was born at hursley and was sent to school at baddesley in 1582 the year of the great hailstorm of the nineinch stones  he kept valuable memoranda which mr marsh quotes and died in 1672 when he is registered as   ricardus morley senex sepultus fuit august 1672  senex indeed for he must have been 97   of maijor morley records he was very witty and thrifty and got more by oppressing his tenants than did all the lords in 60 years before him  he was a justice of the peace and raised a troop in the cause of the parliament  it must have been in the army that oliver cromwell made his acquaintance and in 1647 began the first proposals of a marriage treaty between richard olivers eldest surviving son just twentyone and educated for the law and the elder daughter of mr maijor which carlyle always spells as mayor  for the time however this passed off but apparently under the direction of mr robertson a minister of southampton and mr stapylton also a minister the treaty was resumed and three weeks after the kings execution oliver wrote to mr maijor   for my very worthy friend richard mayor esq  these  london 12th february 1648  siri received some intimations formerly and by the last return from southampton a letter from mr robinson concerning the reviving of the last years motion touching my son and your daughter  mr robinson was also pleased to send enclosed in his a letter from you bearing date the 5th of this instant february wherein i find your willingness to entertain any good means for the completing of that business  from whence i take encouragement to send my son to wait upon you and by him to let you know that my desires are if providence so dispose very full and free to the thingif upon an interview there prove also a freedom in the young persons thereunto  what liberty you will give herein i wholly submit to you  i thought fit in my letter to mr robinson to mention somewhat of expedition because indeed i know not how soon i may be called into the field or other occasions may remove me from hence having for the present some liberty of stay in london  the lord direct all to his gloryi rest sir your very humble servant  oliver cromwell   probably this was the time when the publichouse of hursley took the name of the kings head which it has kept to the present day  but young cromwell was inclined to loyalty and when at cambridge used to drink to the health of our landlord meaning the king  he was one andtwenty when with his fathers friend mr stapylton he made a visit to hursley and was received by mr and mrs maijor with many civilities also seeing their two daughters dorothy and anne  in a letter of 28th february cromwell thanks mr maijor for the reception of my son in the liberty given him to wait on your worthy daughter the report of whose virtues and godliness has so great a place in my heart that i think fit not to neglect anything on my part which may consummate a close of the business if god please to dispose the young ones hearts thereunto and other suitable ordering of affairs towards mutual satisfaction appear in the dispensation of providence  mr stapylton was commissioned to act for general cromwell in the matter of settlements over which there was considerable haggling though oliver writes that the report of the young ladys godliness causeth him to deny himself in the matter of moneys  more correspondence ensued as to the settlement of hursley upon dorothy and her heirs male and the compensation to her younger sister anne cromwell was anxious to hurry on the matter so as to have it concluded before his departure to take the command in ireland  the terms were finally settled and richard and dorothy were married at hursley on may day 1649 before cromwells departure to crush the illarranged risings in ireland  her sister anne shortly after married john dunch of baddesley with 1000 pounds as her portion morley of baddesley chronicles the marriage in no friendly tone when says he king charles was put to death and oliver cromwell protector of england and richard maijor of his privy council and noll his eldest son richard married to mr maijors daughter doll then mr maijor did usurp authority over his tenants at hursley  in another place he says that he ie mr maijor set forth horse and man for the parliament and was a captain and justice of peace lord richard cromwell was also a justice of peace and john dunch a captain and justice  these all lived at lodge together in olivers reign so we had justice right or wrong by power for if we did offend they had power to send us a thousand miles off and that they have told us  richard having no turn for politics or warfare preferred to live a quiet life with his fatherinlaw in the lodge  there were two walnut avenues planted about this time leading to the lodge from the churchyard on one side and on the other towards baddesley and the foundations of the house can still be traced on the lawn to which both lead  oliver writes in the summer after the marriage that he is glad the young people have leisure to make a journey to eat cherries  there is little doubt but that this must have been to the gardens in ram alley near chandlers ford originally chaloners ford where numerous trees bearing quantities of little black cherries called merries used to grow and where parties used to go as a sunday diversion and eat before the days of the station and the building  the elder mrs cromwell paid a visit to hursley after parting with the protector on his voyage to ireland but he never seems to have gone thither in person though he wrote kindly paternal letters to his son and daughter  he wishes richard to study mathematics and cosmography and read history especially sir walter raleighs  it is a body of history and will add much more to your understanding than fragments of story  and to dorothy he gives advice on her health and religious habits  john hardy had been vicar of hursley but was expelled and mr maijor as patron of the living provided persons for the ministry and kept a close account of their expenses which is still preserved seven different ministers in the half year after christmas 1645 were remunerated for travell and pains in preaching after which time mr richard webb settled for a time at hursley and mr daniel lloyd at otterbourne though several more changes took place  a parish register at hursley 1653 recording births not baptisms mentions the opening of a chalkpit at hatchgate in 1655 and at otterbourne  the children of william downe of otterbourne farm are distinguished by double black lines below their names  oliver cromwell according to an old village tradition sunk his treasure at the bottom of merdon well in an iron chest which must have been enchanted for on an endeavour to draw it up no one was to speak  one workman unfortunately said here it comes when it immediately sank to the bottom and this is quite certain never was seen  the well was cleaned out in later times and nothing was found but a pair of curious pattens cut away to receive a highheeled shoe also a mazerbowl an iron fleshhook and small cookingpot and a multitude of pins thrown in to make the curious reverberating sound when after several seconds they reached the water  a couple of ducks are said to have been thrown down and to have emerged at pool hole at otterbourne with their feathers scraped off  on 3rd september 1658 the family party at hursley was broken up by the unexpected death of the protector  he was not yet sixty years of age and had not contemplated being cut off before affairs were more settled and when in his last moments he was harassed with enquiries as to his successor he answered you will find my will in such a drawer of my cabinet  some of his counsellors thought he named his son richard and no one ever found the drawer with the will in it in which it was thought that his soninlaw fleetwood a much abler man was named  at any rate richard was accepted in his fathers place by parliament and army and went to much expense for the protectors funeral  it must have been a great misfortune to him that his shrewd fatherin law the witty and thrifty mr maijor was sinking under a complication of incurable diseases of which morley speaks somewhat unkindly and he died in the end of april 1660  richard had never been a strong partisan of the commonwealth though he had quietly submitted to whatever was required of him  he had been member of parliament for the county of hants and had been placed at the head of the list of his fathers attempt at a house of lords and he allowed greatness to be thrust on him in a quiet acquiescent way  he dismissed the fictitious parliament that his father had summoned and then offended the strict and godly of the army by promoting soldiers of whom they disapproved  here is dick ingoldsby he said he can neither pray nor preach and yet i trust him before you all  no one had any real enthusiasm for the harmless helpless man the phantom king of half a year and it was just as old mr maijor was dying that richard was requested by the rump to resign and return to hampton court with the promise of a pension and of payment of the debts incurred by his father  while packing for his departure he sat down on a box containing all the complimentary addresses made to him and said between my legs lie the lives and fortunes of all the good folk in england  he then returned to hursley where he found himself pursued by those debts of his father which the long parliament had engaged to pay and which swallowed up more than his patrimony though the manor of merdon having been settled upon his wife could not be touched  he was sufficiently alarmed however to make him retreat to the continent and change his name to clarke  in 1675 mrs richard cromwell died leaving out of a numerous family only one son and two daughters  the son oliver inherited the estates and seems to have been on good terms with his father who in 1700 came to live at cheshunt under his name of clarke and made some visits to hursley  richard married under this assumed name and left some children  when oliver died without heirs in 1706 his father richard according to the original settlement succeeded to the property but his two daughters set up their claim and the case was brought into court it is said that the judge was cowper but this has been denied  at any rate the judge seems to have been shocked at the undutiful litigation and treated the old man with much respect  the case was decided in his favour and he lived between hursley and cheshunt till his death in 1712 in his 86th year  as mr palgrave writes      him count we wise him also though the chorus of the throng    be silent though no pillar rise in slavish adulation of the strong but here from blame of tongues and fame aloof    neath a low chancel roof     the peace of god he sleeps unconscious hero  lowly grave by village footsteps daily trod unconscious or while silence holds the nave and the bold robin comes when day is dim    and pipes his heedless hymn   these are a poets meditations on him more graceful than the inscription on the monument erected to him by his two undutiful daughters ere in 1718 they sold the estate  it was a large tablet of marble surmounted by deaths heads  it is of gray or veined marble in the doric style of architecture and is in height thirteen feet and in breadth nearly nine  the inscription upon it is as follows   this monument was erected to the memory of mrs eliz cromwell spinster by mr richard cromwell and thomas cromwell her executors  she died the 8th day of april 1731 in the 82d yeare of her age and lyes interred near this place she was the daughter of richard cromwell esq by dorothy his wife who was the daughter of richard maijor esq  and the following account of her family all of whom except mrs ann gibson lie in this chancel is given according to her desire  mrs ann gibson the 6th daughter died 7th dec 1727 in the 69th year of her age and lies interred with dr thomas gibson her husband physician general of the army in the churchyard belonging to st georges chapel in london  richard cromwell esq father of the said eliz cromwell died 12th july 1712 in the 86th year of his age  oliver cromwell esq son of the said richard cromwell died 11th may 1705 in the 49th year of his age  mrs dorothy mortimer a seventh daughter wife of john mortimer esq died 14th may 1681 in the 21st year of her age but left no issue  mrs dorothy cromwell wife of the said richard cromwell died 5th january 1675 in the 49th year of her age  mrs ann maijor mother of the said mrs dorothy cromwell died 13th of june 1662  richard maijor esq husband of the said mrs ann maijor died 25th april 1660  mrs dorothy cromwell a fifth daughter died 13th december 1658 in the 2nd year of her age  a fourth daughter died 27th may 1655 in the 1st year of her age  mrs mary cromwell a third daughter died 24th september 1654 in the 2nd year of her age  a son of the said richard and dorothy cromwell died 13th december 1652 in the 1st year of his age  mrs ann cromwell a second daughter died 14th march 1651 in the 1st year of her age  mr john kingswell father of the said mrs ann maijor died 5th march 1639   the limetrees beautifully surrounding the churchyard are said to have been planted by richard cromwell and there was certainly an excellent fashion of planting them in the latter end of the seventeenth century partly due to a french custom partly to evelyns sylva  the beautiful avenue of limes at brambridge in three aisles was probably planted at this date by one of the welles family  in taking down the old lodge of merdon or hursley a large lump of metal was found squeezed into a crevice of the wall and was sold by mr heathcote as a roman weight but on being cleaned it proved to be the die of the seal of the commonwealth  richard had caused a new seal to be made for himself by simon a noted medallist and he had probably thus disposed of the die as a dangerous possession  mr vertue saw it in 1710 in the collection of a mr roberts but it has since disappeared  there was a stone inscribed to edward reynell and mary his wife who died respectively in 1698 and 1699  they are believed to have been friends of oliver cromwell the grandson who certainly named them in his will  there was a tradition in hursley that this reynell was actually the executioner of king charles    chapter vcustoms of the manor of merdon    as it was just at this time that the customs of the manor of merdon were revised this seems to be the fittest place for giving mr marshs summary of them  the quantity of land in cultivation within the manor of merdon or parish of hursley is as i imagine not less than threefifths of the whole or about 6000 acres of which the greater part was anciently copyhold under the bishop and church of winchester  the tenure by which it was held was and indeed is still that denominated borough english the most singular custom of which is that the youngest son inherits the copyhold of his father in preference of all his elder brothers  the origin of this tenure according to sir william blackstone is very remote it being his opinion that it was a remnant of saxon liberty 53 and was so named in contradistinction to the norman customs afterwards introduced by the conqueror from the duchy of normandy  the reasons commonly assigned for the peculiar usage just mentioned are given by blackstone but they are evidently not satisfactory to him and as it should seem not founded on truth  his own way of accounting for it is far more rational and probable though it must be confessed it is only conjectural  he supposes that the ancient inhabitants of this island were for the most part herdsmen and shepherds that their elder sons as soon as they arrived at manhood received from their father a certain allotment of cattle and removed from him and that the youngest son who continued to the last with him became naturally the heir of the family and of the remaining property  whether this were really the case or not will probably ever remain a question of great uncertainty and it is a circumstance of too trifling a nature to deserve much investigation  it is however worthy of remark that to this day this custom of descent to the youngest son prevails among the tartars and that something very like it was anciently the usage among most northern nations 54  but whatever be its origin or in whatever way it be accounted for such is the custom now existing in this manor and i have had frequent opportunities of observing that it is held especially by the inferior class of copyholders as sacred and that they would on no consideration divert their tenements out of the customary order of inheritance   but besides this custom there are others also in this manor which indicate great antiquity and which there can be but little if any doubt are the same as were in use before the norman conquest  we are told indeed by judge blackstone that after that event the ancient saxon system of tenure was laid aside and that the normans wherever they had lands granted to them introduced the feodal system and that at length it was adopted generally and as constitutional throughout the kingdom  there does not however i think appear to be sufficient reason for supposing that this new system was received into this manor the customs here in use being evidently those of a more remote age and in their circumstances if not in their nature altogether unlike those which were at this time established by the normans  under the feodal system the tenant originally held his lands entirely at the will of the lord and at his death they reverted to the lord again  the services to be performed for the lord were uncertain and unlimited  the copyhold was also subject to a variety of grievous taxes which the lord had the privilege upon many occasions of imposingsuch as aids reliefs primer seisin wardship escheats for felony and want of heirs and many more altogether so exorbitant and oppressive as often totally to ruin the tenant and rob him of almost all interest in his property 56  the difference of the circumstances under which the lands in the manor of merdon are and as it seems always were held is remarkably striking  here the copyhold is hereditary the services are certain and limited the fines are fixed and unchangeable the lord has no right of wardship neither is the copyhold liable to escheat for felony the widow of a tenant has also a right of inheritance and the tenement may be let without the lords consent for a year  all which circumstances appear to bespeak an original and fundamental difference of tenure from that of the feodal system and are i presume to be considered not as encroachments that have gradually grown upon that system but as being of a more liberal extraction and much greater antiquity 57a  but besides these differences the supposition here advanced has this farther ground to rest upon viz that neither the name of merdon nor that of hursley is so much as mentioned in the great survey of the kingdom called domesdaybook which if the intention of that survey be rightly understood 57b it seems next to a certainty that one or other of them would have been had the new system been here adopted  nor when it is considered that this was church property and that in many instances the alterations were not enforced 58 out of favour as it is supposed to the landholder who was partial to the more ancient tenure ought it to be thought extraordinary that the customs in this manor did not undergo the general change since if favour were desirable and shown to any who were so likely to expect and to find it as the clergy  but however this point may really be it appears evident that the tenants of this manor have from the earliest times to which we have the means of resorting for information enjoyed many unusual rights and immunities and that their services were in many respects far from being so base and servile as those of the strictly feodal tenant  when it was that disputes first arose between the lord and tenants concerning their respective rights is not i believe known with certainty but it appears that in the time of mr maijor many of the lords claims were complained of by the tenants as usurpations as on the other hand many of theirs were by the lord as new and uncustomary  but it was in vain then for the tenants either to resist the lords pretensions or to assert their own such being mr maijors power and interest with the cromwellian government as to enable him as they well knew easily to defeat all their efforts in justice however to mr maijor it should be mentioned that he acted in one instance at least with great liberality towards the tenants as by him it was that the customary personal services were commuted for pecuniary paymentsan exchange which could not fail of being peculiarly acceptable to them as they were not only relieved by it from a service they considered as a grievance and performed reluctantly but had the prospect of being in the end great gainers by it  but though by this concession on the part of the lord some ground of discontent was removed yet disputes and animosities still continued to subsist with respect to other customs and no sooner was mr maijor dead and the cromwell family dispossessed of its power than the tenants laid aside their fears and renewed their opposition the circumstances of the times being now in their favour it might perhaps have been expected that they in their turn should establish all their claims without contention  the case however was quite otherwise as neither mrs cromwell nor her son would tamely forego any one of their supposed privilegeson the contrary oliver defended them in the true spirit of a cromwell and relinquished none but such as the decisions of a jury which were more than once resorted to deprived him of  in this state of strife and litigation things continued until the year 1692 when most of the principal tenants concurred in a determination to appeal to the court of chancery  a bill of complaint was accordingly presented to the court stating their supposed grievances and soliciting its interference  several hearings and trials ordered in consequence of this application for the investigation of the disputed customs then ensued after which though not till more than six years had elapsed the court finally adjudged and decreed the customs of the manor to be and continue for the future as they here follow   custom 1  that all the copyholds and customary messuages lands and tenements within the said manor are and have been time out of mind copyholds of inheritance demised and demisable to the copyholders or customary tenants thereof and their heirs in fee simple by copy of court roll according to the custom of the said manor  custom 2  that the

default of such issue of such customary tenant to the youngest brother or youngest sister but also for default of such brother and sister of such customary tenant to the next kinsman or kinswoman of the whole blood of the customary tenant in possession how far so ever remote  custom 3  that if any tenant of any copyhold die seized of any copyhold his wife living then she ought to come to the next

fine  custom 8  that every heir and tenant of any customary lands of the said manor may sell his inheritance during the life of the widow of his ancestor who enjoys such customary estate for life  custom 9  that it is lawful for any of the copyholders or customary tenants of the said manor to let her his or their copyholds for one year but not for any longer term without a licence from the lord

them at pleasure and may dig for stone coal earth marle chalk sand and gravel in their own grounds to be employed thereon and may also dig any of the commons or wastes belonging to the said manor for

was discontinued by either sir philip hobby or richard maijor but on the borders between hursley and baddesley at a spot called high trees corner near the railway is marked in the old map here stode gospell oke  it is not far from wools grave the next corner towards the baddesley road  there no doubt the procession halted for the reading of the gospel for rogation week  there are two curious entries in the old accounts   chirurchets 67 vi hennes and cockes as apereth  in the old customary which i had from john        44 seymour                                            and in the old book of fines written in 1577    the reve doth gather by his scores37 pounds 18 2 the bedell gathers the escheats the reve the rents and eggs and is keeper of the west heth   a small farm near the church was held by corpus christi college oxford having probably been granted by bishop richard fox the founder who held the see of winchester from 1500 to 1528  the bearing in his coat of arms was a pelican in her piety and the pelican was the name of the public house and of the farm that succeeded it down to the present day  the title as well as that of the college are of course connected with the emblem of the pelican feeding her young from her own breast  little pelicans alternately with tudor portcullises profusely adorn foxs chantry in winchester cathedral    chapter vicranbury and brambridge    great changes began at the restoration  robert maunder became vicar of hursley in 1660 on whose presentation is unknown but that he or his curate were scholars is probable since the entries in the parish registers both of hursley and otterbourne begin to be in latin cranbury had passed from dean young to his brother major general young and from him to his daughter the wife or sir charles wyndham son of sir edmund wyndham knight marshall of england and a zealous cavalier  brambridge closely bordering on otterbourne on the opposite side of the itchen though in twyford parish was in the possession of the welles family  brambridge and otterbourne are divided from one another by the river itchen a clear and beautiful trout stream much esteemed by fishermen  in the early years of charles ii a canal was dug beside the itchen for the conveyance of coal from southampton  it was one of the first formed in england and for two hundred years was constantly used by barges  the irrigation of the meadows was also much benefited broad ditches being formedwater carriages as they are locally calledwhich conduct the streams in turn over the grass so that even a dry season causes no drought but they always lie green and fresh while the hills above are burnt brown  another work was set in hand during the reign of charles ii namely the palace he designed to build in rivalry of versailles  sir christopher wren was the architect  the grounds were intended to stretch over the downs to a great distance and on the highest point was to stand a pharos whose light would be visible from the solent fountains were to be fed from the itchen and a magnificent palace was actually begun the bricks for it being dug from a clay pit at otterbourne which has ever since borne the name of dell copse and became noted for the growth of daffodils  the king lodged at southampton to inspect the work and there is a tradition derived from dean rennell that being an excellent walker he went on foot to winchester  one of his gentlemen annoyed him by a hint to the country people as to who he was whereupon a throng come out to stare at him at one of the bridges  he escaped and took his revenge by a flying leap over a broad water carriage leaving them to follow as they could  his death put an end to his design when only one wing of the building was completed  it was known as the kings house and was used as barracks till 1892 when it was unfortunately burnt to the ground  boyat or bovieres as it once was called had been a hundred and was probably more of a village than at present since up to 1840 there was a pound and stocks opposite to the single farmhouse that remained  the lands stretched from the hill to the river near which was a hamlet called highbridge just on the boundary between twyford and otterbourne  here was an endowed roman catholic chapel a mere brick building at the back of a cottage only distinguished by a little cross on the roof  there is reason to think that a good many dependants of the brambridge family lived here for there are entries in the parish register that infants had been born at highbridge but the curate of otterbourne could not tell whether they had been baptized  a new parchment parish register was provided in 1690 and very carefully kept by the curate john newcombe who yearly showed it up to the magistrates at the petty sessions when it was signed by two of them  a certain augustin thomas was a man of some property comprising a house and two or three fields which were known as thomass bargain till one was used as a site for the vicarage several surnames still extant in the parish are found in the register cox comley collins goodchild woods warehamanne and abraham were the twin children of john and anne diddams a curious connection with the name didymus twin which seems to be the origin  there must have been extensive repairs if such they may be called of the church probably under the influence of sir charles and lady wyndhamfor though cranbury house stands in hursley parish it is so much nearer to otterbourne that the inhabitants generally attend the church thereand two huge square pews in the chancel one lined with red baize the other bare were appropriated to cranbury and might well have been filled by the children of sir charles and dame james his wifejacoba in her marriage register at hursleyfor they had no less than seventeen children of whom only five died in infancy a small proportion in those days of infant mortality  the period of alteration is fixed by a great square board bearing the royal arms with the initials w and m and the date 1687  no notice was taken of the nassau shield and indeed it must have been put up in a burst of enthusiasm for the glorious revolution for the lion as best he can be recollected had a most exultant expression with his tongue out of one side of his mouth  the blackletter commandments on the chancel arch were whitewashed out and a tablet in blue with gold lettering erected in their stead on each side of the altar  the east window had either then or previously been deprived of all its tracery and was an expanse of plain glass with only a little remains of a cusp at the top of the arch  the bells were in one of the true hampshire weatherboarded square towers of which very few still exist in their picturesqueness  there were the remains of an old broken font and a neat white marble one of which the tradition was that it was given by a parish clerk named david fidler and it still exists as the lining of the present font  sir charles wyndham died in 1706 his wife in 1720  a small monument was raised for them in hursley church with an inscription on a tablet now in the tower purporting that the erection was by their daughters frances white and beata hall  frances was married to a man of some note in his day to judge by the monument she erected to his memory in milton church near lymington where his effigy appears an upright figure cut off at the knees and in addition to the sword in his hand there is a metal one with a blade waved like a malay crease by the side of the monument  the inscription is thus    thomas white esq son of  ignatius white esq of fiddleford in dorsetshire  he served three kings and queen ann as a commander in the guards and was much wounded  he was in the wars of ireland and flanders  he had one son who dyed before him  he departed this life on the 17th of february in the year 1720  this monument was erected by his widow frances one of the daughters of sir charles wyndham in the county of southampton   mrs white thus lost her husband and her mother in the course of the same year  her brother sold the cranbury property to jonathan conduitt esquire who was a noted person in his day  he married catherine barton the favourite niece and adopted daughter of sir isaac newton  it may be remembered that this great man was a posthumous child and was bred up by his mothers second husband barnabas smith rector of north witham lincolnshire so as to regard her children as brothers and sisters  hannah smith married one thomas barton of brigstock and her daughter catherine whose name mysteriously is found as suing for the price of property sold to charles ii for the site of the kings house at winchester lived with sir isaac newton was very beautiful and much admired by lord halifax for her wit and gaiety  it was even reported that she was privately married to him but this of course was mere scandal and she became the wife of jonathan conduitt educated at trinity college a friend and pupil of newton who had for many years assisted in the harder work of master of the mint and wrote an essay on the gold and silver coinage of the realm  he was member of parliament for southampton  sir isaac made his home with his niece and her husband till his death in 1727 when mr conduitt succeeded to his office as master of the mint and intended to write his life but was prevented by death in 1737  among the materials which mr conduitt had preserved is the record of newtons saying i do not know what i may appear to the world but to myself i seem to have been only like a boy playing on the sea shore and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary while the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me  a very curious relic of sir isaac survives in the garden at cranbury park viz a sundial said to have been calculated by newton  it is in bronze in excellent preservation and the gnomon so perforated as to form the cypher i c seen either way  the dial is divided into nine circles the outermost divided into minutes next the hours then a circle marked watch slow watch fast another with the names of places shown when the hour coincides with our noonday such as samarcand and aleppo etc all round the world  nearer the centre are degrees then the months divided into days  there is a circle marked with the points and divisions of the compass and within a diagram of the compass the points alternately plain and embossed  there is no date but the makers name john rowley and the arms of mr conduitt as granted in 1717  quarterly 1st and 4th gules on a fesse wavy argent between three pitchers double eared or as many bees volant proper  2nd and 3rd gules a lion rampant argent between six acorns or impaling argent 3 boars heads sable for barton  cresttwo caducean rods with wings lying fesse ways or  thereon a peacocks head erased proper  the mottocada uno es hijo de sus obras  each one is son of his deedstranslates the spanish  the 1st and 3rd quartering belongs to the old family of chenduite from which jonathan conduitt may have been descended  probably he could not prove his right to their arms and therefore had the fresh grant  mr conduitt died in 1737 leaving a daughter whose guardians sold cranbury to thomas lee dummer esquire from whom it descended in 1765 to his son of the same name  catherine conduitt married the son of viscount lymington afterwards created earl of portsmouth    chapter viithe building at hursley    in the year 1718 hursley was sold by cromwells two surviving daughters for 36000 pounds to william heathcote esq afterwards created a baronet  the heathcotes belonged to a family of gentle blood in derbyshire gilbert heathcote one of the sons was an alderman at chesterfield and was the common ancestor of the rutland as well as the hursley family  his third son samuel spent some years as a merchant at dantzic where he made a considerable fortune and returning to england married mary the daughter of william dawsonne of hackney he was an intimate friend of the great locke and assisted him in his work on preserving the standard of the gold coin of the realm  he died in 1708 his son william and brother gilbert attained to wealth and civic honours  sir gilbert was lord mayor in 1711 and was the last who rode in procession on the 9th of november  both were whigs though the jacobite lord mayor whose support was reckoned on by the stuarts was their cousin  at about twentyseven years of age william heathcote married elizabeth only daughter of thomas parker earl of macclesfield and had in course of time six sons and three daughters  he was mp first for buckingham and afterwards for southampton  he was created a baronet in 1733  there were plans drawn for enlarging the old lodge in which the hobbys and cromwells had lived but these seem to have been found impracticable and it was decided to pull the house down and erect a new one on a different site  tradition and noble in his cromwell declared that the change was from dislike of the cromwell opinions and usurpations but mr marsh considers this mean and illiberal and combats it sharply  the new and much more spacious building was placed a little higher up on the hill with a wide bowlinggreen on the south side where in dry summers the old foundations of the former house can be traced the walnut avenues leading up to it  the house was in the style that is now called queen anne of red brick quoined with stone with largeframed heavy sash windows and double doors to each of the principal rooms some of which were tapestried with gobelin arras representing the four elementsjuno with all the elements of the air ceres presiding over the harvest for the earth vulcan with the emblems of fire and amphitrite drawn by tritons personifying water  there was then a great central entrancehall in the middle of the northern side of the house with stone steps going up at each end outside but as we see from drawings and prints of the time with no carriageapproach to the house so that people must have driven up to the front door over the grass  sir william died in 1751 fiftyeight years old  his son sir thomas born in 1721 was the builder of old hursley church which was begun in 1752 and completed the next year only the tower being left of the former edifice  in 1808 some few capitals of the old pillars remained in parts of the village and were adjudged by mr marsh to be saxon  it was said that the inside was very dark the ground outside being nearly on a level with the windows and six or eight steps descending to the floor  it was all swept away and the new structure was pronounced by mr marsh to be exceedingly neat light and airy  it was 82 feet long and 49 broad with two aisles and an arched ceiling supported on pillars  it might well be light for the great roundheaded windows were an expanse of glass very glaring in sunshine though mitigated by the waving limetrees  the plan and dimensions followed those of the old church and were ample enough the north aisle a good deal shorter than the chancel and all finished with gables crowstepped in the dutch fashion  it was substantially paved within and was a costly and anxiously planned achievement in the taste of the time carefully preserving all the older monuments  a mausoleum in the same style was built for the heathcote family in the southwestern corner of the churchyard and gradually the white washed walls of the church became ornamented  with the hatchments of each successive baronet and his wife the gentlemens shields with the winged globe as crest and the motto deus prosperat justos the ladies lozenge finished with a deaths head above and resurgam below  sir thomas was twice married and had eight children  he died at sixtyfive years of age on 29th of june 1787  he was succeeded by his eldest son the second sir william who was born in 1746 and was member for the county in three parliaments  he was a man of great integrity humanity and charity very affable and amiable and unassuming in his manners and he died as he had lived fearing god  he married frances daughter and coheiress of john thorpe of embley and had seven children  his eldest son sir thomas married the heiress of thomas edwards freeman of batsford gloucestershire in 1799 and was known as sir thomas freeman heathcote  he was member for the county from 1808 till 1820 when he retired  he is reported to have known an old man who said he had held a gate open for oliver cromwell but this must have meant the grandson who died in 1705  sir thomas died without issue in his fiftysixth year on the 21st day of february 1825    chapter viiiold otterbourne    thomas dummer esquire who in 1765 succeeded his father in the possession of cranbury was a man to whom some evil genius whispered have a taste for in 1770 he actually purchased the city cross of winchester to set it up at cranbury but happily the inhabitants of the city were more conservative than their corporation and made such a demonstration that the bargain was annulled and the cross left in its proper place  he consoled himself with erecting a tall lath and plaster obelisk in its stead which was regarded with admiration by the children of the parish for about sixty years when weather destroyed it  he also transported several fragments from netley abbey which formed part of his property at weston near southampton and set them up in his park as an object from the windows  there is an arch the base of a pillar and a bit of gateway tower but no one has been able to discover the part whence they came so that not much damage can have been done  the rear of the gateway has been made into a keepers lodge and is known to the village of otterbourne as the castle  he is also said to have had a kind of menagerie and to have been once in danger from either a bear or a leopard the man at hursley who rescued him did not seem in his old age to be clear which it was though he considered himself to have a claim on the property  it would not have been easy to substantiate it for mr dummer died without heirs about 1790 leaving his property at cranbury and netley first to his widow and after her to the chamberlayne family  mrs dummer lived many years after her husband and married an artist then of some note sir nathanael dance who assumed the name of holland and in 1800 was created a baronet  he threw up painting as a profession but brought several good pictures to cranbury  his wife survived him till 182324 when william chamberlayne mp for southampton came into the property and from him in 1829 it descended to his nephew thomas chamberlayne esquire  brambridge had a more eventful history  from the welleses it passed to the smythes also roman catholics  walter smythe the first of these was second son of sir john smythe of acton burnell in derbyshire  his daughter mary anne was married at nineteen to one of the welds of lulworth castle who died within a year and afterwards to thomas fitzherbert who left her a childless widow before she was twentyfive  it was six years later that after vehement passionate entreaties on the part of george prince of wales and even a demonstration of suicide she was wrought upon to consent to a private marriage with him which took place on the 21st of december 1785 at her house in park lane the ceremony being performed by a clergyman of the church of england in the presence of her uncle and one of her brothers  so testifies jesse in his life of george iii  nevertheless there is at twyford a belief that the wedding took place at midnight in the bare little roman catholic chapel at highbridge and likewise in brambridge house where the vicar officiated and was sworn to secrecy  the register it is said was deposited at couttss bank under a lock with four keys  the connection with twyford was kept up while the lady lived but no one remains who can affirm the facts her first marriage in early youth was most probably as described at brambridge  her very small wedding ring is also extant but neither ring nor ceremony can belong to her royal marriage  it would be curious that the adjoining parish of marwell likewise had to boast if that is a right word of henry viiis marriage with jane seymour  mrs fitzherbert certainly visited brambridge for an old gardener named newton and miss frances mary bargus who came to live at otterbourne in 1820 remembered her and the latter noted her fine arched brows  george ivs love for her was a very poor thing but she was the only woman he ever had any real affection for and he desired that her miniature should be buried with him  she survived him for many years and died in 1837 at eightyone years old  her brother walter was one of the english who visited paris and was made prisoner by napoleon i at the rupture of the peace of amiens and detained till 1814  while he was a prisoner his brother charles caused all the limes in the avenue at brambridge to be pollarded and sold the tops for gun stocks  nevertheless the trees are still magnificent making three aisles all the branches inwards rising up perpendicularly those without sweeping gracefully down and all budding and fading simultaneously  the pity is that the modern house should not have been built at one end or the other so that they form actually a passage that leads to nothing  since his death the property has been sold and has passed into strangers hands  the endowment of the chapel has been transferred to one at eastleigh and the house to which it was attached belongs to a market garden  the two parishes were near enough to the coast to be kept in anxiety by the french schemes for landing  the tenant of the winchester college property at otterbourne is said to have kept all her goods packed up and to have stirred the fire with a stick all through one winter and as late as between 184050 mr bailey of hursley still had in his barn the seats that had been prepared to fit into the waggons that were to carry the women into the downs in the event of a battle  the rev john marsh who in 1808 collected the memoranda of hursley and dedicated them to sir william heathcote was curate of hursley and incumbent of baddesley  the vicar was the rev gilbert heathcote fifth son of sir thomas second baronet  he was afterwards archdeacon of winchester and a canon of winchester  he was a man of great musical talent and some of his chants are still in use  the only other fact recollected of him was that being told that he used hard words in his sermons he asked a labourer if he knew what was meant by predestination and was answered yes sir someat about the innards of a pig  he generally resided there mr marsh remained curate of hursley and was presented to the living of baddesley  all this time otterbourne had only one sunday service alternately matins or evensong and the church bell was rung as soon as the clergyman could be espied riding down the lane  old customs so far survived that the congregation turned to the east in the creed always stood up if not sooner when alleluia occurred at the end of the very peculiar anthems and had never dropped the response thanks be to thee o lord at the end of the gospel  the holy communion was celebrated four times a year 35 7d being paid each time for the elements as is recorded in beautiful writing in the church raiting book which began to be kept in 1776 washan the surples before easter cost 4s a communion cloth tenpence and for washing and marking it sixpence  a new bell cost 5 pounds  5  10 and its carridge from london 11s 10d whitewashing the church came to 1 pound  1s and work in the gallery to 10s 4d  besides there was a continual payment for dozens of sprow heads also for fox heads at threepence apiece for a badgers head a poul cat marten cats and hedgehogs  these last together with sparrows continue to appear till 1832 when the rev robert shuckburgh in the vestry protested against such use of the church rate and it was discontinued  mr shuckburgh was the first resident curate at otterbourne being appointed by the archdeacon he was the first to have two services on sunday though still the antecommunion service was read from the desk and he there pulled off his much ironmoulded surplice from over his gown and ascended the pulpit stair  the clerk limped along the aisle to the partitioned space in the gallery to take part in the singing  but changes were beginning  the direct coaching road between winchester and southampton had been made and many houses had followed it  the road that crosses colden common and leads to portsmouth was also made about the same time and was long called cobbetts road from that remarkable selftaught peasant reformer william cobbett who took part in planning the direction  cobbett was a friend of mr harley a retired tradesman who bought the cottage that had belonged to a widow named science dear and enlarged it  several american trees were planted in the ground by cobbett of which only one survives a hickory together with some straggling bushes of robinia which cobbett thought would make good hedges being very thorny and throwing up suckers freely but the branches proved too brittle to be useful  about 1819 mr harley sold his house and the paddock adjoining to mary bargus widow of the rev thomas bargus vicar of barkway in hertfordshire and she came to live there with her daughter frances mary  in 1622 miss bargus married william crawley yonge youngest son of the rev duke yonge vicar of cornwood devon of the old family of yonges of puslinch he then retired from the 52nd regiment in which he had taken part in the pyrenean battles and in those of orthez and toulouse and had his share in the decisive charge which completed the victory of waterloo  they had two children charlotte mary born august 11th 1823 and julian bargus born january 31st 1830    chapter ixchurch building    a new era began in both hursley and otterbourne with the accession of sir william heathcote the fifth baronet and with the marriage of william yonge  sir william was born on the 17th of may 1801 the son of the rev william heathcote rector of worting hants and prebendary of the cathedral of winchester second son of sir william third baronet his mother was elizabeth daughter of lovelace bigg wither of manydown park in the same county  she was early left a widow and she bred up her only son with the most anxious care  she lived chiefly at winchester and it may be interesting to note that her son remembered being at a twelfthday party where jane austen drew the character of mrs candour and assumed the part with great spirit  he was sent first to the private school of considerable reputation at ramsbury in wiltshire kept by the rev edward meyrick and after four years there became a commoner at winchester college where it is said that he and dr william sewell were the only boys who jointly retarded the breaking out of the rebellion against dr gabell which took place after their departure  however in april 1818 he left winchester and became a commoner of oriel college oxford where his tutor was the rev john keble only eight years older than himself and not yet known to fame but with an influence that all who came in contact with him could not fail to feel  in 1821 mr heathcote gained a firstclass in his ba examination and was elected fellow of all souls in november 1822  he began to read at the temple but in april 1825 he came into the property of his uncle and in the november of the same year he married the hon caroline frances perceval the youngest daughter of charles george lord arden  both he and his wife were deeply religious persons with a strong sense of the duties of their station  education and influence had done their best work on a character of great rectitude and uprightness even tending to severity such as softened with advancing years  remarkably handsome and with a highbred tone of manners he was almost an ideal country gentleman with however something of stiffness and shyness in early youth which wore off in later years  in 1826 he became member for the county on the tory interest  as a landlord he is remembered as excellent  his mother took up her abode at southend house in hursley parish and under the auspices of the heathcote family and of the misses marsh daughters of the former curate sunday and weekday schools were set on foot the latter under mrs ranger and her daughter whose rule continued almost to the days of national education  one of his first proceedings was to offer the living of hursley to the rev john keble who had spent a short time there as curate in 1826  it was actually accepted when the death of a sister made his presence necessary to his aged father at fairford in gloucestershire and for two years during which the publication of the christian year took place he remained in charge of a small parish adjacent to his home  about 1824 mrs yonge began to keep the first sunday school at otterbourne in a hired room teaching the children all girls chiefly herself and reading part of the church service to them at the times when it was not held at church  the only weekday school was on the hill kept by a picturesque old dame whose powers amounted to hindering the children from getting into mischief but whowith the instinct mrs charles describesnever forgave the advances that disturbed her monopoly  in 1826 as mrs yonge was looking at the empty space of a roadway that had led into the paddock before it became a lawn she said how i should like to build a school here  well said her mother mrs bargus you shall have what i can give  mrs yonge contrived the room built of cement with two tiny ones behind for kitchen and bedroom for the mistress and a brick floor and the first mistress mrs creswick was a former servant of archdeacon heathcotes  she was a gentle woman with dark eyes and a lame leg so that she could not walk to church with the children who sat on low benches along the nave under no discipline but the long stick master oxford the clerk brandished over them  nor could she keep the boys in any order and the big ones actually kicked a hole nearly through the cement wall behind them  at last under the sanction of the rev gilbert wall heathcote who had succeeded his father as vicar of hursley a rough cast room was erected in the churchyard where master oxford kept school with more upright goodness than learning and mr shuckburgh the curate and mr yonge had a sunday school there  the riots at the time of the reform bill did not greatly affect the two parishes though a few villagers joined the bands who went about asking for money at the larger houses  george sir williams second son told me that he remembered being locked into the strong room on some alarm but whether it came actually to the point of an attack is a question  it was also said that one man at otterbourne hid himself in a bog that the rioters might not call upon him and one other man james collins went about his work as usual and heard nothing of any rising  one consequence of the riotous state of the country was the raising of troops of volunteer yeomanry cavalry  charles shaw lefevre esq afterwards speaker and lord eversley was colonel sir william was major and captain of such a troop mr yonge a captain but at one of the drills in hursley park a serious accident befell sir william his horse threw back its head and gave him a violent blow on the forehead which produced concussion of the brain  he was long in recovering and a slight deafness in one ear always remained  in 1835 a far greater trouble fell on him in the death of the gentle lady heathcote leaving him three sons and a daughter  in the midst of his grief he was able to bring his old friend and tutor nearer to him  mr keble at the funeral gave him the poem as yet unpublished   i thought to meet no more   which had been written after the funeral of his own sister mary anne keble  the elder mr keble died in the course of the same year and mr gilbert wall heathcote resigning the living to become a fellow of winchester it was again given to the rev john keble  mr heathcote had brought to otterbourne a young fellow of new college a deacon just twentythree the reverend william bigg wither who came for six weeks and remained thirtyfive years  he found only twelve communicants in the parish and left seventy  mr keble was already known and revered as the author of the christian year and was professor of poetry at oxford when he came to hursley having married on the 10th of october 1835 charlotte clarke the most perfect of helpmeets to pastor or to poet save only in the frailness of her health  he had two years previously preached at oxford the assize sermon on national apostasy which newman marks as the beginning of the awakening of the country to church doctrine and practice  he and his brother were known as contributors to the tracts for the times which were rousing the clergy in the same direction but which were so much misunderstood and excited so much obloquy that mr norris of hackney himself a staunch oldfashioned churchman who had held up the light in evil times said to his young friend the rev robert francis wilson a firstclass oriel man to whom the curacy of hursley had been offered now remember if you become kebles curate you will lose all chance of preferment for life  mr wilson though a man of much talent was willing to accept the probability which proved a correct augury  the new state of things was soon felt  daily services and monthly eucharists began and the school teaching and cottage visiting were full of new life  otterbourne had even before mr kebles coming begun to feel the need of a new church  the population was 700 greatly overflowing the old church so that the children really had to be excluded when the men were there  it was also at an inconvenient distance from the main body of the inhabitants who chiefly lived along the high road  moreover the south western railway was being made and passed so near that to those whose ears were unaccustomed to the sound of trains it seemed as if the noise would be a serious interruption to the service  mr yonge had begun to take measures for improving and enlarging the old church but was recommended to wait for the appointment of the new incumbent  mr keble threw himself heartily into the scheme and it was decided that it would be far better to change the site of the church at once  the venerable dr routh who was then president of st mary magdalen college and used yearly to come on progress to the old manor house the moat house to hold his court took great interest in the project and the college gave an excellent site on the western slope of the hill with the common crossed by the high road in front and backed by the woods of cranbury park  also a subscription of large amount was given  sir william heathcote as patron as well as mr keble contributed largely and mr bigg wither gave up his horse and presented 25 pounds out of each payment he received as fellow of new college  other friends also gave and first and last about 3000 pounds was raised  church building was much more difficult in those days than in these ecclesiastical architecture had scarcely begun to revive and experts were few if any indeed deserved the title  an architect at winchester mr owen carter was employed but almost all the ideas and many of the drawings of the details came from mr yonge who started with merely the power of military drawing acquired before he was sixteen years old and a great admiration for york cathedral  the cruciform plan was at once decided on traced out at first with a stick on cranbury grand drive but the slope of the ground hindered it from being built duly east and west the material is brick so burnt as to be glazed grey on one side  hearing of a church corstan wiltshire with a bellturret likely to suit the means and the two bells mr yonge and mr wither rode to see it and it was imitated in the design  the chancel was as in most of the new churches built at this time only deep enough for the sanctuary as surpliced choirs had not been thought possible in villages and so many old chancels had been invaded by the laity that it was an object to keep them out  mr yonge sought diligently for old patterns and for ancient carving in oak and in wardour street he succeeded in obtaining five panels representing the blessed virgin and the four latin fathers which are worked into the pulpit also an exceedingly handsome piece of carving which was then adapted as altarrailevidently flemish with scrolls containing corn and grapes presided over by angels and with two groups of kneeling figures on one side apparently an emperor with his crown laid down and the collar of the golden fleece around his neck followed by a group of male figures one with a beautiful face  on the other side kneels a lady not an empress with a following of others bringing flowers  at the divisions stand religious of the four orders one a man  the idea is that it probably represents either the coronation of maximilian or the abdication of charles v  in either case there was no wife but the crown is not imperial and that is in favour of maximilian  on the other hand the four monastic orders are in favour of charles vs embracing the religious life  for the stonework mr yonge discovered that the material chiefly used in the cathedral was caen stone though the importation had long ceased  he entered into communication with the quarrymen there sent out a stone mason newman from winchester and procured stone for the windows reredos and font thus opening a traffic that has gone on ever since  mistakes were made from ignorance and lack of authoritative precedent before ecclesiology had become a study but whatever could be done by toil intelligence and selfdevotion was done by mr yonge in those two years and the sixty years that have since elapsed have seen many rectifications of the various errors  even as the church stood when completed it was regarded as an effort in the right direction and a good example to church builders  the first stone was laid in whitsunweek 1837 by julian bargus mr yonges fiveyearold son  a school for the boys was built on a corner of the ground intended as churchyard and a larger room added to the girls the expense being partly defrayed by a bazaar held at winchester and in part by charlotte yonges first book the chateau de melville which people were good enough to buy though it only consisted of french exercises and translations  the consecration took place on the 30th of july 1838 and immediately after daily matins were commenced  so that the church of st matthew has never in sixty years been devoid of the voice of praise except during casual absences  most of the trees in the churchyard were planted by mr bigg wither especially the great sequoia and the holly hedge around was grown by him from the berries of the first christmas decoration which he sowed in a row under the wall of the boys school and transplanted when large enough  it was in 1839 that mr keble published his oxford psalter a work he had been engaged on for years paying strict and reverent attention to the hebrew original and not thinking it right to interweave expressions of his own as guidance to meaning  his belief was that holy scripture is so manysided and so fathomless in signification that to dwell on one point more than another might be a wrong to the full impression and an irreverence in the translation  thus as a poet he sacrificed a good deal to the duty of being literal but his translation is a real assistance to students and it is on the whole often somewhat like to sternholds whom he held in much respect for his adherence to the originals  perhaps it may be mentioned here that the parishes of hursley and otterbourne were in such good order under the management of sir william heathcote and mr yonge that under the new poor law they were permitted to form a small union of four afterwards five and now six parishes  ampfield was a hamlet lying on the western side of hursley park and wood a very beautiful wood in parts of oak and beech trees which formed lovely vaulted arcades one of which mr keble used to call hursley cathedral  the place was increasing in population and nearly two miles of woodland and park lay between it and the parish church  sir william heathcote therefore resolved to build a church for the people and mr yonge was again the architect and clerk of the works profiting by the experience gained at otterbourne so as to aim at early english rather than decorated style  a bell turret discovered later at leigh delamere in wiltshire was a more graceful model than that of corston  the situation was very beautiful cut out as it were of the pine plantation on a rising ground above the road to romsey so that when the first stone was laid by gilbert vyvyan sir williams third son the psalm lo we heard of the same at ephrata and found it in the wood sounded most applicable  st mark was the saint of the dedication which fell opportunely on 21st april 1841 very near mr kebles birthday st marks day and to many it was a specially memorable day as the rev j h newman was present with his sister mrs thomas mozley and her husband then vicar of cholderton and the rev isaac williams a sacred poet whose writings ought to be better known than they are was also present the endowment was provided by the chapter of winchester giving up the great tithes and a subscription of which t white esq of ampfield gave 500 pounds  the rev robert francis wilson was the first curate being succeeded in the curacy of hursley by the rev peter young then a deacon who inhabited the old vicarage  the present one which had been built by sir thomas freeman heathcote was made over to the living by sir william some years later  immediately after the consecration sir william was married to selina daughter of evelyn john shirley esq of eatington warwickshire a marriage occasioning great happiness and benefit to all the parish and neighbourhood    chapter xhursley church    in one of his prose writings mr keble speaks of the faithful shepherd going on his way though storms may be raging in the atmosphere and such might be a description of his own course as regarded his flock though there were several of these storms that affected him deeply  one gust came very near home  the diocesan bishop charles sumner was an excellent and conscientious man with a much deeper sense of his duties as a bishop than his immediate predecessors and of great kindness and beneficence but he had been much alarmed and disturbed by the alleged tendencies of the tracts for the times and shared in the desire of most of the authorities to discourage their doctrines and practice  when therefore the curate of hursley came to farnham to be admitted to the priesthood he was required contrary to the usual custom with candidates to state categorically his views upon the holy eucharist  he used the expressions of the catechism also those of bishop ridley but was desired to use his own individual words and when these were sent in he was rejected though they did not outrun the doctrine that had always been taught by the close followers of the doctrine of the catechism  nevertheless in spite of this disapproval there was no withdrawal of his licence and he remained at hursley not thinking it loyal to seek ordination from another bishop as would readily have been granted  he married mrs kebles cousin miss caroline coxwell and their young family was an infinite source of delight to the childless vicarage  their baby ways to one who held that where christened infants sport the floor is holy and who read a mystical meaning into many of their gestures and words were a constant joy and inspiration and there grew up a store of poems upon them and other little ones especially the children of dr george moberly then headmaster of winchester college later bishop of salisbury  these mr keble thought of putting together for publication being chiefly impelled to do so by the desire to improve hursley church the eighteenth century arrangement of which really prevented the general inculcation of the more reverent observances which teach and imply doctrine  in consideration of the feelings of certain old parishioners and the other more pressing needs as well as of the patience with which so great an enterprise needed in his mind to be contemplated nine years had elapsed since his incumbency had begun before he wrote  we are stirring about our church and next spring i hope really to go to work you must come and see the plans first or else hereafter for ever hold your peace in respect of alleging impediments  one feels that ones advanced age has not rendered one fitted to set about such works but really the irreverence and other mischiefs caused by the present state of hursley church seem to leave one no choice  the step that had first been taken was one for which many generations far and wide have reason to be grateful the arrangement and publication of the lyra innocentium to a certain degree on the lines of the christian year so as to have one poem appropriated to each sunday and holy day though these were only fully marked off in a later edition  the book is perhaps less universally read than the christian year and is more unequal some poems rising higher and into greater beauty some deeper and showing that the soul had made further progress in these twenty years some very simple in structure fit for little children yet with a grave and solemn thought in the last verse  those that are specially full of hursley atmosphere on events connected with the author may be touched on here  christmas eve vespers was suggested by the schoolmasters little daughter going into church before the decoration had been put up and exclaiming disappointed no christmas  the second sunday in lent recalls in the line on the mimic rain on poplar leaves the sounds made by a trembling aspen whose leaves quivered all through the summer evenings growing close to the house of mr kebles life long friend and biographer sir john taylor coleridge at ottery st mary  an engraving of raffaelles last picture the transfiguration hung in the vicarage drawingroom  the fourth sunday in lent on the offering of the lad with the five loaves was suggested by the stained window on that subject given by the young marquess of lothiana pupil for some years of mr wilson at ampfieldto the church at jedburgh built by his mother  now that he has passed away it may be remarked that he as well as all the children commemorated in these poems grew up so as to leave no painful impression connected with them  keep thou dear boy thine early vow was fulfilled in him as it was with george herbert moberly the eldest son of dr moberly who when a young child staying at the vicarage was unconsciously the cause of the poems loneliness and repeating the creed for easter sunday and low sunday  frightened by unwonted solitude at bedtime he asked to hear something true and was happy when mrs keble produced the bible he was a boy of beautiful countenance and his reverent thoughtful look as he repeated the creed delighted mr keble  it was little expected then that he was doomed to a lifelong struggle with invalidism though he was able to effect much as a thinker and a priest before he too was taken to see in paradise the glorious dream around him burst  it was a baby sister of his who drew herself up in her nurses arms with a pretty gesture like a pheasants neck in a sort of reproof as she said thank you to her little self when she had held out a flower to mr keble which for once in his life he did not notice and his selfreproach produced the thoughts of thankfulness  one of the gems of the lyra bereavement was the thought that came to the mind of the pastor as he buried the little sister the only child except the elder girl of the bailiff at dr moberlys farm  fire embodied his feeling about a burnt child at ampfield    we miss thee from thy place at school    and on thy homeward way where violets by the shady pool    peep out so shyly gay   the lullaby with the view of the burnished cross upon the spire and the girl singing the baby to sleep with the old psalm    in thee i put my stedfast trust defend me lord for thou art just   is another ampfield scene inspiring noble and gentle thoughts for innocents day  lifting up to the cross st jamess day was the product of a drawing brought home from germany of a sight beheld by miss maria trench on a journey with sir william and lady heathcote  she afterwards became mrs robert f wilson and made her first wedded home at ampfield and there is another commemoration of that journey in the fountain under the bank in ampfield churchyard an imitation of one observed in tyrol and with the motto       while cooling waters here you drink       rest not your thoughts below    look to the sacred sign and think       whence living waters flow then fearlessly advance by night or day the holy cross stands guardian of your way   more stars all saints day and wakefulness the annunciation are reminiscences of charles coleridge pode a little nephew of mr yonge and his ecstatic joy on the first night of being out of doors late enough to see the glory of the stars  a few months later on a sister being born he hoped that her name would be mary because he liked the virgin mary  and when only a few days later his own mother was taken from him he lay awake and silent night after night  he too was one who fulfilled his early promise till as a young physician he was cut off after much patient suffering  more stars is also attributed to an exclamation of one of mr peter youngs children but in point of fact most little ones have broken out in a similar joyous shout on their first conscious sight of the starry heavens  mrs keble used to forbear telling of the subjects of these poems lest as she said there might be a sort of blight on the children in breaking the reserve but most of them are beyond the reach of that danger in publicity and i can only further mention that the village children en masse and the curates in detail furnished many more of the subjects while still they only regarded mr keble as their best of playmates  they cheered him when the great sorrow of his life befell him in the secession of john henry newman hitherto his friend and fellow worker  it came at a time when perhaps he was most fitted to bear it when his brother in gloucestershire and his wife at home had just begun to recover from a terrible typhoid fever caught at bude  words spoken in the immediate prospect of death by mrs keble strengthened her husbands faith and made him more than ever determined to hold fast by the church of his fathers and the thankfulness and exhilaration caused by the improvement in her health carried him the better over the first blow though he went out alone to a quiet deserted chalkpit to open the letter which he knew would bring the final news of the reception of his friend into the roman church  nor did his hursley plans stand still  under the management of sir john taylor coleridge and other friends the christian year had become much more profitable and the lyra also brought in a considerable quota so that the entire work could be undertaken at mr kebles expense  it was decided partly by mr yonge himself that the enterprise was on too large a scale for his partial knowledge and moreover much progress had been made during these nine years in ecclesiology so that architects who had made it their study were to be found  the design was committed to william harrison esq a relation of archdeacon harrison a very old friend and contemporary  it followed the lines of the existing church which were found to be so solid and well built as for the most part only to need casing and not renewal nor was the old tower taken down  the contract with locke and nesham was for 3380 pounds exclusive of the flooring the woodwork and other fittings of the interior  for this 1200 pounds was set aside but the sum was much exceeded and there were many offerings from private friends  the altar of cedarwood was the gift of robert williams esq the altar plate was given by mrs heathcote the rails by the architect the font by the rev william butler and emma his wife and the clergy and sisters of wantage  mr butler was then vicar of wantage later canon of worcester and dean of lincoln  the present cedar credence table was made long after mr kebles death the original one was walnut matching the chancel fittings  this was proposed as the inscription on the base of the font to be entirely hidden   ecclesiae parochiali sanctorum omnium in agro hursleiense hunc fontem lavacrum regenerationis in honorem d n j c gratis animis ddd presbyteri diacones lectores sorores ecclesiae ss petri et pauli indigna familia apud wantagium   whether the whole was actually cut out on the under side of the granite step must be uncertain  the steps of the sanctuary have in encaustic tiles these texts  on the lowest   blessed are they that do his commandments that they may have a right to the tree of life and enter through the gates into the city   on the step on which the rails stand   blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled   on the next   blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted  blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see god   and on the highest   thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty they shall behold the land that is very far off   the lectern was the offering of the friend of his youth the rev charles dyson rector of dogmersfield copied from that at corpus christi college where they first met  the corbels were carefully chosen  those by the chancel arch are heads of st peter and st paul as exponents of the inner mysteries those by the east window are st athanasius and st augustine as champions of the faith  on the corbels of the north porch looking towards the hills of winchester are bishops andrewes and ken on the outside on the inside wykeham and waynflete  on the south porch st augustine of canterbury and the empress helena over the door on the outside bishop sumner and queen victoria to mark the date of building  how would you like to have the book boards of the seats wrote the architect perhaps it would suggest the idea of a prayer desk if they were made to slope as the chancel stalls  and certainly their finials do suggest kneeling and the arrangement is such that it is nearly impossible not to assume a really devotional attitude  a stranger clergyman visited the church measured the font and the height to the ceiling and in due time in 1850 there arrived the beautiful carved canopy the donor never being known  the windows did not receive their coloured glass at first but mr keble had an earnest wish to make them follow the wonderful emblematic series to which he had been accustomed in the really unique church of fairford where he had grown up  the glass of these windows had been taken in a flemish ship on the way to spain by one john tame a gloucestershire merchant who had proceeded to rebuild his parish church so as fitly to receive it and he must also have obtained the key to their wonderful and suggestive arrangement  fairford church is much larger than hursley so that the plan could not be exactly followed but it was always in mr kebles mind  it was proposed that the glass should be given by the contribution of friends and lovers of the christian year  two of the windows came from the offertory on the consecration day one threelight was given by mrs heathcote mother of sir william another by sir william and lady heathcote one by the marchioness of bath and one by the marchioness of lothian  the designs were more or less suggested by dyce and copley fielding but the execution was carried out by wailes under the supervision of butterfield  the whole work was an immense delight to mr keble and so anxious was he that the whole should be in keeping that the east window was actually put in three times before it was judged satisfactory  the plan of the whole was mr kebles own and though the colours are deeper and what is now called more crude than suits the taste of the present day they must be looked upon with reverence as the outcome of his meditations and his great delight  i transcribe the explanation that his sister elisabeth wrote of their arrangement   the hursley windows are meant to be a course of instruction in sacred history from adam to the last day the church being dedicated to all saints  the northwest window has adam and noah  the windows along the north aisle each represent two persons from the old testament  the threelight window on the north side david with the ground plan of the temple moses with the tables of the law solomon with the model of the temple  the medallion under moses is the altar of incense and some of the holy things  the whole of that window means to represent the fixing and finishing of the old religion  then comes in the north chancel isaiah jeremiah ezekiel and daniel the prophets preparing for the gospel  the northeast window has the circumcision connecting the law with the church with the figures of anna and simeon on each side  east window  the crucifixion the blessed virgin and st john on each side the agony bearing the cross and the scourging  the side window of the sanctuary has st stephen and st john the baptist as the nearest martyrs to our lord both before and after him and their martyrdoms underneath  the southeast window  the resurrection with soldiers at the sepulchre  st peter and st paul on each side  the south chancel windows  the four evangelists under st luke the disciples at emmaus under st john he and st peter at the sepulchre  the threelight south window  st james the less first bishop of jerusalem underneath the council in acts x 6  at his side two successors of the apostles st clement of rome phil iv 3 and st dionysius of athens acts xvii 34 to show how the church is built upon the apostles  in the west window the last judgment with st michael with his scales and answering to adam and noah in the west window of the north aisle and as a repentance window st peter and st mary magdalene in the west of the south aisle  in the two windows close to the font st philip and nicodemus for baptism   so were carried out the lines in the lyra innocentium      the saints are there the living dead the mourners glad and strong    this sacred floor their quiet bed their beams from every window shed    their voice in every song   the clerestory windows were put in somewhat later on finding that the church was dark and mr keble wished to have the children mentioned in scripture in outline upon them but this was not carried out  it was first thought probable that readers of the christian year and the lyra innocentium might have presented these stained windows but the plan fell through and the only others actually given were the repentance window representing st peter and st mary magdalene by mr harrison  two were paid for by special offertories and the rest were finally given by mr keble as the sums came in from his published writings  the spire completing the work was added to the ancient tower by sir william heathcote  the foundation stone a brass plate with an inscription surrounded by oak leaves and acorns was laid on the 29th of may 1847 but the spot is unknown  the entire cost exclusive of the woodwork and the gifts mentioned amounted to 6000 pounds  the large barn was used as a temporary church and there are happy recollections connected with it and with the elmshaded path between the park and the vicarage field when all sat on forms without the shade of pews example taught a lesson of reverent attitude to the congregation who felt obliged to lay aside any bad habits which might have grown up out of sight so as to be unconsciously prepared for the new church where the very width of the open benches and the shape of their ends are suggestive of kneeling in prayer  the period of the building was a time of enjoyment to mr keble for it was symbolical to him of the edifying building up of the living stones of the true church and the restoring her waste places  when the workmen were gone home he used to walk about the open space in the twilight silence in prayer and meditation  when the topmost stone was to be added on 18th october 1848 and the weathercock finally secured mr keble ascended to the elevation that he might set his hand to the work and there said a thanksgiving for the completionthe hands of zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house  his hands shall also finish it zech iv 9  the day of the consecration was an exceedingly happy one on 24th october 1848 the only drawback being that sir william heathcote was too unwell to be present  there was a great gatheringthe two judges coleridge and patteson and many other warm and affectionate friends and sir john coleridge was impressed by the sweet state of humble thankfulness of the vicar and his wife in the completion of the work  the sermon at evensong on that day was preached by mr keble himself in which he spoke of the end of all things and said the best fate that could befall that new church was that it should be burnt at the judgment day  he thought probably of the perils of perversion from true catholic principles which the course of affairs in these days made him dread exceedingly and hold himself ready to act like the nonjurors or the free kirk men in scotland who had resigned all for the sake of principle  nevertheless he wrote i suppose it is ones duty to go on as if all were encouraging  and he did go on and supported others till by gods providence the tide had turned and much was effected of which he had only dreamt as some day possible  it was in this frame of mind that the poem was composed of which this is a fragment      the shepherd lingers on the lone hillside       in act to count his faithful flock again    ere to a strangers eye and arm untried       he yield the rod of his old pastoral reign he turns and round him memories throng amain    thoughts that had seemd for ever left behind    oertake him een as by some greenwood lane the summer flies the passing traveller find keen but not half so sharp as now thrill oer his mind   for indeed every lapse in his parish turned to fill their pastor with selfblame    chapter xithe golden days of hursley    those forebodings of mr kebles mercifully never were realised many more years were granted in which hursley saw the church and the secular power working together in an almost ideal way  to speak of what sir william heathcote was as a county gentleman would be difficult  he was for many years chairman of the quarter sessions and it is worth recording that when king frederick william iv of prussia wished for information on the practical working of the english system of government and sent over two jurists to enquire into the working of the unpaid magistracy they were advised to attend the winchester quarter sessions as one of the best regulated to be found  they were guests at hursley park and as a domestic matter their interest in english dishes and likewise their surprise at the status of an english clergyman were long remembered  considerable county undertakings originated in these daysa new and wellmanaged lunatic asylum at fareham a renewed jail on the then approved principles and the inauguration of county police  in all these undertakings sir william heathcote and mr yonge were active movers and gave constant superintendence while they were carried out  ill health obliged sir william to retire from the representation of north hants in the conservative interest in 1847 but in 1854 on the recommendation of sir robert harry inglis he was elected member for the university of oxford and so remained till his final retirement in 1868  what he was in both public and private capacities has nowhere been better expressed than by the late earl of carnarvon in a letter to the editor of the times   long time a county member and intimately acquainted with the subjects and interests which formed the heritage of english county gentlemen he was as a chairman of quarter sessions recognised and often appealed to as the very representative and pattern of the class and when afterwards he accepted the blue riband of parliamentary representation as member for the university of oxford from first to last through all the waves and weathers of political and personal bitterness he retained the trust of friend and opponent  so long as he cared to keep that seat all men desired to keep him  for this was his special characteristic that in every period and pursuit of life in the public business of his county in the house of commons in the university he not only enjoyed respect and affection but he conciliated the confidence of all  it was the unconscious tribute to a whole life and character  for to a remarkable clearness and vigour of intellect he added a fairness of mind a persuasiveness and courtesy of manner with an inflexible uprightness of purpose which won to him friend and stranger alike i have never known any one who was not bettered by his converse but i think none outside his own county and society can fully appreciate the remarkable influence which his name and characterin the later years it might be truly said clarum et venerabile nomenexercised on all with whom he was connected  if indeed he had a fault it was that his standard of action was so high his nature so absolutely above the littleness of ordinary life that he attributed to inferior men far purer and more unselfish objects than those that really moved them  vixit enim tanquam in platonis politeia non tanquam in romuli faece  it is the common fault of biographers to overcolour the character of a favourite hero but those who knew sir william heathcote will admit that there is no exaggeration in what i have said  he was the highest product of a class and school of thought which is fast disappearing and which will perhaps find few representatives in the next generation  with change of time comes also change of men and the statesmen and politicians of the new world whatever their merits or demerits will probably be of a very different order from him of whom i am writing  the old university culture the fastidious taste the independence of thought the union of political life with county associationsbound up as they are in this case by a rare intelligence and a moderation of mind which trimmed with an almost judicial impartiality the balance of thought on all matters submitted to himare not a combination to be easily found in any age or society but it may be safely predicted that they will be even less common in the coming age than they were in the generation of which sir william heathcote was a representative and ornament  be this however as it may i desire by your favour to record here the loss of one who deserved if ever man did the name of an english worthy   this warmhearted tribute is the exact truth as all could testify who ever had occasion to ask sir williams advice or assistance another such testimony must be added from a speech of lord chief justice coleridge at nobodys club   i looked at him from another point of view and i can tell you only how he struck me a man much younger of different surroundings differing from him in many opinions political and religious  yet it is my pride and sorrowful delight to recollect that sir william heathcote gave me his friendship for nearly forty years and it is not presumptuous to say that his friendship deepened into affection i could not say if i would and i would not if i could all that he was to me how much of what is best if there is any in my life i owe to him how much affection and reverence has gone with him to his grave  his house was open like another home in joy and still more in sorrow his sympathy was always warm and ready in trouble and in difficulty his advice was always at hand  what advice it always was what comfort and strength there was in his company  for the time at least he lifted one up and made one better  inflexible integrity stern sense of duty stainless honour these qualities a very slight acquaintance with sir william heathcote at once revealed  but he had other great qualities too  he was one of the closest and keenest reasoners i ever knew  he was a man of the soundest and strongest judgment and yet full of the most perfect candour and full of forbearance and indulgence for other men  and for a man of his intellect and indeed for a man he was wonderfully modest and shy and of a humility which was as i saw it profoundly touching  yet there was no weakness in him  not unbecomingly not one whit more than was just he believed in himself in his position in his family he had dignity true and inborn without the need of self assertion and love and respect towards him went hand in hand  mr keble once said coming away from a long talk with him that it was like holding intercourse with some old christian knight  and so it was     i am not one of those who believe in the degeneracy of the race and i look forward to the future with hope rather than with dismay  i believe upon the whole the world improves  it is useless to be always looking back to be a laudator temporis acti se puero is placed by the wise and genial horace to the discredit and not to the credit of old age  but i do think that each age has its own virtues and its own type of excellence and these do not return  we may have good things but we shall not have the same good things  we shall have i hope good men and great men and noble men in time to come but i do not think we shall see again a sir william heathcote that most charming mixture of dignified self respect with unfailing gracious courtesy to others those manners in which frankness and refinement mingled with and set off each other that perfect purity of thought and utterance and yet that thorough enjoyment of all that was good and racy in wit or humourthis has passed away with him so beautiful and consistent a life in that kind of living we shall hardly see again  he was preserved to our time to show us of a later age a perfect specimen of the oldfashioned highbred highly cultivated county gentleman and a finer type of englishman it is hardly possible to conceive   these two portraits they are too true to be called eulogies thoroughly describe sir william as he was in friendship as he was not only to his original contemporaries but to their sons so that he came to be a generally looked up to father as it were to the magistracy of the county as well as the neighbourhood  a portrait of him by g richmond esq ra was subscribed for by the magistracy and placed in the county hall which began to be newly restored under his auspices so as worthily to show the work of henry iii in the beautiful old banqueting hall  already however a great loss had been suffered in william crawley yonge who had worked by his side in all his public undertakings carrying out all that was done in a spirit of thoroughness that never rested till perfection had been attained as far as possible  his own parish of otterbourne had felt his influence and was noted for good order and improvement  both otterbourne and hursley had land in allotments from at least 1830 long before the arrangement was taken up by government  mr yonges strong churchmanship and deep religious feeling told on all around and there was a strong sense of his upright justice as much as his essential kindness  the end came suddenly apoplexy brought on by the hurry and confusion of sending off his only son julian bargus yonge in the rifle brigade to the crimean war  he died on the 26th of february 1854  what shall we do without him were the first words of sir william heathcotes letter to mr keble on receiving the tidings  it should be mentioned here that six young men from otterbourne were concerned in the crimean warcaptain denzil chamberlayne and julian b yonge though health obliged the latter to return from varna while the former took part in the famous balaklava charge and was unhurt though his horse was killed  and four of the privates john hawkins james and william mason and joseph knight of whom only james mason lived to return  an inscription built into the wall of the churchyard records their names with the inscription suggested by mr keble it is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth  and here william yonges daughter must record sir williams never failing kindness to her mother and herself both in matters of business and in personal criticism and assistance in those matters in her works in which the counsel of a man acquainted with the law is needful to prevent mistakes  indeed in the discussions on character and adventures nothing was ever more evident to her than that she was talking as mr keble said to a true specimen of the most pure minded chivalry  on 16th september 1868 sir william retired from parliament and on the 9th of august 1870 was sworn of the privy council  this appointment gave him the greater satisfaction as a testimony to his consistent integrity through his whole parliamentary career as it came from the gladstonian ministry and he had been forced by his deep church and state convictions to separate from mr gladstone the friend and fellowworker of his younger days  his last great public achievement was the rebuilding and improvement of the county hospital  winchester had been the first provincial city to possess a county hospital and the arrangements had grown antiquated and by no means accordant with more advanced medical practice  a subscription was raised and with the warm cooperation of warden robert s barter of winchester college the present building was erected on mr butterfields plans in a more healthy and airy situation in the year 1868 with a beautiful chapel for the nurses and patients and with the modern system of nursing carried out  as was said when in 1878 sir william resigned the post of chairman of the committee he was the father and the founder of the institution  few men have earned by a lifetime so much honour gratitude and affection as he by one consistent upright course of life or have left a nobler memory  a few words we must give to the festivals  there was the yearly distribution of christmas beef to all the labourers and artisans employed on the estate and widows  there was occasionally a grand beating of the bounds of the manor of merdon followed by a dinner in a tent to the tenants at which the lord of the manor made a speech hoping that in times to come the days of the old sir william might be kindly remembered and somewhat later there were private theatricals performed chiefly by the family which were a great pleasure to friends and tenants  what a centre of hospitality cheerfulness and kindness hursley park was in those days can hardly be described though remembered by many as a sort of golden age of hursley    chapter xiihursley vicarage    the golden age of hursley did not deduce all its honour from the manor house  the vicarage was perhaps the true centre of the light which the park reflected or rather both knew that their radiance alike came from one source above in whose light they sought to walk  the happy sometimes playful intercourse between them may perhaps best be exemplified by the petition sent up by mr keble on an alarm that the copse on ladwell hill was about to be cut down in obedience to the dicta of agricultural judges who much objected to trees and broad hedgerows  ladwell or as it probably ought to be ladywell hill is a steep bank thickly clothed with trees and copsewood with cottages nestling under it on the southward road from hursley and on the top the pathway to field house the farm rented by dr moberly headmaster of winchester college since bishop of salisbury as the holiday resort of his family  it is a delightful place well worthy of the plea for its preservation   to the lord of the manor of merdon  the petition of sundry lifetenants or hereditary denizens of the said manor  humbly sheweth  that by custom of this clime even from immemorial time we or our forefathers old as in witherings list enrolled have in occupation been of all nooks and corners green where the swelling meadows sweet with the waving woodlands meet there we peep and disappear there in games to fairies dear all the springtide hours we spend hiding seeking without end and sometimes a merry train comes upon us from the lane every gleaming afternoon all through april may and june boys and maidens birds and bees airy whisperings of all trees with their music will supply all we need of sympathy now and then a graver guest for one moment here will rest loitering in his pastoral walk and with us hold kindly talk to himself weve heard him say thanks that i may hither stray worn with age and sin and care here to breathe the pure glad air here faiths lesson learn anew of this happy vernal crew here the fragrant shrubs around and the graceful shadowy ground and the village tones afar and the steeple with its star and the clouds that gently move turn the heart to trust and love    thus we fared in ages past but the nineteenth age at last as your suppliants are advised reigns and we no more are prized now a giant plump and tall called high farming stalks oer all platforms railings and straight lines are the charms for which he pines forms mysterious ancient hues he with untired hate pursues and his cruel word and will is from every copsecrowned hill every glade in meadow deep us and our green bowers to sweep now our prayer is here and there may your honour deign to spare shady spots and nooks where we yet may flourish safe and free so old hampshire still may own charm to other shires unknown bays and creeks of grassy lawn half beneath his woods withdrawn so from many a joyous child many a sire and mother mild for the sheltering boughs so sweet and the blossoms at their feet thanks with prayers shall find their way and we flowers if we may pray with our very best would own your young floweret newly blown  anemone nemorosa primula vulgaris orchis daffodil cowslip strawberry violet innumerable signatures etc etc etc ladwell hill 2nd april 1855   the young flowret newly blown was sir williams son godfrey who faded at seven years old  when his mind was wandering one of his dreamy utterances was i should like to fly softly  and therefore mr keble suggested that the words on his little grave outside the mausoleum should be who are these that fly as a cloud  the intercourse of the vicarage with the park as with all this neighbourhood was affectionate intimate or neighbourly and friendly according as there was likeness of mind  the impression left was always a cheerful one of hospitality and of a kind of being on holy ground  the house stands on the side of a rapid slope from the park with a terrace raised on brick arches overlooking the lawn only separated by a low wall from the churchyard  here in early summer the school children from both the outlying congregations met those of hursley at tea and for games in the park ending with standing round in the twilight below the terrace and singing the national anthem and bishop kens evening hymn  the anniversary of the consecration day falling late in the autumn was the occasion of a feast for the elders of the parish above sixty years old  this followed of course on festal services when those who heard it can hardly forget a sermon of warden barters on the 134th psalm when with the noble sweetness of his countenance lighted up he spoke of our delight in nature being the joy of a child in the beauty of his fathers house  a new organ had been given and the choir had been brought to great improvement during the few years that the rev w le geyt was at hursley  also a mission school chapel had been built at pitt a hamlet on the downs towards winchester and a second curate had been added to the staff  the present writer can only dwell with thankfulness too deep to be spoken on mr kebles influence not so much friendly as fatherly and he was the best and kindest of critics in literary affairs  but throughout the vicar was the personal minister to each individual of his flockteaching in the school catechising in the church most carefully preparing for confirmation watching over the homes and however otherwise busied always at the beck and call of every one in the parish  to the old men and women of the workhouse he paid special attention bringing them little dainties trying to brighten their dull minds as a means of reaching their souls and endeavouring to raise their spirits to higher things  one who had been removed to another union when asked how he liked hursley said it seemed as if they was saying holy holy holy all day long  during this time mr keble wrote his life of bishop wilson making two visits to the isle of man to study the situation and the documents there preserved various of the plain sermons some controversial pamphlets defending the cause of the church and above all the treatise on eucharistic adoration  he assisted dr j m neale in drawing up the salisbury hymnal a precursor of hymns ancient and modern and contributed several hymns especially those for rogation days for the service for holy matrimony and a very grand one for the feast of st john the evangelist which has not found place in hymns ancient and modern  all this time he was the prime counsellor and assistant to many engaged in church work or church defence among whom may be mentioned dr pusey bishop alexander forbes of brechin bishop walter hamilton of salisbury the rev w j butler of wantage dean of lincoln and canon liddon  to them hursley vicarage was a place of holy counsel and peaceful rest  bishop robert gray of capetown and the great bishop george augustus selwyn were warmly welcomed there on their visits to england and the young son of the lastmentioned john richardson selwyn when left in england for education often happily spent part of his holidays there  no doubt this had a share in his preparation for his future work in melanesia closed early by the failure of health that brought him after a few more years to his grave  another guest was queen emma of the sandwich isles literally the queen of the south come to hear the wisdom of the saint and last of all the friend and partner of his earlier work the sharer in the revival of the church from her torpid repose john henry newman who met dr pusey there for one last day fulfilling the words written long before    yet deem not on such parting sad shall dawn no welcome dear and glad   but neither of these two last visits took place till after the changes of old age had begun at hursley  the first great sorrow came in the death of elisabeth the wise gentle and quiet invalid sister who had been always part of mr kebles life and seemed above all to diffuse about her an atmosphere of peace and holiness  after a gradual almost imperceptible decay she sank to sleep on the 7th of august 1860 mrs kebles always frail health began to fail more and more so that winters in a warmer climate became necessary  dawlish penzance and torquay were resorted to in successive winters and mr keble began to revolve the question whether it might not become his duty to resign the living where to his own humble apprehension all his best efforts had failed to raise the people to his own standard of religion  however this was averted and he was still at his post when on the night of st andrews day the 30th of november 1864 as he was sitting up writing to dean stanley on a passage of which he disapproved in the history of the jewish church the hand of warning touched him with a slight stroke of paralysis  with complete rest at torquay and penzance during the winter he recovered to a considerable degree and came home to resume many of his usual habits but mrs kebles suffering from spasmodic asthma had become very frequent and it became necessary early in the autumn to remove to bournemouth  there they remained she gradually sinking and only distressed at the thought of his being left he bearing up in silent resignation and prayer till on the 22nd of march a mistake in using a cold instead of a hot bath brought on a shock and in four days more on maundythursday the 29th of march 1866 the voice of hursley and otterbourne was thy master is taken from thy head today  it was granted to her to be at rest concerning him before she followed six weeks later on the 11th of may to the double grave  it was on a beautiful day with the celandines shining like stars on the bank that we laid him in his grave a concourse of sorrowing friends being present who could look to him as having wakened and cherished their best aspirations and those who had come under his personal influence feeling that a loved father had been taken away it was on that day that alexander forbes bishop of brechin dr pusey dean hook sir william heathcote dean butler and others decided that the most fitting memorial would be the building of the college at oxford which bears his name and is pledged to church principles and to a scale of expenses not beyond the reach of less wealthy students  a monument was in due time raised above the graves designed by mr butterfieldmr kebles in red granite mrs kebles in derbyshire marble  the place in the chancel where the coffin of john keble priest of the parish had been placed before the mornings celebration was marked by a brass cross given by the parishioners who more and more felt that they had had among them a saint of god and can hardly fail to think of him when they sing o ye holy and humble men of heart bless ye the lord praise him and magnify him for ever    chapter xiiilater changes    in the october of 1853 the rev robert f wilson having resigned the curacy of ampfield he was replaced by the rev john frewen moor who on 12th january of the next year became perpetual curate and by and by vicar  improvements in the church advanced in his time  the stained glass of the east and west windows of the church were given by sir william and lady heathcote the southeast window is a memorial of mr keble the other south windows of mr moors three sons one of whom was drowned while preparing for mission work in newfoundland and another died on his return from what was truly a pilgrimage to the holy land  on mr kebles death the rev james gavin young brother to the much beloved curate the rev peter young was presented to the living of hursley  in 1871 the rev william bigg wither after thirtyfive years diligent work in the parish decided on accepting the rectory of hardwicke in buckinghamshire  great improvements had taken place in his time and he was greatly beloved by his flock from whom for nearly forty years he had never been absent for a single sunday and during all that time had given them the privilege of daily matins and evensong  as he never liked the acceptance of testimonials it was resolved that in memory of his long services a new girls school should be built the old one having become quite insufficient and with it a masters house with a tower to contain a village clock which was given out of the savings of mrs smith and her sister and brother miss and mr pink a kind old thatcher who will long be remembered  in that year 1869 bishop sumner resigned the see of winchester and for three years the diocese had the benefit of the great powers and eloquence of bishop samuel wilberforce whose confirmation addresses at each of the churches will be remembered for life by his candidates  the rev walter francis elgie became mr youngs curate at otterbourne and in 1875 the first vicar thereof sir william heathcote having arranged the means of undoing bishop pontissaras injustice  this was rendered practicable by the liberality of mrs william gibbs who purchased the advowson of otterbourne for a sum that sir william applied to the endowment of hursley so as to compensate for the loss of the tithes of otterbourne  by this time a considerable industry had grown up at allbrook with a saw mill and brick making and the inhabitants with a little assistance erected a mission chapel and school  there the kind and excellent rowland jones bateman esquire of the grange gave hearty assistance as a teacher and latterly as a licensed reader being thus appointed by bishop edward harold browne who succeeded to the see of winchester on the sudden death of bishop wilberforce  he came to reconsecrate otterbourne church when an apse had been added to the choir and several other alterations made with the view of rendering it more suitable for devout worship than knowledge or means had made practicable when the church was built and other alterations have since been made in the same direction  the kindly and openhearted squire of cranbury thomas chamberlayne esq died on october 1876 being succeeded by his son tankerville chamberlayne esq and brambridge after descending from the smythes to a niece the honourable mrs craven whose son sold it has since several times changed owners  on the 25th february 1881 otterbourne lost the first vicar mr elgie and the rev henry walter brock was presented to the vicarage when many improvements were further carried on  but change and decay mark every generation in turn and there is little else to record  the joyous genial days at hursley park had passed away and the days of agricultural depression had set in causing much trouble and anxiety with alterations met with simple bravery and cheerfulness according with the character that could bear adversity as nobly as prosperity  the rev thomas mozley in the somewhat discursive reminiscences of his latter years declares that long before he had seen one of mr kebles curates in tears at the possibility of the repeal of the cornlaws causing sir william heathcote to put down one of his equipages  none of the curates could recollect the occasion and certainly they lived to see what might have been more deplored for at the end of sir williams life there were actually only two little ponies in his stables  though never a very strong man he preserved all his powers and his kind interest and thorough attention to whatever was brought before him until the end came as to a shock of corn in full season and he was taken to his rest on the 17th of august 1881 leaving to all who knew him the precious recollection of emphatically a just man serving god in his generation  that simple walking funeral devoid of all pomp or show but attended by at least 130 friends did indeed show the esteem in which he was held as the moving spring of all the best undertakings for many years in the county and may hursley never forget that she is as it were consecrated by having been the home of two such men as john keble and william heathcote  still there are changes to record  julian bargus yonge after long inactivity from broken health sold the property at otterbourne to major robert scarlett and removed to london where he died a few days later in october 1891  in 1892 mr brock was invited to return to his house in guernsey to become rector of the parish of st pierre au bois in succession to his father and grandfather and the rev henry albany bowles became vicar of otterbourne  other changes had in the meantime taken place  the hursley estate including not only the manor of merdon but recent purchases had become much encumbered from the inevitable consequences of agricultural depression and after the provision for the family had been made of whom there were ten survivors besides lady heathcote it proved that the only way of clearing off the various liabilities was to sell  lady heathcote gave up her right to a life residence at hursley park and after 170 years of possession during which the family had well merited general affection and esteem they resigned themselves to the sale of the greater part of the property  the park the advowson of the living and the greater part of the parish were bought by joseph baxendale esq in 1888  the more distant portions were more gradually disposed of and recently the ground of cranbury common and hiltingbury has risen in value from brickmaking industries and the convenience of chandlers or chaloners ford station and a large and rising colony on the confines of five parishes otterbourne north stoneham ampfield hursley and baddesley  a school chapel was raised but soon proved insufficient and there is now a church  the place has been formed into a separate parish otterbourne resigning the hamlet of fryern hill ampfield part of fryern hill and numerous houses built among the plantations of cuckoo bushes and cranbury common and stoneham many houses placed among the trees of the former fleming property  and another change took place mr frewen moor from increasing age and loss of eyesight resigned the pastoral charge he had so carefully and affectionately fulfilled for fortyfour years and was succeeded by the rev vere awdry   rectors and vicars of hursley   john de raleghe rector d 1279 paganus de lyskeret rector 12801296    john de sta fide vicar hugo de welewyck rector 12961348    henry

sketch of the present appearance of the parishes in 1898  to begin at the west where the border is on romsey michelmersh and farley the romsey road formerly the direct road from winchester to salisbury running through it beside ampfield church and village this is high ground and ampfield wood extends along it to the borders of hursley park  it is chiefly of oak fir and beech and on the southern side are the fine arcades of beechwood that mr keble used to call hursley cathedral  from one point in the wood long sight can distinguish a sort of needle which is the spire of salisbury cathedral  the wood is very old probably primeval as it is guarded in the oldest notices of the manor of merdon and it contains a flora of its own in which may be mentioned that rare and beautiful melittis melissophyllum bastard balm like a purple and white archangel  the bilberry is plentiful there and all along the beautiful parklike road to romsey and salisbury  the church raised above the wayside fountain and the churchyard full of very beautiful varieties of pine still nestles into the wood and there is a charming view over the open country towards the south  farley chamberlayne which joins the wood on the other side rising much higher has a monument viewed from all the country round erected by one of the st john family to a horse which leapt down with him into a chalkpit of considerable depth and so alighted that neither horse nor man was hurt and the horse won the cup at the races the year after under the name of beware chalkpit  parnholt wood that clothes one side of the mount is beloved by botanists for possessing tracts of lily of the valley convallaria majalis and likewise paris quadrifolia a great rarity  the mount itself is bare chalk down 154 but has a wonderful view over the whole undulating countryto the southward the beginning of forest land and to the southeast where the beechwoods of south lynch begin to creep up the rapid slope of chalk there is delightful hunting ground for bee orchis ophrys apifera swarm careful search may discover the brown velvet blueeyed fly ophrys muscifera the quaint man and dwarf orchis can be found butterfly or honeysuckle orchis habenaria as we are constrained to term it is frequent and where the beechtrees begin there are those curious parasites which are the only plants they tolerate the listera nidusavis birdsnest orchis the monotropa hypopitys or yellow birdsnest the beautiful lilylike epipactis grandiflora while helleborine and the curious and capricious toothwort spiraea filipendula or dropwort gentiana amarella and other distinctive chalkdown plants are found  on the southern side of ampfield lies the parish of north baddesley which preserves the curious old hampshire village church with a timber bell turret  this side is where there once stood a gospel oak marking the place where the gospel was read when the bounds of the manor of merdon were trod at rogationtide  the whole tract is an extension of the new forest land almost all heather and bog undulating and in the drier spots growing bushes of the glistening holly  it is forest scenery without the trees excepting the plantations of fir made by a former generation but presenting grand golden fields of gorse in the spring and of red and purple heather in early autumn and whereas the northern side of hursley gives the distinctive flora of dry chalk here we have the growth of the black peaty bog the great broomrape brown and leafless growing on the roots of the gorse the curious dodder spreading a tangled red skein of thread over it gemmed with little round white balls the rare marsh cinquefoil the brilliant yellow asphodel the delicate exquisite bog pimpernel the blue skullcap the two weird and curious sundews and even in former times the beautiful dark blue gentiana pneumonanthe as well as the two pinguiculasvulgaris like a violet and the rarer lusitanica  but alas the giant called high farming is an enemy to the botanists and had starved out many of the choicest of these even before the building of villas at chandlers ford put a total end to most of them  hursley park touches on one side the forest land of ampfield wood and on the other the chalk of the south downs and it shows its length of having been reclaimed in the wellkept trees with their straight lines finishing their foliage beneath due to the feeding of deer and cattle  its chief beauty is when the thorns are like masses of snow  moreover there grows up from the moat at merdon over the back of the remains of the gateway a travellers joy with an enormous trunk that must be of many years duration  merdon castle is just where the chalk begins and from thence running down to the house itself there is a broad level space of deer park clear of trees and making a fit setting to the early georgian red brick house with the gardens on the other side containing several fine old lime trees  on all the sides except towards ampfield the ground falls away and the village of wellkept picturesque cottages lies in the valley beneath the park the tall white spire of the church making a beautiful object looking along the walnut avenue leading from the gardens  the limetrees enclose the church on three sides most fitly except in the eyes of an old woman some sixty years ago who objected to worshipping in a grove  at a short distance eastward of the churchyard begin the two roads both leading to otterbourne the northern one part of which still bears the name of kings lane is said to have been the way taken by purkiss cart when bringing william rufuss body to winchester  the southern road which is part of the romsey and southampton highway soon rises into the height of ladwell hill fields with very fine elms bordering it on the west and the copse of mr kebles petition on the east  at the gate of the wood is a patch of the rare geranium phaeun the dusky cranesbill but whether wild or a stray from a disused garden is doubtful  after another dip the road to otterbourne leaves the main one and skirts cranbury park and has on the opposite side the once open country since planted first with trees and later with houses leading to chandlers ford  the very pretty and uncommon linaria repens a toad flax white and striped with purple is a speciality that it is hoped may not be smothered with houses and gardens  a lane called even in 1588 mallibar runs southward over the heath and emerges into the southampton road  it is a grand place for heath ferns and broomrape with daffodils in a field at the end there are remains of a farmyard and orchard once apparently rented by mr coram of cranbury  cranbury park is on a hill intersected by various springs and where the peaty ground soon gives way to gravel  the house a large red brick one built round a court so that it looks low in proportion to its width is on the level ground at the top flat as it fronts to the south but in the rear descending rapidly  in fact on that side the grounds have the air of cresting the hill and there is a group of exceedingly tall pinetrees which are a landmark of the country on all sides though the tallest of them was blown down a few years ago  near them is one of the oldfashioned orangeries with a great deal of wall and very little glass and near it stands the sundial of newtonian fame  from the ridge where the pines stand the ground descends through very steep fields belonging to the home farm at longmore to kings lane where hursley parish touches upon compton at the hamlet of silkstede which is reported to have been a priory and has a fine old barn and a dell in the orchard full of snowdrops  no mention of it is in dugdales monasticon and it was probably only a grange but it still owns some very fine old trees the bordering copses are full of violets and the rare lathyrus nissolia has been found there  returning to the open park in front of cranbury there occurs that fitfully blooming plant ladystressesneottia spiralis autumnalis and a profusion of brownwinged orchis and cowslips  all the slopes are covered with copsewood much of it oak the tints of which are lovely shades of green in spring and goldenbrown in early autumn the whole is a place remarkable for masses of blossom  there are giant garlands of white wild cherry above in spring and equally white anemone below by and by an acre of primroses growing close together not large but wonderfully thick a golden river of king cup between banks of dogs mercury later on whole glades of wild hyacinth producing a curious effect of blue beneath the budding yellow green of the young birches with silver stems  sheets of the scarlet sorrel by and by appear and foxgloves of all sizes troop in the woods and are succeeded by the rose bay willow herb and lastly come perfect clouds of the little devilsbit scabious  ferns adorn the watery glens and bracken spreads on the undulating ground in wild beauty of form here and there enhanced by a bright faded tint of gold  at the bottom of the hill close to otterbourne church the gravel has given place to clay  on the side of the hill a rough hedge divides the private ground of the copse from otterbourne common and hill which is crossed by the old high road from london to southampton the very steep hill having had a cutting made through it  the cranbury side of the road has the village cricket ground on it though burrowed under by the concentric brickwork circles of the southampton companys water works which are entered by a little staircase tower cemented over so as to be rather ornamental than otherwise  beside it there is a beautiful view of a delightful home landscape stretching out on the south lie woods and low hills to the gleam of southampton water the smoke of the steamers and even the gray hills of the isle of wight  on the other side beyond the rich water meadows of the itchen valley may be seen the woods of colden common rising into concord hill and beyond them the view is closed by the broken outline of longwood warren  while more to the north there is visible the round smooth outline of the beechcrowned steep of st catherines hill  it is a charming prospect especially on a day of sunshine and clouds making shadows chase one another over the distance  nor except for a white thatched cottage and an extensive gravelpit by the road have the native charms of the hill been much disturbed and gorse heather and honeysuckle flourish till where the clay begins there is a grassy slope bearing a few elms and horsechestnuts  perhaps loaded waggons drop some of their seeds for on those cuttings through the gravel on the road side have sprung up the dainty little yellow stonecrop sedum acre and the storks bill erodium moschatum  these are plentifully spread over the cutting but the trifolium arvense which came for a few years seems to have vanished again  on the eastern side of the road lies the village green  the old cottages used to stand round in an irregular amphitheatre some with poplars before them and the name of maypolefield now allotments testifies to there having been sports there before the memory of the present man  the arrangements have been broken by modern building but right of common still protects the green expanse for donkeys and children including the more youthful cricketers not yet promoted to matches  from the top of the hill extends a large space of woodland known as otterbourne park  the higher part is full of a growth of beautiful ling in delicate purple spikes almost as tall as the hazel and mountain ash are allowed to grow  on summer evenings it is a place in which to hear the nightingale and later to see the glowworm and listen to the purring of the nightjar  it is a very ancient wood part of the original grant of st magdalen college and bears plenty of the yellow cowwheat which kingsley holds as the mark of primeval wasteland but it is not exceptional in its other plants except that a spring halfway down has the rare viola palustris around it the whole tract remained untouched till a pleasant residence called the grange was taken out of it to the south at a ground rent by rowland jones bateman esq whose beneficent kindness and excellent religious influence told on all the neighbourhood and especially on the hamlet of allbrook till his death in 1897  the parish here borders on bishopstoke and the grange commands a pleasant view over the water meadows and up the opposite bishopstoke hill  otterbourne park reaches down to where the meadows begin along the course of the itchen  in these meadows the willofthewisp has undoubtedly been seen as well as in a wet field in the central part of the parish but it is a disappointing phenomenonnothing but a misty pale bluish light rather like the reality of a comets tail and if he was by friars lantern led he must have had a strong imagination  probably drainage sawmills and brickmaking have exorcised jacko lantern for allbrook from a hamlet of four cottages has grown up into a considerable village with a schoolchapel of its own and a large population  the two farms called hams and boyatt border it on the southern or bishopstoke side and on the northern it extends to highbridge apparently so called from the lowness of the bridge where is another small hamlet half otterbourne half twyford and there was for many years a roman catholic chapel attached to a large cottage and distinguished by a cross  it was endowed but nearly all the flock having faded away the endowment was transferred to eastleigh and it is now inhabited by a market gardener with numerous glass houses  it is the real itchen that is crossed at highbridge  the canal goes through allbrook but both serve the purpose of irrigation and a network of ditches crosses the meadows  both river and canal too are excellent for fishermen who in the season can find   here and there a lusty trout and here and there a grayling   in the clear stream which now and then an otter inhabits soon to serve as sport for his many enemies  smooth and level the river is still an unfailing source of enjoyment in the walks along the towing path when moorhens are swimming and dipping on a glimpse of the spectator when fish are rising or sometimes taking a sudden header into the air and going down with a splash when the watervole rushes for his hole with head just above the water when a blue flash of kingfisher darts by and the deep blue or green dragonflies sit on the sedges or perhaps a tiny may fly sits on a rail to shake off its last garment and come forth a snowwhite fairy thing with three long whisks at the tail  the real itchen is the boundary and beyond lies brambridge  but on coming to the bridge over the canal the road leads westward towards otterbourne hill  first it skirts a stream a tributary to the itchen and goes between meadows till the old church is reached now only a chancel in the midst of old headstones and still bordered with trees on the bank between it and the stream  there are square brick monuments covered with stone slabs  in the interstices there used to be a great deal of adiantum nigrumblack maidenhair but it has disappeared  the flowers are quite different from those of the peaty marshes on the opposite side of the district belonging to an alluvial soil washed down from the chalk hills  the great reedmace adorns the itchen and going along the disused towing path of the canal there is to be found abundance of the black and golden spikes of the sedge and the curious balls of the burreed very like the horrid german weapon called a morning star  also meadowsweet meadowrue and comfrey of every shade of purple the water avens and forgetmenot also that loveliest plant the bogbean with trefoil leaves and feathery blossoms  orchis latifolia is in plenty and also orchis incarnata sometimes called the romsey orchis  of late years the mimulus has gilded the bank of one of the ditches  is it compensation for the pinguicula vulgaris which has been drained away or the mountain pink at highbridge which i suspect some gardener of appropriating  higher up the course of the river orchis conopsea longspurred and very sweet the compact orchis pyramidalis and the rare epipactis palustris are to be found as well as campanula glomerata and crow garlic in an old chalkpit nearly destroyed by the railway and the water works  otterbourne farm bounds the churchyard on the west side and below on either side of a low bridge stand two fine yew trees where boys in the old church days used to climb and devour the waxen berries with impunity  meadows lie on each side the road and on the left is a short lane leading up to the old manor house the moathouse but it is no longer even a farmhousethe moat is choked with mud and reeds and only grows fine forgetmenots and the curious panel picture of a battle apparently between turks and austrians has been removed  the fields beyond bordering on otterbourne park are the best for cowslips in the parish  returning into the road whose proper name is kiln lane the way leads between two fields oddly enough called courtiers rising a little and with a view of otterbourne hill the east side of which below the slope of otterbourne park has been laid out in allotments for more than fifty years at first by mr yonge though it has now been taken in hand by the parish council and it makes a pleasant picture of stripes of various shades of green and brown with people working in them  the hedge sweeps round in a curve leaving a space where stands the pound still sometimes used for straying cattle the stocks were once there but never used in the memory of man  the valley is of clay strong yellow clay favourable to oaks though too many have been cut down whenever they came to a good size in the hedges but in the grounds of otterbourne house where they have been undisturbed for at least eighty years there are a number of very handsome wellgrown trees and near them is dell copse dug out for the bricks for the kings house and the home of countless daffodils  half way up the hill is a small spring where the water rises so as to make little jets of sand  it flows down in a gutter to the green at the opening of kiln lane around the pound and here spreads into a pool called the dip hole the resort of cows from the common and long of village women as the blue galt below the yellow clay never affords good water but this has been remedied by water works  at this spot kiln lane opens into the highroad and there is a broad space of green at nearly the bottom of the hill before the main body of the village begins  every line in the place is a curvehedges roads gardens and all and this gives the view a peculiar grace so that one of the old men used to say he knew not where to find a better or prettier view than looking down into the village from the hill and on far beyond to owslebury crowd hill and longwood warren a lovely home view  the church stands on the hillside just where the upward road to cranbury begins to branch off  the churchyard is full of crosses a large granite cross in memory of john keble as rector in the midst and there is a splendid wellingtonia or more properly a sequoia now about fifty years old and overtopping the bellturret  and the outside space on this side is scattered with horse chestnuts and elms  below are the schools and the irregular curving street of houses thatched tiled or slated in gardens or close to the road  here stands otterbourne house and after two large fields more cottages and the vicarage like the schools with the fancy brick chimneys moulded at hursley  not far beyond the little stream that had crossed the meadows from the church is spanned by another bridge belonging to the highroad from winchester  thence may be seen the source of the stream in pool hole said to be fed from merdon well and now forced to spread into a bed of watercresses  and here begins compton silkstede is in sight and the round of the parishes is completed with kings lane turning to the west from the high road to winchester    chapter xvwords and phrases    before entirely quitting the parish a few of the older words and forms of expression may be recorded chiefly as remembered from the older generation for the schoolmaster and the influx of new inhabitants have changed much that was characteristic of the genuine west saxon  nor indeed was there any very pronounced dialect like a separate language  the speech is slow and with a tendency to make o like aa as titus oates does in peveril of the peak  an otterbourne man going into devonshire was told my son you speak french  no one ever showed the true hampshire southcountry speech and

blacksmiths anvils  it is viewed as the blacksmiths holiday  the accepted legend is that st clement was drowned with an anchor hung to his neck and that his body was found in a submarine temple from which the sea receded every seven years for the benefit of pilgrims  thus he became the patron of anchor forgers and thence of smiths in general  charles dickens in great expectations describes an essex blacksmith as working to a chant the refrain of which was old clem  i have heard the explosions at hursley before 1860 but more modern blacksmiths despise the custom at twyford however the festival is kept and at the dinner a story is read that after the temple was finished solomon feasted all the artificers except the blacksmiths but they appeared and pointed out all that they had done

willingness of some woman to undertake the bedizening of them with strips of ribbon or coloured paper and moreover political allusions are sometimes introduced which spoil the simplicity  the helmets are generally made of wallpaper in a shape like autodafe caps with long strips hanging over so as to conceal the face and over the shirts are sewn streamers  thus tramp seven or eight lads and stand drawn up in a row when the foremost advances with at the top of his hoarse voice  room room brave gallants room im just come to show you some merry sport and game to help pass away this cold winter

all in this room there shall be shown the dreadfullest battle that ever was known so walk in st george with thy free heart and see whether thou canst claim peace for thine own part  so far from claiming peace st george waves or ought to wave his wooden sword as he clumps forth exclaiming  in comes i st george st george that man of courage bold with my broad sword and spear i won the crown of gold       i fought that fiery dragon          and drove him to the slaughter       and by that means i won          the king of egypts daughter    therefore if any man dare enter this door       ill hack him small as dust    and after send him to the cooks shop       to be made into mincepie crust  on this defiance another figure appears  here comes i the turkish knight just come from turkey land to fight ill fight thee st george st george thou man of courage bold if thy blood be too hot ill quickly make it cold  to which st george responds in the tone in which he would address a carthorse  wo ho  my little fellow thou talkst very bold just like the little turks as i have been told therefore thou turkish knight pull out thy sword and fight pull out thy purse and pay ill have satisfaction or thou guest away  turkish knight  satisfaction no satisfaction at all my head is made of iron my body lined with steel ill battle thee to see which on the ground shall fall  the two wooden swords clatter together till the turkish knight falls all doubled up even his sword with due regard to his finery and st george is so much shocked that he marches round lamenting  o only behold what i have been and done cut and slain my brother just the evening sun  then bethinking himself he exclaims  i have a little bottle called elecampane if the man is alive let him rise and fight again  the application of the elecampane so far restores the turkish knight that he partly rises entreating  o pardon me st george o pardon me i crave o pardon me this once and i will be thy slave  very inconsistently with his late remorse st george replies   i never will pardon a turkish knight therefore arise and try thy might  the combat is renewed and the turkish knight falls prostrate on which the foreign king comes forward shouting  st george st george what hast thou done for thou hast slain mine only son  but after marching round the fallen hero he cries  is there a doctor to be found that can cure this man lies bleeding on the ground  in response the doctor appears  o yes there is a doctor to be found that can cure this man lies bleeding on the ground  the anxious father asks  doctor doctor what is thy fee  the doctor replies  ten guineas is my fee but ten pounds ill take of thee  the king answers  take it doctor but what canst thou cure  the doctors pretensions are high for he says  i can cure the ague palsy and the gout and thats a roving pain that goes within and out a broken leg or arm i soon can cure the pain and if thou breakst thy neck ill stoutly set it again bring me an old woman of fourscore years and ten without a tooth in her head ill bring her young again  the king observes  thou best a noble doctor if thats all true thou best talking about  and the doctor taking to prose replies  im not like those little mountebank doctors that go about the streets and say this that and the other and tell you as many lies in one halfhour as you would find in seven years but what i does i does clean before your eyes and ladies and gentlemen if you wont believe your own eyes tis a very hard case  the king agreeing that it is the doctor goes to the patient saying  i have a little bottle that i call golden foster drops  one drop on the root of this mans tongue and another on his crown will strike the heat through his body and raise him off the ground  accordingly the turkish knight slowly rises and decamps st george exclaiming  arise arise thou cowardly dog and see how uprightly thou canst stand  go home into your own country and tell them what old england has done for you and how theyll fight a thousand better men than you  this last speech may have been added after the crimean war as the drama was copied out in 1857 but the staple of it was known long before though with variations in different villages and it always concludes with little johnny jack the smallest of the troup with a bundle of dolls on his back going round with a jingling moneybox saying  here comes i little johnny jack wife and family at my back my familys large though i am small and so a little helps us all roast beef plum pudding strong beer and mincepies who loves that better than father christmas or i one mug of christmas ale soon will make us merry and sing some money in our pockets will be a very fine thing so ladies and gentlemen all at your ease give the christmas boys just what you please   before christmas carols had to be reformed and regulated lest they should be a mere occasion of profanity and rudeness that curious one of dives and lazarus was occasionally heard of which two lines could never be forgotten    he had no strength to drive them way and so they licked his sores   and when lazarus afterwards sees divers sitting on a serpents knee

happy may day   we cannot but here add an outline of a village character from old times at otterbourne  mr william stainer was a baker  his bread was excellent and he was also noted for what were called otterbourne buns the art of making which seems to have gone with him  they were small faircomplexioned buns which stuck together in parties of three and when soaked expanded to twice or three times their former size  he used to send them once or twice a week to winchester  but though baking was his profession he did much besides  he was a real oldfashioned herbalist and had a curious book on the virtues of plants and he made decoctions of many kinds which he administered to those in want of medicine  before the poor law provided union doctors medical advice except at the hospital was almost out of reach of the poor mr and mrs yonge like almost all other beneficent gentlefolks in villages kept a medicine chest and book and doctored such cases as they could venture on and mr stainer was in great favour as a practitioner as many of our elder people can remember  he was exceedingly charitable and kind and ready to give his help so far as he could  he was a great lover of flowers and had contrived a sort of little greenhouse over the great oven at the back of his house and there he used to bring up lovely geraniums and other flowers which he sometimes sold  he was a deeply religious and devout man and during an illness of the clerk took his place in church which was more important when there was no choir and the singers sat in the gallery  he was very happy in this office moving about on felt shoes that he might make no noise and most reverently keeping the church clean and watching over it in every way  he also continued in the post of schoolmaster which at first he had only taken temporarily and quaintly managing it  he was found setting as a copy a blind mans wife needs no paint which he defended as proverbs sir proverbs  giving up part of his business to his nephew he still sat up at night baking for the nephew he said was only in the a b c book of baking and he also had other troubles there was insanity in his family and he was much harassed  his kindness and simplicity were sometimes abused  he never had the heart to refuse to lend money or to deny bread on credit to hopeless debtors and altogether debts distress baking and watching his sisters all night and school keeping all day were too much for him the first hint of an examination of his school completed the mischief and he died insane drowning himself in the canal  it is a sad story but many of us will remember with affectionate regard the good kind quaint and most excellent little man   a few lines half parody half original may be added as picturing the old aspect of otterbourne about 1830   old remembrances   i remember i remember    old times at otterbourne before the building of the church    and when smock frocks were worn  i remember i remember    when railroads there were none when by stage coach at early dawn    the journey was begun  and through the turnpike roads till eve    trotted the horses four with inside passengers and out    they carried near a score  red rover and the telegraph    we knew them all by name and masons and the oxford coach    full thirty of them came  the coachman wore his many capes    the guard his bugle blew the horses were a gallant sight    dashing upon our view  i remember i remember    the posting days of old the yellow chariot lined with blue    and lace of colour gold  the postboys jackets blue or buff    the inns upon the road the hills up which we used to walk    to lighten thus the load  the rattling up before the inn    the horses led away the postboy as he touched his hat    and came to ask his pay  the perch aloft upon the box    delightful for the view the turnpike gates whose keepers stood    demanding each his due  i remember i remember    when ships were beauteous things the floating castles of the deep    borne upon snowwhite wings  ere irondads and turret ships    ugly as evil dream became the hideous progeny    of iron and of steam  you crossed the itchen ferry    all in an open boat now on a panting hissing bridge    you scarcely seem afloat  southampton docks were sheets of mud    grim colliers at the quay no tramway and no slender pier    to stretch into the sea  i remember i remember    long years ere rowland hill when letters covered quarto sheets    writ with a grey goose quill  both hard to fold and hard to read    crossed to the scarlet seal hardest of all to pay for ere    their news they might reveal  no stamp with royal head was there    but eightpence was the sum for every letter all alike    that did from london come  i remember i remember    the mowing of the hay scythes sweeping through the heavy grass    at breaking of the day  the haymakers in merry ranks    tossing the swathes so sweet the haycocks tanning olivebrown    in glowing summer heat  the reapers mid the ruddy wheat    the thumping of the flail the winnowing within the barn    by whirling round a sail  long ere the whirr and buzz and rush    became a harvest sound or monsters trailed their tails of spikes    or ploughed the fallow ground  our sparks flew from the flint and steel    no lucifers were known snuffers with tallow candles came    to prune the wick oergrown  hands did the work of engines then    but now some new machine must hatch the eggs and sew the seams    and make the cakes i ween  i remember i remember    the homely village school the dame with spelling book and rod    the sceptre of her rule  a black silk bonnet on her head    buff kerchief on her neck with spectacles upon her nose    and apron of blue check  ah then were no inspection days    no standards then were known children could freely make dirt pies    and learning let alone  those sundays i remember too    when service there was one for living in the parish then    of parsons there were none  and oh i can recall to mind    the church and every pew william and marys royal arms    hung up in fullest view  the lion smiling with his tongue    like a pug dogs hung out the unicorn with twisted horn    brooding upon his rout  exalted in the gallery high    the tuneful village choir with flute bassoon and clarionet    their notes rose high and higher  they shewed the number of the psalm    in white upon a slate and many a time the last lines sung    of brady and of tate  while far below upon the floor    along the narrow aisle the children on their benches sat    arranged in single file  and there the clerk would stump along    and strike with echoing blow each idle guilty little head    that chattered loud or low  ah  i remember many things    old middleaged and new is the new better than the old    more bright more wise more true  the old must ever pass away    the new must still come in when these new things are old to you    be they unstained by sin  so will their memory be sweet    a treasury of bliss to be borne with us in the days    when we their presence miss  trifles connected with the love    of many a vanished friend will thrill the heart and wake the sense    for memory has no end    chapter xvinatural history    or animal life though abundant there is little or nothing special to record besides the list of birds  polecats and martens only exist in the old rating book but weasels and stoats remain as well as a profusion of their preyhares and rabbits  squirrels haunt the trees and otters are occasionally found in the river  trout grayling now and then a pike as well as the smaller fry of minnows and sticklebacks are of course found in the streams  eels used to be caught there on the moonlight nights by old labourers with a taste for sport and the quaint little river crayfish may be picked out of the banks of the watercarriages  toads and frogs are a matter of course  sometimes a procession of tiny but perfectly formed charley frogs as the village boys call them just emerged from their tadpole state may be seen making their way up from their native pools  the pretty crested newt dark brown and orange with a gold crest along its back like an iguana is found in shallow ponds also the smooth newt  these efts or evvets as the people call them are regarded with horror by the peasantry  the children speak of having seen one as if it were a crocodile and an abscess in the arm has been ascribed to having picked up an evvet in a bundle of grass  the slowworm in silvery coat is too often slaughtered as a snake vipers come to light in the woods also the harmless brown snake one of these has been seen swimming across a pond his head just out of the water another climbing an oak tree and one upon the lawn was induced to disgorge a frog which gathered up its legs and hopped away as if nothing had happened  of rats and mice and such small deer there are only too many though it is worth while to watch rats at play round a hayrick on sunday evenings when they know they will not be persecuted and sit up like little kangaroos  the vole which is not a rat is a goodly sight and the smooth round dormouse or sleepmouse as the children call it is a favourite gift imprisoned in an old teapot  the beautiful nest of a fieldmouse has been found in a cypresss thick foliage and dead shrews bestrew the paths though the magic effects of having a sherry mouse die in ones hand and thus being enabled to stroke cattle and cure them have never been experienced  the anodon or fresh water mussel used to be found in fishers pond on colden common bordering on otterbourne and the green banks were strewn with shells left by the herons but the pond is fast drying up and the herons have been driven away by guns  the delicate paludina of brown horncoloured gracefullyformed shell creeps on the water weeds and hosts of snails may be studied  of insects less can be said here but it is worth noting that one live purple emperor has been captured in ampfield wood two dead dilapidated ones picked up at otterbourne  the forest fly so called does not often come here but it is observable that while strange horses are maddened by it the native ones do not seem disturbed knowing that it only creeps and does not bite  it is small and brown not so formidable looking as the large fly popularly called a stout as big as a hornet which lays eggs under the skin of cows  but with the blue green and orange dragonflies of summer this list must conclude and turn to the birds and botany of the place mostly well known and verified by mr townsends flora of hampshire   birds   the kite milvus ictinussometimes hovering over heathlands or farmyards but not very common  sparrowhawk accipiter fringillariustaken in a trap set

to be seen skimming softly along on summer evenings  brown owl ulula stridulaglides over the fields like a huge moth and on moonlight nights in august may be heard the curious hunting note  as the eggs are hatched not all at once but in succession a family taken out of a loft and put into a seakale pot were of various ages the eldest nearly fledged standing up as if to guard the nest the second hissing and snapping as if a naughty boy and two downy infants who died  one brown owl was kept tame and lived 14 years  the village people call this bird screech owl and after a sudden death always

otterbourne hill where he earns his other name of fern owl and may be seen flitting on silent wing in search of moths  kingfisher alcedo ispidathis beautiful creature darts out of the reeds bordering the itchen and it used to be at chandlers ford before the place was so populated  it seems also to haunt ponds or marshy places in woods for a young fullfledged one was brought into otterbourne house

april the notes may be heard by the gate of cranbury in a larch wood on otterbourne hill in the copse wood of otterbourne house at oakwood and elsewhere  for about a week there is constant song but after nesting begins it is less frequent  one year there was a nest in the laurels at otterbourne house since taken away and at eight in the morning and seven at night the nightingale came on the lawn

retired farmer after whom elderfield is named made it his business to exterminate the village sparrows  he often brought them down to one but always by the next morning that sparrow had provided himself with a mate to share his castle dangerous sparrows or sprows heads make a figure in many church ratebooks  chaffinch fringilla caelebschink is the hampshire name  the hens do not here migrate in winter but a whole flight of them has been seen in the autumn on the winchester road evidently on their way and once after an early severe frost about a hundred were found dead in a haystack near basingstoke  thomas chamberlayne esq who had a singular attraction for birds used to have them coming to eat grain from his pocket  it has the perfection of a nest  goldfinch carduelis elegansthis

being kitty wren is to be seen everywhere  whether kingsleys theory is right that the little birds roll themselves into a ball in a hole in the winter i know not  single ones are certainly to be seen

pratensissmall brown birds not easy to distinguish but the eggs differ and both have been found  bullfinch pyrrhula vulgarisit is charming to greet the black head and red waistcoat in the tops of the laurels or appletrees and surely this destroyer of insect devourers does more good than harm if he does pick the buds to pieces in the search  he is a delightful pet of exclusive and jealous attachments hating every one except his own peculiar favourite and his sobercoloured lady has quite as much character as he  one which was devoted to her own mistress would assail another of the family with such spite as sometimes to drive her out of the room  starling sturnus vulgarisgreen bedropped with gold when seen closely but at a distance looking more like a rusty blackbird though its gait on the lawn always distinguishes it being a walk instead of a hop  though not tuneful no bird has such a variety of notes and the clatter on the root the callnote the impatient summons of the brood about to be fed make it a most amusing neighbour when it returns to the same tree year after year  raven corvus coraxhe has flown over the village several times one lived for many years in the yard of the george inn at winchester  crow corvus coronaegamepreserving has nearly put an end to him but he is seen round the folds on the downs in lambing time  rook corvus frugilegusshining and black the great birds come down on the fields  there is a rookery at cranbury another at hams farm at allbrook and a considerable one in the beeches near merdon for which the rooks deserted some oaktrees nearer the house  while these trees were still inhabited mr g w heathcote observed a number of walnuts under them and found that the rooks brought them from the walnut avenues  a parliament of these wise birds is sometimes held on the downs and there are woods where they assemble in great numbers in the autumn contingents from all lesser rookeries pouring in to spend the winter and whirling round and round in clouds before roosting  jackdaw corvus monedulaa very amusing though very wicked pet there used to be throngs of them in the tower of the old church at hursley and their droll voices might be heard conversing in the evening  mr chamberlayne had one which after being freed always came down to greet him when he walked in the garden  magpie corvus picapages might be filled with the merry mischief of this handsome creature  perhaps the most observable characteristic of the three tame ones closely observed was their exclusive and devoted attachment to one person whom they singled out for no cause that could be known and followed about from place to place  jay garrulus glandariusmay be heard calling in the pine plantations on hursley common  it would be as amusing as the magpie if tamed  green woodpecker picus viridisthe laugh and the tap may be heard all through the spring days  in 1890 picus major a small black and spotted french magpie as devonians

europaeathis pretty creature will come and be fed on nuts at windows in the winter  these nuts he thrusts into crevices of bark to hold them fast while he hammers the shell  the remains may often be found  for many years a pair built in a hole halfway down an old appletree covered with ivy at otterbourne house and the exertions of the magpie with clipped wing to swing himself on a trail of ivy into the hole were comical as well as his wrath when he fell off as he uniformly did  treecreeper certhia familiaris winds round and round the trees like a little mouse  hoopoe upupa vulgarisonce in a

the ways of the moorhen with its brilliant beak  but once by some extraordinary chance a moorhen fell down a cottage chimney and was brought alive for inspection by a boy who ignorant of natural
