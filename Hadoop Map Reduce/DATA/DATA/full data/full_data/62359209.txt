an early spring dawn lies over headland and seahardly a ripple stirs the blue cheek of the bay the softness of departing night lies upon the bosom of the mediterranean like the dew upon the heart of a flower  a silent dawn  veils of transparent greys and purples and mauves still conceal the distant horizon breathless calm rests upon the water and that awed hush which at times descends upon nature herself when the finger of destiny marks an eventful hour  but now the grey and the purple veils beyond the headland are lifted one by one the midst of dawn rises upwards like the smoke of incense from some giant censers swung by unseen mighty hands  the sky above is of a translucent green studded with stars that blink and now are slowly extinguished one by one the green has turned to silver and the silver to lemongold the veils beyond the upland are flying in the wake of departing night  the lemongold turns to glowing amber anon to orange and crimson and far inland the mountain peaks peeping shyly through the mist blush a vivid rose to find themselves so fair  and to the south there where fiery sea blends and merges with fiery sky a tiny black speck has just come into view larger and larger it grows as it draws nearer to the land now it seems like a bird with wings outspreadan eagle flying swiftly to the shores of france  in the bay the fisher folk who are making ready for their days work pause a moment as they haul up their nets with rough brown hands held above their eyes they look out upon that black speckcurious interested for the ship is not one they have seen in these waters before  tis the emperor come back from elba says someone  the men laugh and shrug their shoulders that tale has been told so often in these parts during the past year the good folk have ceased to believe in it it has almost become a legend now that story that the emperor was coming backtheir emperorthe man with the battered hat and the grey redingote the peoples emperor he who led them from victory to victory whose eagles soared above every capital and every tower in europe he who made france glorious and respected her citizens men her soldiers heroes  and with stately majesty the dawn yields to day the last tones of orange have faded from the sky it is once more of a translucent green merging into sapphire overhead and the great orb in the east rises from out the trammels of the mist and from awakening earth and sea comes the great lovecall the triumphant call of day and far away upon the horizon to the south the black speck becomes more distinct and more clear it takes shape substance life  it divides and multiplies for now there are three or four specks silhouetted against the skynot three or four but fiveno sixno seven seven black specks which detach themselves one by one one from another and from the vagueness beyondexperienced eyes scan the horizon with enthusiasm and excitement which threaten to blur the clearness of their vision anyone with an eye for seagoing craft can distinguish that topsailschooner there well ahead of the rest of the tiny fleet skimming the water with swift grace and immediately behind her the threemasted polaccahm have we not seen her in these waters beforeand the two graceful feluccas whose lateen sails look so like the outspread wings of a bird  but it is on the schooner that all eyes are riveted now she skips along so fast that within an hour her pennant is easily distinguishablered and white the flag of elba of that diminutive toykingdom which for the past twelve months has been ruled over by the mightiest conqueror this modern world has ever known  the flag of elba then it is the emperor coming back  a crowd had gathered on the headland nowa crowd made up of barefooted fisherfolk men women children and of the labourers from the neighbouring fields and vineyards they have all come to greet the emperorthe man with the battered hat and the grey redingote the curious flashing eyes and mouth that always spoke genial words to the people of france  traitors turned against himney de marmont bernadotte those on whom he had showered the full measure of his friendship whom he had loaded with honours with glory and with wealth foreign armies joined in coalition against france and forced the peoples emperor to leave his country which he loved so well had sent him to humiliation and to exile but he had come back as all his people had always said that he would he had come back there was the topsailschooner that was bringing him home so swiftly now  another hour and the schooners name can be deciphered quite easilylinconstant and that of the polacca le saintesprit    and beyond these letoile and saint joseph caroline and the entire little fleet flies the flag of elba  the emperor has come back barefooted fisherfolk whisper it among themselves the labourers in the valley call the news to those upon the hills  why after another hour or so there are those among the small knot who stand congregated on the highest point of the headland who swear that they can see the emperorstanding on the deck of the linconstant  he wears a black bicorne hat and his grey redingote he is pacing up and down the deck of the schooner his hands held behind his back in the manner so familiar to the people of france and on his hat is pinned the tricolour of france everyone on shore who is on the lookout for the schooner now can see the tricolour quite plainly a mighty shout escapes the lusty throats of the men on the beach the women are on the verge of tears from sheer excitement and that shout is repeated again and again and sends its ringing echo from cliff to cliff and from fort to fort as the red and white pennant of the kingdom of elba is hauled down from the ships stern and the tricolour flagthe flag of liberty and of regenerate franceis hoisted in its stead  the soft breeze from the south unfurls its folds and these respond to his caress the red white and blue make a trenchant note of colour now against the tender hues of the sea flaunting its triumphant message in the face of awakening nature  the eagle has left the bounds of its narrow cage of elba it has taken wing over the blue mediterranean within an hour perhaps or two it will rest on the square church tower of antibesbut not for long soon it will take to its adventurous flight again and soar over valley and mountain peak from church belfry to church belfry until it finds its restingplace upon the towers of notre dame  one hour after noon the curtain has risen upon the first act of the most adventurous tragedy the world has ever known  napoleon bonaparte has landed in the bay of jouan with eleven hundred men and four guns to reconquer france and the sovereignty of the world six hundred of his old guard six score of his polish light cavalry three or four hundred corsican chasseurs thus did that sublime adventurer embark upon an expedition the most mad the most daring the most heroic the most egotistical the most tragic and the most glorious which recording destiny has ever written in the book of this world  the boats were lowered at one hour after noon and the landing was slowly and methodically begun too slowly for the patience of the old guardthe old growlers with grizzled moustache and furrowed cheeks down which tears of joy and enthusiasm were trickling at sight of the shores of france they were not going to wait for the return of those boats which had conveyed the polish troopers on shore they took to the water and waded across the bay tossing the salt spray all around them as they trod the shingle like so many shaggy dogs enjoying a bath and when six hundred fur bonnets darkened the sands of the bay at the foot of the tower of la gabelle such a shout of vive lempereur went forth from six hundred lusty throats that the midday spring air vibrated with kindred enthusiasm for miles and miles around     chapter i  the glorious news   i  where the broad highway between grenoble and gap parts company from the turbulent drac and after crossing the ravine of vaulx skirts the plateau of la motte with its magnificent panorama of forests and mountain peaks a narrow bridle path strikes off at a sharp angle on the left and in wayward curves continues its length through the woods upwards to the hamlet of vaulx and the shrine of notre dame  far away to the west the valley of the drac lies encircled by the pinecovered slopes of the lans range whilst towering some seven thousand and more feet up the snowclad crest of grande moucherolle glistens like a sea of myriads of rosecoloured diamonds under the kiss of the morning sun  there was more than a hint of snow in the sharp stinging air this afternoon even down in the valley and now the keen wind from the northeast whipped up the faces of the two riders as they turned their horses at a sharp trot up the bridle path  though it was not long since the sun had first peeped out above the forests of pelvoux the riders looked as if they had already a long journey to their credit their horses were covered with sweat and sprinkled with lather and they themselves were plentifully bespattered with mud for the road in the valley was soft after the thaw but despite probable fatigue both sat their horse with that ease and unconscious grace which marks the man accustomed to hard and constant riding thoughto the experienced eyethere would appear a vast difference in the style and manner in which each horseman handled his mount  one of them had the rigid precision of bearing which denotes military training he was young and slight of build with unruly dark hair fluttering round the temples from beneath his white sugarloaf hat and escaping the trammels of the neatlytied black silk bow at the nape of the neck he held himself very erect and rode his horse on the curb the reins gathered tightly in one gloved hand and that hand held closely and almost immovably against his chest  the other sat more carelesslythough in no way more looselyin his saddle he gave his horse more freedom with a chainsnaffle and reins hanging lightly between his fingers he was obviously taller and probably older than his companion broader of shoulder and fairer of skin you might imagine him riding this same powerful mount across a sweep of open country but his friend you would naturally picture to yourself in uniform on the parade ground  the riders soon left the valley of the drac behind them on ahead the path became very rocky winding its way beside a riotous little mountain stream whilst higher up still peeping through the intervening trees the whitewashed cottages of the tiny hamlet glimmered with dazzling clearness in the frosty atmosphere at a sharp bend of the road which effectually revealed the foremost of these cottages distant less than two kilometres now the younger of the two men drew rein suddenly and lifting his hat with outstretched arm high above his head he gave a long sigh which ended in a kind of exultant call of joy  there is notre dame de vaulx he cried at the top of his voice and hat still in hand he pointed to the distant hamlet theres the spot wherebefore the sun darts its midday rays upon usi shall hear great and glorious and authentic news of him from a man who has seen him as lately as fortyeight hours ago who has touched his hand heard the sound of his voice seen the look of confidence and of hope in his eyes oh he went on speaking with extraordinary volubility it is all too good to be true since yesterday i have felt like a man in a dreami havent lived i have scarcely breathed i     the other man broke in upon his ravings with a goodhumoured growl  you have certainly behaved like an escaped lunatic since early this morning my good de marmont he said drily dont you think thatas we shall have to mix again with our fellowmen presentlyyou might try to behave with some semblance of reasonableness  but de marmont only laughed he was so excited that his lips trembled all the time his hand shook and his eyes glowed just as if some inward fire was burning deep down in his soul  no i cant he retorted i want to shout and to sing and to cry vive lempereur till those frowning mountains over there echo with my shoutsand ill have none of your english stiffness and reserve and curbing of enthusiasm today i am a lunatic if you willan escaped lunaticif to be mad with joy be a proof of insanity clyffurde my dear friend he added more soberly i am honestly sorry for you today  thank you commented his companion drily may i ask how i have deserved this genuine sympathy  well because you are an englishman and not a frenchman said the younger man earnestly because youas an englishmanmust desire napoleons downfall his humiliation perhaps his death instead of exulting in his glory trusting in his star believing in him following him if i were not a frenchman on a day like this if my nationality or my patriotism demanded that i should fight against napoleon that i should hate him or vilify him i firmly believe that i would turn my sword against myself so shamed should i feel in my own eyes  it was the englishmans turn to laugh and he did it very heartily his laugh was quite different to his friends it had more enjoyment in it more good temper more appreciation of everything that tends to gaiety in life and more direct defiance of what is gloomy  he too had reined in his horse presumably in order to listen to his friends enthusiastic tirades and as he did so there crept into his merry pleasant eyes a quaint look of half contemptuous tolerance tempered by kindly humour  well you see my good de marmont he said still laughing you happen to be a frenchman a visionary and weaver of dreams believe me he added more seriously if you had the misfortune to be a prosy shopkeeping englishman you would certainly not commit suicide just because you could not enthuse over your favourite hero but you would realise soberly and calmly that while napoleon bonaparte is allowed to rule over franceor over any country for the matter of thatthere will never be peace in the world or prosperity in any land  the younger man made no reply a shadow seemed to gather over his facea look almost of foreboding as if fate that already lay in wait for the great adventurer had touched the young enthusiast with a warning finger  whereupon clyffurde resumed gaily once more  shall we he said go slowly on now as far as the village it is not yet ten oclock emery cannot possibly be here before noon  he put his horse to a walk de marmont keeping close behind him and in silence the two men rode up the incline toward notre dame de vaulx on ahead the pines and beech and birch became more sparse disclosing the great patches of mosscovered rock upon the slopes of pelvoux on taillefer the eternal snows appeared wonderfully near in the brilliance of this early spring atmosphere and here and there on the roadside bunches of wild crocus and of snowdrops were already visible rearing their delicate corollas up against a background of moss  the tiny village still far away lay in the peaceful hush of a sunday morning only from the little chapel which holds the shrine of notre dame came the sweet insistent sound of the bell calling the dwellers of these mountain fastnesses to prayer  the northeasterly wind was still keen but the sun was gaining power as it rose well above pelvoux and the sky over the dark forests and snowcrowned heights was of a glorious and vivid blue   ii  the words auberge du grand dauphin looked remarkably inviting written in bold shiny black characters on the whitewashed wall of one of the foremost houses in the village the riders drew rein once more this time in front of the little inn and as a young ostler in blue blouse and sabots came hurriedly and officiously forward whilst mine host in the same attire appeared in the doorway the two men dismounted unstrapped their mantles from their saddlebows and loudly called for mulled wine  mine host typical of his calling and of his race rubicund of cheek portly of figure and genial in manner was overanxious to please his guests it was not often that gentlemen of such distinguished appearance called at the auberge du grand dauphin seeing that notre dame de vaulx lies perdu on the outskirts of the forests of pelvoux that the bridle path having reached the village leads nowhere save into the mountains and that la motte is close by with its medicinal springs and its fine hostels  but these two highlydistinguished gentlemen evidently meant to make a stay of it they even spoke of a friend who would come and join them later when they would expect a substantial déjeuner to be served with the best wine mine host could put before them annettemine hosts darkeyed daughterwas all aflutter at sight of these gallant strangers one of them with such fiery eyes and vivacious ways and the other so tall and so dignified with fair skin wellbronzed by the sun and large firm mouth that had such a pleasant smile on it her eyes sparkled at sight of them both and her glib tongue rattled away at truly astonishing speed  would a wellbaked omelette and a bit of fricandeau suit the gentlemenadmirably ah well then that could easily be doneand now in the meanwhileonly good mulled wine that would present no difficulty either five minutes for it to get really hot as annette had made some the previous day for her father who had been on a tiring errand up to la mure and had come home cold and starvedand it was specially goodall the better for having been hotted up once or twice and the cloves and nutmeg having soaked in for nearly four and twenty hours  where would the gentlemen have itoutside in the sunshine    well it was very cold and the wind biting    but the gentlemen had mantles and she annette would see that the wine was piping hot    five minutes and everything would be ready     what    the tall fairskinned gentleman wanted to wash    what a funny idea    hadnt he washed this morning when he got up    he had well then why should he want to wash again    she annette managed to keep herself quite clean all day and didnt need to wash more than once a day    but there strangers had funny ways with them    she had guessed at once that monsieur was a stranger he had such a fair skin and light brown hair well so long as monsieur wasnt englishfor the english she detested  why did she detest the english    because they made war against france well against the emperor anyhow and she annette firmly believed that if the english could get hold of the emperor they would kill himoh yes they would put him on an island peopled by cannibals and let him be eaten bones marrow and all  and annettes dark eyes grew very round and very big as she gave forth her opinion upon the barbarous hatred of the english for lempereur she prattled on very gaily and very volubly while she dragged a couple of chairs out into the open and placed them well in the lee of the wind and brought a couple of pewter mugs which she set on the table  she was very much interested in the tall gentleman who had availed himself of her suggestion to use the pump at the back of the house since he was so bent on washing himself and she asked many questions about him from his friend  ten minutes later the steaming wine was on the table in a huge china bowl and the englishman was ladling it out with a longhandled spoon and filling the two mugs with the deliciously scented cordial annette had disappeared into the house in response to a peremptory call from her father the chapel bell had ceased to ring long ago and she would miss hearing mass altogether today and m le curé who came on alternate sundays all the way from la motte to celebrate divine service would be very angry indeed with her  well that couldnt be helped annette would have loved to go to mass but the two distinguished gentlemen expected their friend to arrive at noon and the déjeuner to be ready quite by then so she comforted her conscience with a few prayers said on her knees before the picture of the holy virgin which hung above her bed after which she went back to her housewifely duty with a light heart but not before she had decided an important point in her mindnamely which of those two handsome gentlemen she liked the best the dark one with the fiery eyes that expressed such bold admiration of her young charms or the tall one with the earnest grey eyes who looked as if he could pick her up like a feather and carry her running all the way to the summit of taillefer  annette had indeed made up her mind that the giant with the soft brown hair and winning smile was on the whole the more attractive of the two   iii  the two friends with mantles wrapped closely round them sat outside the grand dauphin all unconscious of the problem which had been disturbing annettes busy little brain  the steaming wine had put plenty of warmth into their bones and though both had been silent while they sipped their first mugfull it was obvious that each was busy with his own thoughts  then suddenly the young frenchman put his mug down and leaned with both elbows upon the rough deal table because he wanted to talk confidentially with his friend and there was never any knowing what prying ears might be about  i suppose he said even as a deep frown told of puzzling thoughts within the mind i suppose that when england hears the news she will up and at him again attacking him snarling at him even before he has had time to settle down upon his reconquered throne  that throne is not reconquered yet my friend retorted the englishman drily nor has the news of this mad adventure reached england so far but     but when it does broke in de marmont sombrely your castlereagh will rave and your wellington will gather up his armies to try and crush the hero whom france loves and acclaims  will france acclaim the hero theres the question  the army willthe people will  clyffurde shrugged his shoulders  the army yes he said slowly but the people    what peoplethe peasantry of provence and the dauphiné perhapswhat about the town folkyour mayors and préfetsyour tradespeople your shopkeepers who have been ruined by the wars which your hero has made to further his own ambition     dont say that clyffurde once more broke in de marmont and this time more vehemently than before when you speak like that i could almost forget our friendship  whether i say it or not my good de marmont rejoined clyffurde with his goodhumoured smile you will anyhowwithin the next few monthsdays perhapsbury our friendship beneath the ashes of your patriotism no one believe me he added more earnestly has a greater admiration for the genius of napoleon than i have his love of france is sublime his desire for her glory superb but underlying his love of country there is the love of self the mad desire to rule to conquer to humiliate it led him to moscow and thence to elba it has brought him back to france it will lead him once again to the capitol no doubt but as surely too it will lead him on to the tarpeian rock whence he will be hurled down this time not only bruised but shattered a fallen heroand you willa broken idol for posterity to deal with in after time as it lists  and england would like to be the one to give the hero the final push said de marmont not without a sneer  the people of england my friend hate and fear bonaparte as they have never hated and feared any one before in the whole course of their historyand tell me have we not cause enough to hate him for fifteen years has he not tried to ruin us to bring us to our knees tried to throttle our commerce break our might upon the sea he wanted to make a slave of britain and britain proved unconquerable believe me we hate your hero less than he hates us  he had spoken with a good deal of earnestness but now he added more lightly as if in answer to de marmonts glowering look  at the same time he said i doubt if there is a single english gentleman living at the present momentlet alone the armywho would refuse ungrudging admiration to napoleon himself and to his genius but as a nation england has her interests to safeguard she has suffered enoughand through himin her commerce and her prosperity in the past twenty yearsshe must have peace now at any cost  ah i know sighed the other a nation of shopkeepers     yes we are that i suppose we are shopkeepers    most of us     i didnt mean to use the word in any derogatory sense protested victor de marmont with the ready politeness peculiar to his race why even you     i dont see why you should say even you broke in clyffurde quietly i am a shopkeepernothing more    i buy goods and sell them again    i buy the gloves which our friend m dumoulin manufactures at grenoble and sell them to any london draper who chooses to buy them    a very mean and ungentlemanly occupation is it not  he spoke french with perfect fluency and only with the merest suspicion of a drawl in the intonation of the vowels which suggested rather than proclaimed his nationality and just now there was not the slightest tone of bitterness apparent in his deeptoned and mellow voice once more his friend would have protested but he put up a restraining hand  oh he said with a smile i dont imagine for a moment that you have the same prejudices as our mutual friend m le comte de cambray who must have made a very violent sacrifice to his feelings when he admitted me as a guest to his own table i am sure he must often think that the servants hall is the proper place for me  the comte de cambray retorted de marmont with a sneer is full up to his eyes with the prejudices and arrogance of his caste it is men of his typeand not marat or robespierrewho made the revolution who goaded the people of france into becoming something worse than mandevouring beasts and mind you twenty years of exile did not sober them nor did contact with democratic thought in england and america teach them the most elementary lessons of commonsense if the emperor had not come back today we should be once more working up for revolutionmore terrible this time more bloody and vengeful if possible than the last  then as clyffurde made no comment on this peroration the younger man resumed more lightly  andknowing the comte de cambrays prejudices as i do imagine my surpriseafter i had met you in his house as an honoured guest and on what appeared to be intimate terms of friendshipto learn that you    in fact     that i was nothing more than a shopkeeper broke in clyffurde with a short laugh nothing better than our mutual friend m dumoulin glovemaker of grenoblea highly worthy man whom m le comte de cambray esteems somewhat lower than his butler it certainly must have surprised you very much  well you know old de cambray has a horror of anything that pertains to trade and an avowed contempt for everything that he calls bourgeois  theres no doubt about that assented clyffurde fervently  perhaps he does not know of your connection with     gloves  with business people in grenoble generally  oh yes he does replied the englishman quietly  well then queried de marmont  then as his friend sat there silent with that quiet goodhumoured smile lingering round his lips he added apologetically  perhaps i am indiscreet    but i never could understand it    and you english are so reserved     that i never told you how m le comte de cambray commander of the order of the holy ghost grand cross of the order du lys hereditary grand chamberlain of france etc etc came to sit at the same table as a vendor and buyer of gloves said clyffurde gaily theres no secret about it i owe the comtes exalted condescension to certain letters of recommendation which he could not very well disregard  oh as to that    quoth de marmont with a shrug of the shoulders people like the de cambrays have their own codes of courtesy and of friendship  in this case my good de marmont it was the code of ordinary gratitude that imposed its dictum even upon the autocratic and aristocratic comte de cambray  gratitude sneered de marmont in a de cambray  m le comte de cambray said clyffurde with slow emphasis his mother his sister his brotherinlaw and two of their faithful servants were rescued from the very foot of the guillotine by a band of heroesknown in those days as the league of the scarlet pimpernel  i knew that said de marmont quietly  then perhaps you also knew that their leader was sir percy blakeneya prince among gallant english gentlemen and my dead fathers friend when my business affairs sent me to grenoble sir percy warmly recommended me to the man whose life he had saved what could m le comte de cambray do but receive me as a friend you see my credentials were exceptional and unimpeachable  of course assented de marmont now i understand but you will admit that i have had grounds for surprise youwho were the friend of dumoulin a tradesman and avowed bonapartisttwo unpardonable crimes in the eyes of m le comte de cambray he added with a return to his former bitterness you to be seated at his table and to shake him by the hand why man if he knew that i have remained faithful to the emperor     he paused abruptly and his somewhat full sensitive lips were pressed tightly together as if to suppress an insistent outburst of passion  but clyffurde frowned and when he turned away from de marmont it was in order to hide a harsh look of contempt  surely he said you have never led the comte to suppose that you are a royalist  i have never led him to suppose anything but he has taken my political convictions for granted rejoined de marmont  then suddenly a look of bitter resentment darkened his face making it appear hard and lined and considerably older  my uncle marshal de marmont duc de raguse was an abominable traitor he went on with illrepressed vehemence he betrayed his emperor his benefactor and his friend it was the vilest treachery that has ever disgraced an honourable name paris could have held out easily for another four and twenty hours and by that time the emperor would have been back but de marmont gave her over wilfully scurvily to the allies but for his abominable act of cowardice the emperor never would have had to endure the shame of his temporary exile at elba and louis de bourbon would never have had the chance of wallowing for twelve months upon the throne of france but that which is a source of irreparable shame to me is a virtue in the eyes of all these royalists de marmonts treachery against the emperor has placed all his kindred in the forefront of those who now lick the boots of that infamous bourbon dynasty and it did not suit the plans of the bonapartist party that wein the provincesshould proclaim our faith too openly until such time as the emperor returned  and if the comte de cambray had known that you are just an ardent bonapartist    suggested clyffurde calmly  he would long before now have had me kicked out by his lacqueys broke in de marmont with everincreasing bitterness as he brought his clenched fist crashing down upon the table while his dark eyes glowed with a fierce and passionate resentment for men like de cambray there is only one castethe noblesse one religionthe catholic one creedadherence to the bourbons all else is scum trash beneath contempt hardly human oh if you knew how i loathe these people he continued speaking volubly and in a voice shaking with suppressed excitement they have learnt nothing these aristocrats nothing i tell you the terrible reprisals of the revolution which culminated in that appalling reign of terror have taught them absolutely nothing they have not learnt the great lesson of the revolution that the people will no longer endure their arrogance and their pretensions that the old regime is deaddead the regime of oppression and pride and intolerance they have learnt nothing he reiterated with evergrowing excitement nothing humanity begins with the noblesse is still their watchword today as it was before the irate people sent hundreds of them to perish miserably on the guillotinethe rest of mankind to them is only cattle made to toil for the wellbeing of their class oh i loathe them i tell you i loathe them from the bottom of my soul  and yet you and your kind are rapidly becoming at one with them said clyffurde his quiet voice in strange contrast to the other mans violent agitation  no we are not protested de marmont emphatically the men whom napoleon created marshals and peers of france have been openly snubbed at the court of louis xviii ney who is prince of moskowa and next to napoleon himself the greatest soldier of france has seen his wife treated little better than a chambermaid by the duchesse dangoulême and the ladies of the old noblesse my uncle is marshal of france and duc de raguse and i am the heir to his millions but the comte de cambray will always consider it a mesalliance for his daughter to marry me  the note of bitter resentment of wounded pride and smouldering hatred became more and more marked while he spoke his voice now sounded hoarse and his throat seemed dry presently he raised his mug to his lips and drank eagerly but his hand was shaking visibly as he did this and some of the wine was spilled on the table  there was silence for a while outside the little inn silence which seemed full of portent for through the pure mountain air there was wafted the hot breath of mens passionsfierce dominating challenging love hatred prejudices and contemptall were portrayed on de marmonts mobile face they glowed in his dark eyes and breathed through his quivering nostrils now he rested his elbow on the table and his chin in his hand his nervy fingers played a tattoo against his teeth clenched together like those of some young feline creature which sees its prey coming along and is snarling at the sight  clyffurde with those deepset earnest grey eyes of his was silently watching his friend his hand did not shake nor did the breath come any quicker from his broad chest yet deep down behind the wide brow behind those same overshadowed eyes a keen observer would of a surety have detected the signs of a latent volcano of passions all the more strong and virile as they were kept in perfect control it was he who presently broke the silence and his voice was quite steady when he spoke though perhaps a trifle more toneless more dead than usual  and he said what of mlle crystal in all this  crystal queried the other curtly what about her  she is an ardent royalist more strong in her convictions and her enthusiasms than women usually are  and what of that rejoined de marmont fiercely i love crystal  but when she learns that you     she shall not learn it rejoined the other cynically we sign our marriage contract tonight the wedding is fixed for tuesday until then i can hold my peace  an exclamation of hot protest almost escaped the englishmans lips his hand which rested on the table became so tightly clenched that the hard knuckles looked as if they would burst through their fetters of sinew and skin and he made no pretence at concealing the look of burning indignation which flashed from his eyes  but man he exclaimed a deception such as you propose is cruel and monstrous    in view too of what has occurred in the past few days    in view of what may happen if the news which we have heard is true     in view of all that my friend retorted de marmont firmly the old regime has had its nine days of wonder and of splendour the emperor has come back we who believe in him who have remained true to him in his humiliation and in his misfortunes may once more raise our heads and loudly proclaim our loyalty the return of the emperor will once more put his dukes and his marshals in their rightful place on a level with the highest nobility of france the comte de cambray will realise that all his hopes of regaining his fortune through the favours of the bourbons have by force of circumstances come to naught like most of the old noblesse who emigrated he is without a sou he may choose to look on me with contempt but he will no longer desire to kick me out of his house for he will be glad enough to see the cambray scutcheon regilt with de marmont gold  but mademoiselle crystal insisted clyffurde almost appealingly for his whole soul had revolted at the cynicism of the other man  crystal has listened to that ape st genis replied de marmont drily one of her own caste    a marquis with sixteen quarterings to his family escutcheon and not a sou in his pockets she is very young and very inexperienced she has seen nothing of the world as yetnothing she was born and brought up in exilein england in the midst of that narrow society formed by impecunious émigrés     and shopkeeping englishmen murmured clyffurde under his breath  she could never have married st genis reiterated victor de marmont with deliberate emphasis the man hasnt a sou even crystal realised from the first that nothing ever could have come of that boy and girl dallying the comte never would have consented     perhaps not but shemademoiselle crystalwould she ever have consented to marry you if she had known what your convictions are  crystal is only a child said de marmont with a light shrug of the shoulders she will learn to love me presently when st genis has disappeared out of her little world and she will accept my convictions as she has accepted me submissive to my will as she was to that of her father  once more a hot protest of indignation rose to clyffurdes lips but this too he smothered resolutely what was the use of protesting could he hope to change with a few arguments the whole cynical nature of a man and what right had he even to interfere the comte de cambray and mademoiselle crystal were nothing to him in their minds they would never look upon him even as an equallet alone as a friend so the bitter words died upon his lips  and you have been content to win a wife on such terms was all that he said  i have had to be content was de marmonts retort crystal is the only woman i have ever cared for she will love me in time i doubt not and her sense of duty will make her forget st genis quickly enough  then as clyffurde made no further comment silence fell once more between the two men perhaps even de marmont felt that somehow during the past few moments the slender bond of friendship which similarity of tastes and a certain similarity of political ideals had forged between him and the stranger had been strained to snapping point and this for a reason which he could not very well understand he drank another draught of wine and gave a quick sigh of satisfaction with the world in general and also with himself for he did not feel that he had done or said anything which could offend the keenest susceptibilities of his friend  he looked with a sudden sense of astonishment at clyffurde as if he were only seeing him now for the first time his keen dark eyes took in with a rapid glance the englishmans powerful personality the square shoulders the head well erect the strong anglosaxon chin firmly set the slender hands always in repose in the whole attitude of the man there was an air of willpower which had never struck de marmont quite so forcibly as it did now and a virility which looked as ready to challenge fate as it was able to conquer her if she proved adverse  and just now there was a curious look in those deepset eyesa look of contempt or of pityde marmont was not sure which but somehow the look worried him and he would have given much to read the thoughts which were hidden behind the high square brow  however he asked no questions and thus the silence remained unbroken for some time save for the soughing of the northeast wind as it whistled through the pines whilst from the tiny chapel which held the shrine of notre dame de vaulx came the sound of a softtoned bell ringing the midday angelus  just then round that same curve in the road where the two riders had paused an hour ago in sight of the little hamlet a man on horseback appeared riding at a brisk trot up the rugged stony path  victor de marmont woke from his rêverie  theres emery he cried  he jumped to his feet then he picked up his hat from the table where he had laid it down tossed it up into the air as high as it would go and shouted with all his might  vive lempereur   iv  the man who now drew rein with abrupt clumsiness in front of the auberge looked hot tired and travelstained his face was covered with sweat and his horse with lather the lapel of his coat was torn his breeches and boots were covered with halffrozen mud  but having brought his horse to a halt he swung himself out of the saddle with the brisk air of a boy who has enjoyed his first ride across country surgeoncaptain emery was a man well over forty but today his eyes glowed with that concentrated fire which burns in the heart at twenty and he shook de marmont by the hand with a vigour which made the younger man wince with the pain of that iron grip  my friend mr clyffurde an english gentleman said victor de marmont hastily in response to a quick look of suspicious enquiry which flashed out from under emerys bushy eyebrows you can talk quite freely emery and for gods sake tell us your news  but emery could hardly speak he had been riding hard for the past three hours his throat was parched and through it his voice came up hoarse and raucous nevertheless he at once began talking in short jerky sentences  he landed on wednesday he said i parted from him on friday    at castellane    you had my message  this morning earlywe came at once  i thought we could talk better herefirstbut i was spent last nighti had to sleep at corps    so i sent to you    but now in heavens name give me something to drink     while he drank eagerly and greedily of the cold spiced wine which clyffurde had served out to him he still scrutinised the englishman closely from under his frowning and bushy eyebrows  clyffurdes winning glance however seemed to have conquered his mistrust for presently after he had put his mug down again he stretched out a cordial hand to him  now that our emperor is back with us he said as if in apology for his former suspicions we his friends are bound to look askance at every englishman we meet  of course you are said clyffurde with his habitual goodhumoured smile as he grasped surgeoncaptain emerys extended hand  it is the hand of a friend i am grasping insisted emery  of a personal friend if you will call him so replied clyffurde politically i hardly count you see i am just a lookeron at the game  the surgeoncaptains keen eyes under their bushy brows shot a rapid glance at the tall wellknit figure of the englishman  you are not a fighting man he queried much amazed  no replied clyffurde drily i am only a tradesman  your news emery your news here broke in victor de marmont who during the brief colloquy between his two friends had been hardly able to keep his excitement in check  emery turned away from the other man in silence clearly there was something about that fine noblelooking fellowwho proclaimed himself a tradesman while that splendid physique of his should be at his countrys servicewhich still puzzled the worthy army surgeon  but he was primarily very thirsty and secondly as eager to impart his news as de marmont was to hear it so now without wasting any further words on less important matter he sat down close to the table and stretched his short thick legs out before him  my news is of the best he said with lusty fervour we left porto ferrajo on sunday last but only landed on wednesday as i told you for we were severely becalmed in the mediterranean we came on shore at antibes at midday of march 1st and bivouacked in an olive grove on the way to cannes that was a sight good for sore eyes my friends to see him sitting there by the camp fire his feet firmly planted upon the soil of france what a man sir what a man he continued turning directly to clyffurde on board the inconstant he had composed and dictated his proclamation to the army to the soldiers of france the finest piece of prose sir i have ever read in all my life but you shall judge of it sir you shall judge     and with hands shaking with excitement he fumbled in the bulging pocket of his coat and extracted therefrom a roll of loose papers roughly tied together with a piece of tape  you shall read it sir he went on mumbling while his trembling fingers vainly tried to undo the knot in the tape you shall read it and then mayhap youll tell me if your pitt was ever half so eloquent curse these knots he exclaimed angrily  will you allow me sir said clyffurde quietly and with steady hand and firm fingers he undid the refractory knots and spread the papers out upon the table  already de marmont had given a cry of loyalty and of triumph  his proclamation he exclaimed and a sigh of infinite satisfaction born of enthusiasm and of heroworship escaped his quivering lips  the papers bore the signature of that name which had once been allpowerful in its magical charm at sound of which europe had trembled and crowns had felt insecure the name which men had breathednay still breathedeither with passionate loyalty or with bitter hatrednapoleon  they were copies of the proclamation wherewith the heroic adventurerconfident in the power of his dictionmeant to reconquer the hearts of that army whom he had once led to such glorious victories  de marmont read the long document through from end to end in a halfaudible voice now and again he gave a little crya cry of loyalty at mention of those victories of austerlitz and jena of wagram and of eckmühl at mention of those imperial eagles which had led the armies of france conquering and glorious throughout the length and breadth of europeor a cry of shame and horror at mention of the traitor whose name he bore and who had delivered france into the hands of strangers and his emperor into those of his enemies  and when the young enthusiast had read the proclamation through to the end he raised the paper to his lips and fervently kissed the imprint of the revered name napoleon  now tell me more about him he said finally as he leaned both elbows on the table and fastened his glowing eyes upon the equally heated face of surgeoncaptain emery  well resumed the latter as i told you we bivouacked among the olive trees on the way to cannes the emperor had already sent cambronne on ahead with forty of his grenadiers to commandeer what horses and mules he could as we were not able to bring many across from porto ferrajo cambronne he said you shall be in command of the vanguard in this the finest campaign which i have ever undertaken my orders are to you that you do not fire a single unnecessary shot remember that i mean to reconquer my imperial crown without shedding one drop of french blood oh he is in excellent health and in excellent spirits such a man such fire in his eyes such determination in his actions younger bolder than ever i tell you friends continued the worthy surgeoncaptain as he brought the palm of his hand flat down upon the table with an emphatic bang that it is going to be a triumphal march from end to end of france the people are mad about him at roccavignon just outside cannes where we bivouacked on thursday men women and children were flocking round to see him pressing close to his knees bringing him wine and flowers and the people were crying vive lempereur even in the streets of grasse  but the army man the army cried de marmont the garrisons of antibes and cannes and grasse did the men go over to him at onceand the officers  we hadnt encountered the army yet when i parted from him on friday retorted emery with equal impatience we didnt go into antibes and we avoided cannes you must give him time the people in the towns wouldnt at first believe that he had come back general masséna who is in command at marseilles thought fit to spread the news that a band of corsican pirates had landed on the littoral and were marching inlanddevastating villages as they marched the peasants from the mountains were the first to believe that the emperor had really come and they wandered down in their hundreds to see him first and to spread the news of his arrival ahead of him by the time we reached castellane the mayor was not only ready to receive him but also to furnish him with 5000 rations of meat and bread with horses and with mules since then he has been at digue and at sisteron be sure that the garrisons of those cities have rallied round his eagles by now  then whilst emery paused for breath de marmont queried eagerly  and so    there has been no contretemps  nothing serious so far replied the other we had to abandon our guns at grasse the emperor felt that they would impede the rapidity of his progress and our second days march was rather trying the mountain passes were covered in snow the lancers had to lead their horses sometimes along the edge of sheer precipices they were hampered too by their accoutrements their long swords and their lances otherswho had no mountshad to carry their heavy saddles and bridles on those slippery paths but he was walking too stick in hand losing his footing now and then just as they did and once he nearly rolled down one of those cursed precipices but always smiling always cheerful always full of hope at antibes young casabianca got himself arrested with twenty grenadiersthey had gone into the town to requisition a few provisions when the news reached us some of the younger men tried to persuade the emperor to march on the city and carry the place by force of arms before casabiancas misfortune got bruited abroad no he said every minute is precious all we can do is to get along faster than the evil news can travel if half my small army were captive at antibes i would still move on if every man were a prisoner in the citadel i would march on alone thats the man my friends cried emery with evergrowing enthusiasm thats our emperor  and he cast a defiant look on clyffurde as much as to say bring on your wellington and your armies now the emperor has come back the whole of france will know how to guard him then he turned to de marmont  and now tell me about grenoble he said  grenoble had an inkling of the news already last night said de marmont whose enthusiasm was no whit cooler than that of emery marchand has been secretly assembling his troops he has sent to chambéry for the 7th and 11th regiment of the line and to vienne for the 4th hussars inside grenoble he has the 5th infantry regiment the 4th of artillery and 3rd of engineers with a train squadron this morning he is holding a council of war and i know that he has been in constant communication with masséna the news is gradually filtering through into the town people stand at the street corners and whisper among themselves the word lempereur seemed wafted upon this mornings breeze     and by tonight well have the emperors proclamation to his people pinned up on the walls of the hôtel de ville exclaimed emery and with hands still trembling with excitement he gathered the precious papers once more together and slipped them back into his coat pocket then he made a visible effort to speak more quietly and now he said for one very important matter which by the way was the chief reason for my asking you my good de marmont to meet me here before my getting to grenoble  yes what is it queried de marmont eagerly  surgeoncaptain emery leaned across the table instinctively he dropped his voice and though his excitement had not abated one jot though his eyes still glowed and his hands still fidgeted nervously he had forced himself at last to a semblance of calm  the matter is one of money he said slowly the emperor has some funds at his disposal but as you know that scurvy government of the restoration never handed him over one single sou of the yearly revenue which it had solemnly agreed and sworn to pay to him with regularity now of course he continued still more emphatically we who believe in our emperor as we believe in god we are absolutely convinced that the army will rally round him to a man the army loves him and has never ceased to love him the army will follow him to victory and to death but the most loyal army in the world cannot subsist without money and the emperor has little or none the news of his triumphant march across france will reach paris long before he does it will enable his most excellent and most corpulent majesty king louis to skip over to england or to ghent with everything in the treasury on which he can lay his august hands now de marmont do you perceive what the serious matter is which caused me to meet you heretwentyfive kilomètres from grenoble where i ought to be at the present moment  yes i do perceive very grave trouble there said de marmont with characteristic insouciance but one which need not greatly worry the emperor i am rich thank god and     and may god bless you my dear de marmont for the thought broke in emery earnestly but what may be called a large private fortune is as nothing before the needs of an army soon of course the emperor will be in peaceful possession of his throne and will have all the resources of france at his command but before that happy time arrives there will be much fighting and many daysweeks perhapsof anxiety to go through during those weeks the army must be paid and fed and your private fortune my dear de marmont wouldeven if the emperor were to accept your sacrifice which is not likelybe but as a drop in the mighty ocean of the cost of a campaign what are two or even three millions my poor dear friend it is forty fifty millions that the emperor wants  de marmont this time had nothing to say he was staring moodily and silently before him  now that is what i have come to talk to you about continued emery after a few seconds pause during which he had once more thrown a quick halfsuspicious glance on the impassive though obviously interested face of the englishman always supposing that monsieur here is on our side  neither on your side nor on the other captain said bobby clyffurde with a slight tone of impatience i am a mere tradesman as i have had the honour to tell you a spectator at this game of political conflicts m de marmont knows this well else he had not asked me to accompany him today nor offered me a mount to enable me to do so but if you prefer it he added lightly i can go for a stroll while you discuss these graver matters  he would have risen from the table only that emery immediately detained him  no offence sir said the surgeoncaptain bluntly  none i give you my word assented the englishman it is only natural that you should wish to discuss such grave matters in private let me go and see to our déjeuner in the meanwhile i feel sure that the fricandeau is done to a turn by now ill have it dished up in ten minutes i pray you take no heed of me he added in response to murmured protestations from both de marmont and emery i would much prefer to know nothing of these grave matters which you are about to discuss  this time emery did not detain him as he rose and turned to go within in order to find mine host or annette the two frenchmen took no further heed of him wrapped up in the all engrossing subjectmatter they remained seated at the table leaning across it their faces close to one another their eyes dancing with excitement questions and answersas soon as the strangers back was turnedalready tumbling out in confusion from their lips  clyffurde turned to have a last look at them before he went into the house and while he did so his habitual pleasant gentlyironical smile still hovered round his lips but anon a quicklysuppressed sigh chased the smile away and over his face there crept a strange shadowa look of longing and of bitter regret  it was only for a moment however the next he had passed his hand slowly across his forehead as if to wipe away that shadow and smooth out those lines of unspoken pain  soon his cheerful voice was heard echoing along the low rafters of the little inn loudly calling for annette and for news of the baked omelette and the fricandeau   v  you really could have talked quite freely before mr clyffurde my good emery said de marmont as soon as bobby had disappeared inside the inn he really takes no part in politics he is a friend alike of the comte de cambray and of glovemaker dumoulin he has visited our bonapartist club dumoulin has vouched for him you see he is not a fighting man  i suppose that you are equally sure that he is not an english spy remarked emery drily  of course i am sure asserted de marmont emphatically dumoulin has known him for years in business though this is the first time that clyffurde has visited grenoble he is in the glove trade in england his interests are purely commercial he came here with introductions to the comte de cambray from a mutual friend in england who seems to be a personage of vast importance in his own country and greatly esteemed by the comteelse you may be sure that that stiffnecked aristocrat would never have received a tradesman as a guest in his house but it was in dumoulins house that i first met bobby clyffurde we took a liking to one another and since then have ridden a great deal together he is a splendid horseman and i was very glad to be able to offer him a mount at different times but our political conversations have never been very heated or very serious clyffurde maintains a detached impersonal attitude both to the bonapartist and the royalist cause i asked him to accompany me this morning and he gladly consented for he dearly loves a horse i assure you you might have said anything before him  eh bien im sorry if ive been obstinate and ungracious said the surgeoncaptain but in a tone that obviously belied his words though frankly i am very glad that we are alone for the moment  he paused and with a wave of his thick shortfingered hand he dismissed this less important subjectmatter and once more spoke with his wonted eagerness on that which lay nearest his heart  now listen my good de marmont he said do you recollect last april when the empresspoor wretched misguided womanfled so precipitately from paris abandoning the capital france and her crown at one and the same time and taking away with her all the crown diamonds and money and treasure belonging to the emperor she was terribly illadvised of course but     yes i remember all that perfectly well broke in de marmont impatiently  well then you know that that abominable talleyrand sent one of his emissaries after the empress and her suite    that this emissarydudon was his namereached orleans just before marie louise herself got there     and that he ordered in talleyrands name the seizure of the empress convoy as soon as it arrived in the city broke in de marmont again yes i recollect that abominable outrage perfectly dudon backed by the officers of the gendarmerie managed to rob the empress of everything she had even to the last knife and fork even to the last pocket handkerchief belonging to the emperor and marked with his initials oh it was monstrous hellish devilish it makes my blood boil whenever i think of it    whenever i think of those fatuous treacherous bourbons gloating over those treasures at the tuileries while our empress went her way as effectually despoiled as if she had been waylaid by so many brigands on a public highway  just so resumed emery quietly after de marmonts violent storm of wrath had subsided but i dont know if you also recollect that when the various cases containing the emperors belongings were opened at the tuileries there was just as much disappointment as gloating some of those fatuous bourbonsas you so rightly call themexpected to find some forty or fifty millions of the emperors personal savings therebanknotes and drafts on the banks of france of england and of amsterdam which they were looking forward to distributing among themselves and their friends your friend the comte de cambray would no doubt have come in too for his share in this distribution but m de talleyrand is a very wise man always farseeing he knows the improvidence the prodigality the ostentation of these new masters whom he is so ready to serve ere dudon reached paris with his booty m de talleyrand had very carefully eliminated therefrom some five and twenty million francs in banknotes and bankers drafts which he felt would come in very usefully once for a rainy day  but m de talleyrand is immensely rich himself protested de marmont  ah he did not eliminate those five and twenty millions for his own benefit said emery i would not so boldly accuse him of theft the money has been carefully put away by m de talleyrand for the use of his corpulent majesty louis de bourbon xviiith of that name  then as emery here made a dramatic pause and looked triumphantly across at his companion de marmont rejoined somewhat bewildered  but    i dont understand     why i am telling you this retorted emery still with that triumphant air you shall understand in a moment my friend when i tell you that those five and twenty millions were never taken north to paris they were conveyed in strict secrecy south to grenoble  to grenoble exclaimed de marmont  to grenoble reasserted emery  but why    why such a long waywhy grenoble queried the young man in obvious puzzlement  for several reasons replied emery firstly both the préfet of the department and the military commandant are hot royalists whilst the province of dauphiné is not in case of any army corps being sent down there to quell possible and probable revolt the money would have been there to hand also if you remember there was talk at the time of the king of naples proving troublesome there too in case of a campaign on the frontier the money lying ready to hand at grenoble could prove very useful but of course i cannot possibly pretend to give you all the reasons which actuated m de talleyrand when he caused five and twenty millions of stolen money to be conveyed secretly to grenoble rather than to paris his ways are more tortuous than any mere armysurgeon can possibly hope to gauge enough that he did it and that at this very moment there are five and twenty millions which are the rightful property of the emperor locked up in the cellars of the hôtel de ville at grenoble  but    murmured de marmont who still seemed very bewildered at all that he had heard are you sure  quite sure affirmed emery emphatically dumoulin brought news of it to the emperor at elba several months ago and you know that he and his bonapartist club always have plenty of spies in and around the préfecture the money is there he reiterated with still greater emphasis now the question is how are we going to get hold of it  easily rejoined de marmont with his habitual enthusiasm when the emperor marches into grenoble and the whole of the garrison rallies around him he can go straight to the hôtel de ville and take everything that he wants  always supposing that m le préfet does not anticipate the emperors coming by conveying the money to paris or elsewhere before we can get hold of it quoth emery drily  oh fourier is not sufficiently astute for that  perhaps not but we must not neglect possibilities that money would be a perfect godsend to the emperor it was originally his too par dieu anyhow my good de marmont that is what i wanted to talk over quietly with you before i get into grenoble can you think of any means of getting hold of that money in case fourier has the notion of conveying it to some other place of safety  i would like to think that over emery said de marmont thoughtfully as you say we of the bonapartist club at grenoble have spies inside the hôtel de ville we must try and find out what fourier means to do as soon as he realises that the emperor is marching on grenoble and then we must act accordingly and trust to luck and good fortune  and to the emperors star rejoined emery earnestly it is once more in the ascendant but the matter of the money is a serious one de marmont you will deal with it seriously  seriously ejaculated de marmont  once more the unquenchable fire of undying devotion to his hero glowed in the young mans eyes  everything pertaining to the emperor he said fervently is serious to me for a whim of his i would lay down my life i will think of all you have told me emery and here beneath the blue dome of gods sky i swear that i will get the emperor the money that he wants or lose mine honour and my life in the attempt  amen to that rejoined emery with a deep sigh of satisfaction you are a brave man de marmont would to heaven every frenchman was like you and now he added with sudden transition to a lighter mood let annette dish up the fricandeau heres our friend the tradesman who was born to be a soldier m clyffurde he added loudly calling to the englishman who had just appeared in the doorway of the inn my grateful thanks to younot only for your courtesy but for expediting that delicious déjeuner which tickles my appetite so pleasantly i pray you sit down without delay i shall have to make an early start after the meal as i must be inside grenoble before dark  clyffurde goodhumoured genial quiet as usual quickly responded to the surgeoncaptains desire he took his seat once more at the table and spoke of the weather and the sunshine the alps and the snows the while annette spread a cloth and laid plates and knives and forks before the distinguished gentlemen  we all want to make an early start eh my dear clyffurde ejaculated de marmont gaily we have serious business to transact this night with m le comte de cambray and partake too of his gracious hospitality what  emery laughed  not i forsooth he said m le comte would as soon have satan or beelzebub inside his doors and i marvel my good de marmont that you have succeeded in keeping on such friendly terms with that royalist ogre  i said de marmont whose inward exultation radiated from his entire personality i my dear emery did you not know that i am that royalist ogres future soninlaw par dieu but this is a glorious day for me as well as a glorious day for france emery dear friend wish me joy and happiness on tuesday i wed mademoiselle crystal de cambraytonight we sign our marriage contract wish me joy i say shes a bride well worth the winning napoleon sets forth to conquer a thronei to conquer love and you old soberface do not look so glum he added turning to clyffurde  and his ringing laugh seemed to echo from end to end of the narrow valley  after which a lighter atmosphere hung around the table outside the auberge du grand dauphin there was but little talk of the political situation still less of party hatred and caste prejudices the heros name was still on the lips of the two men who worshipped him and clyffurde faithful to his attitude of detachment from political conflicts listened quite unmoved to the impassioned dithyrambs of his friends  but so absorbed were these two in their conversation and their joy that they failed to notice that clyffurde hardly touched the excellent déjeuner set before him and left mine hosts fine burgundy almost untasted     chapter ii  the old regime   i  on that same day and at about the same time when victor de marmont and his english friend first turned their horses up the bridle path and sighted notre dame de vaulx when if you remember the young frenchman drew rein and fell to apostrophising the hamlet the day the hour and the glorious news which he was expecting to hear at about that selfsame hour i say in the château de brestalou situate on the right bank of the isère at a couple of kilomètres from grenoble the big folding doors of solid mahogany which lead from the suite of vast reception rooms to the small boudoir beyond were thrown open and hector appeared to announce that m le comte de cambray would be ready to receive mme la duchesse in the library in a quarter of an hour  mme la duchesse douairière dagen thereupon closed the giltedged muchbethumbed missal which she was readingsince this was sunday and she had been unable to attend mass owing to that severe twinge of rheumatism in her right kneeand placed it upon the table close to her elbow then with delicate bemittened hand she smoothed out one unruly crease in her puce silk gown and finally looked up through her round bonerimmed spectacles at the sobervisaged majestic personage who stood at attention in the doorway  tell m le comte my good hector she said with slow deliberation that i will be with him at the time which he has so graciously appointed  hector bowed himself out of the room with that perfect decorum which proclaims the welltrained domestic of an aristocratic house as soon as the tall mahogany doors were closed behind him mme la duchesse took her spectacles off from her highbred nose and gave a little sniff which caused mademoiselle crystal to look up from her book and mutely to question madame with those wonderful blue eyes of hers  ah ça my little crystal was madames tart response to that eloquent enquiry does monsieur my brother imagine himself to be a second bourbon king throning it in the tuileries and granting audiences to the ladies of his court or is it only for my edification that he plays this magnificent game of etiquette and ceremonial and other stupid paraphernalia which have set me wondering since last night m le comte will receive mme la duchesse in a quarter of an hour forsooth she added mimicking hectors pompous manner par dieu i should think indeed that he would receive his own sister when and where it suited her conveniencenot his  crystal was silent for a moment or two and in those same expressive eyes which she kept fixed on madames face the look of mute enquiry had become more insistent it almost seemed as if she were trying to penetrate the underlying thoughts of the older woman as if she tried to read all that there was in that kindly glance of hidden sarcasm of humour or tolerance or of gentle contempt evidently what she read in the wrinkled face and the twinkling eyes pleased and reassured her for now the suspicion of a smile found its way round the corners of her sensitive mouth  there are some very old people living in grenoble at the present day whose mothers or fathers have told them that they remembered mademoiselle crystal de cambray quite well in the year that m le comte returned from england and once more took possession of his ancestral home on the bank of the isère which those awful terrorists of 92 had taken away from him louis xviii the benevolent king had promptly restored the old château to its rightful owner when he himself after years of exile mounted the throne of his fathers and the usurper bonaparte was driven out of france by the armies of europe allied against him and sent to cool his ambitions in the island fastnesses of elba  mademoiselle de cambray was just nineteen in that year 1814 which was so full of grace for the bourbon dynasty and all its faithful adherents and in february of the following year she attained her twentieth birthday of course you know that she was born in england and that her mother was english for had not m le comte been obliged to fly before the fury of the terrorists whose dreaded committee of public safety had already arrested him as a suspect and condemned him to the guillotine he had contrived to escape death by what was nothing short of a miracle and he had lived for twenty years in england and there had married a beautiful english girl from whom mademoiselle crystal had inherited the deep blue eyes and brilliant skin which were the greatest charm of her effulgent beauty  i like to think of her just as she was on that memorable day early in march of the year 1815just as she sat that morning on a low stool close to mme la duchesses highbacked chair and with her eyes fixed so enquiringly upon madames kind old face her fair hair was done up in the quaint loops and curls which characterised the mode of the moment she had on a white dress cut low at the neck and had wrapped a soft cashmere shawl round her shoulders for the weather was cold and there was no fire in the stately open hearth  having presumably arrived at the happy conclusion that madames wrath was only on the surface crystal now said gently  father loves all this etiquette ma tante it brings back memories of a very happy past it is the only thing he has left now she added with a little sigh the only bit out of the past which that awful revolution could not take away from him you will try to be indulgent to him aunt darling wont you  indulgent retorted the old lady with a shrug of her shoulders of course ill be indulgent its no affair of mine and he does as he pleases but i should have thought that twenty years spent in england would have taught him commonsense and twenty years experience in earning a precarious livelihood as a teacher of languages in     hush aunt for pitys sake broke in crystal hurriedly and she put up her hands almost as if she wished to stop the words in the old ladys mouth  all right all right i wont mention it again said mme la duchesse goodhumouredly i have only been in this house four and twenty hours my dear child but i have already learned my lesson i know that the memory of the past twenty years must be blotted right out of our mindsout of the minds of every one of us     not of mine aunt altogether murmured crystal softly  no my dearnot altogether rejoined mme la duchesse as she placed one of her fine white hands on the fair head of her niece your beautiful mother belongs to the unforgettable memories of those twenty years     and not only my beautiful mother aunt dear there are men living in england today whose names must remain for ever engraved upon my fathers heart as well as on mineif we should ever forget those names and neglect for one single day our prayers of gratitude for their welfare and their reward we should be the meanest and blackest of ingrates  ah said madame i am glad that monsieur my brother remembers all that in the midst of his restored grandeur  have you been wronging him in your heart all this while ma tante asked crystal and there was a slight tone of reproach in her voices you used not to be so cynical once upon a time  cynical exclaimed the duchesse bless the childs heart of course i am cynicalat my age what can you expectand what can i expect but there dont distress yourself i am not wronging your fatherfar from itonly this grandeurthe state dinner last nighthis gracious mannerall that upset me i am not used to it my dear you see twenty years in that diminutive house in worcester have altered my tastes i see more than they did your fathers    and these last ten months which he seems to have spent in reviving the old grandeur of his ancestral home i spent remember with the dear little sisters of mercy at boulogne praying amidst very humble surroundings that the future may not become more unendurable than the past  but you are glad to be back at brestalou again and you will remain here with usalways queried crystal and with tender eagerness she clasped the older womans hands closely in her own  yes dear replied madame gently i am glad to be back in the old châteaumy dear old homewhere i was very happy and very young onceoh so very long ago and i will remain with your father and look after him all the time that his young bird is absent from the nest  again she stroked her nieces soft wavy hair with a gesture which apparently was habitual with her and it seemed as if a note of sadness had crept into her brisk sharp voice over crystals cheeks a wave of crimson had quickly swept at her aunts last words and the eyes which she now raised to madames kindly face were full of tears  it seems so terribly soon now ma tante she said wistfully  hm yes quoth mme la duchesse drily time has a knack now and then of flying faster than we wish well my dear so long as this day brings you happiness the old folk who stay at home have no right to grumble  then as crystal made no reply and held her little head resolutely away madame said more insistently  you are happy crystal are you not  of course i am happy ma tante replied crystal quickly why should you ask  but still she would not look straight into madames eyes and the tone of madames voice sounded anything but satisfied  well she said i ask i suppose because i want an answer    a satisfactory answer  you have had it ma tante have you not  yes my dear if you are happy i am satisfied but last night it seemed to me as if your ideas of your own happiness and those of your father on the same subject were somewhat at variance eh  oh no ma tante rejoined crystal quietly father and i are quite of one mind on that subject  but your heart is pulling a different way is that it  then as crystal once more relapsed into silence and two hot tears dropped on the duchesses wrinkled hands the old woman added softly  st genis who hasnt a sou was out of the question i suppose  crystal shook her head in silence  and that young de marmont is very rich  he is his uncles heir murmured crystal  and you child are marrying a kinsman of that abominable duc de raguse in order to regild our family escutcheon  my father wished it so very earnestly rejoined crystal who was bravely swallowing her tears and i could not bear to run counter to his desire the duc de raguse has promised father that when i am a de marmont he will buy back all the forfeited cambray estates and restore them to us victor will be allowed to take up the name of cambray and    and    oh she exclaimed passionately father has had such a hard life so much sorrow so many disappointments and now this poverty is so horribly grinding    i couldnt have the heart to disappoint him in this  you are a good child crystal said madame gently and no doubt victor de marmont will prove a good husband to you but i wish he wasnt a marmont thats all  but this remark delivered in the old ladys most uncompromising manner brought forth a hot protest from crystal  why aunt she said the duc de raguse is the most faithful servant the king could possibly wish to have it was he and no one else who delivered paris to the allies and thus brought about the downfall of bonaparte and the restoration of our dear king louis to the throne of france  tush child i know that said madame with her habitual tartness of speech i know it just as well as history will know it presently and methinks that history will pass on the duc de raguse just about the same judgment as i passed on him in my heart last year god knows i hate that bonaparte as much as anyone and our bourbon kings are almost as much a part of my religion as is the hierarchy of saints but a traitor like de marmont i cannot stomach what was he before bonaparte made him a marshal of france and created him duc de ragusean outatelbows ragamuffin in the ranks of the republican army to bonaparte he owed everything title money consideration even the military talents which gave him the power to turn on the hand that had fed him delivered paris to the allies indeed continued the duchesse with everincreasing indignation and volubility betrayed bonaparte then licked the boots of the czar of russia of the emperor of king louis of all the deadly enemies of the man to whom he owed his very existence pouah i hate bonaparte but men like ney and berthier and de marmont sicken me thank god that even in his lifetime de marmont duc de raguse has already an inkling of what posterity will say of him has not the french language been enriched since the capitulation of paris with a new word that henceforth and for all times will always spell disloyalty and today when we wish to describe a particularly loathsome type of treachery do we not already speak of a ragusade  crystal had listened in silence to her aunts impassioned tirade now when madame pausedpresumably for want of breathshe said gently  that is all quite true ma tante but i am afraid that father would not altogether see eye to eye with you in this after all she added naively a pagan may become converted to christianity without being called a traitor to his false gods and the duc de raguse may have learnt to hate the idol whom he once worshipped and for this profession of faith we should honour him i think  yes grunted madame unconvinced but we need not marry into his family  but in any case retorted crystal poor victor cannot help what his uncle did  no he cannot assented the duchesse decisively and he is very rich and he loves you and as your husband he will own all the old cambray estates which his uncle of ragusade fame will buy up for him and presently your son my darling will be comte de cambray just as if that awful revolution and all that robbing and spoliation had never been and of course everything will be for the best in the best possible world if only concluded the old lady with a sigh if only i thought that you would be happy  crystal took care not to meet madames kindly glance just then for of a surety the tears would have rushed in a stream to her eyes but she would not give way to any access of selfpity she had chosen her part in life and this she meant to play loyally without regret and without murmur  but of course ma tante i shall be happy she said after a while as you say m de marmont is very kind and good and i know that father will be happy when brestalou and cambray and all the old lands are once more united in his name then he will be able to do something really great and good for the king and for france    and i too perhaps     you my poor darling exclaimed madame what can you do i should like to know  a curious dreamy look came into the girls eyes just as if a foreknowledge of the drama in which she was so soon destined to play the chief rôle had suddenly appeared to her through the cloudy and distant veils of futurity  i dont know ma tante she said slowly but somehow i have always felt that one day i might be called upon to do something for france there are times when that feeling becomes so strong that all thoughts of myself and of my own happiness fade from my knowledge and it seems as if my duty to france and to the king were more insistent than my duty to god  poor france sighed madame  yes that is just what i feel ma tante poor france she has suffered so much more than we have and she has regained so much less enemies still lurk around her the prowling wolf is still at her gate even the throne of her king is still insecure poor poor france our country ma tante she should be our pride our glory and she is weak and torn and beset by treachery oh if only i could do something for france and for the king i would count myself the happiest woman on gods earth  now she was a woman transformed she seemed taller and stronger her girlishness too had vanished her cheeks burned her eyes glowed her breath came and went rapidly through her quivering nostrils mme la duchesse dagen looked down on her niece with naive admiration  hé my little joan of arc she said merrily par dieu your eloquence ma mignonne has warmed up my old heart too but please god our dear old country will not have need of heroism again  i am not so sure of that ma tante  you are thinking of that ugly rumour which was current in grenoble yesterday  yes  if that corsican brigand dares to set his foot again upon this land    began the old lady vehemently  let him come ma tante broke in crystal exultantly we are ready for him let him come and this time when god has punished him again it wont be to elba that he will be sent to expiate his villainies  amen to that my child concluded madame fervently and now my dear dont let me forget the hour of my audience hector will be back in a moment or two and i must not lose any more time gossiping but before i go little one will you tell me one thing  of course i will ma tante  quite frankly  absolutely  well then i want to know    about that english friend of yours     mr clyffurde you mean asked crystal what about him  i want to know my dear what i ought to make of this mr clyffurde  crystal laughed lightly and looked up with astonished inquiring wideopen eyes to her aunt  what should you want to make of him ma tante she asked wholly unperturbed under the scrutinising gaze of madame  nothing said the duchesse abruptly i have had my answer thank you dear  evidently she had no intention of satisfying the girls obvious curiosity for she suddenly rose from her chair gathered her lace shawl round her shoulders and said with abrupt transition  the hour for my audience is at hand not one minute must i keep my august brother waiting i can hear hectors footsteps in the corridor and i will not have him see me in a fluster  crystal looked as if she would have liked to question madame a little more closely about her former cryptic utterance but there was something in the sarcastic twinkle of those sharp eyes which caused the young girl to refrain from too many questions andvery wiselyshe decided to hold her peace  madame la duchesse threw a quick glance into the giltframed mirror close by she smoothed a stray wisp of hair which had escaped from under her lace cap she gave a tug to her fichu and a pat to her skirts then as the folding doors were once more thrown open and hectorstiff solemn and pompousappeared under the lintel madame threw back her head in the grand manner pertaining to the old days at versailles  precede me hector she said with consummate dignity to m le comtes audience chamber  and with hands folded before her her aristocratic head very erect her mouth and eyes composed to reposeful majesty she sailed out through the mahogany doors in a style which no one who had never curtsied to the bienaimé monarque could possibly hope to imitate   ii  for some little while after her aunt had sailed out of the room crystal remained where she was sitting on the low stool beside the highbacked chair just vacated by the duchess  her eyes were still glowing with the enthusiasm which had excited the admiration of the older woman a while ago and the high colour in her cheeks the tremor of her nostrils showed that that same enthusiasm still kept her nerves on the quiver and caused the young hot blood to course swiftly through her veins  but something of the lightness of her mood had vanished something of the exultant joy of the heroine had given place to the calmer resignation of the potential martyr gradually the colour faded from her cheeks the light died slowly out of her eyes and the young fair head so lately tossed triumphantly in the ardour of patriotism sunk gradually upon the still heaving breast  crystal was alone and she was not ashamed to let the tears well up to her eyes despite her proud profession of faith the insistent longing for happiness which is the inalienable share of youth knocked at the portals of her heart  not even to the devoted aunt who had brought her up who had known her every childish sorrow and gleaned her every childish tear not even to her would she show what it cost her to sink her individuality her longings her hopes of happiness into that overwhelming sense of duty to her fathers wishes and to the demands of her name her country and her caste  she had repeated it to herself often and often that her father had suffered so much for the sake of his convictions had endured poverty and exile where opportunism would have dictated submission to the usurper bonaparte and the acceptance of riches and honours at his hands he had remained loyal in his beliefs steadfast to his king through twenty years of misery akin to squalor the remembrance of which would for ever darken the rest of his life but he had endured all that without bitterness scarcely without a murmur and now that twenty years of selfabnegation were at last finding their reward now that the king had come into his own and the kings faithful friends were being compensated in accordance with the length of the kings purse would it not be arrant cowardice and disloyalty for heran only childto oppose her fathers will in the ordering of her own future to refuse the rich marriage which would help to restore dignity and grandeur to the ancient name and to the old home  crystal de cambray was born in england she had lived the whole of her life in a small provincial town in this country but she had been brought up by her aunt the duchesse douairière dagen and through that upbringing she had been made to imbibe from her earliest childhood all the principles of the old regime these principles consisted chiefly of implicit obedience by the children to the parents decrees anent marriage of blind worship of the dignity of station and of duty to name and caste to king and country  the thought would never have entered crystals head that she could have the right to order her own future or to demand from life her own special brand of happiness  now her fate had been finally decided on by her father and she was on the point of takingat his wishthe irrevocable step which would bind her for ever to a man whom she could never love but she did not think of rebellion she had no thought of grumbling at fate or at her father crystal de cambray had english blood in her veins the blood that makes men and women accept the inevitable with set teeth and a determination to do the right thing even if it hurts crystal therefore had no thought of rebellion she only felt an infinity of regret for something sweet and intangible which she had hardly realised hardly expected which had been too elusive to be called hope too remote to be termed happiness she gave herself the luxury of this short outburst of tearssince nobody was near and nobody could see there was a fearful pain in her heart while she rested her head against the cushion of the stiff highbacked chair and cried till it seemed that she never could cry again whatever sorrow life might still have in store for her  but when that outburst of grief had subsided she dried her eyes resolutely rose to her feet arranged her hair in front of the mirror and feeling that her eyes were hot and her head heavy she turned to the tall french window opened it and stepped out into the garden   it had suffered from years of neglect the shrubs grew rank and stalky the paths were covered with weeds but there was a slight feeling of spring in the air the bare branches of the trees seemed swollen with the rising sap and upon the edge of the terrace balustrade a redbreasted robin cocked its mischievous little eye upon her  at the bottom of the garden there was a fine row of ilex with here and there a stone seat and in the centre an old stone fountain mosscovered and overshadowed by the hanging boughs of the huge melancholy trees crystal was very fond of this avenue she liked to sit and watch the play of sunshine upon the stone of the fountain the melancholy quietude of the place suited her present mood it was so strange to look on these big evergreen trees and on the havoc caused by weeds and weather on the fine carving of the fountain and to think of their going on here year after year for the past twenty years while that hideous revolution had devastated the whole country while men had murdered each other slaughtered women and children and committed every crime and every infamy which lust of hate and revenge can engender in the hearts of men the old trees and the stone fountain had remained peaceful and still the while unscathed and undefiled grand dignified and majestic while the owner of the fine château of the gardens and the fountain and of half the province around earned a precarious livelihood in a foreign land halfstarved in wretchedness and exile  she crystal had never seen them until some ten months ago when her father came back into his own and leading his daughter by the hand had taken her on a tour of inspection to show her the magnificence of her ancestral home she had loved at once the fine old château with its lichencovered walls its fine portcullis and crenelated towers she had wept over the torn tapestries the broken furniture the family portraits which a rough and impious rabble had wilfully damaged she had loved the wide sweep of the terrace walls the views over the isère and across the mountain range to the peaks of the grande chartreuse but above all she had loved this sombre row of ilex trees the broken fountain the hush and peace which always lay over this secluded portion of the neglected garden  the earth was moist and soft under her feet the cheeky robin curious after the manner of his kind had followed her and was flying from seat to seat ahead of her watching her every movement  crystal  at first she thought that it was the wind sighing through the trees so softly had her name been spoken so like a sigh did it seem as it reached her ears  crystal  this time she could not be mistaken someone had called her name someone was walking up the avenue rapidly behind her she would not turn round for she knew who it was that had called and she would not allow surprise to resuscitate the outward signs of regret but she stood quite still while those hasty footsteps drew nearer and she made a great and successful effort to keep back the tears which once more threatened to fill her eyes  a minute later she felt herself gently drawn to the nearest stone seat and she sank down upon it still trying very hard to remain calm and above all not to cry  oh why why did you come maurice she said at last when she felt that she could look with some semblance of composure on the halfsitting halfkneeling figure of the young man beside her despite her obstinate resistance he had taken her hand in his and was covering it with kisses  why did you come she reiterated pleadingly you must know that it is no use     i cant believe it i wont believe it he protested passionately crystal if you really cared you would not send me away from you  if i really cared she said dully maurice sometimes i think that if you really cared you would not make it so difficult for me cant you see she added more vehemently that every time you come you make me more wretched and my duty seem more hard till sometimes i feel as if i could not bear it any longeras if in the struggle my poor heart would suddenly break  and because your father is so heartless    he began vehemently  my father is not heartless maurice she broke in firmly but you must try and see for yourself how impossible it was for him to give his consent to our marriage even if he knew that my happiness was bounded by your love    just think it over quietlyif you had a sister who was all the world to you would you consent to such a marriage     with a penniless outatelbows goodfornothing you mean he said with a kind of resentful bitterness no i dare say i should not money he cried impetuously as he jumped to his feet and burying his hands in the pockets of his breeches he began pacing the path up and down in front of her money always money always talk of duty and of obedience    always your father and his sorrows and his desires    do i count for nothing then have i not suffered as he has suffered did i not live in exile as he did have i not made sacrifices for my king and for my ideals why should i suffer in the future as well as in the past why because my king is powerless or supine in giving me back what was filched from my father should that be taken from me which alone gives me incentive to live    you crystal he added as once again he knelt beside her he encircled her shoulders with his arms then he seized her two hands and covered them with kisses you are all that i want in this world after all we can live in poverty    we have been brought up in poverty you and i    and even then it is only a question of a few years    months perhaps    the king must give us back what that abominable revolution took from usfrom us who remained loyal to him and because we were loyal my father owned rich lands in burgundy    the king must give those back to me    he must    he shall    he will    if only you will be patient crystal    if only you will wait     the fiery blood of his race had rushed into maurice de st genis head he was talking volubly and at random but he believed for the moment everything that he said tears of passion and of fervour came to his eyes and he buried his head in the folds of crystals white gown and heavy sobs shook his bent shoulders she moved by that motherly tenderness which is seldom absent from a good womans love stroked with soothing fingers the matted hair from his hot forehead for a while she remained silent while the paroxysm of his passionate revolt spent itself in tears then she said quite softly  i think maurice that in your heart you do us all an injusticeto me to father to yourself even to the king the king cannot give you that which is not his your propertylike ourswas confiscated by that awful revolutionary government because your father and mine followed their king into exile the rich lands were sold for the benefit of the nation the nation presumably has spent the money but the people who bought the lands in good faith cannot be dispossessed by our king without creating bitter illfeeling against himself as you well know and once more endangering his throne those are the facts maurice against which no hotblooded argument no passionate outbursts can prevail the king gave my father back this dear old castle because it happened to have proved unsaleable and was still on the nations hands our rich landslike yourscan never be restored to us that hard fact has been driven into poor fathers head for the past ten months and now it has gone home at last these grey walls this neglected garden a few sticks of broken furniture a handful of money from an overgenerous kings treasury is all that fate has rescued for him from out the ashes of the past my father is every whit as penniless as you are yourself maurice as penniless as ever he was in england when he gave french and drawing lessons to a lot of young ragamuffins in a middleclass school but victor de marmont is rich and his moneyonce i am his wifewill purchase back all the estates which have been in our family for hundreds of years for my fathers sake for the sake of the name which i bear i must give my hand to victor de marmont and pray to god that some semblance of peace the sense of duty accomplished will compensate me for the happiness to which i shall bid goodbye today  and you are willing to be sold to young de marmont for the price of a few acres of land retorted maurice de st genis hotly oh its monstrous crystal monstrous all the more monstrous as you seem quite unconscious of the iniquity of such a bargain  women of our caste maurice she said in her turn with a touch of bitterness have often before now been sacrificed for the honour of their name men have been accustomed to look to them for help when their own means of gilding their escutcheons have failed  and you are willing crystal to be sold like this he insisted  my father wishes me to marry victor de marmont she replied with calm dignity and after all that he has suffered for the honour and dignity of our name i should deem myself craven and treacherous if i refused to obey him in this  maurice de st genis once more rose to his feet all his vehemence his riotous outbreak of rebellion seemed to have been smothered beneath a pall of dreary despair his young goodlooking face appeared sombre and sullen his restless dark eyes wandered obstinately from crystals fair bent head to her stooping shoulders to her hands to her feet it seemed as if he was trying to engrave an image of her upon his turbulent brain or that he wished to force her to look on him again before she spoke the last words of farewell  but she wouldnt look at him she kept her head resolutely averted looking far out over the undulating lands of dauphiné and savoie to where in the far distant sky the stately alps reared their snowcrowned heads at last unable to bear her silence any longer he said dully  then it is your last word crystal  you know that it must be maurice she murmured in reply my marriage contract will be signed tonight and on tuesday i go to the altar with victor de marmont  and you mean to tear your love for me out of your heart  yes  were its roots a little deeper a little stronger you could not do it crystal but they are not so deep as those of your love for your father  she made no reply    perhaps something in her heart told her that after all he might be right that unbeknown to herself even there were tendrils of affection in her that bound her ivylike and so closelyto her father that even her girlish love for maurice de st genisthe first hint of passion that had stirred the smooth depths of her young heartcould not tear her from that bulwark to which she clung  this is the last time that i shall see you crystal said maurice with a sigh seeing that obviously she meant to allow his taunt to pass unchallenged  you are going away she asked  how can i stayhere under this roof where anonin a few hoursvictor de marmont will have claims upon you which if he exercised them before me would make me wish to kill him or myself i shall leave tomorrowearly    he added more quietly  where will you go  to parisor abroador the devil i dont know which he replied moodily  father will be sorry if you go she murmured under her breath for once again the tears were very insistent and she felt an awful pain in her heart because of the misery which she had to inflict upon him  your father has been passing kind to me he gave me a home when i was homeless but it is not fitting that i should trespass any longer upon his hospitality  have you made any plans  not yet but the king will give me a commission there will be some fighting now    there was a rumour in grenoble last night that bonaparte had landed at antibes and was marching on paris  a false rumour as usual i suppose she said indifferently  perhaps he replied  there was silence between them for awhile after that silence only broken by the twitter of birds wakening to the call of spring the word goodbye remained unspoken neither of them dared to say it lest it broke the barrier of their resolve  will you not go now maurice said crystal at last in pitiable pleading we only make each other hopelessly wretched by lingering near one another after this  yes i will go crystal he replied and this time he really forced his voice to tones of gentleness although his inward resentment still bubbled out with every word he spoke i wish i could have left this house altogethernowat oncebut your father would resent itand he has been so kind    i wish i could go today he reiterated obstinately i dread seeing victor de marmont in this house where the laws of chivalry forbid my striking him in the face  maurice she exclaimed reproachfully  nay ill not say it again i have sufficient reason left in me i think to show these parvenus how we of the old regime bear every blow which fate chooses to deal to us they have taken everything from us these new menour lives our lands our very means of subsistencenow they have taken to filching our sweetheartscurse them but at least let us keep our dignity  but again she was silent what was there to say that had not been saidsave that unspoken word goodbye and he asked very softly  may i kiss you for the last time crystal  no maurice she replied never again  you are still free he urged you are not plighted to de marmont yet  nonot actuallynot till tonight     then    maynt i  no maurice she said decisively  your hand then  if you like he knelt down close to her she yielded her hand to him and he with his usual impulsiveness covered it with kisses into which he tried to infuse the fervour of a last farewell  then without another word he rose to his feet and walked away with a long and firm stride down the avenue crystal watched his retreating figure until the overhanging branches of the ilex hid him from her view  she made no attempt now to restrain her tears they flowed uninterruptedly down her cheeks and dropped hot and searing upon her hands with maurices figure disappearing down the dark avenue with the echo of his footsteps dying away in the distance the last chapter of her first book of romance seemed to be closing with relentless finality  the afternoon sun was hidden behind a bank of grey clouds the northeast wind came whistling insistently through the treeseven that feeling of spring in the air had vanished it was just a bleak grey winters day now crystal felt herself shivering with cold she drew her shawl more closely round her shoulders then with eyes still wet with tears but small head held well erect she rose to her feet and walked rapidly back to the house   iii  madame la duchesse had in the meanwhile followed hector along the corridor and down the finely carved marble staircase at a monumental door on the ground floor the man paused his hand upon the massive ormolu handle waiting for madame la duchesse to come up  he felt a little uncomfortable at her approach for here in the big square hall the light was very clear and he could see madames keen searching eyes looking him up and down and through and through she even put up her lorgnon and though she was not very tall she contrived to look hector through them straight between the eyes  is m le comte in there madame la duchesse deigned to ask as she pointed with her lorgnon to the door  in the small library beyond madame la duchesse replied hector stiffly  and    she queried with sharp sarcasm is the antechamber very full of courtiers and ladies just now  a quick almost imperceptible blush spread over hectors impassive countenance and as quickly vanished again  m le comte he said imperturbably is disengaged at the present moment he seldom receives visitors at this hour  on madames mobile lips the sarcastic curl became more marked and i suppose my good hector she said that since m le comte has only granted an audience to his sister today you thought it was a good opportunity for putting yourself at your ease and wearing your patched and mended clothes eh  once more that sudden wave of colour swept over hectors solemn old face he was evidently at a loss how to take mme la duchesses remarkwhether as a rebuke or merely as one of those mild jokes of which every one knew that madame was inordinately fond  something of his dignity of attitude seemed to fall away from him as he vainly tried to solve this portentous problem his mouth felt dry and his head hot and he did not know on which foot he could stand with the least possible discomfort and how he could contrive to hide from madame la duchesses piercing eyes that very obvious patch in the right knee of his breeches  madame la duchesse will forgive me i hope he stammered painfully  but already madames kind old face had shed its mask of raillery  never mind hector she said gently you are a good fellow and theres no occasion to tell me lies about the rich liveries which are put away somewhere nor about the numerous retinue and countless number of flunkeys all of whom are having unaccountably long holidays just now its no use trying to throw dust in my eyes my poor friend or put on that pompous manner with me i know that the carpets are not all temporarily rolled up or the best of the furniture at a repairers in grenoblewhats the use of pretending with me old hector those days at worcester are not so distant yet are they when all the family had to make a meal off a pound of sausages or your wife jeanne god bless her had to pawn her weddingring to buy m le comte de cambray a secondhand overcoat  madame la duchesse i humbly pray your grace    entreated hector whose wrinkled parchmentlike face had become the colour of a peony and who torn between the respect which he had for the great lady and his horror at what she said was ready to sink through the floor in his confusion  eh what man retorted the duchesse lightly there is no one but these bare walls to hear me and my words youll find will clear the atmosphere round youit was very stifling my good hector when i arrived there now she added announce me to m le comte and then go down to jeanne and tell her that i for one have no intention of forgetting worcester or the pawned ring or the sausages and that the array of grenoble louts dressed up for the occasion in motheaten liveries dragged up out of some old chests do not please me half as much round a dinner table as did her dear old streaming face when she used to bring us the omelette straight out of the kitchen  she dropped her lorgnon and folding her aristocratic hands upon her bosom she once more assumed the grand manner pertaining to versailles and hector having swallowed an uncomfortable lump in his throat threw open the huge folding doors and announced in a stentorian voice  madame la duchesse douairière dagen   iv  m le comte de cambray was at this time close on sixty years of age and the hardships which he had endured for close upon a quarter of a century had left their indelible impress upon his wrinkled careworn face  but no oneleast of all a younger mancould possibly rival him in dignity of bearing and gracious condescension of manner he wore his clothes after the oldtime fashion and clung to the powdered peruque which had been the mode at the tuileries and versailles before these vulgar young republicans took to wearing their own hair in its natural colour  now as he advanced from the inner room to meet mme la duchesse he seemed a perfect presentation or rather resuscitation of the courtly and vanished epoch of the roi soleil he held himself very erect and walked with measured step and a stereotyped smile upon his lips he paused just in front of mme la duchesse then stopped and lightly touched with his lips the hand which she held out to him  tell me monsieur my brother said madame in her loudlypitched voice do you expect me to make before you my best versailles curtsey forwith my rheumatic kneei warn you that once i get down you might find it very difficult to get me up on my feet again  hush sophie admonished m le comte impatiently you must try and subdue your voice a little we are no longer in worcester remember  but madame only shrugged her thin shoulders  bah she retorted theres only good old hector on the other side of the door and you dont imagine you are really throwing dust in his eyes do you    good old hector with his threadbare livery and his illfed belly     sophie exclaimed m le comte who was really vexed this time i must insist     all right all right my dear andré    i wont say anything more take me to your audience chamber and ill try to behave like a lady  a smile that was distinctly mischievous still hovered round madames lips but she forced her eyes to look grave she held out the tips of her fingers to her brother and allowed him to lead her in the correct manner into the next room  here m le comte invited her to sit in an upright chair which was placed at a convenient angle close to his bureau while he himself sat upon a stately thronelike armchair one shapely knee bent the other slightly stretched forward displaying the fine silk stocking and the set of his wellcut satin breeches mme la duchesse kept her hands folded in front of her and waited in silence for her brother to speak but he seemed at a loss how to begin for her piercing gaze was making him feel very uncomfortable he could not help but detect in it the twinkle of goodhumoured sarcasm  madame of course would not help him out she enjoyed his obvious embarrassment which took him down somewhat from that high altitude of dignity wherein he delighted to soar  my dear sophie he began at last speaking very deliberately and carefully choosing his words before the step which crystal is about to take today becomes absolutely irrevocable i desired to talk the matter over with you since it concerns the happiness of my only child  isnt it a little late my good andré remarked madame drily to talk over a question which has been decided a month ago the contract is to be signed tonight our present conversation might have been held to some purpose soon after the new year it is distinctly useless today  at madames sharp and uncompromising words a quick blush had spread over the comtes sunken cheeks  i could not consult you before sophie he said coldly you chose to immure yourself in a convent rather than come back straightaway to your old home as we all did when our king was restored to his throne the post has been very disorganised and boulogne is a far cry from brestalou but i did write to you as soon as victor de marmont made his formal request for crystals hand to this letter i had no reply and i could not keep him waiting in indefinite uncertainty  your letter did not reach me until a month after it was written as i had the honour to tell you in my reply  and that same reply only reached me a fortnight ago retorted the comte when crystal had been formally engaged to victor de marmont for over a month and the date for the signature of the contract and the weddingday had both been fixed i then sent a courier at great expense and in great haste immediately to you he added with a tone of dignified reproach i could do no more  or less she assented tartly and here i am my dear brother and i am not blaming you for delays in the post i merely remarked that it was too late now to consult me upon a marriage which is to all intents and purposes an accomplished fact already  that is so of course but it would be a great personal satisfaction to me my good sophie to hear your views upon the matter you have brought crystal up from babyhood in a measure you know her better than even iher fatherdo and therefore you are better able than i am to judge whether crystals marriage with de marmont will be conducive to her permanent happiness  as to that my good andré quoth madame you must remember that when our father and mother decided that a marriage between me and m le duc dagen was desirable my personal feelings and character were never consulted for a moment    and i suppose thattaking life as it isi was never particularly unhappy as his wife  and what do you adduce from those reminiscences my dear sophie queried the comte de cambray suavely  that victor de marmont is not a bad fellow replied madame that he is no worse than was m le duc dagen and that therefore there is no reason to suppose that crystal will be any more unhappy than i was in my time  but     there is no but about it my good andré crystal is a sweet girl and a devoted daughter she will make the best never you fear of the circumstances into which your blind worship of your own dignity and of your rank have placed her  my good sophie broke in the count hotly you talk par dieu as if i was forcing my only child into a distasteful marriage  no i do not talk as if you were forcing crystal into a distasteful marriage but you know quite well that she only accepted victor de marmont because it was your wish and because his millions are going to buy back the old cambray estates and she is so imbued with the sense of her duty to you and to the family escutcheon that she was willing to sacrifice every personal feeling in the fulfilment of that duty  by personal feeling i suppose that you mean st genis  well yes    i do said madame laconically  crystal was very much in love with him at one time  she still is  but even you my dear sister must admit that a marriage with st genis was out of the question retorted the count in his turn with some acerbity i am very fond of maurice and his name is as old and great as ours but he hasnt a sou and you know as well as i do by now that the restoration of confiscated lands is out of the question    parliament will never allow it and the king will never dare     i know all that my poor andré sighed madame in a more conciliatory spirit i know moreover that you yourself havent a sou either in spite of your grandeur and your prejudices    money must be got somehow and our ancient family scutcheon must be regilt at any cost i know that we must keep up this state pertaining to the old regime we must have our lacqueys and our liveries sycophants around us and gaping yokels on our way when we sally out into the open    we must blot out from our lives those twenty years spent in a democratic and enlightened country where no one is ashamed either of poverty or of honest workand above all things we must forget that there has ever been a revolution which sent m le comte de cambray commander of the order of the holy ghost grand cross of the ordre du lys seigneur of montfleury and st eynard hereditary grand chamberlain of france to teach french and drawing in an english grammar school     you wrong me there sophie i wish to forget nothing of the past twenty years  i thought that you had given your memory a holiday  i forget nothing he reiterated with dignified emphasis neither the squalid poverty which i endured nor the bitter experiences which i gleaned in exile  nor the devotion of those who saved your life  and yours    he interposed  and mine at risk of their own  perhaps you will believe me when i tell you that not a day goes by but crystal and i speak of sir percy blakeney and of his gallant league of the scarlet pimpernel  well we owe our lives to them said madame with deepdrawn sigh i wonder if we shall ever see any of those fine fellows again  god only knows sighed m le comte in response but he continued more lightly as you know the league itself has ceased to be we saw very little of sir percy and lady blakeney latterly for we were too poor ever to travel up to london crystal and i saw them before we left england and i then had the opportunity of thanking sir percy blakeney for the last time for the many valuable french lives which his plucky little league had saved  he is indeed a gallant gentleman said mme la duchesse gently even whilst her bright shrewd eyes gazed straight out before her as if on the great bare walls of her own ancestral home the ghostly hand of memory had conjured up pictures of long agoher own her husbands and her brothers arrest here in this very room the weeping servants the rough halfnaked soldierythen the agony of a nine days imprisonment in a dark dank prisoncell filled to overflowing with poor wretches in the same pitiable plight as herselfthe hasty trial the insults the mockeryher husbands death in prison and her own thoughts of approaching death  then the gallant deedafter all these years she could still see herself her brother and jeanne her faithful maid and poor devoted hector all huddled up in a rickety tumbril being dragged through the streets of paris on the road to death on ahead she had seen the weird outline of the guillotine silhouetted against the evening sky whilst all around her a howling jeering mob sang that awful refrain cà ira cà ira les aristos à la lanterne  then it was that she had felt unseen hands snatching her out of the tumbril she had felt herself being dragged through that yelling crowd to a place where there was silence and darkness and where she knew that she was safe thence she was conveyedshe hardly realised howto england where she and her brother and jeanne and hector their faithful servants had found refuge for over twenty years  it was a gallant deed whispered mme la duchesse once again and one which will always make me love every englishman i meet for the sake of one who was called the scarlet pimpernel  then why should you attribute vulgar ingratitude to me retorted the comte reproachfully my feelings i imagine are as sensitive as your own am i not trying my best to be kind to that mr clyffurde who is an honoured guest in my housejust because it was sir percy blakeney who recommended him to me  it cant be very difficult to be kind to such an attractive young man was mme la duchesses dry comment recommendation or no recommendation i liked your mr clyffurde and if it were not so late in the day and there was still time to give my opinion i should suggest that mr clyffurdes money could quite well regild our family scutcheon he is very rich too i understand  my good sophie exclaimed the comte in horror what can you be thinking of  crystal principally replied the duchesse i thought clyffurde a far nicer fellow than de marmont  my dear sister said the comte stiffly i really must ask you to think sometimes before you speak of a truth you make suggestions and comments at times which literally stagger one  i dont see anything so very staggering in the idea of a penniless aristocrat marrying a wealthy english gentleman     a gentleman my dear exclaimed the comte  well mr clyffurde is a gentleman isnt he  his family is irreproachable i believe  well then  but    mr clyffurde    you know my dear     no i dont know said madame decisively what is the matter with mr clyffurde  well i didnt like to tell you sophie immediately on your arrival yesterday said the comte who was making visible efforts to mitigate the horror of what he was about to say but    as a matter of fact    this mr clyffurde whom you met in my house last night    who sat next to you at my table    with whom you had that long and animated conversation afterwards    is nothing better than a shopkeeper  no doubt m le comte de cambray expected that at this awful announcement mme la duchesses indignation and anger would know no bounds he was quite ready even now with a string of apologies which he would formulate directly she allowed him to speak he certainly felt very guilty towards her for the undesirable acquaintance which she had made in her brothers own house great was his surprise therefore when madames wrinkled face wreathed itself into a huge smile which presently broadened into a merry laugh as she threw back her head and said still laughing  a shopkeeper my dear comte a shopkeeper at your aristocratic table and your meal did not choke you why god forgive you but i do believe you are actually becoming human  i ought to have told you sooner of course began the comte stiffly  why bless your heart i knew it soon enough  you knew it  of course i did mr clyffurde told me that interesting fact before he had finished eating his soup  did he tell you that    that he traded in    in gloves  well and why not gloves she retorted gloves are very nice things and better manufactured at grenoble than anywhere else in the world the english coquettes are very wise in getting their gloves from grenoble through the good offices of mr clyffurde  but my dear sophie    mr clyffurde buys gloves here from dumoulin and sells them again to a shop in london    he buys and sells other things too and he does it for profit     of course he does    you dont suppose that any one would do that sort of thing for pleasure do you mr clyffurde continued madame with sudden seriousness lost his father when he was six years old his mother and four sisters had next to nothing to live on after the bulk of what they had went for the education of the boy at eighteen he made up his mind that he would provide his mother and sisters with all the luxuries which they had lacked for so long and instead of going into the armywhich had been the burning ambition of his boyhoodhe went into business    and in less than ten years has made a fortune  you seem to have learnt a great deal of the mans family history in so short a time  i liked him and i made him talk to me about himself it was not easy for these english men are stupidly reticent but i dragged his story out of him bit by bitor at least as much of it as i couldand i can tell you my good andré that never have i admired a man so much as i do this mr clyffurde    for never have i met so unselfish a one i declare that if i were only a few years younger she continued whimsically and even so    heigh but i am not so old after all     my dear sophie ejaculated the comte  eh what she retorted tartly you would object to a tradesman as a brotherinlaw would you what about a de marmont for a son eh  victor de marmont is a soldier in the army of our legitimate king his uncle the duc de raguse     thats just it broke in madame again i dont like de marmont because he is a de marmont  is that the only reason for your not liking him  the only one she replied but i must say that this mr clyffurde     you must not harp on that string sophie said the comte sternly it is too ridiculous to begin with clyffurde never cared for crystal and secondly crystal was already engaged to de marmont when clyffurde arrived here and thirdly let me tell you that my daughter has far too much pride in her ever to think of a shopkeeper in the light of a husband even if he had ten times this mr clyffurdes fortune  then everything is comfortably settled andré and now that we have returned to our sheep and have both arrived at the conclusion that nothing stands in the way of crystals marriage with victor de marmont i suppose that i may presume that my audience is at an end  i only wished to hear your opinion my good sophie rejoined m le comte and he rose stiffly from his chair  well and you have heard it andré concluded madame as she too rose and gathered her lace shawl round her shoulders you may thank god my dear brother that you have in crystal such an unselfish and obedient child and in me such a submissive sister franklysince you have chosen to ask my opinion at this eleventh houri dont like this de marmont marriage though i have admitted that i see nothing against the young man himself if crystal is not unhappy with him i shall be content if she is i will make myself exceedingly disagreeable both to him and to you and that being my last word i have the honour to wish you a polite goodday  she swept her brother an imperceptibly ironical curtsey but he detained her once again as she turned to go  one word more sophie he said solemnly you will be amiable with victor de marmont this evening  of course i will she replied tartly ah ça monsieur my brother do you take me for a washerwoman  i am entertaining the préfet for the souper du contrat continued the comte quietly ignoring the old ladys irascibility of temper and the general in command of the garrison they are both converted bonapartists remember  hm grunted madame crossly whom else are you going to entertain  mme fourier the préfets wife and mlle marchand the generals daughter and of course the dembruns and the genevois  is that all  some half dozen or so notabilities of grenoble we shall sit down twenty to supper and afterwards i hold a reception in honour of the coming marriage of mlle de cambray de brestalou with m victor de marmont one must do ones duty     and pander to ones love of playing at being a little king in a limited way    all right i wont say anything more i promise that i wont disgrace you and that ill put on a grand manner that will fill those worthy notabilities and their wives with awe and reverence and now id best go she added whimsically ere my good resolutions break down before your pomposity    i suppose the louts from the village will be again braced up in those motheaten liveries and the bottles of thin médoc purchased surreptitiously at a local grocers will be duly smothered in the dust of ages    all right all right im going for gracious sake dont conduct me to the door or ill really disgrace you under hectors uplifted nose    oh shades of cold beef and treacle pies of worcester    and washingday    do you remember    all right all right monsieur my brother i am dumb as a carp at last  and with a final outburst of sarcastic laughter madame finally sailed across the room while monsieur fell back into his thronelike chair with a deep sigh of relief     chapter iii  the return of the emperor   i  but even as madame la duchesse douairière dagen placed her aristocratic hand upon the handle of the door it was opened from without with what might almost be called undue haste and hector appeared in the doorway  hector in truth but not the soberfaced pompous dignified hector of the household of m le comte de cambray but a redvisaged excited fussy hector who for the moment seemed to have forgotten where he was as well as the etiquette which surrounded the august personality of his master he certainly contrived to murmur a humble if somewhat hasty apology when he found himself confronted at the door by mme la duchesse herself but he did not stand aside to let her pass  she had stepped back into the room at sight of him for obviously something very much amiss must have occurred thus to ruffle hectors ingrained dignity and even m le comte was involuntarily dragged out of his aristocratic aloofness and almostthough not quitejumped up from his chair  what is it hector he exclaimed peremptorily  m le comte gasped hector who seemed to be out of breath from sheer excitement the corsican    he has come back    he is marching on grenoble    m le préfet is here     but already m le comte hadwith a wave of the hand as it wereswept the unwelcome news aside  what rubbish is this he said wrathfully you have been dreaming in broad daylight hector    and this excitement is most unseemly show mme la duchesse to her apartments he added with a great show of calm  hectorthus reproved coloured a yet more violent crimson to the very roots of his hair he made a great effort to recover his pomposity and actually took up the correct attitude which a welltrained servant assumes when he shows a great lady out of a room but even thendespite the wellmerited reproofhe took it upon himself to insist  m le préfet is here m le comte he said and begs to be received at once  well then you may show him up when mme la duchesse has retired said the comte with quiet dignity  by your leave my brother quoth the duchesse decisively ill wait and hear what m le préfet has to say the newsif news there beis too interesting to be kept waiting for me  and accustomed as she was to get her own way in everything mme la duchesse calmly sailed back into the room and once more sat down in the chair beside her brothers bureau whilst hector with as much grandeur of mien as he could assume under the circumstances was still waiting for orders  m le comte would undoubtedly have preferred that his sister should leave the room before the préfet was shown in he did not approve of women taking part in political conversations and his manner now plainly showed to mme la duchesse that he would like to receive m le préfet alone but he said nothingprobably because he knew that words would be useless if madame had made up her mind to remain which she evidently had so after a brief pause he said curtly to hector  show m le préfet in  he took up his favourite position in his throneshaped chairone leg bent the other stretched out displaying to advantage the shapely calf and wellshod foot m le préfet fourier mathematician of great renown and member of the institut was one of those converted bonapartists to whom it behoved at all times to teach a lesson of decorum and dignity  and certainly when presently hector showed m fourier in the two menthe aristocrat of the old regime and the bureaucrat of the newpresented a marked and curious contrast m le comte de cambray calm unperturbed slightly supercilious in a studied attitude and moving with pompous deliberation to greet his guest and jacques fourier man of science and préfet of the isère department short of stature scant of breath flurried and florid  both men were conscious of the contrast and m fourier did his very best to approach mme la duchesse with a semblance of dignity and to kiss her hand in something of the approved courtly manner when he had finally sat down and mopped his streaming forehead m le comte said with kindly condescension  you are perturbed my good m fourier  alas m le comte replied the worthy préfet still somewhat out of breath how can i help being agitated    this awful news     what news queried the comte with a lifting of the brows which was meant to convey complete detachment and indifference to the subject matter  what news exclaimed the préfet who on the other hand was unable to contain his agitation and had obviously given up the attempt havent you heard     no replied the comte  and madame also shook her head  towngossip does not travel as far as the castle of brestalou added m le comte gravely  town gossip reiterated m fourier who seemed to be calling heaven to witness this extraordinary levity town gossip m le comte    but god in heaven help us all bonaparte landed at antibes five days ago he was at sisteron this morning and unless the earth opens and swallows him up he will be on us by tuesday  bah you have had a nightmare m le préfet rejoined the comte drily we have had news of the landing of bonaparte at least once a month this halfyear past  but it is authentic news this time m le comte retorted fourier who gradually under the influence of de cambrays calm demeanour had succeeded in keeping his agitation in check the préfet of the var department m le comte de bouthillier sent an express courier on thursday last to the préfet of the bassesalpes who sent that courier straight on to me telling me that he and general loverdo who is in command of the troops in that district promptly evacuated digue because they were not certain of the loyalty of the garrison the corsican it seems only landed with about a thousand of his old guard but since then the troops in every district which he has traversed have deserted in a body and rallied round his standard it has been so i hear a triumphal march for him from the littoral to digne and altogether the news which the courier brought me this morning was of such alarming nature that i thought it my duty m le comte to apprise you of it immediately  that said m le comte condescendingly was exceedingly thoughtful and considerate my good m fourier and what is the alarming news  firstly that bonaparte made something like a state entry into digne yesterday the city was beflagged and decorated the national guard turned out and presented arms drums were beating the population acclaimed him with cries of vive lempereur the préfet and the general in command had intended to resist his entry into the city but all the notabilities of the town forced them into submission duval the préfet fled to a neighbouring village taking the public funds with him while general loverdo with a mere handful of loyal troops has retreated on sisteron  though m le comte de cambray had listened to the préfets narrative with all his habitual grandeur of mien it soon became obvious that some of his aristocratic sangfroid had already abandoned him his furrowed cheeks had become a shade paler than usual and the slender hand which toyed with an ivory paperknife on his desk had not its wonted steadiness mme la duchesse perceived this no doubt for her keen eyes were fixed scrutinisingly upon her brother she saw too that his thin lips were quivering and that the reason why he made no comment on what he had just heard was because he could not quite trust himself to speak it was she therefore who now remarked quietly  and in your department m le préfet in grenoble itself is the garrison equally likely to go over to the corsican brigand  m fourier shrugged his shoulders he was not at all sure  after what has happened at digne mme la duchesse he said i would not care to prophesy général marchand does not intend to trust entirely to the garrison he has sent to vienne and to chambéry for reinforcements    but     the préfet was hesitating evidently he had not a great deal of faith in the loyalty of those reinforcements either  m le comte made a vigorous protest surely m fourier he said you dont mean to suggest that grenoble is going to turn traitor to the king  but m le préfet apparently had meant to suggest it  alas m le comte he said we must always bear in mind that the whole of the dauphiné has remained throughout a bed of bonapartism  but in that case    ejaculated the comte  général marchand is doing all he can to ensure effectual resistance m le comte but we are in the hands of the army and the army has never been truly loyal to the king at the bottom of every soldiers haversack there is an old and worn tricolour cockade which is there ready to be fetched out at a moments notice and will be fetched out at the mere sound of the corsicans voice we are in the hands of the army m le comte and in the dauphiné alas the army is only too ready to cry vive lempereur  there was silence in the stately room now silence only broken by the taptap of the ivory paperknife with which m le comte was still nervously fidgeting m fourier was wiping the perspiration from his overheated brow  for gods sake andré stop that irritating noise said mme duchesse after awhile that tapping has got on my nerves  i beg your pardon sophie said the comte loftily  he was offended with her for drawing m fouriers attention to his own nervous restlessness yet grateful to be thus forcibly made aware of it himself his attitude was on the verge of incorrectness where was the aristocratic sangfroid which should have made him proof even against so much perturbing news what had become of the lesson in decorum which should have been taught to this vulgar little bureaucrat  m le comte pulled himself together with a jerk he straightened out his spare figure put on that air of detachment which became him so well and finally turned once more to the préfet a perfectly calm and unruffled countenance  then he said with his accustomed urbanity  and now my good m fourier since you have so admirably put the situation before me will you also tell me in what way i may be of service to you in thisor to général marchand  i am coming to that m le comte replied the préfet it will explain the reason of my disturbing you at this hour when i was coming anyhow to partake of your gracious hospitality later on but i do want your assistance m le comte as the matter of which i wish to speak with you concerns the king himself  everything that you have told me hitherto my good m fourier concerns his majesty and the security of his throne i cannot help wondering how much of this news has reached him by now  all of it at this hour i should say for already on friday the prince dessling sent a despatch to his majestyby courier as far as lyons and thence by aërial telegraph to paris the kingmay god preserve him added the exbonapartist fervently knows as much of the corsicans movements at the present moment as we do and god alone knows what he will decide to do  whatever happens interjected the comte de cambray solemnly louis de bourbon xviiith of his name by the grace of god will act like a king and a gentleman  amen to that retorted the préfet and now let me come to my point m le comte and the chief object of my visit to you  i am at your service my dear m fourier  you will remember m le comte that directly you were installed at brestalou and i was confirmed in my position as préfet of this department i thought it was my duty to tell you of the secret funds which are kept in the cellars of our hôtel de ville by order of m de talleyrand  yes of course i remember that perfectly french money which the unfortunate wife of that brigand bonaparte was taking out of the country  quite so assented fourier the funds are in a convenient and portable form being chiefly notes and bankers drafts to bearer but the amount is considerable namely twentyfive millions of francs  a comfortable sum interposed mme la duchesse drily i did not know that grenoble sheltered so vast a treasure  the money was seized said the comte from marie louise when she was fleeing the country talleyrand did it all and it was his idea to keep the money in this part of the country against likely emergencies  but the emergency has arisen exclaimed m fourier excitedly and the money at grenoble is useless to his majesty in paris nay it is worse than useless it is in danger of spoliation he added with unconscious naiveté if the corsican marches into grenoble if the garrison and the townspeople rally to him he will of a truth occupy the hôtel de ville and the brigand will seize the kings treasure which lies now in one of its cellars  true mused the comte i hadnt thought of that  well exclaimed madame with light sarcasm seeing that the money was originally taken from his wife the brigand will not be committing an altogether unlikely act i imagine by taking what was originally his  his my good sophie exclaimed the comte highly shocked money robbed by that usurper from francehis  we wont argue andré said madame sharply let us hear what m le préfet proposes  propose mme la duchesse ejaculated the unfortunate préfet i have nothing to propose i am at my wits end what to do i came to m le comte for advice  and you were quite right my dear m fourier said the comte affably  he paused for a few seconds in order to collect his thoughts then continued now let us consider this question from every side and then see to what conclusion we can arrive that will be for the best firstly of course there is the possibility of your following the example of the préfet of the bassesalpes and taking yourself and the money to a convenient place outside grenoble  but at this suggestion m fourier was ready to burst into tears  impossible m le comte he cried pitiably i could not do it    where could i go    the existence of the money is known    known to the bonapartists i am convinced    theres dumoulin the glovemaker he knows everything that goes on in grenoble    and his friend emery who is an army surgeon in the pay of bonaparte    both these men have been to and from elba incessantly these past few months    then theres the bonapartist club in grenoble    with a membership of over two thousand    the members have friends and spies everywhere    even inside the hôtel de ville    why the other day i had to dismiss a servant who     easy easy m le préfet broke in m le comte impatiently the long and the short of it is that you would not feel safe with the money anywhere outside grenoble  or inside it m le comte  very well then the money must be deposited there where it will be safe now what do you think of duponts bank  oh m le comte an avowed bonapartist    m de talleyrand would not trust him with the money last year  that is so    but     it seems to me here interposed mme la duchesse abruptly that by far the best plansince this district seems to be a hotbed of disloyaltywould be to convey the money straightway to paris and then the king or m de talleyrand can dispose of it as best they like  ah mme la duchesse sighed m fourier ecstatically as he clasped his podgy little hands together and looked on madame with eyes full of admiration for her wisdom how cleverly that was spoken if only i could be relieved from that awful responsibility    five and twenty millions under my charge and that corsican ogre at our gates     that is all very well quoth the comte with marked impatience but how is it going to be done convey the money to paris is easily said but who is going to do it m le préfet here says that the bonapartists have spies everywhere round grenoble and     ah m le comte exclaimed the préfet eagerly i have already thought of such a beautiful plan if only you would consent     m le comtes thin lips curled in a sarcastic smile  oh you have thought it all out already m le préfet he said well let me hear your plan but i warn you that i will not have the money brought here i dont half trust the peasantry of the neighbourhood and i wont have a fight or an outrage committed in my house  m le préfet was ready with a protest  no no m le comte he said i wouldnt suggest such a thing for the world if the corsican brigand is successful in capturing grenoble no place would be sacred to him no my idea was if you m le comtewho have oft before journeyed to paris and backwould do it now    before bonaparte gets any nearer to grenoble    and take the money with you     i exclaimed the comte but man ifas you saygrenoble is full of bonapartist spies my movements are no doubt just as closely watched as your own  no no m le comte not quite so closely i am sure  the insinuating manner of the worthy man however was apparently getting on m le comtes nerves  ah ça m le préfet he ejaculated abruptly but meseems that the splendid plan you thought on merely consists in transferring responsibility from your shoulders to mine own  and m le comte cast such a wrathful look on poor m fourier that the unfortunate man was stricken dumb with confusion  moreover concluded the comte i dont know that you m le préfet have the right to dispose of this money which was entrusted to you by m de talleyrand in the kings behalf without consulting his majestys wishes in the matter  bah andré broke in the duchesse in her incisive way you are talking nonsense and you know it there is no time for redtapeism now with that ogre at our gates how are you going to consult his majestys wisheswho is in parisbetween now and tuesday i would like to know she added with a shrug of the shoulders  whereupon m le comte waxed politely sarcastic  perhaps he said you would prefer us to consult yours  you might do worse she retorted imperturbably the question is one which is very easily solved ought his majesty the king to have that money or should m le préfet here take the risk of its falling in bonapartes hands answer me that she said decisively and then i will tell you how best to succeed in carrying out your own wishes  what a question my good sophie said the comte stiffly of course we desire his majesty to have what is rightfully his  you mean he ought to have the twentyfive millions which the prince de bénévant stole from marie louise very well then obviously that money ought to be taken to paris before bonaparte gets much nearer to grenoblebut it should not be taken by you my good andré nor yet by m le préfet  by whom then queried the comte irritably  by me replied mme la duchesse  by you sophie impossible  and god alive why impossible i pray you she retorted the money i understand is in a very portable form notes and bankers drafts which can be stowed away quite easily why shouldnt i be journeying back to paris after crystals wedding who would suspect me i should like to know of carrying twentyfive millions under my petticoats all i should want would be a couple of sturdy fellows on the box to protect me against footpads impossible she continued tartly men are always so ready with that word get a sensible woman i say and she will solve your difficulties before you have finished exclaiming impossible  and she looked triumphantly from one man to the other there was obvious relief on the ruddy face of little m fourier and even m le comte was visibly taken with the idea  well he at last condescended to say it does sound feasible after all  feasible of course its feasible said madame with a shrug of contempt either the king is in want of the money or he is not either bonaparte is likely to get it or he is not if the king wants it he must have it at any cost and any risk twentyfive millions in bonapartes hands at this juncture would help him to reconstitute his army and make it very unpleasant for the king and for us all m le préfet who has been in charge of the money all along and m le comte de cambray who is the only true royalist in the district are both marked down by spies ergo mme la duchesse dagen is the only possible agent for the business and an inoffensive old woman without any political standing is the least likely to be molested in her task if i fail i fail concluded madame decisively if i am stopped on the way and the money taken from me well i am stopped thats all and m le préfet or m le comte de cambray or any male agent they may have sent would have been stopped likewise but i maintain that a woman travelling alone is far safer at this business and more likely to succeed than a man so now for gods sake dont lets argue any more about it crystal is to be married on tuesday and i could start that same afternoon can you bring the money over with you tonight  she put her query directly to the préfet who was obviously overjoyed and intensely relieved at the suggestion  m le comte too seemed to be won over by his sisters persuasive rhetoric her strength of mind and firmness of purpose always imposed themselves on those over whom she chose to exert her will and men of somewhat weak character like the comte de cambray came very easily under the sway of her dominating personality  but he thought it incumbent upon his dignity to make one more protest before he finally yielded to his sisters arguments  i dont like he said the idea of your travelling alone through the country without sufficient escort the roads are none too safe and     bah broke in madame impatiently i pray you monsieur my brother to strengthen your arguments if you are really determined to oppose this sensible scheme of mine travelling alone forsooth did i not arrive only yesterday having travelled all the way from boulogne and with no escort save two louts on the box of a hired coach  you chose to travel alone my dear sister for reasons best known to yourself retorted the comte greatly angered that m le préfet should hear the fact that mme la duchesse douairière had travelled at any time without an escort  and who shall say me nay if i choose to travel back alone again i should like to know so now if you have exhausted your string of objections my dear brother perhaps you will allow m le préfet to answer my question  whereupon m le préfet promptly satisfied mme la duchesse on the point he certainly could and would bring the money over with him this evening and m le comte had no further objections to offer  in the archives of the ministry of war in paris any one who looks may read that in the subsequent trial of général marchand for high treasonafter the hundred days and napoleons second abdicationpréfet fourier during the course of his evidence gave a detailed account of this same interview which he had with m le comte de cambray and mme la duchesse douairière dagen on sunday march the 5th in his deposition he naturally laid great stress upon his own zeal in the matter declaring that he it was who finally overcame by his eloquence m le comtes objections to the scheme and decided him to give his acquiescence thereto1  footnote 1 déposition de fourier dossier de marchant arch guerre  certain it is that there was but little argument after this between mme la duchesse and the two men and that the details of the scheme were presently discussed soberly and in all their bearings  i shall have the honour presently said fourier of coming back here to respond to m le comtes gracious invitation to dinner why shouldnt i bring the money with me then  indeed you must bring the money then retorted the irascible old lady and let there be no shirking or delay promptitude is our great chance of success i ought not to start later than tuesday and i could do so soon after the wedding ceremony i could arrange to sleep at lyons that night at dijon the next day be in paris by thursday evening and in the kings presence on friday  provided you are not delayed sighed the comte  if i am delayed my good andré then anyhow the game is up but we are not going to anticipate misfortune and we are going to believe in our lucky star  would to god i could bring myself to approve wholeheartedly of this expedition the whole thing seems to me chivalrous and romantic rather than prudent and heaven knows how prudent we should be just now  you look back on history my dear brother remarked madame drily and youll see that more great events have been brought about by chivalry and romance than by prudence and circumspection the romance of joan of arc delivered france from foreign yoke the chivalry of françois i saved the honour of france after the disaster of pavie and it certainly was not prudence which set henry of navarre upon the throne of france and in the heart of his people so for gracious sake do not let us talk of prudence any more rather let us allow m le préfet to return quietly to the hôtel de ville so that he and mme fourier may proceed to dress for tonights ceremony just as if nothing untoward had happened in the meanwhile i will complete my preparations for tuesday there are one or two little details in connection with my journeyhostelries servants horses and so onwhich you my dear andré will kindly decide for me and now gentlemen she added rising from her chair i have the honour to wish you both a very good afternoon  she did not wait long enough to allow m le comte time to ring for hector and she appeared so busy with her lace shawl that she was unable to do more than acknowledge with a slight inclination of the head m le préfets respectful salute but then mme la duchesse douairière dagenthough a fervent royalist herselfhad a wholesome contempt for these opportunists fourier celebrated mathematician loaded with gifts and honours by napoleon who had made him a member of the institute of science and given him the prefecture of the isère had turned his coat very readily at the restoration and the oaths of loyalty which he had tendered to the emperor seemed not to weigh overheavily upon his conscience when he reiterated them to the king  mme la duchesse dagen therefore did not willingly place her aristocratic fingers in the hand of a renegade who she felt might turn renegade again if his personal interest so dictated it perhaps something of what lay behind madames curt nod to him struck the préfets sensibilities for the high colour suddenly fled from his round face and he did not attempt to approach her for the ceremonial handkissing but he ran across the room as fast as his short legs would carry him and he opened the door for her and bowed to her as she sailed past him with all the deference which in the olden days of the empire he had accorded to the empress marie louise  it is a mad scheme my good m fourier sighed the comte when he found himself once more alone with the préfet but such as it is i can think of nothing better  m le comte exclaimed the préfet with delight no one could think of anything better ah the women of france he added ecstatically the women how often have they saved france in moments of crises france owes her grandeur to her women m le comte  and also her reverses my dear m fourier remarked the comte drily   ii  when bobby clyffurde came back to brestalou after his long days ride he found the stately rooms of the old castle already prepared for the arrival of m le comtes guests the large reception hall had been thrown open asafter supperm le comte would be receiving some of the notabilities of grenoble in honour of a great occasion the signature of the contrat de mariage between mlle crystal de cambray de brestalou and m victor de marmont there was an array of liveried servants in the hall and along the corridor through which bobby had to pass on the way to his own room their liveries of purple with canary facingsthe heraldic colours of the family of cambray de brestalouhardly showed in the flickering light of wax candles the many ravages of moth and mildew which twenty years of neglect had wrought upon the once fine and brilliant cloth  downstairs the formal supper which was to precede the reception was laid for twenty guests the table was resplendent with the silver so kindly lent by a benevolent and farseeing king to those of his friends who had not the means of replacing the ancient family treasures filched from them by the revolutionary government  there were no flowers upon the table and only very few wax candles burned in the ormolu and crystal chandelier overhead flowers and wax candles were luxuries which must be paid for with ready moneya commodity which was exceedingly scarce in the grandiose château de brestaloubut they also were a luxury which could easily be dispensed with for did not m le comte de cambray set the fashions and give the tone to the whole département and if he chose to have no flowers upon his supper table and but few candles in his silver sconces why then society must take it for granted that such now was bon ton and the prevailing fashion at the tuileries  bobby knowing his hosts fastidious tastes in such matters had made a very careful toilet all the while that his thoughts were busy with the wonderful news which emery had brought this day and which was all over grenoble by now he and his two companions had left notre dame de vaulx soon after their déjeuner and together had entered the city at five oclock in the afternoon on their way they had encountered the travellingcoach of général moutonduveret who accompanied by his aidedecamp was on his way to gap where he intended to organise strong resistance against bonaparte  he parleyed some time with emery whom he knew by sight and suspected of being an emissary of the corsican emery with true southern verve gave the worthy general a highlycoloured account of the triumphal progress through provence and the dauphiné of napoleon whom he boldly called the emperor moutonin no way belying his namewas very upset not only by the news but by his own helplessness with regard to emery who he knew would presently be in grenoble distributing the usurpers proclamations all over the city whilst hemoutonwith his one aidedecamp and a couple of loutish servants on the box of his coach could do nothing to detain him  as soon as the three men had ridden away however he sent his aidedecamp back to grenoble by a roundabout way ordering him to make as great speed as possible and to see général marchand as soon as may be so that immediate measures might be taken to prevent that emissary if not from entering the city at least from posting up proclamations on public buildings  but moutons aidedecamp was no match against the enthusiasm and ingenuity of emery and de marmont and when hein his turnentered grenoble soon after five oclock he was confronted by the printed proclamations signed by the familiar and dreaded name napoleon affixed to the gates of the city to the hôtel de ville the mairie the prison the barracks and to every street corner in grenoble  the three friends had parted at the porte de bonne emery to go to his friend dumoulin the glovemakerde marmont to his lodgings in the rue montorge whilst bobby clyffurde rode straight back to brestalou  a couple of hours later victor de marmont had also arrived at the castle he too had made an elaborate toilet and then had driven over in a hackney coach in advance of the other guests seeing that he desired to have a final interview with m le comte before he affixed his name to his contrat de mariage with mlle de cambray an air of solemnity sat well upon his goodlooking face but it was obvious that he was tryingsomewhat in vainto keep an inward excitement in check  m le comte de cambray believing that this excitement was entirely due to the solemnity of the occasion had smiled indulgentlya trifle contemptuously tooat young de marmonts very apparent eagerness a vulgar display of feelings an inability to control ones words and movements when under the stress of emotion was characteristic of the parvenus of today and de marmonts unfettered agitation when coming to sign his own marriage contract was only on a par with préfet fouriers nervousness this afternoon  the comte received his future soninlaw with a gracious smile the thought of an alliance between mlle de cambray de brestalou and a de marmont of nowhere had been a bitter pill to swallow but m le comte was too proud to show how distasteful it had been chatting pleasantly the two men repaired together to the library   iii  bobby clyffurdeimmaculately dressed in fine cloth coat and satin breeches with fine mechlin lace at throat and wrist and his light brown hair tied at the nape of the neck with a big black bowcame down presently to the reception room he found the place silent and deserted  but the stately apartment looked more cosy and homelike than usual a cheerful fire was burning in the monumental hearth and the soft light of the candles fixed in sconces round the walls tempered to a certain degree that bare and severe look of past grandeur which usually hung upon every corner of the old château  clyffurde went up to the tall hearth he rested his hand on the ledge of the mantel and leaning his forehead against it he stared moodily into the fire  thoughts of all that he had learned in the past few hours of the new chapter in the book of the destinies of france begun a few days ago in the bay of jouan crowded in upon his mind what difference would the unfolding of that new chapter make to the destinies of the comte de cambray and of crystal what had fate in store for the bold adventurer who was marching across france with a handful of men to reconquer a throne and remake an empire what had she in store for the stiffnecked aristocrat of the old regime who still believed that god himself had made special laws for the benefit of one class of humanity and that he had even created them differently to the rest of mankind  and what had fate in store for the beautiful delicate girl whose future had been so arbitrarily settled by two menfather and loverone the buyer the other the seller of her exquisite person the shrine of her pure and idealistic souland bargained for by father and lover as the price of so many acres of landa farma châteauan ancestral estate  father and lover were sitting together even now discussing valuesthe purchase priceyou give me back my lands i will give you my daughter blood money soul money clyffurde called it as he ground his teeth together in impotent rage  what folly it was to care what folly to have allowed the tendrils of his oversensitive heart to twine themselves round this beautiful girl who was as far removed from his destiny as were the ambitions of his boyhood the hopes the dreams which the hard circumstances of fate had forced him to bury beneath the gravemound of rigid and unswerving duty  but what a dream it had been this love for crystal de cambray it had filled his entire soul from the moment when first he saw herdown in the garden under an avenue of ilex trees which cast their mysterious shadows over her her father had called to her and she had come across to where heclyffurdestood silently watching this approaching vision of loveliness which never would vanish from his mental gaze again  even at that supreme moment when her blue eyes her sweet smile the exquisite grace of her took possession of his soul even then he knew already that his dream could have but one awakening she was already plighted to another a happier man but even if she were free crystal would never have bestowed a thought upon the strangerthe commonplace tradesman whose only merit in her sight lay in his friendship with another gallant english gentleman  and knowing thiswhen he saw her after that day after day hour after hourpoor bobby clyffurde grew reconciled to the knowledge that the gates of his paradise would for ever be locked against him he grew contented just to peep through those gates and the angel who was on guard there holding the flaming sword of caste prejudice against him would relent at times and allow him to linger on the threshold and to gaze into a semblance of happiness  those thoughts those dreams those longings he had been able to endure today reality had suddenly become more insistent and more stern the angels flaming sword would sear his soul after this if he lingered any longer by the enchanted gates and thus had the semblance of happiness yielded at last to dull regret  he sank into a chair and buried his face in his hands   iv  the sound of the opening and shutting of a door the soft froufrou of a womans skirt roused him from his gloomy reverie and caused him to jump to his feet  mlle crystal was coming across the long reception room walking with a slow and weary step toward the hearth she was obviously not yet aware of clyffurdes presence and he had full leisure to watch her as she approached to note the pallor of her cheeks and lips and that pathetic look of childlike selfpity and almost of appeal which veiled the brilliance of her deep blue eyes  a moment later she saw him and came more quickly across the room with hand extended and an air of gracious condescension in her whole attitude  ah m clyffurde she said in perfect english i did not know you were here    and all alone my father she added is occupied with serious matters downstairs else he would have been here to receive you  i know mademoiselle he said after he had kissed the tips of three cold little fingers which had been held out to him my friend de marmont is with him just now he desired to speak with m le comte in private    on a matter which closely concerns his happiness  ah then you knew she asked coldly  yes mademoiselle i knew he replied  she had settled herself down in a highbacked chair close to the hearth the ruddy light of the woodfire played upon her white satin gown upon her bare arms and the ends of her lace scarf upon her satin shoes and the bunch of snowdrops at her breast but her face was in shadow and she did not look up at clyffurde whilst hepoor foolstood before her absorbed in the contemplation of this dainty picture which mayhap after tonight would never gladden his eyes again  you are a great friend of m de marmont she asked after a while  oh mademoisellea friend he replied with a selfdeprecatory shrug of the shoulders friendship is too great a name to give to our chance acquaintanceship i met victor de marmont less than a fortnight ago in grenoble     ah yes i had forgottenhe told me that he had first met you at the house of a m dumoulin     in the shop of m dumoulin mademoiselle broke in clyffurde with his goodhumoured smile m dumoulin the glovemaker with whom i was transacting business at the moment when m de marmont walked in in order to buy himself a pair of gloves  of course she added coldly i had forgotten     you were not likely to remember such a trivial circumstance mademoiselle m de marmont saw me after that here as guest in your fathers house he was greatly surprised at finding mea mere tradesmanin such an honoured position surprise laid the foundation of pleasing intercourse between us but you see mademoiselle that m de marmont has no cause to boast of his friendship with me  oh m de marmont is not so prejudiced     as you are mademoiselle he asked quietly for she had paused and he saw that she bit her lips with her tiny white teeth as if she meant to check the words that would come tumbling out  thus directly questioned she gave a little shrug of disdain  my opinions in the matter are not in question sir she said coldly  she smothered a little yawn which may have been due to ennui but also to the tingling of her nerves clyffurde saw that her hands were never still for a moment she was either fingering the snowdrops in her belt or smoothing out the creases in her lace scarf from time to time she raised her head and a tense expression came into her face as if she were trying to listen to what was going on elsewhere in the housedownstairs perhapsin the library where she was being finally bargained for and sold  clyffurde felt an intensean unreasoning pity for her and because of that pitythe gentle kinsman of fierce lovehe found it in his heart to forgive her all her prejudices that almost arrogant pride of caste which was in her blood for which she was no more responsible than she was for the colour of her hair or the vivid blue of her eyes she seemed so forlornsuch a child in the midst of all this decadent grandeur she was being so ruthlessly sacrificed for ideals that were no longer tenable that had ceased to be tenable five and twenty years ago when this château and these lands were overrun by a savage and vengeful mob who were loudly demanding the right to live in happiness in comfort and in freedom that right had been denied to them through the past centuries by those who were of her own kith and kin and it was snatched with brutal force with lust of hate and thirst for reprisals by the revolutionary crowd when it came into its own at last  something of the pity which he felt for this beautiful and innocent victim of rancour oppression and prejudice must have been manifest in clyffurdes earnest eyes for when crystal looked up to him and met his glance she drew herself up with an air of haughty detachment and with that she wished to convey still more tangibly to him the idea of that barrier of caste which must for ever divide her from him  obviously his look of pity had angered her for now she said abruptly and with marked coldness  my father tells me sir that you are thinking of leaving france shortly  indeed mademoiselle he replied i have trespassed too long as it is on m le comtes gracious hospitality my visit originally was only for a fortnight i thought of leaving for england tomorrow  a little lift of the eyebrows an unnecessary smoothing of an invisible crease in her gown and crystal asked lightly  before the    my wedding sir  before your wedding mademoiselle  she frownedvaguely stirred to irritation by his illconcealed indifference i trust she rejoined pointedly that you are satisfied with your trade in grenoble  the little shaft was meant to sting but if bobby felt any pain he certainly appeared to bear it with perfect goodhumour  i am quite satisfied he said i thank you mademoiselle  it must be very pleasing to conclude such affairs satisfactorily she continued  very pleasing mademoiselle  of coursegiven the right temperament for such a careerit must be so much more comfortable to spend ones life in making moneybuying and selling things and so onrather than to risk it every day for the barren honour of serving ones king and country  as you say mademoiselle he said quite imperturbably given the right temperament it certainly is much more comfortable  and you sir i take it are the happy possessor of such a temperament  i suppose so mademoiselle  you are content to buy and to sell and to make money to rest at ease and let the men who love their country and their king fight for you and for their ideals  her voice had suddenly become trenchant and hard her manner contemptuousat strange variance with the indifferent kindliness wherewith she had hitherto seemed to regard her fathers english guest certainly her nerveshe thoughtwere very much on edge and no doubt his own always unruffled calmthe combined product of temperament nationality and educationhad an irritating effect upon her had he not been so intensely sorry for her he would have resented this final taunt of hersan arrow shot this time with intent to wound  but as it was he merely said with a smile  surely mademoiselle my contentment with my own lot and any other feelings of which i may be possessed are of such very little consequenceseeing that they are only the feelings of a very commonplace tradesmanthat they are not worthy of being discussed  then as quickly her manner changed the contemptuous look vanished from her eyes the sarcastic curl from her lips and with one of those quick transitions of mood which were perhaps the principal charm of crystal de cambrays personality she looked up at bobby with a winning smile and an appeal for forgiveness  your pardon sir she said softly i was shrewish and illtempered and deserve a severe lesson in courtesy i did not mean to be disagreeable she added with a little sigh but my nerves are all aquiver today and this awful news has weighed upon my spirit     what awful news mademoiselle he asked  surely you have heard  you mean the news about napoleon      i mean the awful certainty she retorted with a sudden outburst of vehemence that that brigand that usurper that scourge of mankind has escaped from an all too lenient prison where he should never have been confined seeing how easy was escape from it i mean that all the horrors of the past twenty years will begin again now misery starvation exile probably oh surely she added with everincreasing passion surely god will not permit such an awful thing to happen surely he will strike the ogre dead ere he devastates france once again  i am afraid that you must not reckon quite so much on divine interference mademoiselle a nationlike every single individualmust shape its own destiny and must not look to god to help it in its political aims  and france must look once more to england i suppose it is humiliating to be always in need of help she said with an impatient little sigh  each nation in its turn has it in its power to help a sister sometimes help may come from the weaker vessel do you remember the philosophers fable of the lion and the mouse france may be the mouse just nowsome day it may be in her power to requite the lion  she shook her head reprovingly i dont know she said that i approve of your calling francethe mouse  i only did so in order to drive my parable still further home  then as she looked a little puzzled he continuedspeaking very slowly this time and with an intensity of feeling which was quite different to his usual pleasant goodtempered ofttimes flippant manner mademoiselle crystalif you will allow me to speak of such an insignificant person as i ami am at present in the position of the mouse with regard to your father and yourselfthe lions of my parable you might so easily have devoured me you see he added with a quaint touch of humour well the time may come when you may have need of a friend just as i had need of one when i came herea stranger in a strange land events will move with great rapidity in the next few days mademoiselle crystal and the mouse might at any time be in a position to render a service to the lion will you remember that  i will try monsieur she replied  but already her pride was once more up in arms she did not like his tone that air of protection which his attitude suggested and indeed she could not think of any eventuality which would place the comte de cambray de brestalou in serious need of a tradesman for his friend  then as quickly again her mood softened and as she raised her eyes to his he saw that they were full of tears  indeed indeed she said gently i do deserve your contempt sir for my shrewishness and vixenish ways how can ihow can any of usafford to turn our backs upon a loyal friend today too of all days when that awful enemy is once more at our gates oh she added clasping her hands together with a sudden gesture of passionate entreaty you are english sira friend of all those gallant gentlemen who saved my dear father and his family from those awful revolutionariesyou will be loyal to us will you not the english hate bonaparte as much as we do you hate him too do you not you will do all you can to help my poor father through this awful crisis you will wont you she pleaded  have i not already offered you my humble services mademoiselle he rejoined earnestly  indeed this was a very serious ordeal for quiet selfcontained bobby clyffurdean englishman rememberwith all an englishmans shyness of emotion all an englishmans contempt of any display of sentiment here was this beautiful girlwhom he loved with all the passionate ardour of his virile manly temperamentsitting almost at his feet he looking down upon her fair head with its wealth of golden curls and into her blue eyes which were full of tears  who shall blame him if just then a desperate longing seized him to throw all prudence all dignity and honour to the winds and to clasp this exquisite woman for one brief and happy moment in his armsto forget the world her position and histo risk disgrace and betray hospitality for the sake of one kiss upon her lips the temptation was so fierceindeed for one short second it was all but irresistiblethat something of the battle which was raging within his soul became outwardly visible and in the girls teardimmed eyes there crept a quick look of alarmso strange so ununderstandable was his glance the rigidity of his attitudeas if every muscle had become taut and every nerve strained to snapping point while his face looked hard and lined almost as if he were fighting physical pain   v  thus a few seconds went by in absolute silencewhile the great gilt clock upon its carved bracket ticked on with stolid relentlessness marking another minuteand yet anotherof this hour which was so full of portent for the destinies of france clyffurde would gladly have bartered the future years of his life for the power to stay the hand of time just nowfor the power to remain just like this standing before this beautiful woman whom he loved feeling that at any moment he could take her in his arms and kiss her eyes and her lips even if she were unwilling even if she hated him for ever afterwards  the sense of power to do that which he might regret to the end of his days was infinitely sweet the power to fight against that allcompelling passion was perhaps sweeter still then came the pride of victory the habits of a lifetime had come to his aid selfrespect and selfcontrol hard and wilful taskmasters fought against passion until it yielded inch by inch  the battle was fought and won in those few moments of silence the strain of the mans attitude relaxed the set lines on his face vanished leaving it serene and quietly humorous calm and selfdeprecatory only his voice was not quite so steady as usual as he said softly  mademoiselle crystal is there anything that i can do for younow at once i mean if there is i do entreat you most earnestly to let me serve you  had the pure soul of the woman been touched by the fringe of that magnetic wave of passion even as it rose to its utmost height nearly sweeping the man off his feet and in its final retreat leaving him with quivering nerves and senses bruised and numb did something of the mans suffering of his love and of his despair appeardespite his effortsupon his face and in the depth of his glanceand thus made visible did theyeven through their compelling intensitycause that invisible barrier of social prejudices to totter and to break it were difficult to say certain it is that crystals whole heart warmed to the stranger as it had never warmed before she felt that here was a man standing before her now whose promises would never be mere idle words whose deeds would speak more loudly than his tongue she felt that in the midst of all the enmity which encompassed her and her father in their newly regained home and land here at any rate was a friend on whom they could count to help to counsel and to accomplish and deep down in the very bottom of her soul there was a curious unexplainable longing that circumstances should compel her to ask one day for his help and a sweet knowledge that that help would be ably rendered and pleasing to receive  but for the moment of course there was nothing that she could ask she would be married in a couple of daysalas so soonand after that it would be to her husband that she must look for devotion for guidance and for sympathy  a little sigh of regret escaped her lips and she said gently  i thank you sir from the bottom of my heart for the words of friendship which you have spoken i shall never forget them never and if at any time in my life i am in trouble     which god forbid he broke in fervently  if any time i have need of a friend she resumed i feel that i should find one in you oh if only i could think that you would extend your devotion to my poor country and to our king    she exclaimed with passionate earnestness  you love your country very dearly mademoiselle he rejoined  i think that i love france more than anything else in the world she replied and i feel that there is no sacrifice which i would deem too great to offer up for her  and by france you mean the bourbon dynasty he said almost involuntarily and with an impatient little sigh  i mean the king by the grace of god she retorted proudly  she had thrown back her head with an air of challenge as she said this meeting his glance eye to eye she looked strong and wilful all of a sudden no longer girlish and submissive and to the man who loved her this trait of power and latent heroism added yet another to the many charms which he saw in her loyal to her country and to her king she would be loyal in all thingsto husband kindred and to friends  but he realised at the same time how impossible it would be for any man to win her love if he were an enemy to her cause st genisroyalist émigré retrograde like herselfhad obviously won his way to her heart chiefly by the sympathy of his own convictions but what of de marmont to whom she was on the eve of plighting her troth de marmont the hotheaded bonapartist who owned but one godnapoleonand yet had deliberately and with cynical opportunism hidden his fanatical aims and beliefs from the woman whom he had wooed and won  the thought of that deceptionand of the awakening which would await the girlwife on the very morrow of her weddingday mayhap was terribly repellent to clyffurdes straightforward loyal nature and bitter was the contention within his soul as he found himself at the crossroads of a divided duty every instinct of chivalry towards the woman loudly demanded that he should warn hernowat oncebefore it was too latebefore she had actually pledged her life and future to a man whom her very soulif she knew the truthwould proclaim a renegade and a traitor and every instinct of loyalty to the manthat male solidarity of sex which will never permit one manif he be a gentlemanto betray anotherprompted him to hold his peace  crystals gentle voice fell like dreamtones upon his ear vaguely only did he hear what she said she was still speaking of france of all that the country had suffered and all that was due to her from her sons and daughters she spoke of the king gods own anointed as she called him endowed with rights divine and all the while his thoughts were far away flying on the wings of memory to the little hamlet among the mountains where two enthusiasts had exhausted every panegyric in praise of their own hero whom this girl called a usurper and a brigand he remembered every trait in de marmonts face every inflexion of his voice as he said with almost cruel cynicism she will learn to love me in time  that clyffurde knew now crystal de cambray would never do indifferent to de marmont today she would hate and loathe him the day that she discovered how infamously he had deceived her and to clyffurdes passionate temperament the thought of crystals future unhappiness was absolutely intolerable  here indeed was a battle far more strenuous and difficult of issue than that of a mans will against his passions here was a problem far more difficult to solve than any that had assailed bobby clyffurde throughout his life  his heart cried out she must know the truth she must today this minute while there was yet time anon she will be pledged irrevocably to a man who has lied to her whom she will curse as a renegade a traitor false to his country false to his king  and the words hovered on his lips mademoiselle crystal do not plight your troth to de marmont he is no friend of yours his people are not your people his god is not your god and there is neither blessing nor holiness in an union twixt you and him  but the words remained unspoken because the unwritten codethe bond twixt man and mantried to still this natural cry of his heart and reason argued that he must hold his peace his heart rebelled contending that to remain silent was cowardlythat his first duty was to the woman whom he loved better than his soul whilst ingrained principles born and bred in the bone of him threw themselves into the conflict warning him that if he spoke he would be no better than an informer meriting the contempt alike of those whom he wished to help and of the man whom he would betray  it was one sound coming from below which settled the dispute twixt heart and reasonthe sound of de marmonts voice which though he was apparently speaking of indifferent matters had that same triumphant ring in it which clyffurde had heard at notre dame de vaulx this morning  the sound had caused crystal to give a quick gasp and to clasp her hands against her breast as she said with a nervous little laugh  imagine how happy we are to have m de marmonts support in this terrible crisis his influence in grenoble and in the whole province is very great his word in the town itself may incline the whole balance of public feeling on the side of the king and who knows it may even help to strengthen the loyalty of the troops oh that corsican brigand little guesses what kind of welcome we in the dauphiné are preparing for him  her enthusiasm her trust her loyalty ended the conflict in clyffurdes mind far more effectually than any sober reasoning could have done he realised in a moment that neither abstract principles nor his own feelings in the matter were of the slightest account at such a juncture  what was obvious certain and not to be shirked was duty to a woman who was on the point of being shamefully deceived also duty to the man whose hospitality he had enjoyed to remain silent would be cowardlyof that he became absolutely certain and once bobby had made up his mind what duty was no power on earth could make him swerve from its fulfilment  mlle crystal he began slowly and deliberately just now when i was bold enough to offer you my friendship you deigned to accept it did you not  indeed i did sir she replied a little astonished why should you ask  because the time has come sooner than i expected for me to prove the truth of that offer to you there is something which i must say to you which no one but a friend ought to do may i  but before she could frame the little yes which already trembled on her lips her fathers voice and de marmonts rang out from the further end of the room itself  the folding doors had been thrown open m le comte and his soninlaw elect were on the point of entering and had paused for a moment just under the lintel de marmont was talking in a loud voice and apparently in response to something which m le comte had just told him  ah he said mme la duchesse will be leaving brestalou i am sorry to hear that why should she go so soon  an affair of business my dear de marmont replied the comte i will tell you about it at an early opportunity  after which there was a hubbub of talk in the corridors outside the sound of greetings the pleasing confusion of questions and answers which marks the simultaneous arrival of several guests  crystal rose and turned to bobby with a smile  you will have to tell me some other time she said lightly dont forget  the psychological moment had gone by and clyffurde cursed himself for having fought too long against the promptings of his heart and lost the precious moments which might have changed the whole of crystals future he cursed himself for not having spoken sooner now that he saw de marmont with glowing eyes and illconcealed triumph approach his beautiful fiancée and with the air of a conqueror raise her hand to his lips  she looked very pale and to the man who loved her so ardently and so hopelessly it seemed as if she gave a curious little shiver and that for one brief second her blue eyes flashed a pathetic look of appeal up to his   vi  m le comtes guests followed closely on the triumphant bridegrooms heels m le préfet fussy and nervous secretly delighted at the idea of affixing his official signature to such an aristocratic contrat de mariage as was this between mlle de cambray de brestalou and m victor de marmont own nephew to marshal the duc de raguse madame la préfète resplendent in the latest fashion from paris the duc and duchesse dembrun cousins of the bride the vicomte de génevois and his mother who was abbess of pont haut and godmother by proxy to crystal de cambray whilst général marchand in command of the troops of the district fresh from the council of war which he had hastily convened was trying to hide behind a débonnaire manner all the anxiety which the brigands march on grenoble was causing him  the chief notabilities of the province had assembled to do honour to the occasion later on others would come lesser lights by birth and position than this select crowd who would partake of the souper des fiançailles before the contrat was signed in their presence as witnesses to the transaction  everyone was talking volubly the ogres progress through franceno longer to be deniedwas the chief subject of conversation some spoke of it with contempt others with terror the exbonapartists fourier and marchand were loudest in their curses against the usurper  clyffurde silent and keeping somewhat aloof from the brilliant throng saw that de marmont did not enter into any of these conversations he kept resolutely close to crystal and spoke to her from time to time in a whisper and always with that assured air of the conqueror which grated so unpleasantly on clyffurdes irritable nerves  the comte affable and gracious spoke a few words to each of his guests in turn whilst mme la duchesse douairière dagen was talking openly of her forthcoming return journey to the north  i came in great haste she said loudly to the circle of ladies gathered around her for my little crystals wedding but i was in the middle of a lenten retreat at the sacred heart and i only received permission from my confessor to spend three days in all this gaiety  when do you leave us again mme la duchesse queried mlle marchand the generals daughter in a honeyed voice  on tuesday directly after the religious ceremony mademoiselle replied madame whilst m le préfet tried to look unconcerned he had brought the money over as mme la duchesse had directed twentyfive millions of francs in notes and drafts had been transferred from the cellar of the hôtel de ville to his own pockets first and then into the keeping of madame he had driven over from the hôtel de ville in his private coach he himself in an agony of fear every time the road looked lonely or he heard the sound of horses hoofs upon the road behind himfor there might be mounted highwaymen about now he felt infinitely relieved he had shifted all responsibility of that vast sum of money on to more exalted shoulders than his own and inwardly he was marvelling how coolly mme la duchesse seemed to be taking such an awful responsibility  now hector threw open the great doors and announced that m le comte was served through the vast corridor beyond appeared a vista of liveried servants in purple and canary wearing powdered perruque silk stockings and buckled shoes  there was a general hubbub in the room the men moved towards the ladies who had been assigned to them for partners m le comte in his grandest manner approached mme la duchesse dembrun in order to conduct her down to supper an air of majestic grandeur of solemnity and splendid decorum pervaded the fine apartment it sought out every corner of the vast reception room flickered round every wax candle it spread itself over the monumental hearth the stiff brocadecovered chairs the gilt consoles and tall mirrors it emanated alike from the graciousness of m le comte de cambray and the pompousness of his majordomo hector in fact appeared at this moment as the high priest in a temple of good manners and bon ton the muscles of his face were rigid his mouth was set as if ready to pronounce sacrificial words in his right hand he carried a goldheaded wand emblem of his high office  but suddenly there was a disturbancean unseemly noise came from the further end of the corridor where rose the magnificent staircase hectors face became a study in rapidly changing expressions from pompousness to astonishment then horror and finally wrath when he realised that an intruder in stained cloth clothes and booted and spurred was actually making his way through the ranks of liveried and gaping servants and loudly demanding to speak with m le comte  such an unseemly disturbance had not occurred at the château de brestalou since hector had been installed there as majordomo nearly twelve months ago and he was on the point of literally throwing himself upon the impious malapert who thus dared to thrust his illclad person upon the brilliant company when he pausedmore aghast than before in this same impious malapert he had recognised m le marquis de st genis  the young man looked to be labouring under terrible excitement his face was flushed and he was panting as if he had been running hard  m le comte he cried breathlessly as soon as he caught sight of hector tell m le comte that i must speak with him at once  but m le marquis    m le marquis     this was all that poor bewildered hector could stammer his slowlymoving brain was torn between the duties of his position and his respect for m le marquis and in the struggle the worthy man was enduring throes of anxiety  fortunately m le comte himself put an end to hectors dilemma he had recognised st genis voice unlike his majordomo he knew at once that something terribly grave must have happened else the young man would never have committed such a serious breach of good manners and m le comte himself was never at a loss how to turn any situation to a dignified and proper issue he murmured a quick and courteous apology to mme la duchesse dembrun and a comprehensive one to all his guests then he hastened to meet st genis at the door  already st genis had entered his rough clothes and muddy boots looked strangely in contrast to the immaculate getup of the comtes guests but of this he hardly seemed to be aware his face was flushed with his right hand he clutched a small riding cane and his glowering dark eyes swept a rapid glance over every one in the room  and to the comte he said hoarsely i must offer you my humblest apologies my dear comte for obtruding my very untidy person upon you at this hour i have walked all the way from grenoble as i could not get a hackneycoach else i had been here earlier and spared you this unpleasantness  you are always welcome in this house my good maurice said the comte in his loftiest manner and at any hour of the day  and he added with a certain tone of dignified reproach i did ask you to be my guest tonight if you remember  and i said st genis was churlish enough to refuse i would not have come now only that i felt i might be in time to avert the most awful catastrophe that has yet fallen upon your house  again his restless dark eyessullen and wrathful and charged with a look of rage and of hatewandered over the assembled company the look frightened the ladies they took to clinging to one another standing in compact little groups together like frightened birds watchful and wideeyed they feared that the young man was mad but the men exchanged significant glances and significant smiles they merely thought that st genis had been drinking or that jealousy had halfturned his brain  only clyffurde who stood somewhat apart from the others knewby some unexplainable intuitionwhat it was that had brought maurice de st genis to this house in this excited state and at this hour he felt excited too and mightily thankful that the catastrophe would be brought about by othersnot by himself  but all his thoughts were for crystal and an instinctive desire to stand by her and to shield her if necessary from some unknown or unguessed evil made him draw nearer to her she stood on the fringe of the little crowdas isolated as bobby was himself  de marmontwhose face had become the colour of dead asheshad left her side one step at a time and very slowly he was getting nearer and nearer to st genis as if the latters wrathfilled eyes were drawing him against his will  at the young mans ominous words m le comtes sunken cheeks grew a shade more pale  what catastrophe mon dieu he exclaimed could fall on my house that would be worse than twenty years of exile  an alliance with a traitor m le comte said st genis firmly  a gasp went round the room a sigh a cry the women looked in mute horror from one man to the other the men already had their right hand on their swords but clyffurdes eyes were fixed upon crystal who pale silent rigid as a marble statue with lips parted and nostrils quivering stood not five paces away from him her dilated eyes wandering ceaselessly from the face of st genis to that of de marmont and thence to that of her father but beyond that look of tense excitement she revealed nothing of what she thought and felt  already de marmonthis hand upon his swordhad advanced menacingly towards st genis  m le marquis he said between set teeth you will by god eat those words or  eat my words man retorted st genis with a harsh laugh by heaven have i not come here on purpose to throw my words into your lying face  there was a brief but violent skirmish for de marmont had made a movement as if he meant to spring at his rivals throat and général marchand and the vicomte de génevois who happened to be near had much ado to seize and hold him even so they could not stop the hoarse cries which he uttered  liar liar liar let me go let me get to him i must kill him i must kill him  the comte interposed his dignified person between the two men  maurice he said in tones of calm and dispassionate reproof your conduct is absolutely unjustifiable you seem to forget that you are in the presence of ladies and of my guests if you had a quarrel with m de marmont     a quarrel my dear comte exclaimed st genis nay tis no quarrel i have with him and my conduct would have been a thousand times more vile if i had not come tonight and stopped his hand from touching that of mlle crystal de cambrayhis hand which was engaged less than two hours ago in affixing to the public buildings of grenoble the infamous message of the corsican brigand to the army and the people of france  a hoarse murmura sure sign that men or women are afraidcame from every corner of the room  the messagewhat message  some people turned instinctively to m le préfet others to général marchand every one knew that bonaparte had landed on the littoral every one had heard the rumour that he was marching in triumph through provence and the dauphinébut no one had altogether believed thisas for a messagea proclamationa call to the armyand this in grenoble itself no one had heard of thatevery one had been at home getting dressed for this festive function thinking of good suppers and of wedding bells it was as if after a clap of thunder and a flash of lightning the house was found to be in flames m le préfet in answer to these mute queries had shrugged his shoulders and général marchand looked grim and silent  but st genis with arm uplifted and shaking hand pointed a finger at de marmont  ask him he cried ask him my dear comte ask the miserable traitor who with lies and damnable treachery has stolen his way into your house has stolen your regard your hospitality and was on the point of stealing your most precious treasureyour daughter ask him he knows every word of that infamous message by heart i doubt not but a copy of it is inside his coat now ask him général moutonduveret met him outside grenoble in company with that cur emery and i saw him with mine own eyes distributing these hellish papers among our townspeople and pinning them up at the streetcorners of our city  while st genis was speakingor rather screamingfor his voice pitched high seemed to fill the entire roomevery glance was fixed upon de marmont every one of course expected a contradiction as hot and intemperate as was the accusation it was unthinkable impossible that what st genis said could be true they all knew de marmont well nephew of the duc de raguse who had borne the lions share in surrendering paris to the allies and bringing about the downfall of the corsican usurper he was one of the most trusted members of the royalist set in dauphiné they had talked quite freely before him consulted with him when local bonapartism appeared uncomfortably rampant de marmont was one of themselves  and yet he said nothing even now when st genis accused him and hurled insult upon insult at himhe said nothing to refute the awful impeachment to justify his conduct to explain his companionship with emery his face was still livid but it was with ragenot indignation marchand and génevois still held him by the arms else he and st genis would have been at one anothers throat before now but his gestures as he struggled to free himself the imprecations which he uttered were those of a man who was baffled and found outnot of one who is innocent  but as st genis continued to speak and worked himself up every moment into a still greater state of excitement de marmont gradually seemed to calm down he ceased to curse he ceased to struggle and on his facewhich still was lividthere gradually crept a look of determination and of defiance he dug his teeth into his under lip until tiny drops of blood appeared at the corner of his mouth and trickled slowly down his chin  marchand and génevois relaxed the grip upon his arms since he no longer fought and thus released he contrived to pull himself together he tossed back his head and looked his infuriated accuser boldly in the face  by the time st genis paused in his impassioned denunciation he had himself completely under control only his eyes appeared to glow with an unnatural fire and little beads of moisture appeared upon his brow and matted the dark hair against his forehead the comte de cambray at this juncture would certainly have interposed with one of those temperate speeches full of dignity and brimming over with lofty sentiments which he knew so well how to deliver but de marmont gave him no time to begin when st genis paused for breath he suddenly freed himself completely with a quick movement from marchands and génevois hold and then he turned to the comte and to the rest of the company  and what if i did pin the emperors proclamation on the walls of grenoble he said proudly and with a tremor of enthusiasm in his voice the emperor whom treachery more vile than any since the days of the iscariot sent into humiliation and exile the emperor has come back cried the young devotee with that extraordinary fervour which napoleon aloneof all men that have ever walked upon this earthwas able to suscitate his imperial eagles once more soar over france carrying on their wings her honour and glory to the outermost corners of europe his proclamation is to his people who have always loved him to his soldiers who in their hearts have always been true to him his proclamation he added as with a kind of exultant warcry he drew a roll of paper from his pocket and held it out at arms length above his head his proclamation here it is vive lempereur by the grace of god  who shall attempt to describe the feelings of all those who were assembled round this young enthusiast as he hurled his challenge right in the face of those who called him a liar and a traitor surely it were a hard task for the chronicler to search into the minds and hearts of this score of men and womenwho worshipped one god and reverenced one kingat the moment when they saw that king threatened upon his throne their faith mocked and their god blasphemed that the young man spoke words of truth no one thought of denying napoleons name had the power to strike terror in the heart of every citizen who desired peace above all things and of every royalist who wished to see king louis in possession of the throne of his fathers but the army which had fought under him the army which he had led in triumph and to victory from one end of the continent of europe to the other that army still loved him and had never been rightly loyal to king louis the horrors of war which had lain so heavily over france and over europe for the past twenty years were painfully vivid still in everybodys mind and all these horrors were intimately associated with the name which stood out now in bold characters on the paper which de marmont was triumphantly waving  m le comte had become a shade or two paler than he had been before he looked very old very careworn all of a sudden and his pale eyes had that look in them which comes into the eyes of the old after years of sorrow and of regret  but never for a moment did he depart from his attitude of dignity when de marmonts exultant cry of vive lempereur had ceased to echo round the majestic walls of this stately château he straightened out his spare figure and with one fine gesture begged for silence from his guests  then he said very quietly m marmont this is neither the place nor the opportunity which i should have chosen for confronting you with all the lies which you have told in the past ten months ever since you entered my house as an honoured guest but m de st genis has left me no option burning with indignation at your treachery he came hotfoot to unmask you before my daughters fair hand had affixed her own honourable name beneath that of a cheat and a traitor    yes m de marmont he reiterated with virile force breaking in on the hot protests which had risen to the young mans lips no one but a cheat and a traitor could thus have wormed himself into the confidence of an old man and of a young girl no one but a villainous blackguard could have contemplated the abominable deceptions which you have planned against me and against my daughter  for a moment or two after the old man had finished speaking victor de marmont remained silent there were murmurs of indignation among the guests also of approval of the comtes energetic words de marmont was in the midst of a hostile crowd and he knew it here was no drawingroom quarrel which could be settled at the point of a sword thoughas fate and man so oft ordain ita woman was the primary reason for the quarrel she was not its cause and the hostility expressed against him by every glance which de marmont encountered was so general and so great that it overawed him even in the midst of his enthusiasm  m le comte he said at last and he made a great effort to appear indifferent and unconcerned i wish for your daughters sake that m de st genis had chosen some other time to make this fracas we who have learned chivalry at the emperors school would have hit our enemy when he was in a position to defend himself this obviously i cannot do at this moment without trespassing still further upon your hospitality and causing mlle crystal still more pain i might even make a direct appeal to her since the decision in this matter rests i imagine primarily with her but with the emperor at our gates with the influence of his power and of his pride dominating my every thought i will with your gracious permission relieve you of my unwelcome presence without taking another leaf out of m de st genis book  as you will monsieur said the comte stiffly  de marmont bowed quite ceremoniously to him and the comtecourtly and correct to the lastreturned his salute with equal ceremony then the young man turned to crystal  for the first time perhaps since the terrible fracas had begun he realised what it all must mean to her she did not try to evade his look or to turn away from him on the contrary she looked him straight in the face and watched him while he approached her without retreating one single step but she watched him just as one would watch an abject and revolting cur that was too vile and too mean even to merit a kick  crystals blue eyes were always expressive but they had never been so expressive as they were just then de marmont met her glance squarely and he read in it everything that she meant to conveyher contempt her loathing her hatredbut above all her contempt so overwhelming so complete was this contempt that it made him wince as if he had been struck in the face with a whip  he stood still for he knew that she would never allow him to kiss her hand in farewell and he had had enough of insultshe knew that he could not bear that final one  a red mist suddenly gathered before his eyes a mad desire to strike to wound or to kill and with it a wave of passionhe called it lovefor this woman such as he had never felt for her before he gave her back with a glance hatred for hatred but whereas her hatred for him was smothered in contempt his for her was leavened with a fierce and dominant passion  all this had taken but a few seconds in accomplishment m le comte had not done more than give a sign to hector to see m de marmont safely out of the castle and maurice de st genis had only had time to think of interposing if de marmont tried to take crystals hand  only a few seconds but a lifetime of emotion was crammed into them then de marmont with crystals look of loathing still eating into his soul caught sight of clyffurde who stood close byclyffurde whose one thought throughout all this unhappy scene had been of crystal who through it all had eyes and ears only for her  some kind of instinct made the young girl look up to him just then probably only in response to a wave of memory which brought back to her at that very moment the words of devotion and offer of service which he had spoken awhile ago or it may have been that same sense which had told her at the time that here was a man whom she could always trust that he would always prove a friend as he had promised and the look which she gave him was one of simple confidence  but de marmont just happened to intercept that look he had never been jealous of clyffurde of course clyffurdethe foreigner the bourgeois tradesmannever could under any circumstances be a rival to reckon with at any other time he would have laughed at the idea of mlle crystal de cambray bestowing the slightest favour upon the englishman but within the last few seconds everything had become different victor de marmont the triumphant and wealthy suitor of mlle de cambray had become a pariah among all these ladies and gentlemen and he had become a man scorned by the woman whom he had wooed and thought to win so easily  the fierce love engendered for crystal in his turbulent heart by all the hatred and all the scorn which she lavished upon him brought an unreasoning jealousy into being he felt suddenly that he detested clyffurde he remembered clyffurdes nationality and its avowed hatred of the hero whom hede marmontworshipped and he realised also that that same hatred must of necessity be a bond between the englishman and crystal de cambray  thereforethough this new untamed jealousy seized hold of him with extraordinary power though it brought that ominous red film before his eyes which makes a man strike out blindly and stupidly against his rival it also suggested to de marmont a far simpler and far more efficacious way of ridding himself once for all of any fear of rivalry from clyffurde  when he had bowed quite formally to crystal he looked up at bobby and gave him a pleasant and friendly nod  i suppose you will be coming with me my good clyffurde he said lightly we are rowing in the same boat you and i we were a very happy party were we not you and emery and i when général mouton met us outside grenoble for we had just heard the glorious news that the emperor is marching triumphantly through france  then he turned once more to st genis did not he said the generals aidedecamp tell you that m de st genis  st genis hadduring these few seconds while de marmont held the centre of the stagesucceeded in controlling his excitement at any rate outwardly he was so absolutely master of the situation and had put his successful rival so completely to rout that the sense of satisfaction helped to soothe his nerves and when de marmont spoke directly to him he was able to reply with comparative calm  had you he said to de marmont attempted to deny the accusation which i have brought against you i was ready to confront you with the report which général moutons aidedecamp brought into the town  i had no intention of denying my loyalty to the emperor rejoined de marmont but i would like to know what report général moutons aidedecamp brought into grenoble the worthy general did not belie his name i assure you he looked mightily scared when he recognised emery  he was alone with his aidedecamp and in his coach retorted st genis whilst that traitor emery you and your friend mr clyffurde were on horsebackyou gave him the slip easily enough  thats true of course said de marmont simply well shall we go my dear clyffurde  he had accomplished the purpose of his jealousy even more effectually than he could have wished he looked round and saw that everyone had thrown a casual glance of contempt upon clyffurde and then turned away to murmur with scornful indifference i always mistrusted that man or the comte ought never to have had the fellow in the house while the words english spy and informer were on every lip  but clyffurde had made no movement during this brief colloquy he sawjust as de marmont didthat everyone was listening more with indifference than with horror hethe strangerwas of so little consequence after alla tradesman and an englishmanwhat mattered what his political convictions were de marmont was an object of hatred but heclyffurdewas only one of contempt  he heard the muttered words english spy informer and others of still more overwhelming disdain but he cared little what these people said he knew that they would never trouble to hear any justification from himselfthey would not worry their heads about him a moment longer once he had left the house in company with de marmont  he was not quite sure either whether de marmonts spite had been directed against himself personally or that it was merely the outcome of his present humiliating position  m le comte had not bestowed more than a glance upon him and that from under haughtily raised brows and across half the width of the room but crystal had looked up to him and was still looking and it was that look which had driven all the blood from clyffurdes face and caused his lips to set closely as if with a sense of physical pain  the insults which her fathers guests were overtly murmuring she had in her mind and her eyes were conveying them to him far more plainly than her lips could have done  english spytraitor to friendship and to trustliar deceiver hypocrite that and more did her scornful glance imply but she said nothing he tried to plead with eyes as expressive as were her own and she merely turned away from him just as if he no longer existed she drew her skirt closer round her and somehow with that gesture she seemed to sweep him entirely out of her existence  even mme la duchesse had not one glance for him to these passionate hotheaded impulsive royalists an adherent of the corsican ogre was lower than the scum of the earth they loathed de marmont because he had been one of themselves he was a traitor and not one man there but would have liked to see him put up against a wall and summarily shot but the stranger they wiped out of their lives  was there any chance for clyffurde if he tried to defend himself none of a certainty he could not call the accusation a lie since he had been in the company of emery and of de marmont most of the day and mere explanations would have fallen on deaf and unwilling ears  clyffurde knew this nor did he attempt any explanation there is a certain pride in the heart of every english gentleman which in moments of acute crisis rises to its full power and height that pride would not allow clyffurde to utter a single word in his own defence the futility of attempting it also influenced his decision he scorned the idea of speaking on his own behalf words which were doomed to be disbelieved  in a moment he had found himself absolutely isolated in the centre of the room not far from the hearth where he had stood a little while ago talking to crystal and close to the chair where she had sat with the light of the fire playing upon her satin gown the cushions still bore the impress of her young figure as she had leaned up against them the sight of it was an additional pain which almost made clyffurde wince  he bowed silently and very low to crystal and to mme la duchesse and then to all the ladies and gentlemen who coldshouldered him with such contemptuous ostentation de marmont with head erect and an air of swagger was already waiting for him at the door clyffurde in taking leave of m le comte made a violent effort to say at any rate the one word which weighed upon his heart  will you at least permit me m le comte he said to thank you for     but already the comte had interrupted him even before the words were clearly out of his mouth  i will not permit you sir he broke in firmly to speak a single word other than a plain denial of m de st genis accusations against you  then as clyffurde relapsed into silence m le comte continued with haughty peremptoriness  a plain yes or no will suffice sir were you or were you not in the company of those traitors emery and de marmont when général moutonduvernet came upon them outside grenoble  i was replied clyffurde simply  with a stiff nod of the head the comte turned his back abruptly upon him no one took any further notice of the english spy the accused had been condemned without enquiry and without trial in times like these all ones friends must be above suspicion clyffurde knew that there was nothing to be said with a quickly suppressed sigh he too turned away and in his habitual english dogged way he resolutely set his teeth and with a firm soldierly step walked quietly out of the room  hector see that m de marmonts coach is ready for him said m le comte with well assumed indifference and that supper is no longer delayed  he then once more offered his arm to mme la duchesse dembrun mme la duchesse he said in his most courtly manner i beg that you will accept my apologies for this unforeseen interruption may i have the honour of conducting you to supper     chapter iv  the empress millions   i  de marmont having successfully shot his poisoned arrow and brought down his enemy had no longer any illfeeling against clyffurde his jealousy had been shortlived it was set at rest by the brief episode which had culminated in the englishmans final exit from the castle of brestalou  not a single detail of that moving little episode had escaped de marmonts keen eyes he had seen crystals look of positive abhorrence wherewith she had regarded clyffurde he had seen the gathering up of her skirts awayas it werefrom the contaminating propinquity of the english spy  and de marmont was satisfied  he was perfectly ready to pick up the strained strands of friendship with the englishman and affected not to notice the latters absorption and moodiness  can i drive you into grenoble my good clyffurde he asked airily as he paused on the top of the perron steps waiting for the hackney coach  i thank you replied clyffurde i prefer to walk  it is eight kilometres and a pitchdark night  i know my way i thank you  just as you like  he paused a moment and began humming the marseillaise clyffurde started walking down the monumental steps  well ill say goodnight de marmont he said coldly and goodbye too  you are not going away queried the other  as soon as i can get the means of going  troops will be on the move all over the country soon foreigners will be interned you will have some difficulty in getting away  i know that thats why i want to make arrangements as early as possible  where will you stay in the meanwhile  possibly at the troisdauphins if i can get a room  i shall see you again then the emperor will stay there while he is in grenoble well goodnight my dear friend said de marmont as he extended a cordial hand to clyffurde who in the dark evidently failed to see it and dont take the insults of all these fools too much to heart and he gave an expressive nod in the direction of the stately castle behind him  they are dolts he continued airily if they possessed a grain of sense they would have kept on friendly terms with me as that old fools soninlaw i could have saved him from all the reprisals which will inevitably fall on all these royalist traitors now that the emperor has come into his own again  clyffurde was halfway down the stone steps when these words of de marmont struck upon his ear instinctively he retraced his steps there was a suggestion of impending danger to crystal in what the young man had said  what do you mean by talking about reprisals he asked  oh    only the inevitable replied de marmont the people of the dauphiné never cared for these royalists you know    and didnt learn to like them any better in these past eleven months since the restoration m le comte de cambray has been very high and mighty since his return from exile he may yet come to wish that he had never quitted the comfortable little provincial town in england where he gave drawing lessons and french lessons to some very bourgeois boys    but heres that coach at last he continued with that jaunty air which he had assumed since turning his back upon the reception halls of brestalou are you sure that you would rather walk than drive with me  no replied clyffurde abruptly i am not sure thank you very much i think that if you dont object to my somewhat morose company i would like a lift as far as grenoble  he wanted to make de marmont talk to hear what the young man had to say from it he thought that he could learn more accurately what danger would threaten brestalou in the event of napoleons successful march to paris  that the great adventurers triumph would be shortlived clyffurde was perfectly sure he knew the temper of england and believed in the military genius of wellington england would never tolerate for a moment longer than she could help that the firebrand of europe should once more sit upon the throne of france and unless the allies had greatly altered their policy in the past ten months and refused england the necessary support wellington would be more than a match for the decimated army of bonaparte  but a few weeksmonths perhaps might elapse before napoleon was once again put entirely out of actionand this time more completely and more effectually than with a small kingdom wherein to dream again of european conquests during those weeks and months brestalou and its inhabitants would be at the mercy of the man from corsicathe island of unrest and of never sleeping vendetta  de marmont was ready enough to talk he knew nothing of course of napoleons plans and ideas save what emery had told him but what he lacked in knowledge he more than made up in imagination excitement too had made him voluble he talked freely and incessantly the emperor would do this    the emperor will never tolerate that    was all the time on his lips  he bragged and he swaggered launched into passionate eulogies of the emperor and fiery denunciations of his enemies berthier clark foucher de marmont they all deserved death ney alone was to be pardoned for ney was a fine soldieralways supposing that ney would repent but men like the comte de cambray were a pest in any countrymischiefmaking and intriguing bah the emperor will never tolerate them  suddenly clyffurdewho had become halfdrowsy lulled to somnolence by de marmonts incessant chatter and the monotonous jogtrot of the horseswoke to complete consciousness he pricked his ears and in a moment was all attention  they think that they can deceive me de marmont was saying airily they think that i am as great a fool as they are with their talk of mme la duchesses journey north directly after the wedding bah any dolt can put two and two together the comte tells me in one breath that he had a visit from fourier in the afternoon and that the duchessewho only arrived in brestalou yesterdaywould leave again for paris on the day after tomorrow and he tells it me with a mysterious air and adds a knowing wink and a promise that he would explain himself more fully later on i could have laughedif it were not all so miserably stupid  he paused for want of breath and tried to peer through the window of the coach  it is pitchdark he said but we cant be very far from the city now  i dont see rejoined clyffurde ostentatiously smothering a yawn what m le préfets visit to brestalou had to do with the duchesses journey to the north you have got intrigues on the brain my good de marmont  and with wellfeigned indifference he settled himself more cosily into the dark corner of the carriage  de marmont laughed what fouriers afternoon visit has to do with mme dagens journey he retorted ill tell you my good clyffurde fourier went to see m le comte de cambray this afternoon because he is a poltroon he is terrified at the thought that the unfortunate empress money and treasure are still lying in the cellars of the hôtel de ville and he went out to brestalou in order to consult with the comte what had best be done with the money  i didnt know the exempress money was lying in the cellar of the hôtel de ville remarked clyffurde with wellassumed indifference  nor did i until emery told me rejoined de marmont the money is there though stolen from the empress marie louise by that archintriguer talleyrand twentyfive millions in notes and drafts the emperor reckons on it for current expenses until he has reached paris and taken over the treasury  even then i dont see what mme la duchesse dagen has to do with it  you dont said de marmont drily but i did in a moment fourier wouldnt keep the money at the hôtel de ville the comte de cambray would not allow it to be deposited in his house they both want the bourbon to have it soin order to lull suspicionthey have decided that madame la duchesse shall take the money to paris  wellperhaps said clyffurde with a yawn but are we not in grenoble yet  once more he lapsed into silence closed his eyes and to all intents and purposes fell asleep for never another word did de marmont get out of him until grenoble was reached and the rue montorge  here de marmont had his lodgings three doors from the hôtel des troisdauphins where fortunately clyffurde managed to secure a comfortable room for himself  he parted quite amicably from de marmont promising to call in upon him in the morning it would be foolish to quarrel with that young windbag now he knew some things and talked of a great many more   ii  preparations against the arrival of the corsican ogre were proceeding apace général marchand had been overconfident throughout the daywhich was the 5th of march the troops he said were loyal to a man they were coming in fast from chambéry and vienne the garrison would and could repulse that band of pirates and take upon itself to fulfil the promise which ney had made to the kingnamely to bring the ogre to his majesty bound and gagged in an iron cage  but the following day which was the 6th many things occurred to shake the commandants confidence napoleons proclamation was not only posted up all over the town but the citizens were distributing the printed leaflets among themselves one of the officers on the staff pointed out to général marchand that the 4th regiment of artillery quartered in grenoble was the one in which bonaparte had served as a lieutenant during the revolutionthe men it was argued would never turn their arms against one whom they had never ceased to idolize it would not be safe to march out into the open with men whose loyalty was so very doubtful  there was a rumour current in the town that when the men of the 5th regiment of engineers and the 4th of artillery were told that napoleon had only eleven hundred men with him they all murmured with one accord and what about us  therefore général marchand taking all these facts into consideration made up his mind to await the ogre inside the walls of grenoble here at any rate defections and desertions would be less likely to occur than in the field he set to work to organise the city into a state of defence fortyseven guns were put in position upon the ramparts which dominate the road to the south and he sent a company of engineers and a battalion of infantry to blow up the bridge of ponthaut at la mure  the royalists in the city who were beginning to feel very anxious had assembled in force to cheer these troops as they marched out of the city but the attitude of the sapeurs created a very unpleasant impression they marched out in disorder some of them tore the white cockade from their shakos and one or two cries of vive lempereur were distinctly heard in their ranks  at la mure m le maire argued very strongly against the destruction of the bridge of ponthaut it would be absurd he said to blow up a valuable bridge since not one kilometre away there was an excellent ford across which napoleon could march his troops with perfect ease the sapeurs murmured an assent and their officer colonel delessart feeling the temper of his men did not dare insist  he quartered them at la mure to await the arrival of the infantry and further orders from général marchand when the 5th regiment of infantry was reported to have reached laffray delessart had the sapeurs out and marched out to meet them although it was then close upon midnight  while delessart and his troops encamped at laffray cambronnewho was in command of napoleons vanguardhimself occupied la mure this was on the 7th the mayorwho had so strongly protested against the destruction of the bridge of ponthautgathered the population around him and in a body men women and children marched out of the borough along the corpssisteron road in order to give the emperor a rousing welcome  it was still early morning napoleon at the head of his old guard entered la mure a veritable ovation greeted him everyone pressed round him to see him or touch his horse his coat his stirrups he spoke to the people and held the mayor and municipal officials in long conversation  just as practically everywhere else on his route he had won over every heart but his small column which had been eleven hundred strong when he landed at jouan was still only eleven hundred strong he had only rallied four recruits to his standard true he had met with no opposition true that the peasantry of the dauphiné had loudly acclaimed him had listened to his harangues and presented him with flowers but he had not had a single encounter with any garrison on his way nor could he boast of any defections in his favour now he was nearing grenoblegrenoble which was strongly fortified and well garrisonedand grenoble would be the winning or losing cast of this great gamble for the sovereignty of france  it was close on eleven when the great adventurer set out upon this momentous stage of his journey the polish lancers leading then the chasseurs of his old guard with their timeworn grey coats and heavy bearskins some of them were on foot others packed closely together in wagons and carts which the enthusiastic agriculturists of la mure had placed at the disposal of the emperor  napoleon himself followed in his coach his horse being led along amidst thundering cries of god speed the small column started on its way  as for the rest tis in the domain of history every phase of it has been put on recorddelessartworried in his mind that he had not been able to obey général marchands orders and destroy the bridge of ponthauthis desire to communicate once more with the general his decision to await further orders and in the meanwhile to occupy the narrow defile of laffray as being an advantageous position wherein to oppose the advance of the ogre all this on the one side  on the other the advance of the polish lancers of the carts and wagons wherein are crowded the soldiers of the old guard and napoleon himself the great gambler sitting in his coach gazing out through the open windows at the fair land of france the peaceful valley on his left the chain of icecovered lakes and the turbulent drac on his right beyond the hills frowning taillefer snowcapped and pineclad and far ahead grenoble still hidden from his view as the future too was still hiddenthe mysterious gate beyond which lay glory and an empire or the ignominy of irretrievable failure  history has made a record of it all and it is not the purpose of this true chronicle to do more than recall with utmost brevity the chief incident of that memorable encounter the polish lancers galloping back with the report that the narrow pass was held against them in strong force the old guard climbing helterskelter out of carts and wagons examining their arms making ready napoleon stepping quickly out of his coach and mounting his charger  on the other side delessart holding hurried consultation with the vicomte de st genis whom général marchand has despatched to him with orders to shoot the brigand and his horde as he would a pack of wolves  napoleon is easily recognisable in the distance with his grey overcoat his white horse and his bicorne hat presently he dismounts and walks up and down across the narrow road evidently in a state of great mental agitation  delessarts men are sullen and silent a crowd of men and women from grenoble have followed them up thus far they work their way in and out among the infantrymen they have printed leaflets in their hands which they cram one by one into the hands or pockets of the soldierscopies of napoleons proclamation  now an officer of the old guard is seen to ride up the pass delessart recognises him they were brothers in arms two years ago and served together under the greatest military genius the world has ever known napoleon has sent the man on as an emissary but delessart will not allow him to speak  i mean to do my duty he declares  but in his voice too there has already crept that note of sullenness which characterised the sapeurs from the first  then captain raoul own aidedecamp to napoleon comes up at full gallop nor does he draw rein till he is up with the entire front of delessarts battalion  your emperor is coming he shouts to the soldiers if you fire the first shot will reach him and france will make you answerable for this outrage  while he shouts and harangues the men are still sullen and silent and in the distance the lances of the polish cavalry gleam in the sun and the shaggy bearskins of the old guard are seen to move forward up the pass delessart casts a rapid piercing glance over his men sullenness had given place to obvious terror  right about turn    quick    march he commands  resistance obviously would be useless with these men who are on the verge of laying down their arms he forces on a quick march but the polish lancers are already gaining ground the sound of their horses hoofs stamping the frozen ground the snorting the clanging of arms is distinctly heard delessart now has no option he must make his men turn once more and face the ogre and his battalion before they are attacked in the rear  as soon as the order is given and the two little armies stand face to face the polish lancers halt and the old guard stand still  and it almost seems for the moment as if nature herself stood still and listened and looked on the genial midday sun is slowly melting the snow on pine trees and rocks one by one the glistening tiny crystals blink and vanish under the warmth of the kiss the hard white road darkens under the thaw and slowly a thin covering of water spreads over the icy crust of the lakes  napoleon tells colonel mallet to order the men to lower their arms mallet protests but napoleon reiterates the command more peremptorily this time and mallet must obey then at the head of his old chasseurs thus practically disarmed the emperorand he is every inch an emperor nowwalks straight up to delessarts opposing troops  hotheaded st genis cries here he isfire in heavens name  but the sapeursthe old regiment in which napoleon had served as a young lieutenant in those glorious olden daysare now as pale as death their knees shake under them their arms tremble in their hands  at ten paces away from the foremost ranks napoleon halts  soldiers he cries loudly here i am your emperor do you know me  again he advances and with a calm gesture throws open his wellworn grey redingote  fire cries st genis in mad exasperation  fire commands delessart in a voice rendered shaky with overmastering emotion  silence reigns supreme napoleon still advances step by step his redingote thrown open his broad chest challenging the first bullet which would dare to end the bold adventurous daring life  is there one of you soldiers here who wants to shoot his emperor if there is here i am fire  which of these soldiers who have served under him at jena and austerlitz could resist such a call his voice has lost nothing yet of its charm his personality nothing of its magic ambitious ruthless selfish he may be but to the army a friend a comrade as well as a god  suddenly the silence is broken shouts of vive lempereur rend the air they echo down the narrow valley reecho from hill to hill and reverberate upon the pineclad heights of taillefer broken are the ranks white cockades fly in every direction tricolours appear in their hundreds everywhere shakos are waved on the points of the bayonets and always always that cry vive lempereur  sapeurs and infantrymen crowd around the little man in the worn grey redingote and he with that rough familiarity which bound all soldiers hearts to him seizes an old sergeant by the ends of his long moustache  so you old dog he says you were going to shoot your emperor were you  not me replies the man with a growl look at our guns not one of them was loaded  delessart in despair yet shaken to the heart his eyes swimming in tears offers his sword to napoleon whereupon the emperor grasps his hand in friendship and comforts him with a few inspiring words  only st genis has looked on all this scene with horror and contempt his royalist opinions are well known his urgent appeal to delessart a while ago to shoot the brigand and his hordes still rings in every soldiers ear he is halfcrazy with rage and there is quite an element of terror in the confused thoughts which crowd in upon his brain  already the sapeurs and infantrymen have joined the ranks of the old guard and napoleon with that inimitable verve and inspiring eloquence of which he was pastmaster was haranguing his troops just then three horsemen dressed in the uniform of officers of the national guard and wearing enormous tricolour cockades as large as soupplates on their shakos are seen to arrive at a breakneck gallop down the pass from grenoble  st genis recognised them at a glance they were victor de marmont surgeoncaptain emery and their friend the glovemaker dumoulin the next moment these three men were at the feet of their beloved hero  sire said dumoulin the glovemaker in the name of the citizens of grenoble we hereby offer you our services and one hundred thousand francs collected in the last twentyfour hours for your use  i accept both replied the emperor while he grasped vigorously the hands of his three most devoted friends  st genis uttered a loud and comprehensive curse then he pulled his horse abruptly round and with such a jerk that it reared and plunged madly forward ere it started galloping away with its frantic rider in the direction of grenoble   iii  and grenoble itself was in a turmoil  in the barracks the cries of vive lempereur were incessant général marchand was indefatigable in his efforts to still that cry to rouse in the hearts of the soldiers a sense of loyalty to the king  your country and your king he shouted from barrackroom to barrackroom  our country and our emperor responded the soldiers with evergrowing enthusiasm  the spirit of the army and of the people were bonapartist to the core they had never trusted either marchand or préfet fourier who had turned their coats so readily at the restoration they hated the émigrésthe comte de cambray the vicomte de st genis the duc dembrunwith their oldfashioned ideas of the semidivine rights of the nobility second only to the godlike ones of the king they thought them arrogant and untamed overready to grab once more all the privileges which a bloody revolution had swept away  to them napoleon despite the brilliant days of the empire despite his autocracy his militarism and his arrogance represented the people the advanced spirit of the revolution his downfall had meant a return to the old regimethe regime of feudal rights of farmers general of heavy taxation and dear bread  vive lempereur was cried in the barracks and vive lempereur at the street corners  a squadron of hussars had marched into grenoble from vienne just before noon the same squadron which a few months ago at a revue by the comte dartois in the presence of the king had shouted vive lempereur what faith could be put in their loyalty now  but two infantry regiments came in at the same time from chambéry and on these général marchand hoped to be able to reckon the comte charles de la bédoyère was in command of the 7th regiment and though he had served in prussia under napoleon he had tendered his oath loyally to louis xviii at the restoration he was a tried and able soldier and marchand believed in him the general himself reviewed both infantry regiments on the place darmes on their arrival and then posted them upon the ramparts of the city facing direct to the southeast and dominating the road to la mure  de la bédoyère remained in command of the 7th  for two hours he paced the ramparts in a state of the greatest possible agitation the nearness of napoleon of the man who had been his comrade in arms first and his leader afterwards had a terribly disturbing effect upon his spirit from below in the city the peoples mutterings their grumbling their sullen excitement seemed to rise upwards like an intoxicating incense the attitude of the troops of the gunners as well as of the garrison and of his own regiment worked more potently still upon the colonels already shaken loyalty  then suddenly his mind is made up he draws his sword and shouts vive lempereur  soldiers he calls follow me i will show you the way to duty follow me vive lempereur  vive lempereur vociferate the troops  after me my men to the bonne gate after me cries de la bédoyère  and to the shouts of vive lempereur the 7th regiment of infantry passes through the gate and marches along the streets of the suburb on towards la mure  général marchand hastily apprised of the wholesale defection sends colonel villiers in hot haste in the wake of de la bédoyère villiers comes up with the latter two kilomètres outside grenoble he talks he persuades he admonishes he scolds de la bédoyère and his men are firm  your country and your king shouts villiers  our country and our emperor respond the men and they go to join the old guard at laffray while villiers in despair rides back into grenoble  in the town the desertion of the 7th has had a very serious effect the muttered cries of vive lempereur are open shouts now général marchand is at his wits ends he has ordered the closing of every city gate and still the soldiers in batches of tens and twenties at a time contrive to escape out of the town carrying their arms and in many cases baggage with them the royalist factionthe women as well as the menspend the whole day in and out of the barrackrooms talking to the men trying to infuse into them loyalty to the king and to cheer them up by bringing them wine and provisions  in the afternoon the vicomte de st genis sick exhausted his horse covered with lather comes back with the story of the pass of laffray and napoleons triumphant march toward grenoble marchand seriously contemplates evacuating the city in order to save the garrison and his stores  préfet fourier congratulates himself on his foresight and on that he has transferred the twentyfive million francs from the cellars of the hôtel de ville into the safe keeping of m le comte de cambray he and général marchand both hope and think that the brigand and his horde cannot possibly be at the gates of grenoble before the morrow and that mme la duchesse dagen would be well on her way to paris with the money by that time  marchand in the meanwhile has made up his mind to retire from the city with his troops it is only a strategical measure he argues to save bloodshed and to save his stores pending the arrival of the comte dartois at lyons with the army corps he gives the order for the general retreat to commence at two oclock in the morning  satisfied that he has done the right thing he finally goes back to his quarters in the hotel du dauphiné close to the ramparts the comte de cambray is his guest at dinner and toward seven oclock the two men at last sit down to a hurried meal both their minds filled with apprehension and not a little fear as to what the next few days will bring  it is of course only a question of time says the comte de cambray airily monseigneur le comte dartois will be at lyons directly with forty thousand men and he will easily crush that marauding band of pirates but this time the corsican after his defeat must be put more effectually out of harms way i personally was never much in favour of elba  the english have some islands out in the atlantic or the pacific responds général marchand with firm decision it would be safest to shoot the brigand but failing that let the english send him to one of those islands and undertake to guard him well  let us drink to that proposition my dear marchand concludes m le comte with a smile  hardly had the two men concluded this toast when a fearful din is heard regular howls proceeding from the suburb of bonne the windows of the hotel give on the ramparts and the house itself dominates the bonne gate and the military ground beyond it hastily marchand jumps up from the table and throws open the window he and the comte step out upon the balcony  the din has become deafening with a hand that slightly trembles now général marchand points to the extensive grounds that lie beyond the city gate and m le comte quickly smothers an exclamation of terror  a huge crowd of peasants armed with scythes and carrying torches which flicker in the frosty air have invaded the slopes and flats of the military zone they are yelling vive lempereur at the top of their voices and from walls and bastions reverberates the answering cry vive lempereur vociferated by infantrymen and gunners and sapeurs and echoed and reechoed with passionate enthusiasm by the people of grenoble assembled in their thousands in the narrow streets which abut upon the ramparts  and in the midst of the peasantry surrounded by them as by a cordon napoleon and his small army just reinforced by the 7th regiment of infantry have haltedexpectant  napoleons aidedecamp capitaine raoul accompanied by half a dozen lancers comes up to the palisade which bars the immediate approach to the city gates  open he cries loudly so loudly that his young firm voice rises above the tumult around open in the name of the emperor  marchand sees it all he hears the commanding summons hears the thunderous and enthusiastic cheers which greet captain raouls call to surrender he and the comte de cambray are still standing upon the balcony of the hotel that faces the gate of bonne and dominates from its high ground the ramparts opposite whitecheeked and silent the two men have gazed before them and have understood to attempt to stem this tide of popular enthusiasm would inevitably be fatal the troops inside grenoble were as ready to cross over to the brigands standard as was colonel de la bédoyères regiment of infantry  the ramparts and the surrounding military zone were lit up by hundreds of torches by their flickering light the two men on the balcony could see the faces of the people and those of the soldiers who were even now being ordered to fire upon raoul and the lancers  colonel roussille who is in command of the troops at the gate sends a hasty messenger to général marchand the brigand demands that we open the gate reports the messenger breathlessly  tell the colonel to give the order to fire is marchands peremptory response  are you coming with me m le comte he asks hurriedly but he does not wait for a reply wrapping his cloak around him he goes in the wake of the messenger m le comte de cambray is close on his heels  five minutes later the general is up on the ramparts he has thrown a quick piercing glance round him there are two thousand men up here twenty guns ammunition in plenty out there only peasants and a heterogeneous band of some fifteen hundred men one shot from a gun perhaps would send all that crowd flying the first fusillade might scatter the band of brigands but marchand cannot dare not give the positive order to fire he knows that rank insubordination positive refusal to obey would follow  he talks to the men he harangues he begs them to defend their city against this horde of corsican pirates  to every word he says the men but oppose the one cry vive lempereur  the comte de cambray turns in despair to m de st genis who is a captain of artillery and whose men had hitherto been supposed to be tried and loyal royalists  if the men wont fire maurice asks the comte in despair cannot the officers at least fire the first shot  m le comte replies st genis through set teeth for his heart was filled with wrath and shame at the defection of his men the gunners have declared that if the officers shoot the men will shatter them to pieces with their own batteries  the crowds outside the gate itself are swelling visibly they press in from every side toward the city loudly demanding the surrender of the town open the gates open they shout and their clamour becomes more insistent every moment already they have broken down the palisades which surround the military zone they pour down the slopes against the gate but the latter is heavy and massive studded with iron stoutly resisting axe or pick  open they cry open in the emperors name  they are within hailing distance of the soldiers on the ramparts what price your plums they shout gaily to the gunners  quite cheap retort the latter with equal gaiety but theres no danger of the emperor getting any  the women sing the old couplet      bon bon napoléon     va rentrer dans sa maison  and the soldiers on the ramparts take up the refrain      nous allons voir le grand napoléon     le vainqueur de toutes les nations  what can we do m le comte says général marchand at last we shall have to give in  ill not stay and see it replies the comte i should die of shame  even while the two men are talking and discussing the possibilities of an early surrender napoleon himself has forced his way through the tumultuous throng of his supporters and accompanied by victor de marmont and colonel de la bédoyère he advances as far as the gate which still stands barred defiantly against him  i command you to open this gate he cries aloud  colonel roussille who is in command replies defiantly i only take orders from the general himself  he is relieved of his command retorts napoleon  i know my duty insists roussille i only take orders from the general  victor de marmont intoxicated with his own enthusiasm maddened with rage at sight of st genis whose face is just then thrown into vivid light by the glare of the torches cries wildly soldiers of the emperor who are being forced to resist him turn on those treacherous officers of yours tear off their epaulettes i say  his shrill and frantic cries seem to precipitate the inevitable climax the tumult has become absolutely delirious the soldiers on the ramparts tumble over one another in a mad rush for the gate which they try to break open with the buttend of their rifles but they dare not actually attack their own officers and in any case they know that the keys of the city are still in the hands of général marchand and général marchand has suddenly disappeared  feeling the hopelessness and futility of further resistance he has gone back to his hotel and is even now giving orders and making preparations for leaving grenoble préfet fourier hastily summoned is with him and the comte de cambray is preparing to return immediately to brestalou  we shall all leave for paris tomorrow as early as possible he says as he finally takes leave of the general and the préfet and take the money with us of course if the kingwhich god forbidis obliged to leave paris it will be most acceptable to him until the day when the allies are once more in the field and ready to crush irretrievably this time this corsican scourge of europe  one or two of the royalist officers have succeeded in massing together some two or three hundred men out of several regiments who appear to be determined to remain loyal  st genis is not among these his men had been among the first to cry vive lempereur when ordered to fire on the brigand and his hordes they had even gone so far as to threaten their officers lives  now covered with shame and boiling with wrath at the defection st genis asks leave of the general to escort m le comte de cambray and his party to paris  we shall be better off for extra protection urges m le comte de cambray in support of st genis plea for leave i shall only have the coachman and two postillions with me m de st genis would be of immense assistance in case of footpads  the road to paris is quite safe i believe says général marchand and at lyons you will meet the army of m le comte dartois but perhaps m de st genis had better accompany you as far as there at any rate he can then report himself at lyons twentyfive millions is a large sum of course but the purpose of your journey has remained a secret has it not  of course says m le comte unhesitatingly for he has completely erased victor de marmont from his mind  well then all you need fear is an attack from footpadsand even that is unlikely concludes général marchand who by now is in a great hurry to go but m de st genis has my permission to escort you  the general entrusts the keys of the bonne gate to colonel roussille he has barely time to execute his hasty flight having arranged to escape out of grenoble by the st laurent gate on the north of the town in the meanwhile a carter from the suburb of st joseph outside the bonne gate has harnessed a team of horses to one of his wagons and brought along a huge joist twenty pairs of willing and stout arms are already manipulating this powerful engine for the breaking open of the resisting gate already the doors are giving way the hinges creak and while général marchand and préfet fourier with their small body of faithful soldiers rush precipitately across the deserted streets of the town colonel roussille makes ready to open the gate of bonne to the emperor and to his soldiers  my regiment was prepared to turn against me he says to his men but i shall not turn against them  then he formally throws open the gate  ecstatic delight joyful enthusiasm succeeds the frantic cries of a while ago napoleon entering the city of grenoble was nearly crushed to death by the frenzy of the crowd cheered to the echoes surrounded by a delirious populace which hardly allowed him to move it was hours before he succeeded in reaching the hôtel des troisdauphins where he was resolved to spend the night since it was kept by an exsoldier one of his own old guard of the italian campaign  the enthusiasm was kept up all night the town was illuminated until dawn men and women paraded the streets singing the marseillaise and shouting vive lempereur  in a small room simply furnished but cosy and comfortable the great adventurer who had conquered half the world and lost it and had now set out to conquer it again sat with half a dozen of his most faithful friends cambronne and raoul victor de marmont and emery  on the table spread out before him was an ordnance map of the province his clenched hand rested upon it his eyes those eaglelike piercing eyes which had so often called his soldiers to victory gazed out straight before him as if through the bare whitewashed walls of this humble hotel room he saw the vision of the brilliant halls of the tuileries the imperial throne the empress beside him all her faithlessness and pusillanimity forgiven his son whom he worshipped his marshals grouped around him and with a gesture of proud defiance he threw back his head and said loudly  until today i was only an adventurer tonight i am a prince once more   iv  it was the next morning in that same sparselyfurnished and uncarpeted room of the hôtel des troisdauphins that napoleon spoke to victor de marmont to emery and dumoulin about the money which had been stolen last year from the empress and which he understood had been deposited in the cellars of the hôtel de ville  i am not going he said to levy a war tax on my good city of grenoble but my good and faithful soldiers must be paid and i must provision my army in case i encounter stronger resistance at lyons than i can cope with and am forced to make a détour i want the moneythe empress money which that infamous talleyrand stole from her so you de marmont had best go straight away to the hôtel de ville and in my name summon the préfet to appear before me you can tell him at once that it is on account of the money  i will go at once sire replied de marmont with a regretful sigh but i fear me that it is too late  too late snapped out the emperor with a frown what do you mean by too late  i mean that fourier has left grenoble in the trail of marchand and that two days agounless im very much mistakenhe disposed of the money  disposed of the money you are mad de marmont  not altogether sire when i say that fourier disposed of the empress money i only mean that he deposited it in what he would deem a safe place  the cur exclaimed napoleon with a yet tighter clenching of his hand and mighty fist turning against the hand that fed him and made him what he is well he added impatiently where is the money now  in the keeping of m le comte de cambray at brestalou replied de marmont without hesitation  very well said the emperor take a company of the 7th regiment with you to brestalou and requisition the money at once  ifas i believethe comte no longer has the money by him  make him tell you where it is  i mean sire that it is my belief that m le comtes sister and daughter will undertake to take the money to paris hoping by their sex and general air of innocence to escape suspicion in connection with the money  dont worry me with all these details de marmont broke in napoleon with a frown of impatience i told you to take a company with you and to get me the empress money see to it that this is done and leave me in peace  he hated arguing hated opposition the very suggestion of any difficulty his followers and intimates knew that already de marmont had repented that he had allowed his tongue to ramble on quite so much now he felt that silence must redeem his blundersilence now and success in his undertaking  he bent the knee for this homage the great corsican adventurer and onetime dictator of civilised europe loved to receive he kissed the hand which had once wielded the sceptre of a mighty empire and was ready now to grasp it again then he rose and gave the military salute  it shall be done sire was all that he said  his heart was full of enthusiasm and the task allotted to him was a congenial one the baffling and discomfiture of those who had insulted him ifas he believedcrystal would be accompanying her aunt on the journey toward paris then indeed would his own longing for some sort of revenge for the humiliation which he had endured on that memorable sunday evening be fully gratified  it was with a light and swinging step that he ran down the narrow stairs of the hotel in the little entrance hall below he met clyffurde  in his usual impulsive way without thought of what had gone before or was likely to happen in the future he went up to the englishman with outstretched hand  my dear clyffurde he said with unaffected cordiality i am glad to see you i have been wondering what had become of you since we parted on sunday last my dear friend he added ecstatically what glorious events eh  he did not wait for clyffurdes reply nor did he appear to notice the latters obvious coldness of manner but went prattling on with great volubility  what a man he exclaimed nodding significantly in the direction whence he had just come a six days marchmostly on foot and along steep mountain paths and today as fresh and vigorous as if he had just spent a months holiday at some pleasant watering place what luck to be serving such a man and what luck to be able to render him really useful service the tables will be turned eh my dear clyffurde he added giving his taciturn friend a jovial dig in the ribs and what lovely discomfiture for our proud aristocrats eh they will be sorry to have made an enemy of victor de marmont what  whereupon clyffurde made a violent effort to appear friendly and jovial too  why he said with a pleasant laugh what madcap ideas are floating through your head now  madcap schemes ejaculated de marmont nothing more or less my dear clyffurde than complete revenge for the humiliation those de cambrays put upon me last sunday  revenge that sounds exciting said clyffurde with a smile even while his palm itched to slap the young braggarts face  exciting par dieu of course it will be exciting they have no idea that i guessed their little machinations mme la duchesse dagen travelling to paris forsooth aye but with five and twenty millions sewn somewhere inside her petticoats well the emperor happens to want his own five and twenty millions if you please so mme la duchesse or m le comte will have to disgorge and i shall have the pleasing task of making them disgorge what say you to that friend clyffurde  that i am sorry for you replied the other drily  sorry for me why  because it is never a pleasing task to bully a defenceless womanand an old one at that  de marmont laughed aloud bully mme la duchesse dagen he exclaimed sacré tonnerre what do you take me for i shall not bully her fifty soldiers dont bully a defenceless woman we shall treat mme la duchesse with every consideration we shall only remove five and twenty millions of stolen money from her carriage that is all  you may be mistaken about the money de marmont it may be anywhere except in the keeping of mme la duchesse  it may be at the château de brestalou in the keeping of m le comte de cambray and this i shall find out first of all but i must not stand gossiping any longer i must see colonel de la bédoyère and get the men i want what are your plans my dear clyffurde  the same as before replied bobby quietly i shall leave grenoble as soon as i can  let the emperor send you on a special mission to lord grenville in london to urge england to remain neutral in the coming struggle  i think not said clyffurde enigmatically  de marmont did not wait to ask him to what this brief remark had applied he bade his friend a hasty farewell then he turned on his heel and gaily whistling the refrain of the marseillaise stalked out of the hotel  clyffurde remained standing in the narrow panelled hall which just then reeked strongly of stewed onions and of hot coffee he never moved a muscle but remained absolutely quiet for the space of exactly two minutes then he consulted his watchit was then close on middayand finally went back to his room   v  an hour after dawn that selfsame morning the travelling coach of m le comte de cambray was at the perron of the château de brestalou  at the last moment when m le comte hopelessly discouraged by the surrender of grenoble to the usurper came home at a late hour of the night he decided that he too would journey to paris with his sister and daughter taking the money with him to his majesty who indeed would soon be in sore need of funds  at that same late hour of the night m le comte discovered that with the exception of faithful hector and one or two scullions in the kitchen his male servants both indoor and out had wandered in a body out to grenoble to witness the emperors entry into the city they had marched out of the château to the cry of vive lempereur and outside the gates had joined a number of villagers of brestalou who were bent on the same errand  fortunately one of the coachmen and two of the older grooms from the stables returned in the early dawn after the street demonstrations outside the emperors windows had somewhat calmed down and with the routine of many years of domestic service had promptly and without murmurings set to to obey the orders given to them the day before to have the travelling berline ready with four horses by seven oclock  it was very cold the coachman and postillions shivered under their threadbare liveries the coachman had wrapped a woollen comforter round his neck and pulled his white beaver broadbrimmed hat well over his brows as the northeast wind was keen and would blow into his face all the way to lyons where the party would halt for the night he had thick woollen gloves on and of his entire burly person only the tip of his nose could be seen between his muffler and the brim of his hat the postillions whip in hand could not wrap themselves up quite so snugly they were trying to keep themselves warm by beating their arms against their chest  m le comte aided by hector was arranging for the disposal of leather wallets underneath the cushions of the carriage the wallets contained the moneytwentyfive millions in notes and draftsa godsend to the king if the usurper did succeed in driving him out of the tuileries  presently the ladies came down the perron steps with faithful jeanne in attendance who carried small bags and dressingcases both the ladies were wrapped in long furlined cloaks and mme la duchesse dagen had drawn a hood closely round her face but crystal de cambray stood bareheaded in the cold frosty air the hood of her cloak thrown back her own fair hair dressed high forming the only covering for her head  her face looked grave and even anxious but wonderfully serene this should have been her wedding morning the bells of old brestalou church should even now have been ringing out their first joyous peal to announce the great event often and often in the past few weeks ever since her father had formally betrothed her to victor de marmont she had thought of this coming morning and steeled herself to be brave against the fateful day she had been resigned to the decree of the father and to the necessities of family and nameresigned but terribly heartsore she was obeying of her own free will but not blindly she knew that her marriage to a man whom she did not love was a sacrifice on her part of every hope of future happiness her girlish love for st genis had opened her eyes to the possibilities of happiness she knew that life could hold out a veritable cornucopia of delight and joy in a union which was hallowed by love and her ready sacrifice was therefore all the greater all the more sublime because it was not offered up in ignorance  but all that now was changed she was once more free to indulge in those dreams which had gladdened the days and nights of her lonely girlhood out in faroff england dreams which somehow had not even found their culmination when st genis first told her of his love for her they had always been golden dreams which had haunted her in those distant days dreams of future happiness and of love which are seldom absent from a young girls mind especially if she is a little lonely has few pleasures and is surrounded with an atmosphere of sadness  crystal de cambray standing on the perron of her stately home felt but little sorrow at leaving it today she had hardly had the time in one brief year to get very much attached to it the sense of unreality which had been born in her when her father led her through its vast halls and stately parks had never entirely left her the little home in england the tiny sittingroom with its bow window and small front garden edged with dusty evergreens was far more real to her even now she felt as if the last year with its pomp and gloomy magnificence was all a dream and that she was once more on the threshold of reality now on the point of waking when she would find herself once more in her narrow iron bed and see the patched and darned muslin curtains gently waving in the draught  but for the moment she was glad enough to give herself to the delight of this sudden consciousness of freedom she sniffed the sharp frosty air with dilated nostrils like a young arab filly that scents the illimitable vastness of meadowland around her the excitement of the coming adventure thrilled her she watched with glowing eyes the preparations for the journey the bestowal under the cushions of the carriage of the money which was to help king louis to preserve his throne  in a sense she was sorry that her father and her aunt were coming too she would have loved to fly across country as a trusted servant of her king but when the time came to make a start she took her place in the big travelling coach with a light heart and a merry face she was so sure of the justice of the kings cause so convinced of gods wrath against the usurper that she had no room in her thoughts for apprehension or sadness  the comte de cambray on the other hand was grave and taciturn he had spent hours last evening on the ramparts of grenoble he had watched the dissatisfaction of the troops grow into open rebellion and from that to burning enthusiasm for the corsican ogre st genis had given him a vivid account of the encounter at laffray and his ears were still ringing with the cries of vive lempereur which had filled the streets and ramparts of grenoble until he himself fled back to his own château sickened at all that he had seen and heard  he knew that the kings own brother m le comte dartois was at lyons even now with forty thousand men who were reputed to be loyal but were not the troops of grenoble reputed to be loyal too and was it likely that the regiments at lyons would behave so very differently to those at grenoble  thus the wearisome journey northwards in the lumbering carriage proceeded mostly in silence none of the occupants seemed to have much to say mme la duchesse dagen and m le comte sat on the back seats leaning against the cushions crystal de cambray and everfaithful jeanne sat in front making themselves as comfortable as they could  there was a halt for déjeuner and change of horses at rives and here maurice de st genis overtook the party he proposed to continue the journey as far as lyons on horseback riding close by the off side of the carriage here as well as at the next halt at st andrélegaz maurice tried to get speech with crystal but she seemed cold in manner and unresponsive to his whispered words he tried to approach her but she pleaded fatigue and anxiety and he was glad then that he had made arrangements not to travel beside her in the lumbering coach his position on horseback beside the carriage would he felt be a more romantic one and he halfhoped that some enterprising footpad would give him a chance of displaying his pluck and his devotion  a start was made from st andrélegaz at six oclock in the afternoon crystal was getting very cramped and tired even the fine views over the range of the grande chartreuse and the long white plateau of the dent de crolles with the wintry sunset behind it failed to enchain her attention her father and her aunt slept most of the time each in a corner of the carriage and after the start from st andrélegaz comforted with hot coffee and fresh bread and the prospect of lyons now only some sixty kilomètres away crystal settled herself against the cushions and tried to get some sleep  the incessant shaking of the carriage the rattle of harness and wheels the cracking of the postillions whips all contributed to making her head ache and to chase slumber away but gradually her thoughts became more confused as the dim winter twilight gradually faded into night and a veil of impenetrable blackness spread itself outside the windows of the coach  the northeasterly wind had not abated it whistled mournfully through the cracks in the woodwork of the carriage and made the windows rattle in their framework on the box the coachman had much ado to see well ahead of him as the vapour which rose from the flanks and shoulders of his steaming horses effectually blurred every outline on the road the carriage lanthorns threw a weird and feeble light upon the evergrowing darkness to right and left the bare and frozen common land stretched its lonely vastness to some distant horizon unseen   vi  suddenly the cumbrous vehicle gave a terrific lurch which sent the unsuspecting jeanne flying into mme la duchesses lap and threw crystal with equal violence against her fathers knees there was much cracking of whips loud calls and louder oaths from coachman and postillions much creaking and groaning of wheels another lurchmore feeble this timemore groaning more creaking more oaths and finally the coach with a final quivering as it were of all its parts settled down to an ominous standstill  whereafter the oaths sounded more muffled while there was a scampering down from the high altitude of the coachmans box and a confused murmur of voices  it was then close on eight oclock lyons was distant still some dozen miles or soand the night by now was darker than pitch  m le comte roused from fitful slumbers and trying to gather his wandering wits put his head out of the window what is it pierre he called out loudly what has happened  its this confounded ditch m le comte came in a gruff voice from out the darkness i didnt know the bridge had entirely broken down this sacré government will not look after the roads properly  are you there maurice called the comte  but strangely enough there came no answer to his call m de st genis must have fallen back some little distance in the rear else he surely would have heard something of the clatter the shouts and the swearing which were attending the present unfortunate contretemps  maurice where are you called the comte again and still no answer  pierre was continuing his audible mutterings darkness as black as then he shouted with a yet more forcible volley of oaths jean you oaf get hold of the off mare cant you and you whats your name you fool ease the near gelding heavens above what dolts  stop a moment cried m le comte wait till the ladies can get out this pulling and lurching is unbearable  ease a moment commanded pierre stolidly go to the near door jean and help the master out of the carriage  hark what was that it was m le comte who spoke there had been a momentary lull in the creaking and groaning of the wheels while the two young postillions obeyed the coachmans orders to ease a moment and one of them came round to help the ladies and his master out of the lurching vehicle only the horses snorting the champing of their bits and pawing of the hard ground broke the silence of the night  m le comte had opened the near door and was half out of the carriage when a sound caught his ear which was in no way connected with the stranded vehicle and its team of snorting horses yet the sound came from horseshorses which were on the move not very far away and which even now seemed to be coming nearer  who goes there maurice is that you called m le comte more loudly  stand and deliver came the peremptory response  stand yourself or i fire retorted the comte who was already groping for the pistol which he kept inside the carriage  you murderous villain came with the inevitable string of oaths from pierre the coachman you     the rest of this forceful expletive was broken and muffled evidently pierre had been summarily gagged there was a short sharp scuffle somewhere on ahead cries for help from the two postillions which were equally sharply smothered the horses began rearing and plunging  one of you at the leaders heads came in a clear voice which in this impenetrable darkness sounded weirdly familiar to the occupants of the carriage who awed terrified by this unforeseen attack sat motionless clinging to one another inside the vehicle  alone the comte had not lost his presence of mind already he had jumped out of the carriage banging the door to behind him despite feeble protests from his sister pistol in hand he tried with anxious eyes to pierce the inky blackness around him  a muffled groan on his right caused him to turn in that direction  release my coachman he called peremptorily or i fire  easy m le comte came as a sharp warning out of the night in those same weirdly familiar tones as like as not you would be shooting your own men in this infernal darkness  who is it whispered crystal hoarsely i seem to know that voice  god protect us murmured jeanne its the devils voice mademoiselle  mme la duchesse said nothing no doubt she was too frightened to speak her thin bony fingers were clasped tightly round her nieces hands  suddenly there was another scuffle by the door the sharp report of a pistol and then that strangely familiar voice called out again  merely as a matter of form m le comte  you will hang for this you rogue came in response from the comte  but already crystal had torn her hands out of mme la duchesses grasp and now was struggling to free herself from jeannes terrified and clinging embrace  father she cried wildly maurice maurice help let me go jeanne they are hurting him  she had succeeded in pushing jeanne roughly away and already had her hand on the door when it was opened from the outside and the flickering light of a carriage lanthorn fell full on the interior of the vehicle neither crystal nor mme la duchesse could effectually suppress a sudden gasp of terror whilst jeanne threw her shawl right over her head for of a truth she thought that here was the devil himself  the light illumined the lanthornbearer only fitfully but to the terrorstricken women he appeared to be preternaturally tall and broad with wide caped coat pulled up to his ears and an oldfashioned tricorne hat on his head his face was entirely hidden by a black mask and his hands by black kid gloves  i pray you ladies he said quietly and this time the voice was obviously disguised and quite unrecognisable i pray you have no fear neither i nor my men will do you or yours the slightest harm if you will allow me without any molestation on your part to make an examination of the interior of your carriage  mme la duchesse and jeanne remained silent the one from fear the other from dignity but it was not in crystals nature to submit quietly to any unlawful coercion  this is an infamy she protested loudly and you my man will swing on the nearest gallows for it  no doubt i should if i were found out said the man imperturbably but the military patrols of m le comte dartois dont come out as far as this nevertheless i must ask you ladies not to detain me on my business any longer my men are at the door and it is over a quarter of an hour ago since we placed m de st genis temporarily yet effectually hors de combat i pray you therefore step out without delay so that i may proceed to ascertain whether there is anything in this carriage likely to suit my requirements  you must be a madman as well as a thief retorted crystal loudly to imagine that we would submit to such an outrage  if you do not submit madame said the man calmly i will order my man to shoot m le comte in the right leg  you would not dare     but the miscreant turned his head slowly round and called over his shoulder into the night  attention my men m le comte de cambrayhave you got him  aye aye sir came from out the darkness  crystal gave a wild scream and with an agonised gesture of terror clutched the highway robber by the coat  no no she cried stop stop no father help  mademoiselle said the man quietly releasing his coat from her clinging hands remember that m le comte is perfectly safe if you will deign to step out of the carriage without further delay  he held the lanthorn in one hand the other was suddenly imprisoned by crystals trembling fingers  sir she pleaded in a voice broken by terror and anxiety we are helpless travellers on our way to paris driven out of our home by the advancing horde of corsican brigands our little all we have with us you cannot take that all from us let us give you some money of our own free will then the shame of robbing women who have in the darkness of the night been rendered helpless will not rest upon you oh have pity upon us your voice is so gentle you must be good and kind you will let us proceed on our way will you not and well take a solemn oath that well not attempt to put any one on your track you will wont you i swear to you that you will be doing a far finer deed thereby than you can possibly dream of  i have some jewelry about my person here interposed madames sharp voice drily also some gold i agree to what my niece says well swear to do nothing against you when we reach lyons if you will be content with what we give you of our own free will and let us go in peace  the man allowed both ladies to speak without any interruption on his part he even allowed crystals dainty fingers to cling around his gloved hand for as long as she chose no doubt he found some pleasure in this tearful appeal from such beautiful lips for crystal looked divinely pretty just then with the flickering light of the lanthorn throwing her fair head into bold relief against the surrounding gloom her blue eyes were shining with unshed tears her delicate mouth was quivering with the piteousness of her appeal  but when mme la duchesse had finished speaking and began to divest herself of her rings he released his hand very gently and said in his even quiet voice  your pardon madame but as it happens i have no use for ladies trinkets while all that you have been good enough to tell me only makes me the more eager to examine the contents of this carriage  but theres nothing of value in it asserted madame unblushingly except what we are offering you now  that is as may be madame i would wish to ascertain  you impious malapert she cried out wrathfully would you dare lay hands upon a woman  no madame certainly not he replied i will merely as i have had the honour to tell you order my men to shoot m le comte de cambray in the right leg  you vagabond you thief you wouldnt dare expostulated madame who seemed now on the verge of hysteria  attention my men he called once more over his left shoulder  it is no use ma tante here interposed crystal with sudden calm we must yield to brute force let us get out and allow this abominable thief to wreak his impious will with us else we lay ourselves open to further outrage at his hands be sure that retribution swift and certain will overtake him in the end  come thats wisely spoken said the man who seemed in no way perturbed by the scornful glances which crystal and madame now freely darted upon him he stood a little aside holding the door open for them to step out of the carriage  where is m le comte de cambray queried crystal as she brushed past him  close by he replied to your right now mademoiselle and perfectly safe and m le marquis de st genis is not two hundred mètres away equally secure and equally safe here le bossu he added calling out into the night ease the gag round your prisoners mouth a little so that he may speak to the ladies  while madame la duchesse groped her way along in the direction whence came sounds of stirring groaning and not a little cursing which proclaimed the presence of some men held captive by others crystal remained beside the carriage door as if rooted to the spot the feeble light of the lanthorn had shown her at a glance that the masked miscreant had taken every precaution for the success of his nefarious purpose how many men he had with him altogether she could not of course ascertain half a dozen perhaps seeing that her father the coachman and two postillions had been overpowered and were being closely guarded whilst she distinctly saw that two men at least were standing behind their chief at this moment in order to ward off any possible attack against him from the rear while he himself was engaged in the infamous task of robbing the coach of its contents  crystal saw him start to work in a most methodical manner he had stood the lanthorn on the floor of the carriage and was turning over every cushion and ransacking every pocket the leather wallets which he found he examined with utmost coolness seeing indeed that they were stuffed full of banknotes and drafts his huge caped coat appeared to have immense pockets into which those precious wallets disappeared one by one  she knew of course that resistance was useless the occasional glint of the feeble lanthorn light upon the pistols held by the men close beside her taught her the salutary lesson of silence and dignity she clenched her hands until her nails were almost driven into the flesh of her palms and her face now glowed with a fierce and passionate resentment this money which might have saved the king and france from the immediate effects of the usurpers invasion was now the booty of a common thief wild thoughts of vengeance coursed through her brain she felt like a tigercat that was being robbed of its young onceunable to control herselfshe made a wild dash forward determined to fight for her treasure to scratch or to biteto do anything in fact rather than stand by and see this infamous spoliation but immediately her hands were seized and an ominous word of command rang out weirdly through the night  resistance here attention over there  her fathers safety was a guarantee of her own acquiescence struggling fighting was useless the abominable thief must be left to do his work in peace  it did not take long a minute or two later he too had stepped out of the carriage he ordered one of his followers to hold the lanthorn and then quietly took up his stand beside the open door  now ladies an you desire it he said calmly you may continue your journey your coachman and your men are close here on the road securely bound m de st genis is not far offstraight up the roadyou cannot miss him we leave you free to loosen their bonds to horse my men he added in a loud commanding voice le bossu hold my horse a moment and you ladies i pray you accept my humble apologies that i do not stop to see you safely installed  as in a dream crystal heard the bustle incident on a number of men getting to horse in the gloom she saw vague forms moving about hurriedly she heard the champing of bits the clatter of stirrup and bridle the masked man was the last to move after he had given the order to mount he stood for nearly a minute by the carriage door exactly facing crystal not five paces away  his companion had put the lanthorn down on the step and by its light she could see him distinctly a mysterious masked figure who with wanton infamy had placed the satisfaction of his dishonesty and of his greed athwart the destiny of the king of france  crystal knew that through the peepholes of his mask the mans eyes were fixed intently upon her and the knowledge caused a blush of mortification and of shame to flood her cheeks and throat at that moment she would gladly have given her life for the power to turn the tables upon that abominable rogue to filch from him that precious treasure which she had hoped to deposit at the feet of the king for the ultimate success of his cause and she would have given much for the power to tear off that concealing mask so that for the rest of her life she might be able to visualise that face which she would always execrate  something of what she felt and thought must have been apparent in her expressive eyes for presently it seemed to her as if beneath the narrow curtain that concealed the lower part of the mans face there hovered the shadow of a smile  the next moment he had the audacity slightly to raise his hat and to make her a bow before he finally turned to go crystal had taken one step backward just then whether because she was afraid that the man would try and approach her or because of a mere sense of dignity she could not herself have said certain it is that she did move back and that in so doing her foot came in contact with an object lying on the ground the shape and size of it were unmistakable it was the pistol which the comte must have dropped when first he stepped out of the carriage and was seized upon by this band of thieves guided by that same strange and wonderful instinct which has so often caused women in times of war to turn against the assailants of their men or devastation of their homes crystal picked up the weapon without a moments hesitation she knew that it was loaded and she knew how to use it even as the masked man moved away into the darkness she fired in the direction whence his firm footsteps still sent their repeated echo  the short sharp report died out in the still frosty air crystal vainly strained her ears to catch the sound of a fall or a groan but in the confusion that ensued she could not distinguish any individual sound she knew that mme la duchesse and jeanne had screamed she heard a few loud curses the clatter of bits and bridles the snorting of horses and presently the noise of several horses galloping away out in the direction of chambéry  then nothing more   vii  m le comte as well as the coachman and postillions were lying helpless and bound somewhere in the darkness it took the three women some time to find them first and then to release them  crystal with great presence of mind had run to the horses heads directly after she had fired that random shot the poor frightened animals had reared and plunged and had thereby succeeded in dragging the heavy carriage out of the ditch after which they had stopped rigid for a moment and trembling as horses will sometimes when they are terrified before they start running away for dear life that moment was crystals opportunity and fortunately she took it at the right time and in the right way  a hand on the leaders bridles a soothing voice the absence of further alarming noises tended at once to quieten the teama set of good steady normandy drafthorses with none too much corn in their bellies to heat their sluggish blood  while crystal stood at her post mme la duchessecool and practicalfound her way firstly to m le comte then to the coachman and postillions and ordering jeanne to help her she succeeded in freeing the men from their bonds  then calling to one of them to precede her with a lanthorn she started on the quest for maurice de st genis he was foundas that abominable thief had saidsome two hundred yards up the road very securely bound and with his own handkerchief tied round his mouth but otherwise comfortably laid on a dry bit of roadside grass  mme la duchesse would not reply to his questions but after he was released and able to stand up she made him give her a brief account of his adventure it had all been so sudden and so quickhe had fallen back a little behind the carriage as soon as the night had set in as he thought it safer to keep along the edge of the road he was feeling tired and drowsy and allowing his horse to amble along in the slow jogtrot peculiar to its race no doubt his attention had for some time been on the wander when all at once in the darkness someone seized hold of his horse by the bridle and forced it back upon its haunches the next moment maurice felt himself grabbed by the leg and dragged off his horse he shouted for help but the carriage was on ahead and its own rattle prevented the shouts from being heard after which he was bound and gagged and summarily left to lie by the roadside he had had no chance against the ruffians as they were numerous but they did not attempt to illuse him in any way  slowly hobbling towards the carriage beside mme la duchesse for he was cramped and stiff maurice told her all there was to tell he had heard the distant scuffle the shouts and calls also one pistolshot at the end but he had been rendered helpless even before the carriage had come to a halt in the ditch  it was m le comte who in his accustomed measured tones now gave maurice de st genis the details of this awful adventure the ransacking of the carriage by the mysterious miscreantthe loss of the twentyfive millions the complete shattering of all hope to help the king with this money in the hour of his need and finally crystals desperate act of revenge as she shot the pistol off into the darkness hoping at least to disable the impudent rogue who had done them and the king such a fatal injury  st genis listened to it all with lips held tightly pressed together firm determination causing every muscle in his body to grow taut and firm with the earnestness of his resolve  when m le comte had finished speaking and with a sigh of discouragement had suggested an immediate continuation of his journey maurice said resolutely  do you go on straightway to lyons with the ladies my dear comte but i shall not leave this neighbourhood till by some means or other i find those miscreants and lay their infamous leader by the heel  well spoken maurice said the comte guardedly but how will you do itit is late and the night darker than ever  you must spare me one of your horses my dear comte replied the young man as mine apparently has been stolen by those abominable thieves and ill ride back to the nearest villageyou remember we passed it not half an hour ago ill get lodgings there and get some information in the meanwhile perhaps you will see m le comte dartois immediately tell him all that has happened and beg him to send me as early in the morning as possible a dozen cavalrymen or so to help me scour the country ill be on the lookout for them on this road by six oclock and please god the day shall not go by before we have those infamous marauders by the heels twentyfive millions remember are not dragged about open country quite so easily as those thieves imagine they are bound to leave some trace of their whereabouts sometimes  he appeared so confident and so cheerful that some of his optimism infected m le comte too the latter promised to get an audience of m le comte dartois that very evening and of course the necessary cavalry patrol would at once be forthcoming  god grant you success maurice he added fervently and the young mans energy and enthusiasm were also rewarded by a warm glowing look from crystal  a quarter of an hour afterwards m le comtes travelling coach was once more ready for departure pierre had been given his orders to make due haste for lyons and to drive a unicorn team of three horses instead of a regulation four whereupon he had muttered a string of oaths which would have caused a paris wineshop loafer to blush  one of the horses thereupon was detached from the team for maurices use and made ready with one of the postillions saddles the other postillion had to climb up to the seat next to the coachman all three men were feeling not a little shamed at the sorry rôle which they had just played and they vowed revenge against the mysterious thieves who had sprung upon them unawares and in the dark or mordieu they would have suffered severely for their impudence  in silence m le comte mme la duchesse and crystal followed by faithful jeanne reentered the carriage no one had been hurt m le comtes arms felt a little stiff from the cords which had bound them behind his back and jeanne was inclined to be hysterical but crystal felt a fierce resentment burning in her heart somehow she had no hope that maurice would succeed even though she threw him at the last a kindly and encouraging smile her one hope was that she had inflicted a painful if not a deadly wound upon the shameless robber of the kings money  soon the party was once more comfortably settled and the cumbrous vehicle after another violent lurch was once more on its way  farewell maurice good luck called m le comte at the last  the young man waited until the heavy carriage swung more easily upon its springs then he mounted his horse turned its head in the opposite direction and rode slowly back up the road  inside the vehicle all was silent for a while then m le comte asked quietly  did he find everything  everything replied crystal  i put in five wallets  yes he took them all  it is curious they should have fallen on us just by that broken bridge  they were lying in wait for us of course  knowing that we had the money do you think asked the comte  of course replied crystal with still that note of bitter resentment in her voice  but who besides ourselves and the préfet    began the comte who clearly was very puzzled  victor de marmont for one    retorted the girl  surely you dont suppose that he would play the rôle of a highwayman and     no i dont she broke in somewhat impatiently he wouldnt have the pluck for one thing and moreover the masked man was considerably taller than victor  well then  it is only an idea father dear she said more gently but somehow i cannot believe that this was just ordinary highway robbery this road is supposed to be quite safe travellers are not warned against armed highwaymen and marauders wouldnt be so well horsed and clothed my belief is that it was a paid gang stationed at the broken bridge on purpose to rob us and no one else  maurice will soon be after them tomorrow and ill see m le comte dartois directly we get to lyons said the comte after a slight pause during which he was obviously pondering over his daughters suggestion  it wont be any use father crystal said with a sigh the whole thing has been organised i feel sure and the head that planned this abominable robbery will know how to place his booty in safety  whereupon the comte sighed for he was too wellbred to curse in the presence of his daughter and his sister mme la duchesse had said nothing all this while nor did she offer any comment upon the mysterious occurrence all the time that the next stage of the wearisome journey proceeded   viii  less than an hour later the coach came to a halt once more  m le comte woke up with a start  my god he exclaimed what is it now  crystal had not been asleep her thoughts were too busy her brain too much tormented with trying to find some plausible answer to the riddle which agitated her who had planned this abominable robbery was it indeed victor de marmont himself or had a greater a mightier mind than his discovered the secret of this swift journey to paris and ordered the clever raid upon the treasure  the rumble of the wheels hadthough she was awakeprevented her from hearing the rapid approach of a number of horses in the wake of the coach until a peremptory halt in the name of the emperor suddenly chased every other thought away like her father she murmured my god what is it now  this time there was no mystery there would be no puzzlement as to the meaning of this fresh attack the air was full of those sounds that denote the presence of many horses and of many men there was too the clinking of metal the champing of steel bits the brief words of command which proclaimed the men to be soldiers  they appeared to be all round the coach for the noise of their presence came from everywhere at once  already the comte had put his head out of the window what is it now he asked again more peremptorily this time  in the name of the emperor was the loud reply  we do not halt in the name of an usurper said the comte en avant pierre  you urge those horses on at your peril coachman was the defiant retort  a quick word of command was given there was more clanking of metal snorting of horses loud curses from pierre on the box and the commanding voice spoke again  m le comte de cambray  that is my name replied the comte and who is it pray who dares impede peaceful travellers on their way  by order of the emperor was the curt reply  i know of no such person in france  vive lempereur was shouted defiantly in response  whereupon m le comte de cambrayproud disdainful and determined to show no fear or concern withdrew from the window and threw himself back against the cushions of the carriage  what in the virgins name is the meaning of this murmured mme la duchesse  god in heaven only knows sighed the comte  but obviously the coach had not been stopped by a troop of mounted soldiers for the mere purpose of proclaiming the emperors name on the high road in the dark the same commanding voice which had answered the comtes challenge was giving rapid orders to dismount and to bring along one of the carriage lanthorns  the next moment the door of the coach was opened from without and the light of the lanthorn held up by a man in uniform fell full on the figure and on the profile of victor de marmont  m le comte i regret he said coldly in the name of the emperor i must demand from you the restitution of his property  the comte shrugged his shoulders and vouchsafed no reply  m le comte said de marmont more peremptorily this time i have twentyfour men with me who will seize by force if necessary that which i herewith command you to give up voluntarily  still no reply m le comte de cambray would think himself bemeaned were he to parley with a traitor  as you will m le comte was de marmonts calm comment on the old mans attitude sergeant he commanded seize the four persons in this coach three of them are women so be as gentle as you can go round to the other door first  father now urged crystal gently do you think that this is wiseor dignified  wisely spoken mlle crystal rejoined de marmont have i not said that i have two dozen soldiers with meall trained to do their duty why should m le comte allow them to lay hands upon you and on mme la duchesse  it is an outrage broke in the comte savagely you and your soldiers are traitors rebels and deserters  but we are in superior numbers m le comte said de marmont with a sneer would it not be wiser to yield with a good grace mme la duchesse he added with an attempt at geniality yours was always the wise head i am told that guided the affairs of m le comte de cambray in the past will you not advise him now  i would my good man retorted the duchesse but my wise counsels would benefit no one now seeing that you have been sent on a fools errand  de marmont laughed  does mme la duchesse mean to deny that twentyfive million francs belonging to the emperor are hidden at this moment inside this coach  i deny monsieur de marmont that any twentyfive million francs belong to the son of an impecunious corsican attorneyand i also deny that any twentyfive million francs are in this coach at the present moment  that is exactly what i desire to ascertain madame  ascertain by all means then quoth madame impatiently the other thief ascertained the same thing an hour ago and i must confess that he did so more profitably than you are like to do  the other thief exclaimed de marmont greatly puzzled  it is as mme la duchesse has deigned to tell you here interposed the comte coolly i have no objection to your knowing that i had intended to convey to his majesty the kingits rightful ownera sum of moneyoriginally stolen by the corsican usurper from francebut that an hour ago a party of armed thievesjust like yourselfattacked us bound and gagged me and my men ransacked my coach and made off with the booty  and i thank god now murmured crystal involuntarily that the money has fallen into the hands of a common highwayman rather than in those of the scourge of mankind  m le comte    stammered de marmont who still incredulous yet vaguely alarmed was nevertheless determined not to accept this extraordinary narrative with blind confidence  but m le comte de cambrays dignity rose at last to the occasion you choose to disbelieve me monsieur he asked quietly  de marmont made no reply  will my word of honour not suffice  my orders m le comte said de marmont gruffly are that i bring back to my emperor the money that is his i will not leave one stone unturned     enough monsieur broke in the comte with calm dignity we will alight now if your soldiers will stand aside  and for the second time on this eventful night mme la duchesse dagen and mlle crystal de cambray together with faithful jeanne were forced to alight from the coach and to stand by while the cushions of the carriage were being turned over by the light of a flickering lanthorn and every corner of the interior ransacked for the elusive treasure  there is nothing here mon colonel said a gruff voice out of the darkness after a while  a loud curse broke from de marmonts lips  you are satisfied asked the comte coldly that i have told you the truth  search the luggage in the boot cried de marmont savagely without heeding him search the men on the box bring more light here that money is somewhere in this coach ill swear if i do not find it ill take every one here back a prisoner to grenoble    or     he paused himself ashamed of what he had been about to say  or you will order your soldiers to lay hands upon our persons is that it m de marmont broke in crystal coldly  he made no reply for of a truth that had been his thought foiled in his hope of rendering his beloved emperor so signal a service he had lost all sense of chivalry in this overwhelming feeling of baffled rage  crystals cold challenge recalled him to himself and now he felt ashamed of what he had just contemplated ashamed too of what he had done he hated the comte    he hated all royalists and all enemies of the emperor    but he hated the comte doubly because of the insults which he de marmont had had to endure that evening at brestalou he had looked upon this expedition as a means of vengeance for those insults a means too of showing his power and his worth before crystal and of winning her through that power which the emperor had given him and through that worth which the emperor had recognised  but though he hated the comte he knew him to be absolutely incapable of telling a deliberate lie and absolutely incapable of bartering his word of honour for the sake of his own safety  crystals words brought this knowledge back to his mind and now the desire seized him to prove himself as chivalrous as he was powerful he was one of those men who are so absolutely ignorant of a womans nature that they believe that a womans love can be won by deeds as apart from personality and that a womans dislike and contempt can be changed into love he loved crystal more absolutely now than he had ever done in the days when he was practically her accepted suitor his unbridled and capricious nature clung desperately to that which he could not hold and since he had feltthat evening at brestalouthat his political convictions had placed an insuperable barrier between himself and crystal de cambray he felt that no woman on earth could ever be quite so desirable  his mistake lay in this that he believed that it was his political convictions alone which had turned crystal away from him he felt that he could have won her love through her submission once she was his wife now he found that he would have to win her love first and her wifely submission would only follow afterwards  just nowthough in the gloom he could only see the vague outline of her graceful form and only heard her voice as through a veil of darknesshe had the longing to prove himself at once worthy of her regard and deserving of her gratitude  without replying to her direct challenge he made a vigorous effort to curb his rage and to master his disappointment then he gave a few brief commands to his sergeant ordering him to repair the disorder inside the coach and to stop all further searching both of the vehicle and of the men  finally he said with calm dignity m le comte i must offer you my humble apologies for the inconvenience to which you have been subjected i humbly beg mme la duchesse and mademoiselle crystal to accept these expressions of my profound regret a soldiers life and a soldiers duty must be my excuse for the part i was forced to take in this untoward happening mme la duchesse i pray you deign to reenter your carriage m le comte if there is aught i can do for you i pray you command me     neither the duchesse nor the comte however deigned to take the slightest notice of the abominable traitor and of his long tirade madame was shivering with cold and yawning with fatigue and in her heart consigned the young brute to everlasting torments  the comte would have thought it beneath his dignity to accept any explanation from a follower of the corsican usurper without a word he was now helping his sister into the carriage  jeanne of course hardly countedshe was dazed into semiimbecility by the renewed terrors she had just gone through so for the moment victor felt that crystal was isolated from the others she stood a little to one sidehe could only just see her as the sergeant was holding up the lanthorn for mme la duchesse to see her way into the coach m le comte went on to give a few directions to the coachman  mademoiselle crystal murmured victor softly  and he made a step forward so that now she could not move toward the carriage without brushing against him but she made no reply  mademoiselle crystal he said again have you not one single kind word for me  a kind word she retorted almost involuntarily after such an outrage  i am a soldier he urged and had to do my duty  you were a soldier once m de marmonta soldier of the king now you are only a deserter  a soldier of the emperor mademoiselle of the man who led france to victory and to glory and will do so again now that he has come back into his own once more  you and i m de marmont she said coldly look at france from different points of view this is neither the hour nor the place to discuss our respective sentiments i pray you allow me to join my aunt in the carriage i am cold and tired and she will be anxious for me  will you at least give me one word of encouragement mademoiselle he urged as you say our points of view are very different but i am on the high road to fortune the emperor is back in france the army flocks to his eagles as one man he trusts me and i shall rise to greatness under his wing mademoiselle crystal you promised me your hand i have not released you from that promise yet i will come and claim it soon  excitement seems to have turned your brain m de marmont was all that crystal said and she walked straight past him to the carriage door  victor smothered a curse these aristos were as arrogant as ever what lesson had the revolution and the guillotine taught them none this girl who had spent her whole life in poverty and exile and was likeafter a brief interregnumto return to exile and poverty again was not a whit less proud than her kindred had been when they walked in their hundreds up the steps of the guillotine with a smile of lofty disdain upon their lips  victor de marmont was a son of the peopleof those who had made the revolution and had fought the whole of europe in order to establish their right to govern themselves as they thought best and he hated all these aristosthe men who had fled from their country and abandoned it when she needed her sons help more than she had ever done before  the aristocrat was for him synonymous with the émigréwith the man who had raised a foreign army to fight against france who had brought the foreigner marching triumphantly into paris he hated the aristocrat but he loved crystal the one desirable product of that old regime system which he abhorred  but with him a womans love meant a womans submission he was more determined than ever now to win her but he wanted to win her through her humiliation and his triumphexcitement had turned his brain well so be it fear and oppression would turn her heart and crush her pride  he made no further attempt to detain her he had asked for a kind word and she had given him withering scorn excitement had turned his brain    he was not even worthy of parleynot even worthy of a formal refusal  to his credit be it said that the thought of immediate revenge did not enter his mind then he might have subjected her then and there to deadly outragehe might have had her personal effects searched her person touched by the rough hands of his soldiers but though his estimate of a womans love was a low one it was not so base as to imagine that crystal de cambray would ever forgive so dastardly an insult  as she walked past him to the door however he said under his breath  remember mademoiselle that you and your family at this moment are absolutely in my power and that it is only because of my regard for you that i let you all now depart from here in peace  whether she heard or not he could not say certain it is that she made no reply nor did she turn toward him at all the light of the lanthorn lit up her delicate profile pale and drawn her tightly pressed lips the look of utter contempt in her eyes which even the fitful shadow cast by her hair over her brows could not altogether conceal  the comte had given what instructions he wished to pierre he stood by the carriage door waiting for his daughter no doubt he had heard what went on between her and de marmont and was content to leave her to deal what scorn was necessary for the humiliation of the traitor  he helped crystal into the carriage and also the unfortunate jeanne finally he too followed and pulled the door to behind him  victor did not wait to see the coach make a start he gave the order to remount  how far are we from st priest he asked  not eight kilomètres mon colonel was the reply  en avant then ventreàterre he commanded as he swung himself into the saddle  the great high road between grenoble and lyons is very wide and pierre had no need to draw his horses to one side as de marmont and his troop after much scrambling champing of bits and clanking of metal rode at a sharp trot past the coach and him  for some few moments the sound of the horses hoofs on the hard road kept the echoes of the night busy with their resonance but soon that sound grew fainter and fainter stillafter five minutes it died away altogether  m de comte put his head out of the window  eh bien pierre he called why dont we start  the postillion cracked his whip pierre shouted to his horses the heavy coach groaned and creaked and was once more on its way  in the interior no one spoke jeannes terror had melted in a silent flow of tears   lyons was reached shortly before midnight m le comtes carriage had some difficulty in entering the town as by orders of m le comte dartois it had already been placed in a state of defence against the possible advance of the band of pirates from corsica the bridge of la guillotière had been strongly barricaded and it took m le comte de cambray some little time to establish his identity before the officer in command of the post allowed him to proceed on his way  the town was fairly full owing to the presence of m le comte dartois who had taken up his quarters at the archiepiscopal palace and of his staff who were scattered in various houses about the town nevertheless m le comte and his family were fortunate enough in obtaining comfortable accommodation at the hotel bourbon  the party was very tired and after a light supper retired to bed  but not before m le comte de cambray had sent a special autographed message to monseigneur le comte dartois explaining to him under what tragic circumstances the sum of twentyfive million francs destined to reach his majesty the king had fallen into a common highwaymans hands and begging that a posse of cavalry be sent out on the road after the marauders and be placed under the orders of m le marquis de st genis who would be on the lookout for their arrival he begged that the posse should consist of not less than thirty men seeing that some armed followers of the corsican brigand were also somewhere on the way     chapter v  the rivals   i  the weather did not improve as the night wore on soon a thin cold drizzle added to the dreariness and to maurice de st genis evergrowing discomfort  he had started off gaily enough cheered by crystals warm look of encouragement and comforted by the feeling of certainty that he would get even with that mysterious enemy who had so impudently thrown himself athwart a plan which had service of the king for its sole object  maurice had not exchanged confidences with crystal since the adventure but his ideaswithout his knowing itabsolutely coincided with hers he too was quite sure that no common footpad had engineered their daring attack positive knowledge of the money and its destination had been the fountain from which had sprung the comedy of the masked highwayman and his little band of robbers maurice mentally reckoned that there must have been at least half a dozen of these bravosof the sort that in these times were easily enough hired in any big city to play any part from that of armed escort to nervous travellers to that of seeker of secret information for the benefit of either political partyloafers that hung round the wineshops in search of a means of earning a few days rations discharged soldiers of the empire some of them whose loyalty to the restoration had been questioned from the first  maurice had no doubt that whatever motive had actuated the originator of the bold plan to possess himself of twentyfive million francs he had deliberately set to work to employ men of that type to help him in his task  it had all been very audacious andmaurice was bound to admitvery well carried out as for the motive he was never for a moment in doubt it was a bonapartist plot of that he felt sure as well as of the fact that victor de marmont was the originator of it all he probably had not taken any active part in the attack but he had employed the menmaurice would have taken an oath on that  the comte de cambray must have let fall an unguarded hint in the course of his last interview with de marmont at brestalou and when victor went away disgraced and discomfited he no doubt thought to take his revenge in the way most calculated to injure both the comte and the royalist cause  satisfied with this mental explanation of past events st genis had ridden on in the darkness his spirits kept up with hopes and thoughts of a glaring counter revenge but his limbs were still stiff and bruised from the cramped position in which he had lain for so long and presently when the cold drizzle began to penetrate to his bones his enthusiasm and confidence dwindled the village seemed to recede further and further into the distance he thought when he had ridden through it earlier in the evening that it was not very far from the scene of the attacka dozen kilomètres perhapsnow it seemed more like thirty he thought too that it was a village of some considerable sizefive hundred souls or perhaps morehe had noticed as he rode through it a wellilluminated onestoried house and the words débit de vins and chambres pour voyageurs painted in bold characters above the front door but now he had ridden on and on along the dark road for what seemed endless hoursunconscious of time save that it was dragging on leadenfooted and wearisome    and still no light on ahead to betray the presence of human habitations no distant church bells to mark the progress of the night  at last in desperation maurice de st genis had thought of wrapping himself in his cloak and getting what rest he could by the roadside for he was getting very tired and saddlesore when on his left he perceived in the far distance glimmering through the mist two small lights like bright eyes shining in the darkness  what kind of a way led up to those welcome lights maurice had of course no idea but they proclaimed at any rate the presence of human beings of a house of the warmth of fire and without hesitation the young man turned his horses head at right angles from the road  he had crossed a couple of ploughed fields and an intervening ditch when in the distance to his right and behind him he heard the sound of horses at a brisk trot going in the direction of lyons  maurice drew rein for a moment and listened until the sound came nearer there must have been at least a score of mounted mena military patrol sent out by m le comte dartois no doubt and now on its way back to lyons just for a second or two the young man had thoughts of joining up with the party and asking their help or their escort he even gave a vigorous shout which however was lost in the clang and clatter of horses hoofs and of the accompanying jingle of metal  he turned his horse back the way he had come but before he had recrossed one of the ploughed fields the troop of mounted menwhatever they werehad passed by and maurice was left once more in solitude shouting and calling in vain  there was nothing for it then but to turn back again and to make his way as best he could toward those inviting lights in any case nothing could have been done in this pitchdark night against the highway thieves and st genis had no fear that m le comte dartois would fail to send him help for his expedition against them on the morrow  the lights on ahead were getting perceptibly nearer soon they detached themselves still more clearly in the gloomother lights appeared in the immediate neighbourhoodtoo few for a villagethought maurice and grouped closely together suggesting a main building surrounded by other smaller ones close by  soon the whole outline of the house could be traced through the enveloping darkness two of the windows were lighted from within and an oil lamp flickering feebly was fixed in a recess just above the door the welcome words chambres pour voyageurs aristide briot propriétaire greeted maurices wearied eyes as he drew rein good luck was apparently attending him for thus picking his way across fields he had evidently struck an outoftheway hostelry on some bridle path off the main road which was probably a short cut between chambéry and vienne  be that as it may he managed to dismountstiff as he wasand having tried the door and found it fastened he hammered against it with his boot  a few moments later the bolts were drawn and an elderly man in blue blouse and wide trousers his sabots stuffed with straw came shuffling out of the door  whos there he called in a feeble querulous voice  a travelleron horseback replied maurice come petit père he added more impatiently will you take my horse or call to one of your men  it is too late to take in travellers muttered the old man it is nearly midnight and everyone is abed except me  too late morbleu exclaimed the young man peremptorily you surely are not thinking of refusing shelter to a traveller on a night like this why how far is it to the nearest village  it is very late reiterated the old man plaintively and my house is quite full  theres a shakedown in the kitchen anyway ill warrant and one for my horse somewhere in an outhouse retorted maurice as without more ado he suddenly threw the reins into the old mans hand and unceremoniously pushed him into the house  the man appeared to hesitate for a moment or two he grumbled and muttered something which maurice did not hear and his shrewd eyesthe knowing eyes of a peasant of the dauphinétook a rapid survey of the belated travellers clothes the expensive caped coat the wellmade boots the fashionable hat which showed up clearly now by the light from within  satisfied that there could be no risk in taking in so welldressed a traveller feeling moreover that a good horse was always a hostage for the payment of the bill in the morning the man now without another word or look at his guest turned his back on the house and led the horse awaysomewhere out into the darknessmaurice did not take the trouble to ascertain where  he was under shelter there was the remnant of a woodfire in the hearth at the corner some benches along the walls if he could not get a bed he could certainly get rest and warmth for the night he put down his hat took off his coat and kicked the smouldering log into a blaze then he drew a chair close to the fire and held his numbed feet and hands to the pleasing warmth  thoughts of food and wine presented themselves too now that he felt a little less cold and stiff and he awaited the old mans return with eagerness and impatience  the shuffling of wooden sabots outside the door was a pleasing sound a moment or two later the old man had come back and was busying himself with once more bolting his front door  well now père briot said maurice cheerily as i take it you are the proprietor of this abode of bliss what about supper  bread and cheese if you like muttered the man curtly  and a bottle of wine of course  yes a bottle of wine  well be quick about it petit père i didnt know how hungry i was till you talked of bread and cheese  would you like some cold meat queried the man indifferently  of course i should have i not said that i was hungry  youll pay for it all right enough  ill pay for the supper before i stick a fork into it rejoined maurice impatiently but in heavens name hurry up man i am half dead with sleep as well as with hunger  the old mana real peasant of the dauphiné in his deliberate manner and shrewd instincts of cautiononce more shuffled out of the room and st genis lapsed into a kind of pleasant torpor as the warmth of the fire gradually crept through his sinews and loosened all his limbs while the anticipation of wine and food sent his wearied thoughts into a happy daydream  ten minutes later he was installed before a substantial supper and worthy aristide briot was equally satisfied with the two pieces of silver which st genis had readily tendered him  you said your house was full petit père said maurice after a while when the edge of his hunger had somewhat worn off i shouldnt have thought there were many travellers in this outoftheway place  the place is not outoftheway retorted the old man gruffly the road is a good one and a short cut between vienne and chambéry we get plenty of travellers this way  well i did not strike the road unfortunately i saw your lights in the distance and cut across some fields it was pretty rough in the dark i can tell you  thats just what those other cavaliers said when they turned up here about an hour ago a noisy crowd they were i had no room for them in my house so they had to go  st genis at once put down his knife and fork  a noisy crowd of travellers he exclaimed who arrived here an hour ago  parbleu rejoined the other and all wanting beds too i had no room i can only put up one or two travellers i sent them on to levasseurs further along the road only the wounded man i could not turn away he is up in our best bedroom  a wounded man you have a wounded man here petit père  oh its not much of a wound explained the old man with unconscious irrelevance he himself calls it a mere scratch but my old woman took a fancy to him he is young and welllooking you understand    she is clever at bandages too so she has looked after him as if he were her own son  mechanically st genis had once more taken up his knife and fork though of a truth the last of his hunger had vanished but these dauphiné peasants were suspicious and queertempered and already the young mans surprise had matured into a plan which he would not be able to carry through without the help of aristide briot noisy cavaliershe mused to himselfa wounded man    wounded by the stray shot aimed at him by crystal de cambray indeed st genis had much ado to keep his excitement in check and to continue with a pretence at eating while briot watched him with stolid indifference  petit père said the young man at last with as much unconcern as he could affect i have been thinking that you haveunwittinglygiven me an excellent piece of news i do believe that the man in your best bedroom upstairs is a friend of mine whom i was to have met at lyons today and whose absence from our place of tryst had made me very anxious i was imagining that all sorts of horrors had happened to him for he is in the secret service of the king and exposed to every kind of danger his being wounded in some skirmish either with highway robbers or with a band of the corsicans pirates would not surprise me in the least and the fact that he had some halfdozen mounted men with him confirms me in my belief that indeed it is my friend who is lying upstairs as he often has to have an escort in the exercise of his duties at any rate petit père he concluded as he rose from the table by your leave ill go up and ascertain  while he rattled off these pretty proceeds of his own imagination maurice de st genis kept a sharp watch on aristide briots face ready to note the slightest sign of suspicion should it creep into the old mans shrewd eyes  briot however did not exhibit any violent interest in his guests story and when the latter had finished speaking he merely said pointing to the remnants of food upon the table  i thought you said that you were hungry  so i was petit père rejoined maurice impatiently so i was but my hunger is not so great as it was and before i eat another morsel i must satisfy myself that it is my friend who is safe and well in your old womans care  oh he is well enough grunted briot and you can see him in the morning  that i cannot for i shall have to leave here soon after dawn and i could not get a wink of sleep whilst i am in such a state of uncertainty about my friend  but you cant go and wake him now he is asleep for sure and my old woman wouldnt like him to be disturbed after all the care she has given him  st genis fretting with impatience could have cursed aloud or shaken the obstinate old peasant roughly by the shoulders  i shouldnt wake him he retorted irritated beyond measure at the mans futile opposition ill go up on tiptoe candle in handyou shall show me the way to his roomand ill just ascertain whether the wounded man is my friend or not then ill come down again quietly and finish my supper  come petit père i insist he added more peremptorily seeing that briotwith the hesitancy peculiar to his kindstill made no movement to obey but stood close by scratching his scanty locks and looking puzzled and anxious  fortunately for him maurice understood the temperament of these peasants of the dauphiné he knew that with their curious hesitancy and inherent suspiciousness it was always the easiest to make up their minds for them  so nowsince he was absolutely determined to come to grips with that abominable thief upstairs before the night was many minutes olderhe ceased to parley with briot  a candle stood close to his hand on the table a bit of kindling wood lay in a heap in one corner with the help of the one he lighted the other then candle in hand he walked up to the door  show me the way petit père he said  and aristide briot with a shrug of the shoulders which implied that he there and then put away from him any responsibility for what might or might not occur after this and without further comment led the way upstairs   ii  on the upper landing at the top of the stairs briot paused he pointed to a door at the end of the narrow corridor and said curtly  thats his room  i thank you petit père whispered st genis in response dont wait for me ill be back directly  he is not yet in bed was briots dry comment  a thin streak of light showed underneath the door as st genis walked rapidly toward it he wondered if the door would be locked that certainly was a contingency which had not occurred to him his design was to surprise a wounded and helpless thief in his sleep and to force him then and there to give up the stolen money before he had time to call for help  but the miscreant was evidently on the watch briot still lingered on the top of the stairs there were other people sleeping in the house and st genis suddenly realised that his purpose would not be quite so easy of execution as he had hotheadedly supposed  but the end in view was great and st genis was not a man easily deterred from a set purpose there was the royalist cause to aid and crystal to be won if he were successful  he knocked resolutely at the door then tried the latch the door was locked but even as the young man hesitated for a moment wondering what he would do next a firm step resounded on the floor on the other side of the partition and the next moment the door was opened from within and a peremptory voice issued the usual challenge  who goes there  a tall figure appeared as a massive silhouette under the lintel st genis had the candle in his hand he dropped it in his astonishment  mr clyffurde he exclaimed  at sight of st genis the englishman whose right arm was in a sling had made a quick instinctive movement back into the room but equally quickly maurice had forestalled him by placing his foot across the threshold  then he turned back to aristide briot  thats all right petit père he called out airily it is indeed my friend just as i thought im going to stay and have a little chat with him dont wait up for me when he is tired of my company ill go back to the parlour and make myself happy in front of the fire goodnight  as clyffurde no longer stood in the doorway st genis walked straight into the room and closed the door behind him leaving good old aristide to draw what conclusions he chose from the eccentric behaviour of his nocturnal visitors  with a rapid and wrathful gaze st genis at once took stock of everything in the room a sigh of satisfaction rose to his lips at any rate the rogue could not deny his guilt there hanging on a peg was the caped coat which he had worn and there on the table were two damning proofs of his villainya pair of pistols and a black mask  the whole situation puzzled him more than he could say certainly after the first shock of surprise he had felt his wrath growing hotter and hotter every moment the other mans cool assurance helped further to irritate his nerves and to make him lose that selfcontrol which would have been of priceless value in this unlookedfor situation  seeing that maurice de st genis was absolutely speechless with surprise as well as with anger there crept into clyffurdes deepset grey eyes a strange look of amusement as if the humour of his present position was more obvious than its shame  and what he asked pleasantly has procured me the honour at this late hour of a visit from m le marquis de st genis  his words broke the spell there was no longer any mystery in the situation the condemnatory pieces of evidence were there clyffurdes connection with de marmont was well knownthe plot had become obvious here was an english adventureran alien spywho had obviously been paid to do this dirty work for the usurper andas maurice now concluded airilyhe must be made to give up the money which he had stolen before he be handed over to the military authorities at lyons and shot as a spy or a thiefmaurice didnt care which the whole thing was turning out far simpler and easier than he had dared to hope  you know quite well why i am here he now said roughly of a truth for the moment i was taken by surprise for i had not thought that a man who had been honoured by the friendship of m le comte de cambray and of his family was a thief as well as a spy  and now said clyffurde still smiling and apparently quite unperturbed that you have been enlightened on this subject to your own satisfaction may i ask what you intend to do  force you to give up what you have stolen you impudent thief retorted the other savagely  and how are you proposing to do that m de st genis asked the englishman with perfect equanimity  like this cried maurice whose exasperation and fury had increased every moment as the other mans assurance waxed more insolent and more cool  like this he cried again as he sprang at his enemys throat  a past master in the art of selfdefence clyffurdedespite his wounded armwas ready for the attack with his left on guard he not only received the brunt of the onslaught but parried it most effectually with a quick blow against his assailants jaw  st genisstunned by this forcible contact with a set of exceedingly hard knucklesfell back a step or two his foot struck against some object on the floor he lost his balance and measured his length backwards across the bed  you abominable thief    you    he cried choking with rage and with discomfiture as he tried to struggle to his feet  but this he at once found that he could not do seeing that a pair of firm and muscular knees were gripping and imprisoning his legs even while that same allpowerful left hand with the hard knuckles had an unpleasant hold on his throat  i should have tried some other method m de st genis had i been in your shoes came in irritatingly sarcastic accents from his calm antagonist  indeed the insolent rogue did not appear in the least overwhelmed by the enormity of his crime or by the disgrace of being so ignominiously found out from his precarious position across the bed st genis had a good view of the rascals finely knit figure of his earnest face now softened by a smile full of kindly humour and goodnatured contempt  an impartial observer viewing the situation would certainly have thought that here was an impudent villain vanquished and lying on his back whilst being admonished for his crimes by a just man who had might as well as right on his side  let me go you confounded thief st genis cried as soon as the unpleasant grip on his throat had momentarily relaxed you accursed spy    you     easy easy my young friend said the other calmly you have called me a thief quite often enough to satisfy your rage and further epithets might upset my temper  let go my throat  i will in a moment or two as soon as i have made up my mind what i am going to do with you my impetuous young friendwhether i shall truss you like a fowl and put you in charge of our worthy host as guilty of assaulting one of his guests or whether i shall do you some trifling injury to punish you for trying to do me a grave one  right is on my side said st genis doggedly i do not care what you do to me  right is apparently on your side my friend ill not deny it therefore i still hesitate  like a rogue and a vagabond at dead of night you attacked and robbed those who have never shown you anything but kindness  until the hour when they turned me out of their house like a dishonest lacquey without allowing me a word of explanation  then this is your idea of vengeance is it mr clyffurde  yes m de st genis it is but not quite in the manner that you suppose i am going to set you free now in order to set your mind at rest but let me warn you that i shall be just as much on the alert against another attack from you as ever i was before and that i could ward off two or even three assailants with my left arm and knee as easily as i warded off one it is a way we have in england  he relaxed his hold on maurices legs and throat and the young manfretting and fuming wild with impotent wrath and with mortificationstruggled to his feet  are you proposing to give me some explanation to mitigate your crime he said roughly if so let me tell you that i will accept none putting the question aside of your abominable theft you have committed an outrage against people whom i honour and against the woman whom i love  nor do i propose to give you any explanation m de st genis retorted clyffurde who still spoke quite quietly and evenly but for the sake of your own peace of mind which you will i hope communicate to the people whom you honour i will tell you a few simple facts  neither of the men sat down they stood facing one another now across the table whereon stood a couple of tallow candles which threw fitful yellow lights on their facesso different so strangely contrastedyoung and welllooking bothboth strongly moved by passion yet one entirely selfcontrolled while in the others eyes that passion glowed fierce and resentful  i listen said st genis curtly  and clyffurde began after a slight pause at the time that you fell upon me with such illconsidered vigour m de st genis he said did you know that but for my abominable outrage upon the persons whom you honour the money which they would gladly have guarded with their life would have fallen into the hands of bonapartes agents  in theirs or yours what matters retorted st genis savagely since his majesty is deprived of it now  that is where you are mistaken my young friend said the other quietly his majesty is more sure of getting the money now than he was when m le comte de cambray with his family and yourself started on that quixotic if illconsidered errand this morning  st genis frowned in puzzlement  i dont understand you he said curtly  isnt it simple enough you and your friends credited me with friendship for de marmont he is hotheaded and impetuous and words rush out of his mouth that he should keep to himself i knew from himself that bonaparte had charged him to recover the twentyfive millions which m le préfet fourier had placed in the comte de cambrays charge  why did you not warn the comte then queried st genis who still mistrustful glowered at his antagonist  would he have listened to me think you asked the other with a quiet smile remember he had turned me out of his house two nights before without a word of courtesy or regreton the mere suspicion of my intercourse with de marmont were you too full with your own rage to notice what happened then mlle crystal drew away her skirts from me as if i were a leper what credence would they have given my words would the comte even have admitted me into his presence  and so    you planned this robbery    you    stammered st genis whose astonishment and puzzlement were rendering him as speechless as his rage had done ill not believe it he continued more firmly you are fooling me now that i have found you out  why should i do that you are in my hands and not i in yours bonaparte is victorious at grenoble i could take the money to him and earn his gratitude or use the money for mine own ends what have i to fear from you what cause to fool you your opinion of me m le comtes contempt or goodwill bah after tonight are we likely to meet again  st genis said nothing in reply of a truth there was nothing that he could say the englishmans whole attitude bore the impress of truth even through that still seething wrath which refused to be appeased st genis felt that the other was speaking the truth his mind now was in turmoil of wonderment this man who stood here before him had done something which hest geniscould not comprehend vaguely he realised that beneath the mans actions there still lay a yet deeper foundation of dignity and of heroism and one which perhaps would never be wholly fathomed  it was clyffurde who at last broke the silence between them  you m de st genis he said lightly would under like circumstances have acted just as i did i am sure the whole idea was so easy of execution half a dozen loafers to aid me the part of highwayman to playan old man and two or three defenceless womenmy part was not heroic i admit he added with a smile but it has served its purpose the money is safe in my keeping now within a few days his majesty the king of france shall have it and all those who strive to serve him loyally can rest satisfied  i confess i dont understand you said st genis as he seemed to shake himself free from some unexplainable spell that held him you have rendered us and the legitimate cause of france a signal service why did you do it  you forget m de st genis that the legitimate cause of france is englands cause as well  are you a servant of your country then i thought you were a tradesman engaged in buying gloves  clyffurde smiled so i am he said but even a tradesman may serve his country if he has the opportunity  i hope that your country will be duly grateful said maurice with a sigh i know that every royalist in france would thank you if they knew  by your leave m de st genis no one in france need know anything but what you choose to tell them     you mean     that except for reassuring m le comte de cambray and    and mlle crystal there is no reason why they should ever know what passed between us in this room tonight  but if the king is to have the money he     he will never know from me from whence it comes  he will wish to know     come m de st genis broke in clyffurde with a slight hint of impatience is it for me to tell you that great britain has more than one agent in france these daysthat the money will reach his majesty the king ultimately through the hands of his foreign minister m le comte de jaucourt    and that my name will never appear in connection with the matter    i am a mere servant of great britaindoing my duty where i can    nothing more  you mean that you are in the british secret service nowell i dont profess to understand you english people and you seem to me more incomprehensible than any i have known not that i ever believed that you were a mere tradesman but what shall i say to m le comte de cambray he added after a slight pause during which a new and strange train of thought altered the expression of wonderment on his face to one that was undefinable almost furtive certainly undecided  all you need say to m le comte replied clyffurde with a slight tone of impatience is that you are personally satisfied that the money will reach his majestys hand safely and in due course at least i presume that you are satisfied m de st genis he continued vaguely wondering what was going on in the young frenchmans brain  yes yes of course i am satisfied murmured the other but     but what  mlle crystal would want to know something more than that she will ask me questions    she    she will insist    i had promised her to get the money back myself    she will expect an explanation    she     he continued to murmur these short jerky sentences almost inaudibly avoiding the while to meet the enquiring and puzzled gaze of the englishman  when he pausedstill murmuring but quite inaudibly nowclyffurde made no comment and once more there fell a silence over the narrow room the candles flickered feebly and bobby picked up the metal snuffers from the table and with a steady and deliberate hand set to work to trim the wicks  so absorbed did he seem in this occupation that he took no notice of st genis who with arms crossed in front of him was pacing up and down the narrow room a heavy frown between his deepset eyes   iii  somewhere in the house down below an oldfashioned clock had just struck two clyffurde looked up from his absorbing task  it is late he remarked casually shall we say goodnight m de st genis  the sound of the englishmans voice seemed to startle maurice out of his reverie he pulled himself together walked firmly up to the table and resting his hand upon it he faced the other man with a sudden gaze made up partly of suddenly conceived resolve and partly of lingering shamefacedness  mr clyffurde he began abruptly  yes  have you any cause to hate me  why no replied clyffurde with his habitual goodhumoured smile why should i have  have you any cause to hate mlle crystal de cambray  certainly not  you have no desire insisted maurice to be revenged on her for the slight which she put upon you the other night  his voice had grown more steady and his look more determined as he put these rapid questions to clyffurde whose expressive face showed no sign of any feeling in response save that of complete and indifferent puzzlement  i have no desire with regard to mlle de cambray replied bobby quietly save that of serving her if it be in my power  you can serve her sir retorted maurice firmly and that right nobly you can render the whole of her future life happy beyond what she herself has ever dared to hope  how  maurice paused once more with a gesture habitual to him he crossed his arms over his chest and resumed his restless march up and down the narrow room  then again he stood still and again faced the englishman his dark enquiring eyes seeming to probe the latters deepest thoughts  did you know mr clyffurde he asked slowly that mlle crystal de cambray honours me with her love  yes i knew that replied the other quietly  and i love her with my heart and soul continued maurice impetuously oh i cannot tell you what we have sufferedshe and iwhen the exigencies of her position and the will of her father parted usseemingly for ever her heart was broken and so was mine and i endured the tortures of hell when i realised at last that she was lost to me for ever and that her exquisite personher beautiful soulwere destined for the delight of that lowborn traitor victor de marmont  he drew breath for he had half exhausted himself with the volubility and vehemence of his diction also he seemed to be waiting for some encouragement from clyffurde who however gave him none but sat unmoved and apparently supremely indifferent while a suffering heart was pouring out its wails of agony into his unresponsive ear  the reason resumed st genis somewhat more calmly why m le comte de cambray was opposed to our union was purely a financial one our families are of equal distinction and antiquity but alas our fortunes are also of equal precariousness we sir of the old noblesse gave up our all in order to follow our king into exile victor de marmont was rich his fortune could have repurchased the ancient cambray estates and restored to that honoured name all the brilliance which it had sacrificed for its principles  still clyffurde remained irritatingly silent and st genis asked him somewhat tartly  i trust i am making myself clear sir  perfectly so far replied the other quietly but i am afraid i dont quite see how you propose that i could serve mlle crystal in all this  you can with one word one generous action sir put me in a position to claim crystal as my wife and give her that happiness which she craves for and which is rightly her due  a slight lifting of the eyebrows was clyffurdes only comment  mr clyffurde now said maurice with the obvious firm resolve to end his own hesitancy at last you say yourself that by taking this money to his majesty or rather to his minister you individually will get neither glory nor even gratitudeyour name will not appear in the transaction at all i am quoting your own words remember that is so is it not  it is socertainly  but sir if a frenchmana royalistwere able to render his king so signal a service he would not only gain gratitude but recognition and glory    a man who was poor and obscure would at once become rich and distinguished     and in a position to marry the woman he loved concluded bobby smiling  then as maurice said nothing but continued to regard him with glowing anxious eyes he added smiling not altogether kindly this time  i think i understand m de st genis  and    what do you say queried the other excitedly  let me make the situation clear first as i understand it monsieur continued bobby drily you areand i mistake notsuggesting at the present moment that i should hand over the twentyfive millions to you in order that you should take them yourself to the king in paris and by this act obtain not only favours from him but probably a goodly share of the money which youpresumablywill have forced some unknown highwayman to give up to you is that it  it was not money for myself i thought of sir murmured st genis somewhat shamefacedly  no no of course not rejoined clyffurde with a tone of sarcasm quite foreign to his usual easygoing goodnature you were thinking of the kings favours and of a future of distinction and glory  i was thinking chiefly of crystal sir said the other haughtily  quite so you were thinking of winning mlle crystal by a    a subterfuge  an innocent one sir you will admit i should not be robbing you in any way and remember that it is only crystals hand that is denied me her love i have already won  a look of painquickly suppressed and easily hidden from the others selfabsorbed gazecrossed the englishmans earnest face  i do remember that monsieur he said else i certainly would never lend a hand in the    subterfuge  you will do it then queried the other eagerly  i have not said so  ah but you will pleaded maurice hotly sir the eternal gratitude of two faithful hearts would be yours alwaysfor crystal will know it all once we are married i promise you that she will and in the midst of her happiness she will find time to bless your generosity and your selflessness    whilst i     enough i beg of you m de st genis broke in clyffurde now with angry impatience believe me i do not hug myself with any thought of my own virtues nor do i desire any gratitude from you if i hand over the money to you it is sorely against my better judgment and distinctly against my duty but since that duty chiefly lies in being assured that the king of france will receive the money safely why then by handing it over to you i have that assurance and my conscience will rest at comparative ease you shall have the money sir and you shall marry mlle crystal on the strength of the kings gratitude towards you and mlle crystal will be happyif you keep silence over this transaction but for gods sake lets say no more about it for of a truth you and i are playing but a sorry rôle this night  a sorry rôle protested the other  yes a sorry rôle are you not deceiving a woman am i not running counter to my duty  i but deceive crystal temporarily i love her and only deceive in order to win her the end justifies the means nor do you in my opinion run counter to your duty     but clyffurde interrupted him roughly i pray you sir make no comment on mine actions my own silent comments on these are hard enough to bear your eulogies would raise bounds to my patience  whereupon he walked quickly up to the bed and from under the mattress extricated five leather wallets which he threw one by one upon the table  here is the kings money he said curtly you could never have taken it from me by force but i give it over to you willingly now if within a week from now i hear that the king has not received it i will proclaim you a liar and a thief  sir    you dare     nay well not quarrel i dont want to do you any hurt you know from experience that i could kill you or wring your neck as easily as you could kill a child but mlle crystals love is like a protecting shield all round you so ill not touch you again but dont ask me to measure my words for that is beyond my power take the money m de st genis and earn not only the kings gratitude but also mlle crystals which is far better worth having and now i pray you leave me to rest you must be tired too and our mutual company hath become irksome to us both  he turned his back on st genis and sat down at the table drawing paper pen and inkhorn toward him and with clumsy left hand began laboriously to form written characters as if st genis presence or departure no longer concerned him  an importunate beggar could not have been more humiliatingly dismissed st genis had flushed to the very roots of his hair he would have given much to be able to chastise the insolent englishman then and there but the latter had not boasted when he said that he could wring maurices neck as easily with his left hand as with his right and maurice within his heart was bound to own that the boast was no idle one he knew that in a handtohand fight he was no match for that heavyframed hardfisted product of a fogridden land  he would not trust himself to speak any more lest another word cause prudence to yield to exasperation another moment of hesitation a shrug of the shouldersperhaps a muttered curse or twoand st genis picked up one by one the wallets from the table  clyffurde never looked up while he did so he continued to form awkward illegible characters upon the paper before him as if his very life depended on being able to write with his left hand  the next moment st genis had walked rapidly out of the room bobby left off writing threw down his pen and resting his elbow upon the table and his head in his hand he remained silent and motionless while st genis quick and firm footsteps echoed first along the corridor then down the creaking stairs and finally on the floor below after which there came the sound of the opening and shutting of a door the dragging of a chair across a wooden floor and nothing more  all was still in the house at last the oldfashioned clock downstairs struck halfpast two  with a smothered cry of angry contempt clyffurde seized on the papers that lay scattered on the table and crushed them up in his hand with a gesture of passionate wrath  then he strode up to the window threw open the rickety casement and let the pure cold air of night pour into the room and dissipate the atmosphere of cowardice of falsehood and of unworthy love that still seemed to hang there where m le marquis de st genis had basely bargained for his own ends and outraged the very name of love by planning base deeds in its name     chapter vi  the crime   i  victor de marmont had spent that same night in wearisome agitation his mortification and disappointment would not allow him to rest  he had brought his squad of cavalry up as far as st priest which lies a little off the main road about halfway between lyons and the scene of de marmonts late discomfiture here he and his men had spent the night only to make a fresh start early the next morningback for grenobleseeing that m le comte dartois with thirty or forty thousand troops was even now at lyons  when an hour after leaving st priest the little troop came upon a solitary horseman riding a heavy carriage horse with a postillions bridle de marmont at first had no other thought save that of malicious pleasure at recognising the man whom just now he hated more cordially than any other man in the world  m de st genisfor indeed it was hewas peremptorily challenged and questioned and his wrath and impotent attempts at arrogance greatly delighted de marmont  to make oneself actively unpleasant to a rival is apt to be a very pleasurable sensation victor had an exceedingly disagreeable halfhour to avenge and to declare st genis a prisoner of war to order his removal to grenoble pending the emperors pleasure to command him to be silent when he desired to speak was so much soothing balsam spread upon the wounds which his own pride had suffered at brestalou last sunday eve  it was not until a casual remark from the sergeant under his command caused him to notice the bulging pockets of st genis coat that victor thought to give the order to search the prisoner  the latter entered a vigorous protest he fought and he threatened he promised de marmont the hangmans rope and his men terrible reprisals but of course he was fighting a losing battle he was alone against five and twenty his first attempt at getting hold of the pistols in his belt was met with a threat of summary execution he was dragged out of the saddle his arms were forced behind his back while rough hands turned out the precious contents of his coatpockets all that he could do was to curse fate which had brought these pirates on his way and his own shortsightedness and impatience in not waiting for the armed patrol which undoubtedly would have been sent out to him from lyons in response to m le comte de cambrays request  now he had the deadly chagrin and bitter disappointment of seeing the money which he had wrested from clyffurde last night at the price of so much humiliation transferred to the pockets of a real thief and spoliator who would either keep it for himself orwhat in the enthusiastic royalists eyes would be even worseplace it at the service of the corsican usurper he could hardly believe in the reality of his ill luck so appalling was it in one moment he saw all the hopes of which he had dreamed last night fly beyond recall he had lost crystal more effectually more completely than he ever had done before if the englishman ever spoke of what had occurred last night    if crystal ever knew that he had been fool enough to lose the treasure which had been in his possession for a few hoursher contempt would crush the love which she had for him nor would the comte de cambray ever relent  de marmonts triumph too was hard to bear his clumsy irony was terribly galling  would m le marquis de st genis care to continue his journey to lyons now would he prefer not to go to grenoble  st genis bit his tongue with the determination to remain silent  m de st genis is free to go whither he chooses  the permission was not even welcome maurice would as lief be taken prisoner and dragged back to grenoble as face crystal with the story of his failure  quite mechanically he remounted and pulled his horse to one side while de marmont ordered his little squad to form once more and after the brief word of command and a final sarcastic farewell galloped off up the road back toward lyons at the head of his men not waiting to see if st genis came his way too or not  the latter with wearied aching eyes gazed after the fast disappearing troop until they became a mere speck on the long straight road and the distant morning mist finally swallowed them up  then he too turned his horses head in the same direction back toward lyons once more and allowing the reins to hang loosely in his hand and letting his horse pick its own slow way along the road he gave himself over to the gloominess of his own thoughts   ii  he too had some difficulty in entering the town m le duc dorléans cousin of the king had just arrived to support m le comte dartois and together these two royal princes had framed and posted up a proclamation to the brave lyonese of the national guard  the whole city was in a turmoil for m le duc dorléanswho was nothing if not practicalhad at once declared that there was not the slightest chance of a successful defence of lyons and that by far the best thing to do would be to withdraw the troops while they were still loyal  m le comte dartois protested at any rate he wouldnt do anything so drastic till after the arrival of marshal macdonald to whom he had sent an urgent courier the day before enjoining him to come to lyons without delay in the meanwhile he and his royal cousin did all they could to kindle or at any rate to keep up the loyalty of the troops but defection was already in the air here and there the men had been seen to throw their white cockades into the mud and more than one cry of vive lempereur had risen even while monsieur himself was reviewing the national guard on the place bellecour  the bridge of la guillotière was stoutly barricaded but as st genis waited out in the open road while his name was being taken to the officer in command he saw crowds of people standing or walking up and down on the opposite bank of the river  they were waiting for the emperor the news of whose approach was filling the townspeople with glee  heartsick and wretched st genis after several hours of weary waiting did ultimately obtain permission to enter the city by the ferry on the south side of the city once inside lyons he had no difficulty in ascertaining where such a distinguished gentleman as m le comte de cambray had put up for the night and he promptly made his way to the hotel bourbon his mind at this stage still a complete blank as to how he would explain his discomfiture to the comte and to crystal  in the present state of m le comte dartois difficulties the money would have been thrice welcome and st genis felt the load of failure weighing thrice as heavily on his soul and dreaded the reproachesmute or outspokenwhich he knew awaited him if only he could have thought of something something plausible and not too inglorious there was of course the possibility that he had failed to come upon the track of the thieves at allbut then he had no business to come back so soonand he didnt want to come back only that there was always the likelihood of the englishman speaking of what had occurrednot necessarily with evil intent    but    some words of his if within a week i hear that the king of france has not received this money i will proclaim you a liar and a thief rang unpleasantly in st genis ears  the young mans mind i repeat was at this point still a blank as to what explanation he would give to the comte de cambray of his own miserable failure  he was returningafter an ardent promise to overtake the thief and to force him to give up the moneywithout apparently having made any effort in that directionor having made the effort failing signally and ignominiouslya foolish and unheroic position in either case  to tell the whole unvarnished truth his interview with clyffurde and his thoughtlessness in wandering along the road all alone laden with twentyfive million francs not waiting for the arrival of m le comte dartois patrol was unthinkable  then what st genis determined not to tell the truth found it a difficult task to concoct a story that would be plausible and at the same time redound to his credit his disappointment was so bitter now his hopes of winning crystal and glory had been so bright that he found it quite impossible to go back to the hard facts of lifeto his own poverty and the unattainableness of crystal de cambraywithout making a great effort to win back what victor de marmont had just wrested from him  through the whirl of his thoughts too there was a vague sense of resentment against clyffurdecoupled with an equally vague sense of fear he maurice might easily keep silent over the transaction of last night but clyffurde might not feel inclined to do so he would want to know sooner or later what had become of the money    had he not uttered a threat which made maurices cheeks even now flush with wrath and shame  certain words and gestures of the englishman had stood out before maurices mind in a way that had stirred up those latent jealousies which always lurk in the heart of an unsuccessful wooer clyffurde had been generousblind to his own interestsready to sacrifice what recognition he had earned he had spared his assailant and agreed to an unworthy subterfuge and st genis tormented brain began to wonder why he had done all this  was it for love of crystal de cambray  st genis would not allow himself to answer that question for he felt that if he did he would hate that hardfisted englishman more thoroughly than he had ever hated any man beforenot excepting de marmont de marmont was an evil and vile traitor who never could cross crystals path of life again    but not so the englishman who had planned to serve her and who would have succeeded so magnificently but for hismauricesinterference  if this explanation of clyffurdes strangely magnanimous conduct was the true one then indeed st genis felt that he would have everything to fear from him for indeed was it so very unlikely that the englishman was throughout acting in collusion with victor de marmont who was known to be his friend  was it so very unlikely thatseeing himself unmaskedhe had found a sure and rapid way of allowing the money to pass through st genis hands into those of de marmont and at the same time hopelessly humiliating and discrediting his rival in the affections of mlle de cambray  that the suggestion of handing the money over to him had come originally from maurice de st genis himself the young man did not trouble himself to remember the more he thought this new explanation of past events over the more plausible did it seem and the more likely of acceptance by m le comte de cambray and by crystal and st genis at last saw his way to appearing before them not only zealous but heroiceven if unfortunateand it was with a much lightened heart that he finally drew rein outside the hotel bourbon   iii  m le comte de cambray it seems was staying at the hotel for a few days so the proprietor informed m de st genis m le comte had gone out but mme la duchesse dagen was upstairs with mlle de cambray  with somewhat uncertain step st genis followed the obsequious proprietor who had insisted on conducting m le marquis to the ladies apartments himself they occupied a suite of rooms on the first floor and after a timid knock at the door it was opened by jeanne from within and maurice found himself in the presence of crystal and of the duchesse and obliged at once to enter upon the explanation which with their first cry of surprise they already asked of him  well exclaimed crystal eagerly what news  of the money murmured maurice vaguely who above all things was anxious to gain time  yes the kings money rejoined the girl with slight impatience have you tracked the thieves do you know where they are is there any hope of catching them  none i am afraid he replied firmly  crystal gave a cry of bitter disappointment and reproach then maurice she exclaimed almost involuntarily why are you here  and mme la duchesse folding her mittened hands before her seemed mutely to be asking the same question  but did you come upon the thieves at all continued crystal with eager volubility where did they go to for the night you must have come on some traces of their passage oh she added vehemently you ought not to have deserted your post like this  what could i do he murmured i was all alone    against so many     you said that you would get on the track of the thieves she urged and father told you that he would speak with m le comte dartois as soon as possible monsieur has promised that an armed patrol would be sent out to you and would be on the lookout for you on the road  an armed patrol would be no use i came back on purpose to stop one being sent  but why in heavens name exclaimed the duchesse  because a troop of deserters with that traitor victor de marmont is scouring the road and     we know that said crystal we were stopped by them last night after you left us they were after the money for the usurper who had sent them and i thanked god that twentyfive millions had enriched a common thief rather than the corsican brigand  surely maurice said the duchesse with her usual tartness you were not fool enough to allow the kings money to fall into that abominable de marmonts hands  how could i help it now exclaimed the young man as if driven to the extremity of despair the whole thing was a huge plot beyond one mans power to cope with i tracked the thieves he continued with vehemence as eager as crystals i tracked them to a lonely hostelry off the beaten trackat dead of nighta den of cutthroats and conspirators i tracked the thief to his lair and forced him to give the money up to me  you forced him    oh how splendid cried crystal but then     ah then there was the hideousness of the plot the thief feeling himself unmasked gave up his stolen booty i forced him to his knees and five wallets containing twentyfive million francs were safely in my pockets at last  you forced himhow splendid reiterated crystal whose glowing eyes were fixed upon maurice with all the admiration which she felt  yes that money was in my pocket for the rest of the happy night but the abominable thief knew well that his friend victor de marmont was on the road with five and twenty armed deserters in the pay of the corsican brigand hardly had i left the hostelry and found my way back to the main road when i was surrounded assailed searched and robbed i repeat continued st genis warming to his own narrative what could i do alone against so manythe thief and his hirelings i managed successfully but with the money once in my possession i could not risk staying an hour longer than i could help in that den of cutthroats but they were in league with de marmont and though i would have guarded the kings money with my life it was filched from me ere i could draw a single weapon in its defence  he had sunk in a chair half exhausted with the effort of his own eloquence and now with elbows resting on his knees and head buried in his hands he looked the picture of heroic misery  crystal said nothing for a while there was a deep frown of puzzlement between her eyes  maurice she said resolutely at last you said just now that the thief was in collusion with his friend de marmont what did you mean by that  i would rather that you guessed what i meant crystal replied maurice without looking up at her  you mean    that    she began slowly  that it was mr clyffurde our english friend broke in madame tartly who robbed us on the broad highway i suspected it all along  you suspected it ma tante and said nothing asked the girl who obviously had not taken in the full significance of maurices statement  i said absolutely nothing replied madame decisively firstly because i did not think that i would be doing any good by putting my own surmises into my brothers head and secondly because i must confess that i thought that nice young englishman had acted pour le bon motif  how could you think that ma tante ejaculated crystal hotly a good motive to rob us at dead of nighthe a friend of victor de marmontan adherent of the corsican     englishmen are not adherents of the corsican my dear retorted madame drily and until maurices appearance this morning i was satisfied that the money would ultimately reach his majestys own hands  but we were taking the money to his majesty ourselves  and victor de marmont was after it mr clyffurde may have known that    remember my dear continued madame that these were my impressions last night maurices account of the den of cutthroats has modified these entirely  again crystal was silent the frown had darkened on her face there was a line of bitter resentment round her lipsa look of contempt of hate of a desire to hurt in her eyes  maurice she said abruptly at last  yes  i did wound that thief did i not  yes in the shoulder    it gave me a slight advantage    he said with affected modesty  i am glad and you    you were able to punish him too i hope  yes i punished him  he was watching her very closely for inwardly he had been wondering how she had taken his news she was strangely agitated so maurices troubled jealous heart told him her face was flushed her eyes were wet and a tiny lace handkerchief which she twisted between her fingers was nothing but a damp rag  oh i hate him i hate him she murmured as with an impatient gesture she brushed the gathering tears from her eyes father had been so kind to himso were we all how could he how could he  his duty i suppose said st genis magnanimously  his duty she retorted scornfully  to the cause which he served  duty to a usurper a brigand the enemy of his country was he then paid to serve the corsican  probably  his being in tradebuying gloves at grenoblewas all a plant then  i am afraid so said st genis who much against his will now was sinking ever deeper and deeper in the quagmire of lying and cowardice into which he had allowed himself to drift  and he was nothing better than a spy  no one not even crystal herself could have defined with what feelings she said this was it solely contempt or did a strange mixture of regret and sorrow mingle with the scorn which she felt swiftly her thoughts had flown back to that sunday eveninga very few days agowhen the course of her destiny was so suddenly changed once more when her marriage with a man whom she could never love was broken off when the possibilities once more rose upon the horizon of her life of a renewed existence of poverty and exile in the wake of a dispossessed king  that same evening a man whom she had hardly noticed beforea man neither of her own nationality nor of her own castethis same englishman clyffurde had entered into her lifenot violently or aggressively but just with a few words of intense sympathy and with a genuine offer of friendship and she somehow despite much kindness which encompassed her always had felt cheered and warmed by his words and a strange and sweet sense of security against hurt and sorrow had entered her heart as she listened to them  and now she knew that all that was falsefalse his sympathy false his offers of friendshiphis words were false his handgrasp false treachery lurked behind that kindly look in his eyes and falsehood beneath his smile  he was nothing better than a spy the sting of that thought hurt her more than she could have thought possible she had so few real friends and this one had proved a sham had she been alone she would have given way to tears but before maurice or even her aunt she was ashamed of her grief ashamed of her feelings and of her thoughts there was a great deal yet that she wished to know but somehow the words choked her when she wanted to ask further questions fortunately mme la duchesse was taking maurice thoroughly to task she asked innumerable questions and would not spare him the relation of a single detail  tell us all about it from the beginning maurice she said where did you first meet the rogue  and mauriceweary and ashamedwas forced to embark on a minute account of adventures that were lies from beginning to end he had stumbled across the wayside hostelry on a lonely bypath he had found it full of cutthroats he had stalked and waylaid their chief in his own room and forced him to give up the money by the weight of his fists  it was paltry and pitiable nevertheless st genis as he warmed to his tale lost the shame of it only wrath remained with him anger that he should be forced into this despicable rôle through the intrigues of a rival  in his heart he was already beginning to find innumerable excuses for his cowardice and his rage and hatred grew against clyffurde as madames more and more persistent questions taxed his imagination almost to exhaustion  when after half an hour of this wearying crossexamination madame at last granted him a respite he made a pretext of urgent business at m le comte dartois headquarters and took his leave of the ladies he waited in vain hope that the duchesses tact would induce her to leave him alone for a moment with crystal madame stuck obstinately to her chair and was blind and deaf to every hint of appeal from him whilst crystal who was singularly absorbed and had lent but a very indifferent ear to his narrative made no attempt to detain him  she gave him her hand to kiss just as madame had done it lay hot and moist in his grasp  crystal he continued to murmur as his lips touched her fingers i love you    i worked for you    it is not my fault that i failed  she looked at him kindly and sympathetically through her tears and gave his hand a gentle little pressure  i am sure it was not your fault she replied gently poor maurice     it was not more than any kind friend would say under like circumstances but to a lover every little word from the beloved has a significance of its own every look from her has its hidden meaning somewhat satisfied and cheered maurice now took his final leave  does m le comte propose to continue his journey to paris he asked at the last  oh yes crystal replied he could not stay away while he feels that his majesty may have need of him oh maurice she added suddenly forgetting her absorption her wrath against clyffurde her own disappointmenteverythingin face of the awful possible calamity and turning anxious appealing eyes upon the young man you dont think do you that that abominable usurper will succeed in ousting the king once more from his throne  and st genisremembering laffray and grenoble remembering what was going on in lyons at this moment the silent grumblings of the troops the defaced white cockades the cries of vive lempereur which he himself had heard as he rode through the townst genis remembering all this could only shake his head and shrug his shoulders in miserable doubt  when he had gone at last crystals thoughts veered back once more to clyffurde and to his treachery  what abominable deceit ma tante she cried and quite against her will tears of wrath and of disappointment rose to her eyes what villainy what odious execrable treachery  madame shrugged her shoulders and took up her knitting  these days my dear she said with unwonted placidity the world is so full of treachery that men and women absorb it by every pore  but i shall not leave it at that rejoined crystal resolutely ill find a means of punishing that vile traitor    ill make him feel the hatred which he has so richly deservedi shall not rest till i have made him suffer as he makes me suffer now     my dearmy dear protested mme la duchesse not a little shocked at the girls vehemence  indeed crystals otherwise sweet gentle yielding personality seemed completely transformed for the moment she was just a sensitive woman who has been hit and hurt and whose desire for retaliation is keener more relentless than that of a man all the soft look in her blue eyes had gonethey looked dark and hardher fair curls were matted against her damp forehead indeed madame thought that for the moment all crystals beauty had gonethe sweet submissive beauty of the girl the grace of movement the shy appealing gentleness of her ways she now looked all determination resentment and above all revenge  the dear child sighed the duchesse over her knitting it is the english blood in her those people never know how to accept the inevitable they are always wanting to fight someone for something and never know when they are beaten     chapter vii  the ascent of the capitol   i  and the triumphal march from the gulf of jouan continued uninterrupted to paris  after laffray and grenoble lyons where the silkweavers of la guillotière assembled in their thousands to demolish the barricades which had been built up on their bridge against the arrival of the emperor and watched his entry into their city waving kerchiefs and hats in his honour and tricolour flags and cockades fished out of cupboards where they had lain hidden but not forgotten for one whole year  after lyons villefranche where sixty thousand peasants and workmen awaited his arrival at the foot of the tree of liberty on the top of which a brass eagle the relic of some old standard glistened like gold as it caught the rays of the setting sun  and nevers where the townsfolk urged the regiments as they march through the city to tear the white cockades from their hats and chalonsursaône where the workpeople commandeer a convoy of artillery destined for the army of m le comte dartois  the préfets of the various départements the bureaucracy of provinces and cities are not only amazed but struck with terror  this is a new revolution they cry in dismay  yes it is a new revolution the revolt of the peasantry of the poor the humble the oppressed the hatred which they felt against that old regime which had come back to them with its old arrogance and its former tyrannies had joined issue with the cult of the army for the emperor who had led it to glory to fortune and to fame  the people and the army were roused by the same enthusiasm and marched shoulder to shoulder to join the standard of napoleonthe little man in the shabby hat and the grey redingote who for them personified the spirit of the great revolution the great struggle for liberty and its final victory  the army of the comte dartoisthat portion of it which remained loyalwas powerless against the overwhelming tide of popular enthusiasm powerless against dissatisfaction mutterings and constant defections in its ranks the army would have done well in provencefor provence was loyal and royalist man woman and child but napoleon took the route of the alps and avoided provence by the time he reached lyons he had an army of his own and m le comte dartoisfearing more defections and worse defeatshad thought it prudent to retire  it has often been said that if a single shot had been fired against his original little band napoleons march on paris would have been stopped who shall tell there are such ifs in the world which no human mind can challenge certain it is that that shot was not fired at laffray randon gave the order but he did not raise his musket himself on the walls of grenoble st genis in command of the artillery and urged by the comte de cambray did not dare to give the order or to fire a gun himself the men declare he had said gloomily that they would blow their officers from their own guns  and at lyons there was not militiaman a royalist volunteer or a pariah out of the streets who was willing to fire that first and single shot and though marshal macdonald swore ultimately that he would do it himself his determination failed him at the last when surrounded by his wavering troops he found himself face to face with the conqueror of austerlitz and jena and rivoli and a thousand other glorious fights with the man in the grey redingote who had created him marshal of france and duke of tarente on the battlefields of lombardy his comradeinarms who had shared his own scanty army rations with him slept beside him round the bivouac fires and round whom now there rose a cry from end to end of lyons vive lempereur   ii  victor de marmont did not wait for the arrival of the emperor at lyons nor did he attempt to enter the city he knew that there was still some money in the imperial treasury brought over from elba and his mindalways in search of the dramatichad dwelt with pleasure on thoughts of the day when the emperor having entered fontainebleau or perhaps even paris and the tuileries would there be met by his faithful de marmont who on bended knees in the midst of a brilliant and admiring throng would present to him the twentyfive million francs originally the property of the empress herself and now happily wrested from the cupidity of royalist traitors  the picture pleased de marmonts fancy he dwelt on it with delight he knew that no one requited a service more amply and more generously than napoleon he knew that after this service rendered there was nothing to which hede marmontyoung as he was could not aspiretitle riches honours anything he wanted would speedily become his and with these to his credit he could claim crystal de cambray once more  oh she would be humbled again by then she and her father too the proud aristocrats doomed once more to penury and exile unless hede marmontcame forth like the fairy prince to the beggarmaid with hands laden with riches ready to lay these at the feet of the woman he loved  yes crystal de cambray would be humbled de marmont though he felt that he loved her more and better than any man had ever loved any woman before nevertheless had a decided wish that she should be humbled and suffer bitterly thereby he felt that her pride was his only enemy her pride and royalist prejudices of the latter he thought but little confident of his emperors success he thought that all those hotheaded royalists would soon realise the hopelessness of their causerendered all the more hopeless through its shortlived triumph of the past yearand abandon it gradually and surely accepting the inevitable and rejoicing over the renewed glory which would come over france  as for her pride well that was going to be humbled along with the pride of the bourbon princes of that fatuous old king of all those arrogant aristocrats who had come back after years of exile as arrogant as tyrannical as ever before  these were pleasing thoughts which kept victor de marmont company on his way between lyons and fontainebleau once past villefranche he sent the bulk of his escort back to lyons where the emperor should have arrived by this time he had written out a superficial report of his expedition which the sergeant in charge of the little troop was to convey to the emperors own hands he only kept two men with him put himself and them into plain travelling clothes which he purchased at villefranche and continued his journey to the north without much haste the roads were safe enough from footpads he and his two men were well armed and what stragglers from the main royalist army he came across would be far too busy with their own retreat and their own disappointment to pay much heed to a civilian and seemingly harmless traveller  de marmont loved to linger on the way in the towns and hamlets where the news of the emperors approach had already been wafted from grenoble or lyons or villefranche on the wings of wind or birds who shall say enough that it had come that the peasants assembled in masses in their villages were whispering together that he was comingthe little man in the grey redingotelempereur  and de marmont would halt in those villages and stop to whisper with the peasants too yes he was coming and the whole of france was giving him a rousing welcome there was laffray and grenoble and lyons the army rallied to his standard as one man  and de marmont would then pass on to another village to another town no longer whispering after a while but loudly proclaiming the arrival of the emperor who had come into his own again  after nevers he was only twentyfour hours ahead of napoleon and his progress became a triumphant one newspapers despatches had filtrated through from parisnews became authentic though some of it sounded a little wild wherever de marmont arrived he was received with acclamations as the man who had seen the emperor who had assisted at the emperors magnificent entry into grenoble who could assure citizens and peasantry that it was all true that the emperor would be in paris again very shortly and that once more there would be an end to tyranny and oppression to the rule of the aristocrats and a number of incompetent and fatuous princes  he did not halt at fontainebleau for now he knew that the court of the tuileries was in a panic that neither the comte dartois nor the duc de berry nor any of the royal princes had succeeded in keeping the army together that defections had been rife for the past week even before napoleon had shown himself and that marshal ney the bravest soldier in france had joined his emperor at auxerre  no de marmont would not halt at fontainebleau it was paris that he wanted to see paris which today would witness the hasty flight of the gouty and unpopular king whom it had never learned to love paris decking herself out like a bride for the arrival of her bridegroom paris waiting and watching while once again on the tuileries and the hôtel de ville on the louvre and the luxembourg on church towers and government buildings the old tricolour flag waved gaily in the wind  he slept that night at a small hotel in the louvre quarter but the whole evening he spent on the place du carrousel with the crowd outside the tuileries watching the departure from the palace of the infirm king of france and of his court the crowd was silent and obviously deeply moved the spectacle before it of an old ailing monarch driven forth out of the home of his ancestors and forced after an exile of three and twenty years and a brief reign of less than one to go back once more to misery and exile was pitiable in the extreme  many forgot all that the brief reign had meant in disappointments and bitter regrets and only saw in the pathetic figure that waddled painfully from portico to carriage door a monarch who was unhappy abandoned and defenceless a monarch too who in his unheroic sometimes grotesque person was nevertheless the representative of all the privileges and all the rights of all the dignity and majesty pertaining to the most ancient ruling dynasty in europe as well as of all the humiliations and misfortunes which that same dynasty had endured   iii  it is late in the evening of march 20th a thin mist is spreading from the river right over paris and from the place du carrousel the lighted windows of the tuileries palace appear only like tiny dimlyflickering stars  here an immense crowd is assembled it has waited patiently hour after hour ever since in the earlier part of the afternoon a courier has come over from fontainebleau with the news that the emperor is already there and would be in paris this night  it is the same crowd which twentyfour hours ago shed a tear or two in sympathy for the departing monarch now it stands herewaiting excited ready to cheer the return of a popular herohalfforgotten wildly acclaimed madly welcomed to be cursed again and again forgotten so soon it was a heterogeneous crowd forsooth made up in great part of the curious the idle the indifferent and in great part too of the bonapartist enthusiasts and malcontents who had groaned under the reactionary tyranny of the restorationof malcontents too of no enthusiasm who were ready to welcome any change which might bring them to prominence or to fortune with here and there a sprinkling of hotheaded revolutionaries cursing the return of the emperor as heartily as they had cursed that of the bourbon king and here and there a few heartsick royalists come to watch the final annihilation of their hopes  victor de marmont wrapped in a dark cloak stood among the crowd for a while he knew that the emperor would probably not be in paris before night and he loved to be in the very midst of the wave of enthusiasm which was surging higher and ever higher in the crowd and hear the excited whispers and to feel all round him wrapping him closely like a magic mantle of warmth and delight the exaltation of this mass of men and women assembled here to acclaim the hero whom he himself adored closely buttoned inside his coat he had scraps of paper worth the ransom of any king  among the crowd too bobby clyffurde moved and stood he was one of those who watched this enthusiasm with a heart filled with forebodings he knew well how short this enthusiasm would be he knew that within a few weeksdays perhapsthe bold and reckless adventurer who had so easily reconquered france would realise that the imperial crown would never be allowed to sit firmly upon his head none in this crowd knew better that the present pageant and glory would be shortlived than did this tall quiet englishman who listened with half an ear and a smile of goodnatured contempt to the loud cries of vive lempereur which rose spontaneously whenever the sound of horses hoofs or rattles of wheels from the direction of fontainebleau suggested the approach of the hero of the day none knew better than he that already in faroff england another great hero named wellington was organising the forces which presently would crushfor ever this timethe might and ambitions of the man whom england had never acknowledged as anything but a usurper and a foe  and closely buttoned inside his coat clyffurde had a letter which he had received at his lodgings in the alma quarter only a few moments before he sallied forth into the streets that letter was an answer to a confidential enquiry of his own sent to the chief of the british secret intelligence department resident in paris desiring to know if the department had any knowledge of a vast sum of money having come unexpectedly into the hands of his majesty the king of france before his flight from the capital  the answer was an emphatic no the intelligence department knew of no such windfall but its secret agents reported that victor de marmont captain of the usurpers bodyguard had waylaid m le marquis de st genis on the high road not far from lyons the escort which had accompanied victor de marmont on that occasion had been dismissed by him at villefranche and the information which the british secret intelligence department had obtained came through the indiscretion of the sergeant in charge of the escort who had boasted in a tavern at lyons that he had actually searched m de st genis and found a large sum of money upon him of which m de marmont promptly took possession  when bobby clyffurde received this letter and first mastered its contents the language which he used would have done honour to a toulon coalheaver he cursed st genis stupidity in allowing himself to be caught but above all he cursed himself for his softheartedness which had prompted him to part with the money  the letter which brought him the bad news seemed to scorch his hand and brand it with the mark of folly he had thought to serve the woman he loved first by taking the money from her since he knew that victor de marmont with an escort of cavalry was after it and secondly by allowing the man whom she loved to have the honour and glory of laying the money at his sovereigns feet the whole had ended in a miserable fiasco and clyffurde felt sore and wrathful against himself  and also among the crowdamong those who came heartsick hopeless forlorn to watch the triumph of the enemy as they had watched the humiliation of their feeble kingwas m le comte de cambray with his daughter crystal on his arm  they had come as so many royalists had done with a vague hope that in the attitude of the crowd they would discern indifference rather than exultation and that the active agents of their party as well as those of england and of prussia would succeed presently in stirring up a counter demonstration that a few cries of vive le roi would prove to the army at least and to the people of paris that acclamations for the usurper were at any rate not unanimous  but the crowd was not indifferentit was excited when first the comte de cambray and crystal arrived on the place du carrousel a number of white cockades could be picked out in the throng either worn on a hat or fixed to a buttonhole but as the afternoon wore on there were fewer and fewer of these small white stars to be seen the temper of the crowd did not brook this mute reproach upon its enthusiasm one or two cockades had been roughly torn and thrown into the mud and the wearer unpleasantly illused if he persisted in any royalistic demonstration crystal when she saw these incidents was not the least frightened she wore her white cockade openly pinned to her cloak she was far too loyal far too enthusiastic and fearless far too much a woman to yield her convictions to the popular feeling of the moment and she looked so young and so pretty clinging to the arm of her father who looked a picturesque and harmless representative of the fallen regime that with the exception of a few rough words a threat here and there they had so far escaped active molestation  and the crowd presently had so much to see that it ceased to look out for white cockades or to bait the sadeyed royalists a procession of carriages sparse at first and simple in appearance had begun to make its way from different parts of the town across the place du carrousel toward the tuileries they arrived very quietly at first with as little clatter as possible and drew up before the gates of the pavillon de flore with as little show as may be the carriage doors were opened unostentatiously and dark furtive figures stepped out from them and almost ran to the door of the palace so eager were they to escape observation their big cloaks wrapped closely round them to hide the court dress or uniform below  ministers dignitaries of the court councillors of state majordomos stewards butlers bodyservants they all came one by one or in groups of twos or threes as the afternoon wore on these arrivals grew less and less furtive the carriages arrived with greater clatter and todo with finer liveries and more gorgeous harness those who stepped out of the carriage doors were no longer quick and stealthy in their movements they lingered near the step to give an order or to chat to a friend the big cloak no longer concealed the gorgeous uniform below it was allowed to fall away from the shoulder so as to display the row of medals and stars the gold embroidery the magnificence of the court attire  the emperor had left fontainebleau within an hour he would be in paris everyone knew it and the excitement in the crowd that watched grew more and more intense last night these same men and women had looked with mute if superficial sympathy on the departure of louis xviii through these same palace gates many eyes then became moist at the sight as memory flew back twenty years to the murdered kinghis flight to varennes his ignominious return his weary calvary from prison to court house and thence to the scaffold and here was his brothercome back after twentythree years of exile acclaimed by the populace cheered by foreign soldiersrussians austrians englishanything but frenchand driven forth once more to exile after the brief glory that lasted not quite a year  but this the crowd of today has already forgotten with the completeness peculiar to crowds men women and children too they are no longer mute they talk and they chatter they scream with astonishment and delight whenever now from more and more carriages more and more gorgeously dressed folk descend the ladies are beginning to arrive the wives of the great court dignitaries the ladies of the court and household of the stillabsent empress they do not attempt to hide their brilliant toilettes their bare shoulders and arms gleam through the fastenings of their cloaks and diamonds sparkle in their hair  the crowd has recognised some of the great marshals the men who in the emperors wake led the french troops to victory in italy in prussia in austria maret duc de bassano is there and the crowd cheers him the duc de rovigo marshal davout prince deckmühl general excelmans one of napoleons oldest companions at arms the duke of gaeta the duke of padua a crowd of generals and superior officers it seems like the world of the sleeping beauty and of the enchanted castlewhich a kiss has awakened from its eleven months sleep the empire had only been asleep it had dreamed a bad dream wherein its hero was a prisoner and an exile now it is slowly wakening back to life and to reality  the night wears on darkness and fog envelop paris more and more excitement becomes akin to anxiety if the emperor did leave fontainebleau when the last courier said that he did he should certainly be here by now there are strange whispers strange waves of evil reports that spread through the waiting crowd a royalist fanatic had shot at the emperor the emperor was wounded he was dead  oh the excitement of that interminable wait  at last just as from every church tower the bells strike the hour of nine there comes the muffled sound of a distant cavalcade the sound of horses galloping and only half drowning that of the rumbling of coach wheels  it comes from the direction of the embankment and from far away now is heard the first cry of vive lempereur the noise gets louder and more clear the cries are repeated again and again till they merge into one great uproarious clamour like the ocean when lashed by the wind the crowd surges moves rises on tiptoe subsides falls back to crush forward again and once more to retreat as a heavy coach surrounded by a thousand or so of mounted men dashes over the cobbles of the place du carrousel whilst the clamour of the crowd becomes positively deafening  vive lempereur  the officers in the courtyard of the palace rush to the coach as it draws up at the pavillon de flore one of them succeeds in opening the carriage door the emperor is literally torn out of the carriage carried to the vestibule where more officers seize him raise him from the crowd bear him along hoisted upon their shoulders up the monumental staircase  their enthusiasm is akin to delirium they nearly tear their hero to pieces in their wild mad frantic welcome  in heavens name protect his person exclaims the duc de vicence anxiously and he and lavalette manage to get hold of the banisters and by dint of fighting and pushing succeed in walking backwards step by step in front of the emperor thus making a way for him  lavalette can hardly believe his eyes and the duc de vicence keeps murmuring it is the emperor it is the emperor  and hethe little stout man in green cloth coat and white breecheswalks up the steps of his reconquered palace like a man in a dream his eyes are fixed apparently on nothing he makes no movement to keep his too enthusiastic friends away the smile upon his lips is meaningless and fixed  vive lempereur vociferates the crowd  vive lempereur for one hundred days a few weeks of joy a few weeks of anxiety a few weeks of indecision of wavering and of doubt then defeat more irrevocable than before exile more distant despair more complete  vive lempereur while we shout with excitement while we remember the disappointments of the past year while we hope for better things from a hand that has lost its cunning a mind that has lost its power  vive lempereur let him live for an hundred days while we forget our enthusiasm and europe prepares its final crushing blow let him live until we remember once again the horrors of war the misery the famine the devastated homes until once more we see the maimed and crippled crawling back wearily from the fields of glory until our ears ring with the wails of widows and the cries of the fatherless  then let him no longer live for he it is who has brought this misery on us through his will and through his ambition and france has suffered so much from the aftermath of glory that all she wants now is rest   iv  graduallybut it took some hoursthe tumult and excitement in and round the tuileries subsided the emperor managed to shut himself up in his study and to eat some supper in peace while gradually outside his windows the crowdwho had nothing more to see and was getting tired of staring up at glittering panes of glasswent back more or less quietly to their homes  only in the courtyard of the tuileries the troopers of the cavalry which had formed the emperors escort from fontainebleau tethered their horses to the railings rolled themselves in their mantles and slept on the pavements giving to this portion of the palace the appearance of a bivouac in a place which has been taken by storm  one of the last to leave the place du carrousel was bobby clyffurde the crowd was thin by this time but it was the tired and the indifferentthe merely curiouswho had been the first to go those who remained to the last were either the very enthusiastic who wanted to set up a final shout of vive lempereur after their idol had entirely disappeared from their view or the malcontents who would not lose a moment to discuss their grievances to murmur covert threats or suggest revolt in some shape or form or kind  bobby slipped quickly past several of these isolated groups indifferent to the dark and glowering looks of suspicion that were cast at his tall muscular figure with the firm step and the defiant walk that was vaguely reminiscent of the british troops that had been in paris last year at the time of the foreign occupation he had skirted the tuileries gardens and was walking along the embankment which now was dark and solitary save for some rowdy enthusiasts on ahead who arm in arm in two long rows that reached from the garden railings to the parapet were obstructing the roadway and shouting themselves hoarse with vive lempereur  clyffurde who was walking faster than they did was just deliberating in his mind whether he would turn back and go home some other way or charge this unpleasant obstruction from the rear and risk the consequences when he noticed two figures still further on ahead walking in the same direction as he himself and the rowdy crowd  one of these two figuresthus viewed in the distance through the mist and from the backlooked nevertheless like that of a woman which fact at once decided bobby as to what he would do next he sprinted toward the crowd as fast as he could but unfortunately he did not come up with them in time to prevent the two unfortunate pedestrians being surrounded by the turbulent throng which still arm in arm and to the accompaniment of wild shouts had formed a ring around them and were now vociferating at the top of raucous voices  À bas la cocarde blanche À bas vive lempereur  a flickering street lamp feebly lit up this unpleasant scene bobby saw the vague outline of a man and of a woman standing boldly in the midst of the hostile crowd while two white cockades gleamed defiantly against the dark background of their cloaks to an englishman who was a pastmaster in the noble art of using fists and knees to advantage the situation was neither uncommon nor very perilous the crowd was noisy it is true and was no doubt ready enough for mischief but clyffurdes swift and scientific onslaught from the rear staggered and disconcerted the most bold there was a good deal more shouting plenty of cursing the englishmans arms and legs seemed to be flying in every direction like the arms of a windmill a good many thuds and bumps a few groans a renewal of the attack more thuds and groans and the discomfited group of roisterers fled in every direction  bobby with a smile turned to the two motionless figures whom he had so opportunely rescued from an unpleasant plight  just a few turbulent blackguards he said lightly as he made a quick attempt at readjusting the set of his coat and the position of his satin stock there was not much fight in them really and     he had of course lost his hat in the brief if somewhat stormy encounter and nowas he turnedthe thin streak of light from the streetlamp fell full upon his face with its twinkling deepset eyes and the halfhumorous selfdeprecatory curl of the firm mouth  a simultaneous exclamation came from his two protégés and stopped the easy flow of his lighthearted words he peered closely into the gloom and it was his turn now to exclaim half doubting wholly astonished  mademoiselle crystal    m le comte     indeed sir broke in the comte slowly and with a voice that seemed to be trembling with emotion it is to my daughter and to myself that you have just rendered a signal and generous service for this i tender you my thanks yet believe me i pray you when i say that both she and i would rather have suffered any humiliation or illusage from that rough crowd than owe our safety and comfort to you  there was so much contempt hatred even in the tone of voice of this old man whose manner habitually was a pattern of moderation and of dignity that for the moment clyffurde was completely taken aback puzzlement fought with resentment and with the maddening sense that he was anyhow impotent to avenge even so bitter an insult as had just been hurled upon himagainst a man of the comtes years and status  m le comte he said at last will you let me remind you that the other day when you turned me out of your house like a dishonest servant you would not allow me to say a single word in my own justification the man on whose word you condemned me then without a hearing is a scatterbrained braggart who you yourself must know is not a man to be trusted and     pardon me monsieur broke in the comte with perfect sangfroid even if i acted on that evening with undue haste and illconsidered judgment many things have happened since which you yourself surely would not wish to discuss with me just when you have rendered me a signal service  your pardon m le comte retorted clyffurde with equal coolness i know of nothing which could possibly justify the charges which not later than last sunday you laid at my door  the charge which i laid at your door then mr clyffurde has not been lifted from its threshold yet i charged you with deliberately conspiring against my king and my country all the while that you were eating bread and salt at my table i charged you with striving to render assistance to that corsican usurper whom may the great god punish and you yourself practically owned to this before you left my house  this i did not m le comte broke in clyffurde hotly as a man of honour i give you my word that except for my being in de marmonts company on the day that he posted up the emperors proclamation in grenoble i had no hand in any political scheme  and you would have me believe you exclaimed the comte with evergrowing vehemence when you talk of that corsican brigand as the emperor those words sir are an insult and had you not saved my daughter and me just now from violence i wouldold as i amstrike you in the face for them  with an impatient sigh at the old mans hotheaded obstinacy clyffurde turned with a look of appeal to crystal who up to now had taken no part in the discussion mademoiselle he said gently will you not at least do me justice cannot you see that i am clumsy at defending mine own honour seeing that i have never had to do it before  i only see monsieur she retorted coldly that you are making vain and pitiable efforts to regain my fathers regardno doubt for purposes of your own but why should you trouble you have nothing more to gain from us your clever comedy of a highwayman on the road has succeeded beyond your expectations the corsican who now sits in the armchair lately vacated by an infirm monarch whom you and yours helped to dethrone will no doubt reward you for your pains as for me i can only echo my fathers feelings i would ten thousand times sooner have been torn to pieces by a rough crowd of ignorant folk than owe my safety to your interference  she took her fathers arm and made a movement to go instinctively clyffurde tried to stop her at her words he had flushed with anger to the very roots of his hair the injustice of her accusation maddened him but the bitter resentment in the tone of her voice the look of passionate hatred with which she regarded him as she spoke positively appalled him  m le comte he said firmly i cannot let you go like this whilst such horrible thoughts of me exist in your mind england gave you shelter for three and twenty years in the name of my countrys kindness and hospitality toward you ias one of her sonsdemand that you tell me frankly and clearly exactly what i am supposed to have done to justify this extraordinary hatred and contempt which you and mademoiselle crystal seem now to have for me  one of englands sons monsieur retorted the comte equally firmly nay you are not even that england stands for right and for justice for our legitimate king and the punishment of the usurper  great god he exclaimed more and more bewildered now are you accusing me of treachery against mine own country this will i allow no man to do not even     then sir i pray you rejoined crystal proudly go and seek a quarrel with the man who has unmasked you who caught you redhanded with the money in your possession which you had stolen from us who forced you to give up what you had stolen and whom then you and your friend victor de marmont waylaid and robbed once more go then mr clyffurde and seek a quarrel with the marquis de st genis who has already struck you in the face once and no doubt will be ready to do so again  and what of clyffurdes thoughts while the woman whom he loved with all the strength of his lonely heart poured forth these hideous insults upon him amazement then wrath bewilderment then final hopelessness all these sensations ran riot through his brain  st genis had behaved like an abominable blackguard this he gathered from what she said he had lied like a mean skunk and betrayed the man who had rendered him an infinitely great service of him clyffurde wouldnt even think such despicable crawling worms did exist on gods earth he knew that but he possessed the happy faculty the sunny disposition that is able to pass a worm by and ignore its existence while keeping his eyes fixed upon all that is beautiful in earth and in the sky of st genis therefore he would not think some day perhaps he might be able to punish himbut not nownot while this poor forlorn heartsick girl pinned her implicit faith upon that wretched worm and bestowed on him the priceless guerdon of her love an infinity of pity rose in his kindly heart for her and obscured every other emotion that same pity he had felt for her before a sweet protecting pitygentle sister to fiercer madder love which had perhaps never been so strong as it was at this hour when for the second time he was about to make a supreme sacrifice for her  that the sacrifice must be made he already knew knew it even when first st genis name escaped her lips she loved st genis and she believed in him and he clyffurde who loved her with every fibre of his being with all the passionate ardour of his lonely heart could serve her no better than by accepting this awful humiliation which she put upon him if he could have justified himself now he would not have done it not while she loved st genis and heclyffurdewas less than nothing to her  what did it matter after all what she thought of him he would have given his life for her love but short of that everything else was anyhow intolerableher contempt her hatred what mattered since tonight anyhow he would pass out of her life for ever  he was ready for the sacrificesacrifice of pride of honour of peace of mindbut he did want to know that that sacrifice would be really needed and that when made it would not be in vain and in order to gain this end he put a final question to her  one moment mademoiselle he said before you go will you tell me one thing at least was it m de st genis himself who accused me of treachery  there is no reason why i should deny it sir she replied coldly it was m de st genis himself who gave to my father and to me a full account of the interview which he had with you at a lonely inn some few kilomètres from lyons and less than two hours after we had been shamefully robbed on the highroad of money that belonged to the king  and did m de st genis tell you mademoiselle that i purposed to use that money for mine own ends  or for those of the corsican she retorted impatiently i care not which yes sir m de st genis told me that with his own lips and when i had heard the whole miserable story of your duplicity and your treachery ia helpless deceived and feeble womandid then and there register a vow that i too would do you some grievous wrong one daya wrong as great as you had done not only to the king of france but to me and to my father who trusted you as we would a friend what you did tonight has of course altered the irrevocableness of my vow i owe perhaps my fathers life to your timely intervention and for this i must be grateful but     her voice broke in a kind of passionate sob and it took her a moment or two to recover herself even while clyffurde stood by mute and with wellnigh broken heart his very soul so filled with sorrow for her that there was no room in it even for resentment  father let us go now crystal said after a while with brusque transition and in a steady voice no purpose can be served by further recriminations  none my dear said the comte in his usual polished manner personally i have felt all along that explanations could but aggravate the unpleasantness of the present position mr clyffurde understands perfectly i am sure he had his axe to grindwhether personal or political we really do not care to knowwe are not likely ever to meet again all we can do now is to thank him for his timely intervention on our behalf and     and brand him a liar broke in clyffurde almost involuntarily and with bitter vehemence  your pardon monsieur retorted the comte coldly neither my daughter nor i have done that it is your deeds that condemn you your own admissions and the word of m de st genis would you perchance suggest that he lied  oh no rejoined clyffurde with perfect calm it is i who lied of course  he had said this very slowly and as if speaking with mature deliberation not raising his voice nor yet allowing it to quiver from any stress of latent emotion and yet there was something in the tone of it something in the mans attitude that suggested such a depth of passion that quite instinctively the comte remained silent and awed for the moment however clyffurde seemed to have forgotten the older mans presence wounded in every fibre of his being by the woman whom he loved so tenderly and so devotedly he had spoken only to her compelling her attention and stirringeven by this simple admission of a despicable crimean emotion in her which she could notwould not define  she turned large inquiring eyes on him into which she tried to throw all that she felt of hatred and contempt for him she had meant to wound him and it seemed indeed as if she had succeeded beyond her dearest wish by the dim flickering light of the streetlamp his face looked haggard and old the traitor was suffering almost as much as he deserved almost as muchcrystal said obstinately to herselfas she had wished him to do and yet at sight of him now crystal felt a strong unconquerable pity for him the womanly instinct no doubt to heal rather than to hurt  but this pity she was not prepared to show him she wanted to pass right out of his life to forget once and for all that sense of warmth of the soul of comfort and of peace which she had felt in his presence on that memorable evening at brestalou above all she never wanted to touch his hand again the hand which seemed to have such power to protect and to shield her when on that same evening she had placed her own in it  therefore now she took her fathers arm once more she turned resolutely to go one more curt nod of the head one last look of undying enmity and then she would pass finally out of his life for ever   v  how clyffurde got back to his lodgings that night he never knew crystal after his final admission had turned without another word from him and he had stood there in the lonely silent street watching her retreating formon her fathers armuntil the mist and gloom swallowed her up as in an elvish grave then mechanically he hunted for his hat and he too walked away  that was the end of his lifes romance of course the woman whom he loved with his very soul who held his heart his mind his imagination captive whose every look on him was joy whose every smile was a delight had gone out of his life for ever she had turned away from him as she would from a venomous snake she hated him so cruelly that she would gladly hurt himdo him some grievous wrong if she could and clyffurde was left in utter loneliness with only a vague foolish longing in his heartthe longing that one day she might have her wish and might have the power to wound him to deathbodily just as she had wounded him to the depth of his soul tonight  for the rest there was nothing more for him to do in france king louis was not like to remain at lille very long within twentyfour hours probably he would continue his journeyhis flightto ghentwhere once more he would hold his court in exile with all the fugitive royalists rallied around his tottering throne  clyffurde had already received orders from his chief at the intelligence department to report himself first at lille thenif the king and court had already leftat ghent if however there were plenty of men to do the work of the department it was his intention to give up his share in it and to cross over to england as soon as possible so as to take up the first commission in the new army that he could get england would be wanting soldiers more urgently than she had ever done before mother and sisters would be well looked after hebobbyhad earned a fortune for them and they no longer needed a breadwinner now whilst england wanted all her sons for she would surely fight  clyffurde who had seen the english papers that morningas they were brought over by an intelligence courierhad realised that the debates in parliament could only end one way  england would not tolerate bonaparte she would not even tolerate his abdication in favour of his own son austria had already declared her intention of renewing the conflict and so had prussia englands decision would of course turn the scale and bobby in his own mind had no doubt which way that decision would go  the man whom the people of france loved and whom his army idolised was the disturber of the peace of europe no one would believe his protestations of pacific intentions now he had caused too much devastation too much misery in the pastwho would believe in him for the future  for the sake of that past and for dread of the future he must gogo from whence he could not again return and bobby clyffurderemembering grenoble remembering lyons villefranche and neverscould not altogether suppress a sigh of regret for the brave man the fine genius the reckless adventurer who had so boldly scaled for the second time the heights of the capitol oblivious of the fact that the tarpeian rock was so dangerously near   vi  at this same hour when bobby clyffurde finally bade adieu to all the vague hopes of happiness which his love for crystal de cambray had engendered in his heart his whilom companion in the long agorival and enemy nowvictor de marmont was laying a tribute of twentyfive million francs at the feet of his beloved emperor and receiving the thanks of the man to serve whom he would gladly have given his life  what reward shall we give you for this service the emperor had deigned to ask  the means to subdue a womans pride sire and make her thankful to marry me replied de marmont promptly  a title what queried the emperor you have everything else you rogue to please a womans fancy and make her thankful to marry you  a title sire would be a welcome addition said de marmont lightly and the freedom to go and woo her until france and my emperor need me again  then go and do your wooing man and come back here to me in three months for i doubt not by then the flames of war will have been kindled against me again     chapter viii  the sound of revelry by night   i  but the hand had lost its cunning the mighty brain its indomitable willpower genius was still there but it was cramped now by indecisionthe indecision born of a sense of enmity around suspicion where there should have been nothing but enthusiasm and the blind devotion of the past  the man who all alone by the force of his personality and of his prestige had reconquered france who had been acclaimed from the gulf of jouan to the gates of the tuileries as the saviour of france the peoples emperor the beloved of the nation returned from exile the man who on the 20th of march had said with his old vigour and his old pride failure is the nightmare of the feeble impotence the refuge of the poltroon the man who had marched as in a dream from end to end of france to find himself face to face with the whole of europe in league against him with a million men being hastily armed to hurl him from his throne again now found the south of france in open revolt the west ready to rise against him the north in accord with his enemies  he has not enough men to oppose to those millions his arsenals are depleted his treasury empty and after he has worked sixteen hours out of the twentyfour at reorganising his army his finances his machinery of war he has to meet a set of apathetic or openly hostile ministers constitutional representatives men who are ready to thwart him at every turn jealous only of curtailing his power of obscuring his ascendency of clipping the eagles wings ere it soars to giddy heights again and to them he must give in from them he must beg entreat give up give up all the time one hopedfor privilege after another one power after another  he yields the military dictatorship to otherfar less competenthands he grants liberty to the press liberty of debate liberty of election liberty to all and sundry but suspicion lurks around him they suspect his sincerity his goodwill they doubt his promises they mistrust that dormant olympian ambition which has precipitated france into humiliation and brought the strangers armies within her gates  the same man was therethe same genius who even now could have mastered all the enemies of france and saved her from her present subjection and european insignificance but the men round him were not the same he the guiding hand was still there but the machinery no longer worked as it had done in the past before disaster had blunted and stiffened the temper of its steel  the men around the emperor were not now as they were in the days of jena and austerlitz and wagram their characters and temperaments had undergone a change disaster had brought on slackness the past year of constant failures had engendered a sense of discouragement and demoralisation a desire to argue to foresee difficulties to foretell further disasters  he saw it all well enoughhe the man with the farseeing mind and the eagleeyes that missed nothingneither a look of indecision nor an indication of revolt he saw it all but he could do nothing for he too felt overwhelmed by that wave of indecision and of discouragement faith in himself energy in action had gone he envisaged the possibility of a vanquished and dismembered france  above all he had lost belief in his star the star of his destiny which rising over the small island of corsica shining above a humble middleclass home had guided him step by step from triumph to triumph to the highest pinnacle of glory to which mans ambition has ever reached  that star had been dimmed once its radiance was no longer unquenchable destiny has turned against me he said and in her i have lost my most valuable helpmate  and now the whole of europe had declared war against him and in a final impassioned speech he turns to his ministers and to the representatives of his people help me to save france he begs afterwards well settle our quarrels  one hundred days after he began his dreammarch from the gulf of jouan in the wake of his eagle he started from paris with the army which he loved and which alone he trusted to meet europe and his fate on the plains of belgium   ii  and in brussels they danced danced late into the night no one was to know that within the next three days the destinies of the whole world would be changed by the hand of god  and how to hide from timid eyes the sense of this oncoming destiny how to stop for a few brief hours the flow of womens tears  the ball should have been postponedher grace of richmond was willing that it should be so how could men and women dance flirt and make merry while death was already reckoning the heavy toll of brave young lives which she would demand on the morrow but who knows england who has not seen her at the hour of danger  put off the ball why perish the thought the timid townsfolk of brussels or the ladies of the french royalist party who were in great numbers in the city might think there was something amiss what was amiss some gallant young men would go on the morrow and conquer or die for englands honour theres nothing amiss in that why put off the ball the girls would be disappointedthey who like to dancewhy should they be deprived of partners just because some of them would lie dead on the battlefield tomorrow  open your salons madame la duchesse the soldiers of britain will come to your ball they will laugh and dance and flirt tonight as bravely as they will die tomorrow  the sands of life are running low for them in a few hours perhaps a bullet a bayonet who knows will cut short that merry laugh still the gallant heart that even now takes a last and fond farewell from a blushing partner after a waltz in a sweetscented alcove with sounds of soft and distinct music around that stills the coming cannons roar  gordon and lancey crawford and ponsonby and halkett aye and wellington too what immortal names are spoken by the flunkeys tonight as they usher in these brave men into the hostess presence the ballroom is brilliantly illuminated with hundreds of wax candles the women have put on their pretty dresses displaying bare arms and dazzling shoulders the men are in showy uniforms glittering with stars and decorations orange brunswick nassau english belgian scottish french all are there gay with gold and silver braid  the confusion of tongues is greater surely than round the tower of babel german and french and english scots accent and irish brogue pedantic hanoverian and lusty brunswick tones all and more of these varied sounds mingle with one another and halfdrown by their clamour the sweet strains of the viennese orchestra that discoursed dreamy waltzes from behind a bower of crimson roses whilst ponderous flemish wives of city burgomasters gaze openmouthed at the elegant ladies of the old french noblesse and shy belgian misses peep enviously at their more selfreliant english friends  and the hostess smiles equally graciously to all she is ready with a bright word of welcome for everybody now just as she will be anon with a mute look of farewell whenat ten oclockby wellingtons commands one by one one officer after another will slip out of this hospitable house out into the rainy night for a hurried visit to lodgings or barracks to collect a few necessaries and then to workto horse or marchto form into the ranks of battle as they had formed for the quadrillesquares to face the enemyadvance deploy as they had done in the mazes of the dance to fight as they had danced to give their life as they had given a kiss  bobby clyffurde only saw crystal de cambray from afar he had his commission in colin halketts brigade his orders were the same as those of many others tonight to put in an appearance at her graces ball to dispel any fears that might be confided to him through a fair partners lips to show confidence courage and gaiety and at ten oclock to report for duty  but the crowd in the ballroom was great and crystal de cambray was the centre of a very close and exclusive little crowd as indeed were all the ladies of the old french noblesse who were here in their numbers they had left their country in the wake of their dethroned king and despite the anxieties and sorrows of the past three months while the star of the corsican adventurer seemed to shine with renewed splendour and that of the unfortunate king of france to be more and more on the wane they had somehow filled the sleepy towns of belgiumghent brussels charleroiwith the atmosphere of their own elegance and their unimpeachable good taste  clyffurde knew that the comte de cambray had settled in brussels with his daughter and sister pending the new turn in the fortunes of his cause the english colony there provided the royalist fugitives with many friends and ghent was already overfull with the immediate entourage of the king but bobby had never met either the comte or crystal again  he had crossed over to england almost directly after that final and fateful interview with them he had obtained his commission and was back again in belgiumas a fighting man ready for the work which was expected from britains sons by the whole of europe now  and tonight he saw her again his instinct intuition prescience what you will had told him that he would meet her hereand to his weary eyes when first he caught sight of her across the crowded room she had never seemed more exquisite nor more desirable she was dressed all in white with arms and shoulders bare her fair hair dressed in the quaint mode of the moment with a high comb and a multiplicity of curls she had a bunch of white roses in her belt and carried a shawl of gossamer lace that encircled her shoulders like a diaphanous cobweb through which gleamed the shimmering whiteness of her skin  she did not see him of course he was only one of so many in a crowd of english officers who were about to fight and to die for her country and her cause as much as for their own but to him she was the only living breathing person in the roomall the others were phantoms or puppets that had no tangible existence for him save as a setting a background for her  and poor bobby would so gladly have thrown all pride to the winds for the right to run straight to her across the width of the room to fall at her feet to encircle her knees and to wring from her a word of comfort or of trust so strong was this impulse that for one moment it seemed absolutely irresistible but the next she had turned to maurice de st genis who was never absent from her side and who seemed to hover over her with an air of proprietorship and of triumphant mastery which caused poor bobby to grind his heel into the oak floor and to smother a bitter curse which had risen insistent to his lips   iii  madame la duchesse dagen spoke to him once while he stood by watching crystals dainty form walking through the mazes of a quadrille with her hand in that of st genis  they look well matched do they not mr clyffurde madame said in broken english and with something of her usual tartness and you are you not going to recognise old friends may i ask  he turned abruptly whilst the hot blood rushed up to his cheek so sudden had been the wave of memory which flooded his brain at the sound of madames sharp voice now he stooped and kissed the slender little hand which was being so cordially held out to him  old friends madame la duchesse he queried with a quick sigh of bitterness nay you forget that it was as a traitor and a liar that you knew me last  it was as a young fool that i knew you all the time she retorted tartly even though a kindly look and a kindly smile tempered the gruffness of her sally the male creature my dear mr clyffurde she added was intended by god and by nature to be a selfish beast when he ceases to think of himself he loses his bearings flounders in a quagmire of unprofitable heroism which benefits no one and generally behaves like a fool  did i do all that asked clyffurde with a smile  all of it and more and look at the muddle you have made of things crystal has never got over that miserably aborted engagement of hers to de marmont and is no happier now with maurice de st genis than she would have been with    well with anybody else who had had the good sense to woo and win her in a straightforward proper and selfish masculine way  mademoiselle de cambray i understand rejoined clyffurde stiffly is formally affianced now to m de st genis  she is not formally affianced as you so pedantically and affectedly put it my friend replied madame with her accustomed acerbity but she probably will marry him if he comes out of this abominable war alive and if the king of france    whom may god protectcomes into his own again for his majesty has taken those two young jackanapes under his most gracious protection and has promised maurice a lucrative appointment at his courtif he ever has a court again  then mademoiselle de cambray must be very happy for whichif i dare say soi am heartily rejoiced  so am i said the duchesse drily but let me at the same time tell you this i have always known that englishmen were peculiarly idiotic in certain important matters of life but i must say that i had no idea idiocy could reach the boundless proportions which it has done in your case well she added with sudden gentleness farewell for the present mon preux chevalier it is not too late remember to bear in mind certain old axioms both of chivalry and of commonsensethe most obvious of which is that nothing is gained by sitting openmouthed whilst some one else gets the largest helpings at supper and if it is any comfort to you to know that i never believed st genis story of lonely inns of murderous banditti and whatnots well then i give you that information for what you may choose to make of it  and with a final friendly nod and a gentle pressure of her aristocratic hand on his which warmed and comforted bobbys sore heart she turned away from him and was quickly swallowed up by the crowd   iv  in spite of rain and blustering wind outside the fine ballroomas the evening progressedbecame unpleasantly hot dancing was in full swing and the orchestra had just struck up the first strains of that inspiriting new dancethe latest importation from viennaa dreamy waltz of which dowagers strongly disapproved deeming it licentious indecent and certainly ungraceful but which the young folk delighted in and persisted in dancing defying the mammas and all the proprieties  maurice de st genis after the last quadrille had led crystal away from the ballroom to a small boudoir adjoining it where the cool air from outside fanned the curtains and hangings and stirred the leaves and petals of a bank of roses that formed a background to a couple of seatsobviously arranged for the convenience of two persons who desired quiet conversation well away from prying eyes and ears  here crystal had been sitting with maurice for the past quarter of an hour while from the ballroom close by came as in a dream to her the gentle lilt of the waltz and from behind her a cluster of sweetscented crimson roses filled the air with their fragrance crystal didnt feel that she wanted to talk only to sit here quietly with the sound of the music in her ears and the scent of roses in her nostrils maurice sat beside her but he did not hold her hand he was leaning forward with his elbows on his knees and he talked much and earnestly the while she listened half absently like one in a dream  she had often heard in the olden days in england her aunt speak of the strange doings of that doctor mesmer in paris who had even involved proud marie antoinette in an unpleasant scandal with his weird incantations and wizardlike acts whereby peoplesensible women and menwere sent at his will into a curious torpor which was neither sleep nor yet wakefulness and which produced a yet more strange sense of unreality and dreaminess and visions of things unsubstantial and unearthly  and sitting here surrounded with roses and with that languorous lilt in her ear crystal felt as if she too were under the influence of some unseen mesmer who had lulled the activity of her brain into a kind of wakeful sleep even while her senses remained keenly vitally on the alert she knew for instance that maurice spoke of the coming struggle the final fight for king and country he had been enrolled in a nassau regiment under the command of the prince of orange he expected to be in the thick of a fight tomorrow bonaparte never waits crystal heard him say quite distinctly he is always ready to attack audacity and a bold use of his artillery were always his most effectual weapons  and he went on to tell her of his own plans his future his hopes he spoke of the possibility of death and of this being a last farewell crystal tried to follow him tried to respond when he spoke of his love for hera love the strength of whichhe saidshe would never be able to gauge  if it were not for the strength of my love for you crystal he said almost fiercely i could not bear to face possible death tomorrow    not without telling you    not without making reparation for my sin  and still in that curious trancelike sense of aloofness crystal murmured vaguely  sin maurice what sin do you mean  but he did not seem to give her a direct reply he spoke once more only of his love love atones for all sins he reiterated once or twice with passionate earnestness even god puts love above everything on earth love is an excuse for everything love justifies everything such love as i have for you crystal makes everything elseeven sin even cowardiceseem insignificant and meaningless  she agreed with what he said for indeed she felt too tired to argue the point or even to get his sophistry into her head strangely enough she felt out of tune with him tonightwith himmauricethe lover of her girlhood the man from whom she had parted with such desperate heartache three months ago in the avenue at brestalou then it had seemed as if the world could never hold any happiness for her again once maurice had gone out of her life now he had come back into it chance and the favour of the king had once more made a future happy union with him possible she ought to have been supremely happy yet she was out of tune his passionate words of love found only a cold response in her heart  for the past three months she had constantly been at war with her own self for this she hated and despised herself for that numbness of the heart which had so unaccountably taken all the zest and the joy out of her life does one love one day and become indifferent the next what had become of the girlish love that had invested maurice de st genis with the attributes of a hero what had he done that the pedestal on which her ideality had hoisted him should have proved of such brittle clay  he was still the gallant highborn wellbred gentleman whom she had always known he was on the eve of fighting for his king and country ready to give his life for the same cause which she loved so ardently he was even now speaking tender words of love and of farewell yet she was out of tune with him his words of love almost irritated her for they dragged her out of that delicious dreamlike torpor which momentarily peopled the world for her with goldheaded whitewinged mysterious angels and filled the air with soft murmurings and sweet sounds and a divine fragrance that was not of this earth  it must have been that she grew very sleepyprobably the heat weighed her eyelids downcertainly she found it impossible to keep her eyes open and maurice apparently thought that she felt faint always in the same vague way she heard him making suggestions for her comfort could he get her some wine or should he try and find madame la duchesse  then she realised how she longed for a little rest for perfect solitude for perfect freedom to give herself over to the sweet torpor which paralysed her brain and limbstired sleepy or under the subtle influence of some mysterious agencyshe did not know which she was but she did know that she would have given everything she could at this moment for a few minutes complete solitude  so she contrived to smile and to look up almost gaily into maurices anxious face i think really maurice she said i am just a little bit sleepy if i could remain alone for five minutes i would go honestly to sleep and not be ashamed of myself could you    could you just leave me for five or ten minutes    and    and maurice will you draw that screen a little nearer    she added affecting a little yawn nobody can see me then    and really really i shall be all right    if i could have a few minutes quiet sleep  you shall crystal of course you shall said maurice eager and anxious to do all that she wanted he arranged a cushion behind her head put a footstool to her feet and pulled the screen forward so that nowwhere she satno one could see her from the ballroom and as in response to repeated encores from the dancers the orchestra had embarked upon a new waltz she was not likely to be disturbed  ill try and find mme la duchesse he said after he had assured himself that she was quite comfortable and tell her that you are quite well but must not be disturbed  she caught his hand and gave it a little squeeze  you are kind maurice she murmured  she felt exactly like a tired child now that she had been made so comfortable and she liked maurice so much oh so much no brother could have been dearer  you wont go way without waking me maurice she said as he bent down to kiss her  no no of course not he replied it still wants a quarter before ten  the screen shut off all the glare from the candles the sense of isolation was complete and delicious the roses smelt very sweet the soft strains of the waltz sounded like elfin music   v  like elfin musictender fitful dreamyan exquisite languor stole into crystals limbs she was not asleep yet she was in dreamlandall alone in semidarkness that was restful and soothing and with the fragrance of crimson roses in her nostrils and their velvety petals brushing against her cheek  like elfin musicsweet strains of infinite sadnessthe tune of the infinite mingling with the semblance of reality  like elfin musicor like the voice of a human being in painthe note of sadness became the only real note now  what really happened after this crystal never rightly knew whenever in the future her memory went back to this hour she could not be sure whether in truth she had been waking or dreaming or at what precise moment she became fully conscious of a presence close beside herjust behind the bank of rosesand of a voicelow earnest quivering with passionate emotionthat reached her ear as if through the tender melodies played by the orchestra  it almost seemed to herwhen she thought over all the circumstances in her mindthat she must have been subtly conscious of the presence all alongall the while that maurice was still with her and she felt so curiously languid longing only for darkness and solitude  something encompassed her now that she could not define the warmth of love the sense of protection and securityalmost as if unseen arms that were strong and devoted and selfless held her closely shielding her from evil and from the taint of selfish human passions  and presently she heard her namewhispered low and with a note of tender appeal  her eyes were closed and she paid no heed but the appeal was once more whisperedthis time more insistently and almost against her will she murmured  who calls  an unfortunate whom you hate and despise and who would have given his life to serve you  who is it she reiterated  a poor heartbroken wretch who could not keep away from your side and longed for one more sound of your voice even though it uttered words more cruel than man can stand  what would you like to hear  one word of comfort to ease that terrible sting of hate which has burned into my very soul till every minute of life has become unendurable agony  how could i know she asked and now her eyes were wide open gazing out into nothingness not turned yet in the direction whence that dreamvoice came how could i know that my hatred made you suffer or that you cared for comfort from me  how could you know crystal the voice replied you could know that my dear just as surely as you know that in a stormy night the sky is dark just as you know that when heavy clouds obscure the blue ether above no ray of sunshine warms the shivering earth just as you know that you are beautiful and exquisite so you knew crystal that i loved you from the deepest depths of my soul  how could i guess  by that subtle sense which every human being has and you did guess it crystal else you would not have hated me as you did  i hated you because i thought you a traitor  is it too late to swear to you that my only thought was to serve you     by working against my king and country she retorted with just this one brief flash of her old vehemence  by working for my country and for yours this i swear by your sweet eyesby your dear mouth that hurt me so cruelly that eveningi swear it by the damnable agony which you made me endure    by the abject cowardice which dragged me to your side now like a whining wretch that craves for a crumb of comfort    by all that you have made me suffer    crystal i swear to you that i was never false    false great god when with every drop of my blood with every fibre of my heart with every nerve every sinew every thought i love you  the voice was so low never above a whisper and all around her crystal felt again that delicious sense of warmththe breath of love that brings mans heart so near to godthe sense of security in a mans allencompassing love which women prize above everything else on earth  the music was just an accompaniment to that low earnest whispering the soft strains of the violins made it still seem like a voice that comes through a veil of dreams instinctively crystal began to hum the waltztune and her little head with its quaint coronet of fair curls beat time to the languid lilt  will you dance with me crystal  no no she protested  just oncetonight tomorrow we fightlet us dance tonight  and before she could protest further her will seemed to fall away from her she knew that her father her aunt would be angry thatas like as notmaurice would make a scene she knew that mauriceto whom she had plighted her trothhad branded this man as a liar and a traitor her father believed him to be a traitor and she    well what had he done to disprove maurices accusations a few words of passionate protestations    did they count    he wore his kings uniformmany careless adventurers did that these strenuous times     and he wanted her to dance     how could shecrystal de cambray the future wife of the marquis de st genis the cynosure of a great many eyes tonighthow could she show herself in public on his arm in a crowded ballroom  yet she could not refuse she could not surely it was all a dream and in a dream man is but the slave of circumstance and has no will of his own  she was very young and loved to dance and she had heard that englishmen danced well besides it was all a dream she would wake in a moment or two and find herself sitting quietly among the roses with maurice beside her telling her of his love and of their happy future together   vi  but in the meanwhile the dream was lasting her partner was a perfect dancer and this new delicious waltzinspiriting yet languorous rhythmical and half barbaricsent a keen feeling of joy and of zest into crystals whole being  she was not conscious of the many stares that were levelled at her as she suddenly appeared among the crowd in the ballroom her face flushed with excitement her perfect figure moving with exquisite grace to the measure of the dance  the last dance together  a few moments before clyffurde had made his way to the small boudoir in search of fresh air and had withdrawn to a window embrasure away from a throng that maddened him in his misery of loneliness then he realised that crystal was sitting quite close to him that st genis who had been in constant attendance on her presently left her to herself and that without even moving from where he was he could whisper into her ear that which had lain so heavily on his heart that at times he had felt that it must break under the intolerable load  then as the soft strains of the music from the orchestra struck upon his ear the insistent whim seized him to make her dance with him just oncetonight tomorrow the cannon would roar once moretomorrow europe would make yet another stand against the bold adventurer whom seemingly nothing could crush  tomorrow a bulleta bayoneta swordthrustbut tonight a last dance together  those whims come at times to those who are doomed to die clyffurdes one hope of peace lay in death upon the battlefield life was empty now he had fought against the burden of loneliness left upon him when crystal passed finally out of his life but the burden had proved unconquerable only death could ease him of the load for life like this was stupid and intolerable  men would die within the next few days in their hundreds and in their thousands men who were happy who had wives and children men on whose lives love shed its happy radiance then why not he who was more lonely than any man on earthleft lonely because the one woman who filled all the world for him hated him and was gone from him for ever  but a last dance with her tonight the right to hold her in his arms this he had never done though his muscles had often ached with the longing to hold her but dancing with her he could feel her against him clasp her closely feel her breath against his cheek  she was not very tall and her headhad she chosencould just have rested in the hollow of his shoulder the thought of it sent the blood rushing hotly to his head and with his two strong hands he would at that moment have bent a bar of iron or smashed something to atoms in order to crush that longing to curse against fate against his destiny that had so wantonly dangled happiness before him only to thrust him into utter loneliness again  then he spoke to herand finally asked for the dance  and now he held her and guided her through the throng her tiny feet moving in unison with his and all the world had vanished he had her to himself for these few happy moments he could hold her and refuse to let her go he did not carenor did shethat many curious and some angry glances followed their every movement till the last bar was played till the final chord was struck she was absolutely hisfor she had given up her will to him  the last dance together he sent his heart to her all his heartand the music helped him and the rhythm the very atmosphere of the roomrosescentedhelped him to make her understand he could have kissed her hair so close were the heapedup fair curls to his mouth he could have whispered to her and nobody would hear he could have told her something at any rate of that love which had filled his heart since all time not months or years since he had known her but since all time filling every minute of his life he could have taught her what love meant thrilled her heart with thoughts of mighthavebeen he could have roused sweet pity in her soul loves gentle mother that has the power to give birth to love  but he did not kiss her nor did he speak because though he was quite sure that she would understand he was equally sure that she could not respond she was not hisnot his in the world of realities at any rate her heart belonged to the friend of her childhood the only man whom she would ever lovethe man by whom hepoor bobbyhad been content to be defamed and vilified in order that she should remain happy in her ideals and in her choice so he was content only to hold her his arm round her waist one hand holding hers imprisonedshe herself becoming more and more the creature of his dreams the angel that haunted him in wakefulness and in sleep immortally his bride yet never to be wholly his again as she was now in this heavenly moment where they stood together within the pale of eternity  in this their last dance together   vii  far into the night into the small hours of the morning crystal de cambray sat by the open window of her tiny bedroom in the small apartment which her father had taken for himself and his family in the rue du marais  she sat with one elbow resting on the windowsill her right hand fingering with nervy febrile movements a letter which she held jeanne had handed it to her when she came home from the ball m de st genis jeanne explained had given it to her earlier in the evening    soon after ten oclock it must have been    m le marquis seemed in a great hurry but he made jeanne swear most solemnly that mademoiselle crystal should have the letter as soon as she came home    also m le marquis had insisted that the letter should be given to mademoiselle when she was alone  not a little puzzledfor had she not taken fond leave of maurice shortly before ten oclock when he had told her that his orders were to quit the ball then and report himself at once at headquarters he had seemed very despondent crystal thought and the words which he spoke when finally he kissed her had in them all the sadness of a last farewell crystal even had felt a tinge of remorsewhen she saw how sad he wasthat she had not responded more warmly to his kiss it almost seemed as if her heart rebelled against it and when he pressed her with his accustomed passionate ardour to his breast she had felt a curious shrinking within herself a desire to push him away even though her whole heart went out to him with pity and with sorrow  and now here was this letter crystal was a long time before she made up her mind to open it the paperdamp with the rainseemed to hold a certain fatefulness within its folds at last she read the letter and long after she had read it she sat at the open window listening to the dreary monotonous patter of the rain and to the distant sounds of moving horses and men the rattle of wheels the bugle calls the departure of the allied troops to meet the armies of the great adventurer on the billowing plains of belgium  this is what maurice had written to her a few moments before he left and it must have taken him some time to pen the lengthy epistle       my beautiful crystal       i may never come back something tells me that my life      such as it isempty and worthless enough god knowshas      nearly run its full course but if i do come back to claim      the happiness which your love holds out for mei will not      face you again with so deep a stain upon mine honour i did      not tell you before because i was too great a coward i      could not bear to think that you would despise mei could      not encounter the look of contempt in your eyes so i      remained silent to the call of honour and now i speak      because the next few hours will atone for everything if i      come back you will forgive if i fall you will mourn in      either case i shall be happy that you know crystal in all      my life i spoke only one lie and that was three months      ago when i set out to reclaim the kings money which had      been filched from you on the high road and returned      emptyhanded i found the money and i found the thief no      thief he crystal but just a quixotic man who desired to      serve his country our cause and you that man was your      friend mr clyffurde i dont think that i was ever jealous      of him i am not jealous of him now our love crystal is      too great and too strong to fear rivalry from anyone he      had taken the money from you because he knew that victor de      marmont with a strong body of men to help him would have      filched it from you for the benefit of the corsican he      took the money from you because he knew that neither you      nor the comte would have listened to any warnings from him      he took the money from you with the sole purpose of      conveying it to the king then i found him and taunted him      until the temptation came to me to act the part of a coward      and a traitor and this i did crystal only because i      loved youbecause i knew that i could never win you while      i was poor and in humble circumstances i soon found out      that clyffurde was a friend i begged him to let me have      the money so that i might take it to the king and earn      consideration and a reward thereby that was my sin      crystal and also that i lied to you to disguise the sorry      rôle which i had played clyffurde gave me the money      because i told him how we loved one anotheryou and iand      that happiness could only come to you through our mutual      love he acted well though in truth i meant to do him no      wrong later victor de marmont came upon me and wrested      the money from me and i was helpless to guard that for      which i had played the part of a coward       i have eased my soul by telling you this crystal and i      know that no hard thoughts of me will dwell in your mind      whilst i do all that a man can do for honour king and      country       remember that the next few hours perhaps will atone for      everything and that love excuses all things       yours in love and sorrow       maurice  the letter crumpled and damp remained in crystals hand all the while that she sat by the open window and the sound of moving horses and men in the distance conjured up before her eyes mental visions of all that tomorrow might mean the letter was damp with her tears now they had fallen incessantly on the paper while she reread it a second time and then reread it again  a quixotic man maurice said airily how little he understood how well shecrystalknew what had been the motive of that quixotic action she had learned so much tonight in the mazes of a waltz now when she closed her eyes she could still feel the dreamy motion with that strong arm round her and she could hear the sweet languid lilt of the music and all the delicious elvish whisperings that reached her ear through the monotonous cadence of the dance of what her heart had felt then she need now no longer be ashamed all that should shame her now were her thoughts in the past the belief that the hand which had held hers on that eveninglong agoin brestalou could possibly have been the hand of a traitor that the lowtoned voice that spoke to her so earnestly of friendship then could ever be raised for the utterance of a lie  of such thoughts indeed she could be ashamed and of her cruelty that other night in paris when she had made him suffer so abominably through her injustice and her contempt  the next few hours perhaps will atone for everything maurice had added ah well perhaps but they could not erase the past they could not control the more distant future maurice would come backcrystal prayed earnestly that he shouldbut clyffurde was gone out of her life for ever god alone knew how this renewed war would end how could she hope ever to meet a friend who had gone away determined never to see her again  a last dance together well they had had it and that was the end the end of a sweet romance that had had no beginning he had gone now as maurice had gone as all the men had gone who had listened to their countrys call and she crystal could not convey to him even by a message by a word that she understood all that he had done for her all that his actions had meant of devotion of selfeffacement of pure and tender love  a last dance together and that had been the end even thoughts of him would be forbidden her after this for her thoughts were no longer free of him her heart was no longer free her promise belonged to maurice but her heart her thoughts were no longer hers to give  it was all too late too late the next few hours might atone for the past but they could not call it back  weary and heartsick crystal crawled into bed when the grey light of dawn peeped cold and shy into her room she could not sleep but she lay quite still while one by one those distant sounds died away in the misty morning in this semidreamlike state it seemed to her as if she must be able to distinguish the sound of his horses hoofs from among a thousand others it seemed as if something in herself must tell her quite plainly where he was what he did when he got to horse which way he went and presently she closed her eyes against the grey monotonous light and during one brief moment she felt deliciously conscious of a sweet protecting presence somewhere near her of soft whisperings of fondness and of friendship the sound of a dreamvoice reached her ear and once again as in the sweetscented alcove she felt herself murmuring who calls and once more she heard the tender wailing as of a stricken soul in pain a poor heartbroken wretch who could not keep away from your side  and memoryechoes lingered round her bringing back every sound of his mellow voice every look in his eyes the touch of his handoh that exquisite touchand his last words before he asked her to dance with every drop of my blood with every nerve every sinew every thought i love you  and her heart with a longdrawnout moan of unconquerable sorrow sent out into the still morning air its agonised call in reply  come back my love come back i cannot live without you you have taught me what love ispure selfless and protectingyou cannot go from me nowyou cannot in the name of that love which your tender voice has brought into being come back to me do not leave me desolate     chapter ix  the tarpeian rock   i  rain rain all the morning gods little toolinnocentlooking little tool enoughfor the remodelling of the destinies of this world  god chose to soak the earth on that dayand the formidable artillery that had swept the plateau of austerlitz the vales of marengo the cemetery of eylau was rendered useless for the time being because up in the inscrutable kingdom of the sky a cloud had chosen to burstor had burst by the will of godand water soaked the soft spongy soil of belgium and the wheels of artillery wagons sank axledeep in the mud  if only the ground had been dry if only the great gamblerthe genius the hero call him what you will but the gambler for all thatif only he had staked his crown his honour and that of imperial france on some other stake than his artillery if only     but who shall tell  is it indeed a cloudburst that changed the whole destinies of europe ye materialists ye philosophers answer that  is it to the rain that fell in such torrents until close on midday of that stupendous 18th of june that must be ascribed this wonderful and allembracing change that came over the destinies of myriads of people of entire nations kingdoms and empires rather is it not because god just on that day of all days chose to show this world of pigmiesgreat men valiant heroes controlling genius and allpowerful conquerorsthe entire extent of his mightso far and no furtherand in order to show it he selected that simple seemingly futile means    just a heavy shower of rain  at halfpast eleven the cannon began to roar on the plains of mont saint jean2 but not before before that it had rained rained heavily and the ground was soaked through and the allpowerful artillery of the most powerful military genius of all times was momentarily powerless  footnote 2 ie waterloo  had it not rained so persistently and so long that same compelling artillery would have begun its devastating work earlier in the dayat six mayhap or mayhap at dawn another five six seven hours to add to the length of that awful day another five six seven hours wherein to tax the tenacity the heroic persistence of the british troops another five six seven hours of dogged resistance on the one side of impetuous charges on the other before the arrival of blücher and his prussians and the turning of the scales of blind justice against the daring gambler who had staked his all  but it was only at halfpast eleven that the cannon began to roar and the undulating plain carried the echo like a thunderroll from heaving billow to heaving billow till it broke against the silent majesty of the forest of soigne  here with the forest as a background is the highest point of mont saint jean and here beneath an overhanging elmall day on horsebackanxious frigid and heroic is wellingtonwith a rain of bullets all round him watching ceaselessly watching that horizon far away wrapped now in fog anon in smoke and soon in gathering darkness watching for the promised prussian army that was to ease the terrible burden of that desperate stand which the british troops were bearing and had borne all day with such unflinching courage and dogged tenacity  it is in vain that his aidesdecamp beg him to move away from that perilous position  my lord cries lord hill at last in desperation if you are killed what are we to do  the same as i do now replies wellington unmoved hold this place to the last man  then with a sudden outburst of vehemence that seems to pierce almost involuntarily the rigid armour of british phlegm and british selfcontrol he calls to his old comrades of salamanca and vittoria  boys which of us now can think of retreating what would england think of us if we do  heroic unflinching and cool the british army has held its ground against the overwhelming power of napoleons magnificent cavalry raw recruits some of them against the veterans of jena and of wagram but they have been ordered to hold the place to the last man and in close and serried squares they have held their ground ever since halfpast eleven this morning while one after another the flower of napoleons worldfamed cavalry had been hurled against them  cuirassiers chasseurs lancers up they come to the charge like whirlwinds up the declivities of the plateau like a whirlwind they rush upon those stolid immovable impenetrable squares attacking from every side making violent obstinate desperate onsets upon the stubborn angles the straight unshakable walls of red coats slashing at the bayonets with their swords at crimson breasts with their lances firing their pistols right between those glowing eyes right into those firm jaws and set teeth  the sound of bullets on breastplates and helmets and epaulettes is like a shower of hailstones upon a sheet of metal  twice thrice nay morea dozen timesthey return to the charge and the plateau gleams with brandished steel like a thousand flashes of simultaneous forklightning on the vast canopy of a stormy sky  from midday till after four a kind of mysterious haze covers this field of noble deeds fog after the rain wraps the gentlybillowing flemish ground in a white semitransparent veilcovers with impartial coolness all the mighty actions the heroic charges and still more heroic stands all the silent uncomplaining sufferings the glorious deaths all the courage and all the endurance  through the grey mists we see a medley of moving coloursblue and grey and scarlet and blackof shakos and sabretaches of english and french and hanoverian and scotch of epaulettes and bare knees we hear the sound of carbine and artillery fire the clank of swords and bayonets the call of bugle and trumpet and the wail of the melancholy pibroch tunics and gold tassels and kiltsa medley of sounds and of visions  we see the attack on hougoumontthe appearance of bülow on the heights of saint lambertthe charge of the inniskillings and the scots greysthe death of valiant ponsonby we see marshal

plains of mont saint jean are the great gambling tables on which the supreme gamblernapoleon once emperor of the french and master of half the worldhad staked his all if we come out of this alive and conquered he cries to heymès his aidedecamp there will only be the hangmans rope left for us all  and we see the gambler himselfnapoleon emperor still and still certain of victoryon horseback all day riding from end to end of his lines he is gayer than he has ever been before at marengo he was despondent at austerlitz he was troubled but at waterloo he has no doubts the star of his destiny has risen more brilliant than ever before  the day of frances glory has only just dawned he calls and his mind is full of projectsthe triumphant march back into paristhe germans driven back to the rhinethe english to the sea  his only anxietyand it is a slight one stillis that grouchy with his fresh troops is so late in arriving  still the prussians are late too and the british cannot hold the place for ever   ii  at three oclock the fog liftsthe veil that has wrapped so many sounds such awful and wonderful visions in a kind of mystery is lifted now and it reveals    what hougoumont investedbrave baring there with a handful of menenglish german brunswickiansmaking a last stand with ten rounds of ammunition left to them per man and the french engineers already battering in the gates of the enclosing wall that surrounds the château and chapel of goumont the farm of la haye sainte takenney there with his regiment of cuirassiers and five battalions of the old guard and the english lines on the heights of mont saint jean apparently giving way  we see too a vast hecatomb glory and might must claim their many thousand victims the dead and dying lie scattered like pawns upon an abandoned chessboard the humble pawns in this huge and final gamble for supremacy and power for national existence and for liberty hougoumont la haye sainte papelotte are sown with illustrious deadbut on the plateau of mont saint jean the british still hold their ground  wellington is still there on the heights with the majestic trees of soigne behind him the stately canopy of the elm above his headmore frigid than before more heroic but also more desperately anxious  blücher or nightfall he sighs as a fresh cavalry charge is hurled against those indomitable british squares the thirteenth assault and still they stand or kneel on one knee those gallant british boys bayonet in hand or carbine they fire fall out and reform again shaken hustled encroached on they may be but still they stand and fire with coolness and precision    the ranks are not broken yet  officers ride up to the fieldmarshal to tell him that the situation has become desperate their regiments decimated their men exhausted they ask for fresh orders but he has only one answer for them  there are no fresh orders save to hold out to the last man  and down in the valley at la belle alliance is the great gamblerthe man who today will either be emperor againa greater mightier monarch than even he has ever beenor who will sink to a status which perhaps the meanest of his erstwhile subjects would never envy  but just nowat four oclockwhen the fog has liftedhe is flushed with excitement exultant in the belief in victory  the english centre on mont saint jean is giving way at last he is told  the beginning of retreat he cries  and he who had been anxious at austerlitz despondent at marengo is gay and happy and brimming full of hope  de marmont he calls to his faithful friend de marmont go ride to paris now tell them that victory is ours no no he adds excitedly dont go all the wayride to genappe and send a messenger to paris from therethen come back to be with us in the hour of victory  and victor de marmont rides off in order to proclaim to the world at large the great victory which the emperor has won this day over all the armies of europe banded and coalesced against him   from far away on the road of ohain has come the first rumour that blücher and his body of prussians are nighstill several hours march from waterloo but advancingadvancing for hours wellington has been watching for them until wearily he has sighed blücher or nightfall alone can save us from annihilation now  the rumouroh it was merely the whispering of the wind but still a rumour neverthelessmeans fresh courage to tired halfspent troops even deeds of unparalleled heroism need the stimulus of renewed hope sometimes  the rumour has also come to the ears of the emperor of ney and of all the officers of the staff they all know that those magnificent british troops whom they have fought all day must be nigh to their final desperate effort at lastwith naught left to them but their stubborn courage and that tenacity which has been ever since the wonder of the world  they know these brave soldiers of napoleonwho have fought and admired the brave foethat the 1st and 2nd life guards are decimated by now that entire british and german regiments are cut up that picton is dead the scots greys almost annihilated they know what havoc their huge cavalry charges have made in the magnificent squares of british infantry they know that heroism and tenacity and determination must give way at last before superior numbers before fresh troops before persistent everrenewed attacks  only a few fresh troops and ney declares that he can conquer the final dogged endurance of the british troops before they in their turn receive the support of blücher and his prussians or before nightfall gives them a chance of rest  so he sends colonel heymès to his emperor with the urgent message more troops i entreat more troops and i can break the english centre before the prussians come  none knew better than he that this was the great hazard on which the life and honour of his emperor had been staked that imperial france was fighting hand to hand with great britain each for her national existence each for supremacy and might and the honour of her flag  imperial francebold daring impetuous  great britaintenacious firm and impassive  wellington under the elmtree calmly scanning the horizon while bullets whiz past around his head and ordering his troops to hold on to the last man  the emperor on horseback under a hailstorm of shot and shell and bullets riding from end to end of his lines  ney and his division of cuirassiers and grenadiers of the old guard had just obeyed the emperors last orders which had been to take la haye sainte at all costs and the intrepid maréchal now flushed with victory had sent his urgent message to napoleon  more troops and i can yet break through the english centre before the arrival of the prussians  more troops cried the emperor in despair where am i to get them from am i a creator of men  and from far away the rumour blücher and the prussians are nigh  stop that rumour from spreading to the ears of our men in gods name dont let them know it adjures napoleon in a message to ney  and he himself sends his own staff officers to every point of the field of battle to shout and proclaim the news that it is grouchy who is nigh grouchy with reinforcements grouchy with the victorious troops from ligny fresh from conquered laurels  and the news gives fresh heart to the imperial troops  vive lempereur they shout more certain than ever of victory   iii  the grey day has yielded at last to the kiss of the sun far away at braine lalleud a vivid streak of gold has rent the bank of heavy clouds it is now close on seven oclockthere are two more hours to nightfall and blücher is not yet here  some of the prussians have certainly debouched on plancenoit but napoleons old guard have turned them out again and from limale now comes the sound of heavy cannonade as if grouchy had come upon blücher after all and all hopes of reinforcements for the british troops were finally at an end  napoleonemperor still and still flushed with victorylooks through his glasses on the british lines to him it seems that these are shaken that wellington is fighting with the last of his men this is the hour then when victory waitsattentive ready to bestow her crown on him who can hold out and fight the longeston him who at the last can deliver the irresistible attack  and napoleon gives the order for the final attack which must be more formidable more overpowering than any that have gone before the plateau of mont saint jean he commands must be carried at all costs  cuirassiers lancers and grenadiers then once more to the charge strew once more the plains of waterloo with your dying and your dead up milhaud with your guards poret with your grenadiers michel with your chasseurs up ye heroes of a dozen campaigns of a hundred victories up ye old growlers with the fur bonnetsnapoleons invincible old guard with ney himself to lead you a hero among heroes the bravest where all are brave  have you ever seen a tidal wave of steel rising and surging under the lash of the gale so they come now those cuirassiers and lancers and chasseurs their helmets their swords their lances gleaming in the golden light of the sinking sun in closed ranks stirrup to stirrup they swoop down into the valley and rise again scaling the muddy heights superb as on parade with their finest generals at their head milhaud hanrion michel mallet and ney between them all  splendid they are and certain of victory they gallop past as if at a revue on the place du carrousel opposite the windows of the tuileries all to the repeated cry of vive lempereur  and as they gallop past the wounded and the dying lift themselves up from the bloodstained earth and raise their feeble voices to join in that triumphant call vive lempereur theres an old veteran there who fought at austerlitz and at jena he has three stripes upon his sleeve but both his legs are shattered and he lies on the roadside propped up against a hedge and as the superb cavalry ride proudly by he shouts lustily forward comrades a last victorious charge long live the emperor   after that who was to blame was human agency to blame did neythe finest cavalry leader in napoleons magnificent army the veteran of an hundred glorious victoriesdid he make the one blunder of his military career by dividing his troops into too many separate columns rather than concentrating them for the one allpowerful attack upon the british centres did he indeed mistake the way and lead his splendid cavalry by roundabout crossways to the plateau instead of by the straight brussels road  or did the obscure traitorover whom history has thrown a veil of mysterybetray this fresh advance against the british centre to wellington  was any man to blame was it not rather the hand of god that had already fallen with almighty and divine weight upon the ambitious and reckless adventurerwas it not the voice of god that spoke to him through the cannons roar of waterloo so far but no farther shalt thou go enough of thy will and thy power and thy ambitionenough of this scourge of bloodshed and of misery which i have allowed thee to wield for so longenough of devastated homes of starvation and of poverty enough of the fatherless and of the widow  and up above on the plateau the british troops hear the thunder of thousands of horses hoofs gallopinggalloping to this last charge which must be irresistible and sturdy wearied hands black with powder and stained with blood grasp more firmly still the bayonet the rifle or the carbine and they waitthose exhausted intrepid valiant men they wait for that thundering charge with wideopen eyes fixed upon the crest of the hillthey wait for the chargethey are ready for deathbut they are not prepared to

in the slowly sinking sun whilst from billow to billow the echo brings to straining ears the triumphant cry vive lempereur  five minutes later the british artillery ranged along the crest has made a huge breach in that solid moving mass of horses and of steel quickly the breach is repaired the ranks close up again this is a parade a review the eyes of france are upon her sons and vive lempereur  still they come  volley after volley from the british guns makes deadly havoc among those glistering ranks  but nevertheless they come  no halt save for the quick closing up into serried orderly columns and then on with the advancelike the surging up of a tidal wave against the cliffson with the advance up the slopes toward the crest where those who are in the front ranks are mowed down by the british gunstheir places taken by others from the rearthose others mowed down again and again replacedfalling in their hundreds as they reach the crest like the surf that shivers and dies as it strikes against the cliffs  neys horse is killed under himthe fifth todaybut he quickly extricates himself from saddle and stirrups and continues on his wayon foot sword in handthe sword that conquered at austerlitz at eylau and at moskowa round him the grenadiers of the old guardthey with the fur bonnets and the grizzled moustachestighten up their ranks  they advance behind the cavalry and after every volley from the british guns they shout loudly vive lempereur  and anon the tidal wavedespite the ebb despite the constant breaking of its surfhas by sheer force of weight hurled itself upon the crest of the plateau  the brunswickers on the left are scattered cleeves and lloyd have been forced to abandon their guns the british artillery is silenced and the chasseurs of michel hold the extreme edge of the upland and turn a deadly fusillade upon colin halketts brigade already attacked by milhaud and his guards and now severely shaken  see the english general cries duchaud to his cuirassiers he is between two fires he cannot escape  no he cannot but he seizes the colours of the 33rd whose young lieutenant has just fallen and who threaten to yield under the devastating crossfire he brandishes the tattered colours high up above his headas high as he can hold themhe calls to his men to rally and then falls grievously wounded  but his guards have rallied they stand firm now and duchaud chewing his grey moustache murmurs his appreciation of so gallant a foe  that side will win he mutters who can best keep on killing   iv  up guards and at them  maitlands brigade of guards had been crouching in the corncrouchingwaiting for the order to chargeredcoated lions in the ripening cornready to spring at the word  and death the harvester in chief stands by with his scythe ready for the mowing  up guards and at them  it is maitland and his gallant brigade of guardsout of the corn they rise and front the three battalions of michels chasseurs who were the first to reach the highest point of the hill they fire and death with his scythe has laid three hundred low the tricolour flag is riddled with grapeshot and général michel has fallen  then indeed the mighty wave of steel can advance no longer for it is confronted with an impenetrable walla wall of living palpitating heroic menmen who for hours have stood their ground and fought for the honour of britain and of her flagmen who with set teeth and grim determination were ready to sell their lives dearly if lives were to be soldmen in fact who have had their orders to hold out to the last man and who are going to obey those orders now  up guards and at them and surprised bewildered staggered the chasseurs pause three hundred of their comrades lie dead or dying on the ground they pause their ranks are broken with his last dying sigh brave général michel tries to rally them but he breathes his last ere he succeeds his second in command loses his head he should have ordered a bayonet chargesudden swift and sureagainst that red wall that rushes at them with such staggering power but he too tries to rally his men to reform their rankshow can they reform as for parade under the deadly fire of the british guards  confusion begins its deathly sway the chasseursunder conflicting ordersstand for full ten minutes almost motionless under that devastating fire  and far away on the heights of frischemont the first line of prussian bayonets are seen silhouetted against the sunset sky  wellington has seen it blücher has come at last one final effort one more mighty gigantic superhuman struggle and the glorious end would be in sight he gives the order for a general charge  forward boys cries colonel saltoun to his brigade now is the time  heads down the british charge the chasseurs are already scattered but behind the chasseurs fronting maitlands brigade fronting adam and his artillery fronting saltoun and colborne the fireeater the old guard is seen to advance the old guard who through twelve campaigns and an hundred victories have shown the world how to conquer and how to die  when michels chasseurs were scattered when their general fell when the english lines exhausted and shaken for a moment rallied at wellingtons call up guards and at them when from far away on the heights of frischemont the first line of prussian bayonets were silhouetted against the sunset sky then did napoleons old growlers with their fur bonnets and their grizzled moustaches enter the line of action to face the english guards they were facing death and knew it but still they cried vive lempereur  heads down the british charge whilst from ohain comes the roar of blüchers guns and up from the east zieten with the prussians rushes up to join in the assault  then the carnage begins for the old guard is still advancingin solid squaressolemn unmoved magnificent the bronze eagles on their bonnets catch the golden rays of the setting sun thus they advance in face of deadly fire they fall like corn before the scythe a sublime suicide to the cry of vive lempereur and not one of the brigade is missing except those who are dead  they knownone betterthat this is the beginning of the end perhaps they do not care to live if their emperor is to be emperor no longer if he is to be sent back to exileto the prison of elba or worse and so they advance in serried squares while maitlands artillery has attacked them in the rear great gaps are made in those ranks but they are quickly filled up again the squares become less solid smaller but they remain compact still they advance  but now close behind them blüchers guns begin to thunder and zietens columns are rapidly gaining ground all round their fur bonnets a hailstorm of grapeshot is raging whilst adams artillery is in action within fifty paces at their flank but the old growlers who had suffered death with silent fortitude in the snows of russia who had been as grand in their defeat at moscow and at leipzic as they had been in the triumphs of auerstadt or of friedlandthey neither staggered nor paused in their advance on they wentcarrying their muskets on their shouldersa cloud of tirailleurs in front of them right into the crossfire of the british guns their loud cry of vive lempereur drowning that other awesome terrible cry which someone had raised a while ago and which now went from mouth to mouth we are betrayed sauve qui peut  the prussians were in their rear the british were charging their front and panic had seized the most brilliant cavalry the world had ever seen  sauve qui peut is echoed now and reechoed all along the crest of the plateau and the echo rolls down the slope into the valley where reilles infantry and a regiment of cuirassiers and three more battalions of chasseurs are making ready to second the assault on mont saint jean reille and his infantry pause and listen the cuirassiers halt in their upward movement whilst up on the ridge of the plateau where donzelots grenadiers have attacked the brigade of kempt and lambert and pack the whisper goes from mouth to mouth  we are betrayed sauve qui peut  panic seizes the younger men they turn their horses heads back toward the slopes the stampede has commenced very soon it grows the british in front the prussians in the rear sauve qui peut  ney amongst them is almost unrecognisable his face is coalblack with powder he has no hat no epaulettes and only half a sword rage anguish bitterness are in his husky voice as he adjures entreats calls to the demoralised armyand insults it execrates it in turn but nothing but death will stop that army now in its headlong flight  at least stop and see how a marshal of france dies on the field of honour he calls  but the voice which led these same men to victory at moskowa has lost its potency and its magic the men cry vive ney but they do not stand the stampede has become general in the valley below the infantry has started to run up the slope of la belle alliance after it the cavalry with reins hanging loose stirrups lost casques sabretaches musketsanything that impedesthrown into the fields to right and left la haye sainte is evacuated hougoumont is abandoned papelotte plancenoit the woods the plains are only filled with running men and the thunder of galloping chargers   alone the old guard has remained unshaken whilst all around them what was once the grand army is shattered destroyed melted like ice before a devastating fire they have continued to advance sublime in their fortitude in their endurance their contempt for death one by one their columns are shattered and there are none now to replace those that fall and as the gloom of night settles on this vast hecatomb on the plateau of mont saint jean the conquerors of jena and austerlitz and friedland make their last stand round the bronze eagleall that is left to them of the glories of the past  and when from far away the cry of sauve qui peut has become only an echo and the bronze eagle shattered by a bullet lies prone upon the ground shielded against capture in its fall by a circling mountain of dead when finally night wraps all the heroism the glory the sorrow and the horrors of this awful day in the sable folds of her allembracing mantle napoleons old guard has ceased to be   and out in the western sky a streak of vivid crimson like human blood has broken the bosom of the clouds the glow of the sinking sun rests on this huge dissolution of what was once so glorious and unconquered and great then it is that wellington rides to the very edge of the plateau and fronts the gallant british troops at this supreme hour of oncoming victory and lifting his hat high above his head he waves it three times in the air  and from right and left they come british hanoverians belgians and brunswickers to deliver the final blow to this retreating army wounded already unto death  they charge now they charge all of them cavalry infantry gunners forty thousand men who have forgotten exhaustion forgotten what they have suffered forgotten what they had endured on they come with a rush like a torrent let loose the confusion of sounds and sights becomes a pandemonium of hideousness bugles and drums and trumpets and bagpipes all mingle merge and die away in the fast gathering twilight  and the tidal wave of steel recedes down the slopes of mont saint jean into the valley and thence up again on belle alliance with a mêlée of sounds like the breaking of a gigantic line of surf against the irresistible cliffs or the last drawnout sigh of agony of dying giants in primeval times   v  on the road to genappe in the mystery of the moonlit night a solitary rider turned into a field and dismounted  carried along for a time by the stream of the panic he found himself for a moment comparatively aloneleft as it were high and dry by the same stream which here had divided and flowed on to right and left of him he wore a grey redingote and a shabby bicorne hat  having dismounted he slipped the bridle over his arm and started to walk beside his horse back toward waterloo  a sleepwalker in pursuit of his dream  heavy banks of grey clouds chased one another with mad fury across the midsummer sky now obscuring the cold face of the moon now allowing her pale silvery rays to light up this gigantic panorama of desolation and terror and misery to right and left along the roads and lanes across grassland and cornfields canals ditches and fences the last of the grand army was flying headlong closely pursued by the prussians and at the farm of la belle alliance wellington and blücher had met and shaken hands and had thanked god for the great and glorious victory  but the sleepwalker went on in pursuit of his dreamhe walked with measured steps beside his weary horse his eyes fixed on the horizon far away where the dull crimson glow of smouldering fires threw its last weird light upon this vast abode of the dead and the dying he walked onslowly and mechanically back to the scene of the overwhelming cataclysm where all his hopes lay irretrievably buried he walked onmajestic as he had never been before in the brilliant throneroom of the tuileries or the mystic vastness of notre dame when the imperial crown sat so ill upon his plebeian head    he walked onsilent exalted and greatgreat through the magnitude of his downfall  and to right and left of him like the surf that recedes on a pebbly beach the last of his once invincible army was flying back to franceback in the wake of those who had been lucky enough to fly beforebodies of men who had been the last to realise that an heroic stand round a fallen eagle could no longer win back that which was lost and that if life be precious it could only be had in flightbits of human wreckage too forgotten by the tidethey all rolled and rushed and swept past the silent wayfarer    quite close at times so close that every man could see him quite distinctly could easily distinguish by the light of the moon the grey redingote and the battered hat which they all knew so wellwhich they had been wont to see in the forefront of an hundred victorious charges  now halfblinded by despair and by panic they gazed with uncomprehending eyes on the man and on the horse and merely shouted to him as they rushed galloping or running by the prussians are on us sauve qui peut  and the dreamer still looked on that distant crimson glow and in the bosom of those windswept clouds he saw the pictures of austerlitz and jena and wagram pictures of glory and might and victory and the shouts which he heard were the ringing cheers round the bivouac fires of long ago     chapter x  the last throw   i  it was close on halfpast nine and the moon full up on the stormy sky when a couple of riders detached themselves out of the surging mass of horses and men that were flying pellmell towards genappe and slightly checking their horses put them to a slower gallop and finally to a trot  on their right a small cottage gleamed snowwhite in the cold searching light of the moon a low wall ran to right and left of it and enclosed a small yard at the back of the cottage the wall had a gate in it which gave on the fields beyond at the moment that the two riders trotting slowly down the road reached the first angle of the wall the gate was open and a man leading a white horse and wearing a grey redingote turned into the yard  my god the emperor exclaimed one of the riders as he drew rein  they both turned their horses into the field skirting the low enclosing wall until they reached the gate the white horse was now tethered to a post and the man in the grey redingote was standing in the doorway at the rear of the cottage the two men dismounted and in their turn led their horses into the yard at sight of them the man in the grey redingote seemed to wake from his sleep  berthier he said slowly is that you  yes sireand colonel bertrand is here too  what do you want  we earnestly beg you sire to come with us to genappe there is not the slightest hope of rallying any portion of your army now the prussians are on us you might fall into their hands  berthierconqueror and prince of wagramspoke very earnestly and with head uncovered but more abruptly and harshly than he had been wont to do of yore in the salons of the tuileries or on the glorycrowned battlefields at the close of a victorious day  i am coming i am coming said the emperor with a quick sigh of impatience i only wanted to be alone a momentto think things outto     there is nothing quite so urgent sire as your safety retorted the prince of wagram drily  the emperor did notor did not choose toheed his great marshals marked want of deference perhaps he was accustomed to the moods of these men whom his bounty had fed and loaded with wealth and dignities and titles in the days of his glory and who had proved only too ready alaseven last year even nowto desert him when disaster was in sight  without another word he turned on his heel and pushing open the cottage door he disappeared into the darkness of the tiny room beyond with an impatient shrug of the shoulders berthier prepared to follow him colonel bertrand busied himself with tethering the horses then he too followed berthier into the building  it was deserted of course as all isolated cottages and houses had been in the vicinity of quatre bras or mont saint jean bertrand struck a tinder and lighted a tallow candle that stood forlorn on a deal table in the centre of the room the flickering light revealed a tiny cottage kitchenhastily abandoned but scrupulously cleanwhitewashed walls a redtiled floor the iron hearth the painted dresser decorated with white crockery shiny tin pans hung in rows against the walls and two or three rush chairs napoleon sat down  i again entreat you sire began berthier more earnestly than before  but the emperor was staring straight out before him with eyes that apparently saw something beyond that rough white wall opposite on which the flickering candlelight threw such weird gargantuan shadows the precious minutes sped on minutes wherein death or capture strode with giant steps across the fields of flanders to this lonely cottage where the once mightiest ruler in europe sat dreaming of what might have been the silence of the night was broken by the thunder of flying horses hoofs by the cries of sauve qui peut and distant volleys of artillery proclaiming from far away that death had not finished all his work yet  bertrand and berthier stood by with heads uncovered silent moody and anxious  suddenly the dreamer roused himself for a moment and spoke abruptly and with his usual peremptory impatience de marmont he said has either of you seen him  not lately sire replied colonel bertrand not since five oclock at any rate  what was he doing then  he was riding furiously in the direction of nivelles i shouted to him he told me that he was making for brussels by a circuitous way  ah that is right well done my brave de marmont braver than your treacherous kinsman ever was so you saw him did you bertrand did he tell you that he had just come from genappe  yes sire he did replied bertrand moodily he told me that by your orders he had sent a messenger from there to paris with news of your victory and that by tomorrow morning the capital would be ringing with enthusiasm and with cheers  and by the time de marmont came back from genappe interposed the prince of wagram with a sneer the plains of waterloo were ringing with the grand armys sauve qui peut  an episode prince only an episode said napoleon with an angry frown of impatience to hear you now one would imagine that essling had never been we have been beaten back of course but for the moment the world does not know that paris tomorrow will be beflagged and the bells of notre dame will send forth their joyous peals to cheer the hearts of my people and in brussels this afternoon thousands of our enemiesbelgians dutch hanoverians brunswickerswere rushing helterskelter into the towndemoralised and disorganised after that brilliant charge of our cuirassiers against the allied left  would to god the british had been among them too murmured old colonel bertrand but for their stand     and a splendid stand it was ah but for that    to think that if grouchy had kept the prussians away in only another hour we     the dreamer paused in his dream of the might have been then he continued more calmly  but i was not thinking of that just now i was thinking of those who fled to brussels this afternoon with the news of our victory and of wellingtons defeat  even then the truth is known in brussels by now protested berthier  yes but not before de marmont has had the time and the pluck to save us and our empire    berthier he continued more vehemently dont stand there so gloomy man    and you too my old bertrand    surely surely you have realised that at this terrible juncture we must utilise every circumstance which is in our favour    that early news of our victory    we can make use of that    a big throw in this mighty game but we can do it    berthier do you see how we can do it      no sire i confess that i do not replied the marshal gloomily  you do not see retorted the emperor with a frown of angry impatience de marmont didat oncebut he is youngand enthusiastic whereas you    but dont you see that the news of wellingtons defeat must have enormous consequences on the money markets of the worldif only for a few hours    it must send the prices on the foreign bourses tumbling about peoples ears and create an absolute panic on the london stock exchange only for a few hours of course    but do you not see that if any man is wise enough to buy stock in london during that panic he can make a fortune by reselling the moment the truth is known  even then sire stammered berthier a little confused by this avalanche of seemingly irrelevant facts hurled at him at a moment when the whole map of europe was being changed by destiny and her future trembled in the hands of god  ah de marmont saw it all    at once    continued the emperor earnestly he saw eye to eye with me he knows that moneya great deal of moneyis just what i want now    money to reorganise my army to reequip and reform it the chamber and my ministers will never give me what i want    my god they are such cowards and some of them would rather see the foreign troops again in paris than napoleon emperor at the tuileries you should know that maréchal and you too my good bertrand de marmont knows it    that is why he rode to brussels at the hour when i alone knew that all was lost at waterloo but when half europe still thought that the corsican ogre had conquered again    de marmont is in brussels now    tonight he crosses over to englandtomorrow morning he and his broker will be in the stock exchange in londoncalm silent watchful an operation on the bourse what like hundreds that have been done before    but in this case the object will be to turn one million into fifty so that with it i might rebuild my empire again  he spoke with absolute conviction and with indomitable fervour sitting here quietly hethe architect of the mightiest empire of modern daysjust as he used to do in the camps at austerlitz and jena and wagram and friedlandwith one clenched hand resting upon the rough deal table the flickering light of the tallow candle illuminating the wide brow the heavy jaw those piercing eyes that still gazedin this hour of supreme catastropheinto a glorious future destined never to bescheming planning scheming still even while his grand army was melting into nothingness all around him and distant volleys of musketry were busy consummating the final annihilation of the empire which he had created and still hoped to rebuild  berthier gave a quick sign of impatience  rebuild an empire ye godsan empirewhen the flower of its manhood lies pale and stark like the windrows of corn after the harvester has done his work thoughts of a dreamer schemes of a visionary how will the quaking lips which throughout the length and breadth of this vast hecatomb now cry sauve qui peut how will they ever intone again the old vive lempereur  the conqueror of wagram gave a bitter sigh and faithful bertrand hung his head gloomily but de marmont had neither sighed nor doubted but then de marmont was younghe too was a dreamer and an enthusiast and a visionary his idol in his eyes had never had feet of clay for him the stricken man was his emperor stillthe architect the creator the invincible conquerorchecked for a moment in his glorious work but able at his will to rebuild the empire of france again on the very ruins that smouldered now on the fields of waterloo  i can do it sire he had cried exultantly when his emperor first expounded his great new scheme to him i can be in brussels in an hour and catch the midnight packet for england at ostend at dawn i shall be in london and by ten oclock at my post i know a financiera jew and a mightily clever onehe will operate for me i have a million or two francs invested in england well use these for our operations money sire you shall have millions our differences on the stock exchange will equip the finest army that even you have ever had fifty millions ill bring you a hundred god has not yet decreed the downfall of the empire of france  so de marmont had spoken this afternoon in the enthusiasm of his youth and of his heroworship and since then the great dreamer had continued to weave his dreams nothing was lost nothing could be lost whilst enthusiasm such as that survived in the hearts of the young  and still wrapped in his dream he sat on while danger and death and disgrace threatened him on every side berthier and bertrand entreated in vain in vain tried to drag him away from this solitary place where any moment a party of prussians might find and capture him  unceremoniously the prince of wagram had blown out the flickering light that might have attracted the attention of the pursuers it was a very elementary precaution the only one he or bertrand was able to take the horses were out in the yard for anyone to see and the greatest spoil of victory might at any moment fall into the hands of the meanest prussian soldier out for loot  but the dreamer still sat on in the gloom with the pale light of the moon streaming in through the narrow casement window and illumining that marblelike face rigid and set that seemed only to live by the glowing eyesthe eyes that looked into the future and the past and heeded not the awful present  close on a quarter of an hour went by until at last he jumped to his feet with the sudden cry of to genappe  berthier heaved a sigh of relief and bertrand hurried out to unfasten the horses  you are impatient prince said the emperor almost gaily as he strode with a firm step to the door you are afraid those cursed prussians will put the corsican ogre into a cage and send him at once to his victorious bourbon majesty king louis xviii not so my good berthier not so the star of my destiny has not yet declined ive done all the thinking i wanted to do now well to genappe where well rally the remnants of our army and then quietly await de marmonts return with the millions which we want after that well boldly on to paris and defy my enemies there    en avant maréchal the corsican ogre is not in the iron cage yet  outside bertrand was holding his stirrup for him he swung himself lightly in the saddle and turned out of the farmyard gate into the open throwing back his head and sniffing the stormladen air as if he was about to lead his army to one of his victorious charges not waiting to see how close the other two men followed him he put his horse at once at a gallop  he rode onnever pausingnever looking round even on that gigantic desolation which the cold light of the moon weirdly and fitfully revealedhis mind was fixed upon a fresh throw on the gaming table of the world  overhead the stormdriven clouds chased one another with unflagging fury across the moonlit sky now obscuring now revealing that gigantic dissolution of the grand army so like the melting of ice and frost under the fierce kiss of the sun  more than men in an attack less than women in a retreat the finest cavalry europe had ever seen was flying like sand before the wind but the somnambulist rode on in his sleep forgetting that on these vast and billowing fields twentysix thousand gallant french heroes had died for the sake of his dreams  bertrand and the prince of wagram followedgloomy and silentthey knew that all suggestions would be useless all saner advice remain unheeded besides de marmont had gone and after all what did it all matter what did anything matter now that empire glory hope everything were irretrievably lost  and in faithful bertrands deepset eyes there came a strange faroff look almost of premonition as if in his mind he could already see that lonely island rock in the atlantic and the great gambler there eating out his heart with vain and bitter regrets   ii  but de marmont had never had any doubts never any forebodings he only had boundless faith in his hero and boundless enthusiasm for his cause accustomed to handle money since early manhood owner of a vast fortune which he had administered himself with no mean skill he had no doubt that the emperors scheme for manufacturing a few millions in a wild gamble on the stock exchange was not only feasible but certain of success  undoubtedly the false news of wellingtons defeat would reach london tomorrow as it had already reached paris and brussels the panic in the money market was a foregone conclusion the quick rise in prices when the truth became known was equally certain it only meant forestalling the arrival of wellingtons despatches in london by four and twenty hours and one million would make fifty during that time  as de marmont had told his emperor he had several hundred thousand pounds invested in england on which he could lay his hands operations on the bourse were nothing new to him and already while he was still listening with respect and enthusiasm to his emperors instructions he was longing to get away he knew the country well between here and brussels and he was wildly longing to be at work to be flying across the lowlying land on to brussels and then across to england in the wake of the awful news of complete disaster  he would steal the uniform of some poor dead wretcha belgium or a hanoverian or a black brunswicker he didnt care whichit wouldnt take long to strip the dead and the greatness of the work at stake would justify the sacrilege in the uniform of one of the allied army he could safely continue his journey to brussels and with luck could reach the city long before sunset  in brussels he would at once obtain civilian clothes and then catch the evening packet for england at ostend oh no it was not likely that wellington could send a messenger over to london quite so soon  at this hourit was just past fivehe was still on mont saint jean making another desperate stand against the imperial cavalry with troops half worn out with discouragement and whose endurance must even now be giving way  at this hour the prussians had appeared at braine lalleud they had engaged reille at plancenoit but wellington and the british had still to hold their ground or the news which de marmont intended to accompany to london might prove true after all  ye gods if only that were possible how gladly would victor then have lost the hundred thousands which he meant to risk tomorrow wellington really vanquished before blücher could come to his rescue napoleon once more victorious as he had always been and a mightier monarch than before then he victor de marmont the faithful young enthusiast who had never ceased to believe when others wavered who at this last hourwhen the whole world seemed to crumble away from under the feet of the man who had once been its masterwas still ready to serve his emperor never doubting always hoping he would reap such a reward as must at last dazzle the one woman who could make that reward for him doubly precious  victor de marmont had effected the gruesome exchange he was now dressed in the black uniform of a brunswick regiment wherein so many french royalists were serving by a wide détour he had reached the approach to brussels indeed it seemed as if the news which he had sent flying to paris was true after all behind the forest of soigne where he now was the fields and roads were full of running men and galloping horses the dull green of belgian uniforms the yellow facings of the dutch the black of brunswickers all mingled together in a moving kaleidoscopic mass of colour men were flying unpursued yet panicstricken towards brussels carrying tidings of an awful disaster to the allied armies in their haggard faces their quivering lips their bloodstained tunics  de marmont joined in with them though his heart was full of hope he too contrived to look pale and spent and panicstricken at willhe heard the shouts of terror the hastily murmured all is lost even the british can no longer stand as horses maddened with fright bore their halfsenseless riders by he set his teeth and rode on his dark eyes glowed with satisfaction there was no fear that the great gambler would stake his last in vain the news would travel quick enoughas news of disaster always will brussels even now must be full of weeping women and children as it soon would be of terrordriven men of wounded and of maimed crawling into the shelter of the town to die in peace  and as he rode de marmont thought more and more of crystal the last three months had only enhanced his passionate love for her and his maddening desire to win her yet at all costs st genis would of course be fighting today perchance a convenient shot would put him effectively out of the way de marmont had vainly tried in this wild gallopade to distinguish his rivals face among this mass of foreigners  as for the englishman well no doubt he had disappeared long ago out of crystal de cambrays life de marmont had never feared him greatly that one look of understanding between crystal and clyffurde and the latters strange conduct about the money at the inn were alone responsible for the few twinges of jealousy which de marmont had experienced in that quarter  indeed the englishman was a negligible quantity de marmont did not fear him there was only st genis and with the royalist cause rendered absolutely hopelessas it would be as it must best genis and the comte de cambray and all those stiffnecked aristocrats of the old regime who had thought fit to turn their proud backs on him at brestalou three months ago would be irretrievably ruined and discredited and would have to fly the country once more    and crystal faced with the alternative of penury in england or a brilliant existence at the tuileries as the wife of the emperors most faithful friend would make her choice as hede marmontnever doubted that any woman would  hope for him had already become reality brussels was the halfway halt to the uttermost heights of his ambition fortune the emperors gratitude the woman he loved all waited for him there he reached the city just as that distant horizon in the west was lit up by a streak of brilliant crimson from the fast sinking sun just whenhad he but known iton the crest of mont saint jean wellington had waved his hat over his head and given the heroic british armyexhausted but undauntedthe order for a general charge just when the grand army finally checked in its advance had first set up the ominous call that was like the passingbell of its dying glory sauve qui peut   iii  sauve qui peut  bobby clyffurde heard the cry too through the fast gathering shadows of unconsciousness that closed in round his wearied senses and as a film that was so like the kindly veil of approaching death spread over his eyes he raised them up just once to that vivid crimson glow far out in the west and on the winged chariot of the setting sun he sent up his last sigh of gratitude to god all day he had called for deathall day he had wooed her there where bullets and grapeshot were thickestwhere her huge scythe had been most busily at work  sons of fond mothers husbands sweethearts that were dearly loved brothers that would be endlessly mourned lives that were more precious than any earthly treasuresthe ghostly harvester claimed them all with impartial cruelty and hedesolate and lonelywith no one greatly to care if he came back or nowith not a single golden thread of hope to which he might cling without a dream to brighten the coming days of drearinesswith a life in the future that could hold nothing but vain regrets bobby had sought death twenty times today and death had resolutely passed him by  but now he was grateful for that he was thankful that he had lived just long enough to see the sunset just long enough to take part in that last glorious charge in obedience to wellingtons inspiring command up guards and at them he was glad to have lived just long enough to hear the sauve qui peut to know that the grand army was in full retreat that blücher had come up in time that british pluck and british endurance had won the greatest victory of all times for britains flag and her national existence  now with a rough bandage hastily tied round his head where grapeshot had lacerated cheek and ear with a bayonet thrust in the thigh and another in the arm bobby had remained lying there with many thousands round him as silent as uncomplaining as hein the downtrodden cornand with the tramp of thousands of galloping fleeing horses the clash of steel and fusillade of tirailleurs and artillery reaching his dimmed senses like a distant echo from the land of ghosts and before his eyeshalf veiled in unconsciousness there flitted the tender delicate vision of crystal de cambray of her blue eyes and soft fair hair done up in a quaint mass of tiny curls of the scarf of filmy lace which she always liked to wrap round her shoulders and through the lace the pearly sheen of her skin of her arms and of her throat the air around him had become pure and rarified that horrible stench of powder and smoke and blood no longer struck his nostrilsit was roses roses all around himcrimson rosessweet and caressing and fragrantwith soft velvety petals that brushed against his cheekand from somewhere close by came a dreamy melody the halfsad halfgay lilt of an intoxicating dance  it was delicious and bobby wearied sore and aching in body felt his soul lifted to some exquisite heights which were not yet heaven of course but which must of a truth form the very threshold of paradise  he saw crystal more and more clearly every moment now he was looking straight into her blue eyes and her little hand cool and white as snow rested upon his burning forehead she smiled on himas on a friendthere was no contempt no harshness in her lookonly a great consoling pity and something that seemed like an appeal  yes the longer he himself looked into those blue eyes of hers the more sure he was that there was an appeal in them it almost seemed as if she needed him in a way that she had never needed him before apparently she could not speak she could not tell him what it was she wanted but her little hands seemed to draw him up out of the trodden trampled corn and having soothed his aches and pains they seemed to impel him to do somethingthat was important    and imperative    something that she wanted done  he begged her to let him lie here in peace for he was now comforted and happy he was quite sure now that he was dead that her sweet face had been the last tangible vision which he had seen on earth ere he closed his eyes in the last long sleep   he had seen her and she had gone all of a sudden she had vanished and darkness was closing in around him the scent of roses faded into the air which was now filled again with horrid soundsthe deafening roar of cannon the sharp and incessant retort of riflefire the awesome mêlée of cries and groans and buglecalls and sighs of agony and one deafening cryso like the last wail of departing soulswhich came from somewherenot very far away vive lempereur  bobby raised himself to a sitting posture his head ached terriblyhe was stiff in every limb a burning almost intolerable pain gnawed at his thigh and at his left arm but consciousness had returned and with it all the knowledge of what this day had meant all round him there was the broken corn stained with blood and mud all round him lay the dead and the dying in their thousands far away in the west a crimson glow like fire lit up this vast hecatomb of brave lives sacrificed this final agony of the vast empire the might and grandeur of one man laid low this day by the mightier hand of god  it lit up with the weird light of the dying day the pallid cleanshaven faces of gallant british boys the rugged faces of the scot the olive skin of the child of provence the bronzed cheeks of old veterans it threw its lurid glow on red coats and black coats white facings and gilt epaulettes it drew sparks as of stillliving fire from breastplates and broken swords discarded casques and bayonets sabretaches and kilts and bugles and drums and dead horses and arms and accoutrements and dead and dying men all lying pellmell in a huge litter with the glow of midsummer sunset upon thempoor little chessmenpawns and knightscastles of strength and kings of some lonely mourning heartsall swept together by the almighty hand of the great master of this terrestrial game  but with returning consciousness bobbys gaze took in a wider range of vision he visualised exactly where he wason the south slope of mont saint jean with la haye sainte on ahead a little to his left and the whitewashed walls of la belle alliance still further away gleaming golden in the light of the setting sun  he saw that on the wide road which leads to genappe and charleroi the once invincible cavalry of the mighty emperor was fleeing helterskelter from the scene of its disaster he saw that the britishwhat was left of themwere in hot pursuit he saw from far plancenoit the scintillating casques of blüchers prussians  and on the left a detachment of allied troopsdutch belgian brunswickershad just started down the slope of the plateau to join in this deathdealing pellmell where amongst the litter of dead and dying in the confusion of pursuer and pursued comrade fought at times against comrade brother fired on brotherprussian against british  down below behind the farm buildings of la haye sainte two battalions of chasseurs of the old guard had made a stand around a tattered bit of tricolour and the bronze eaglesymbol of so much decadent grandeur and of such undying glory a moi chasseurs brave général pelet had cried let us save the eagle or die beneath its wing  and those who heard this last call of despair stopped in their headlong flight they forged a way for themselves through the mass of running horses and men they rallied to their flag and with their tirailleurskneeling on one kneeranged in a circle round them they now formed a living bulwark for their eagle of dauntless breasts and bristling bayonets  and upon this mass of desperate men the small body of raw dutch and belgian and german troops now hurled themselves with wild huzzas and blind impetuousness against this mass of heroes and of conquerors in a dozen victorious campaignsmen who had no longer anything to lose but life and to whom life meant less than nothing nowagainst them a handful of halftrained recruits drunk with the cry of victory which drowned the roar of the cannon and the clash of sabres drunk with the vision of glory which awaited them if that defiant eagle were brought to earth by them  and as bobby staggered to his feet he already saw the impending catastropheone of the many on this day of cumulative disasters he saw the dutch and the belgians and the brunswickers rush wildly to the chargeyoung menenthusiastsbravebut men whose ranks had twice been broken todaywho twice had rallied to their colours and then had broken againmen who were exhaustedmen who were none too ably ledmen in factand there were many french royalists among their officerswho had not the physical power of endurance which had enabled the british to astonish the world today  bobby could see amongst them the brunswickers and their black coatshe would have known them amongst millions of men the full brilliance of the evening glow was upon themon their black coats and the silver galoons and tassels two of their officers had made a brave show in brussels three daysor was it a hundred yearsago at the duchess of richmonds ball bobby remembered them so well for one of these two officers was maurice de st genis  oh how crystal would love to see him noweven though her dear heart would be torn with anxiety for himfor he was fighting bravely bravely and desperately as every one had fought today as these chasseurs of the old guardjust the few of them that remainedwere fighting still even at this hour round that tattered flag and that bronze eagle and with the cry of vive lempereur dying upon their lips  despair indeed on both sideseven at this hour when the merest incident might yet turn the issue of this worldconflict one way or the other bobby as he steadied himself on his feet had seen that the attack was already turning into a rout not only had pelets chasseurs held the dutch and brunswickers at bay not only had their tirailleurs made deadly havoc among their assailants but the latter now were threatened with absolute annihilation even whilst all around them their alliesbritish and prussianwere crying victory  bobby could see them quite clearlyfor he saw with that subtle and delicate sense which only a great and pure passion can givehe saw the danger at the very moment when it was bornat the precise instant when it threatened that handful of blackcoated men one of whose officers was named st genis he saw the first sign of wavering of stupefaction that followed the impetuous charge he saw the gaps in the ranks after that initial deadly volley from the tirailleurs it almost seemed as if he could hear those shouts of vive lempereur and the rallying cry of commanding officersit was all so nearnot more than three hundred yards away and the clear stormy atmosphere carried sights and sounds upon its wing  another volley from the tirailleurs and the dutch and brunswickers turned to fly in vain did their officers call they wanted to get away they tried to flyto run for now the chasseurs were at them with bayonetsthey tried to run but the ground was littered with their own wounded and deadwith the wounded and the dead of a long day of carnage they stumbled at every stepfell over the dying and the woundedover dead and wounded horsesover piles of guns and swords and bayonets and sabretaches over forsaken guns and broken carriages litter that impeded them in front even as they were driven with the bayonet from the rear  bobby saw it all for they were coming nowpursued and pursuersas fast as ever they could they were coming these flying blackcoated men casting away their gay trappings as well as their arms trying to runto get awaybut stumbling falling all the timepicking themselves up falling and running again  and in that one short moment while the whole brief tragedy was enacted before his eyes bobby also saw in a vision that was equally swift and fleeting the blue eyes of crystal drowned in tears he saw her with fair head drooping like a lily he saw the quiver of her lips heard the moan of pain that would come to her lips when the man she loved was brought home to herdead and in that same secondso full of portentbobby understood why it was that her sweet image had called to him for help just now again she called again she beckonedher blue eyes looked on him with an appeal that was allcompelling her two dear hands were clasped and she begged of him that he should be her friend  such visions come from god no man sees them save he whose soul is great and whose heart is pure poor bobby clyffurdelonely heartbroken desolatesaw the exquisite face that he would have loved to kisshe saw it with the golden glow of evening upon the delicate cheeks and with the lurid light of fire and battle upon the soft fair hair  and the greatness of his love helped him to understand what life still held for himthe happiness of supreme sacrifice  all around him was death but there was some life too one or two poor abandoned riderless horses were quietly picking bits of corn from between the piles of dead and dying men or were standing sniffing the air with dilated nostrils and snorting with terror at the deafening noise bobby had steadied himself neither his head nor his limbs were aching nowat any rate he had forgotten themall that he remembered was what he saw those blackcoated brunswickers who longed to fly and could not and who were being slaughtered like insects even as they stumbled and fled  and bobby caught the bridle of one of these poor terrorstricken beasts that stood snorting and sniffing not far away he crawled up into the saddle for his thigh was numb and one of his arms helpless but once on horseback he could get alongover trampled corn and over the deadon toward that hideous corner behind the farm of la haye sainte where desperate men were butchering others that were more desperate than theyin among that seething crowd of black coats and fur bonnets of silver tassels and of brass eagles into a whirlpool of swords and bayonets and gunfire from the tirailleursfor there he had seen the man whom crystal lovedfor whose sake she would eat out her heart with mourning and regret  in the deafening noise of shrieking and sighs and whizzing bullets and cries of agony he heard crystals voice telling him what to do already he had seen st genis struggling on his knees not fifty mètres away from the first line of tirailleurs not a hundred from the advancing steel wall of fixed bayonets maurice had thrown back his head in the hopelessness of his despair the evening sun fell full upon his haggard bloodstained face upon his wideopen eyes filled with the terror of death the next moment bobby clyffurde was by his side all around him bullets were whizzingall around him men sighed their last sigh of agony he stooped over his saddle can you pull yourself up he called and with his one sound arm he caught maurice by the elbow and helped him to struggle to his feet the horse dazed with terror snorted at the smell of blood but he did not move maurice equally dazed scrambled into the saddlealmost inerta dead weighta thing that impeded progress and movement but the thing that crystal loved above all things on earth and which bobby knew he must wrest out of these devouring jaws of death and laysafe and soundwithin the shelter of her arms   iv  after that it meant a strugglenot for his own life for indeed he cared little enough for thatbut for the sake of the burden which he was carryinga burden of infinite preciousness since crystals heart and happiness were bound up with it  maurice de st genis clung half inert to him with one hand gripping the saddlebow the other clutching bobbys belt with convulsive tenacity bobby himself was only half conscious dazed with the pain of wounds the exertion of hoisting that dead weight across his saddle the deafening noise of whizzing bullets round him the boring of the frightened horse against its bridle as it tried to pick its way through the tangled heaps upon the ground  but every moment lessened the danger from stray bullets and the chance of the bayonet charge from behind the cries of vive lempereur round that still standing eagle were drowned in the medley and confusion of hundreds of other sounds bobby was just able to guide his horse away from the spots where the fighting was most hot and fierce where vivians hussars attacked those two battalions of cuirassiers where adams brigade of artillery turned the flank of the chasseurs and laid the proud bronze eagle low where ney and the old guard were showing to the rest of the grand army how grizzled veterans fought and died  he rode straight up the plateau however but well to the right now picking his way carefully with that blind instinct which the tracked beast possesses and which the hunted man sometimes receives from god  the dead and the dying were less thick here upon the ground it was here that earlier in the day the dutch and the belgians and the brunswickers had supported the british left during those terrific cavalry charges which british endurance and tenacity had alone been able to withstand it was here that hackes cumberland hussars had broken their ranks and fled taking to brussels and thence to ghent the news of terrific disaster bobbys lips were tight set and he snorted like a warhorse when he thought of thatwhen he thought of the misery and sorrow that must be reigning in brussels nowand of the consternation at ghent where the poor old bourbon king was probably mourning his dead hopes and his vanished throne  in brussels women would be weeping and crystalforlorn and desolatewould perhaps be sitting at her window watching the stream of fugitives that came inwounded and exhaustedfrom the field of battle recounting tales of a catastrophe which had no parallel in modern times and crystal seeing and hearing this would think of the man she loved and believing him to be dead would break her heart with sorrow  and when bobby thought of that he was spurred to fresh effort and he pulled himself together with a desperate tension of every nerve and sinew fighting exhaustion ignoring pain conjuring up the vision of crystals blue eyes and her pleading look as she begged him to save her from lifelong sorrow and the anguish of future loneliness then he no longer heard the weird and incessant cannonade he no longer saw the desolation of this utter confusion around him he no longer felt exhausted or the weight of that lifeless impeding burden upon his saddlebow  stray bands of fugitives with pursuers hot on their heels passed him by stray bullets flew to right and left of him whizzing by with their eerie whistling sound he was now on the outskirts of the great pursuitanon he reached the crest of mont saint jean at last and almost blindly struck back eastward in the direction of the forest of soigne  it was blind instinctand nothing morethat kept him on his horse he clung to his saddle with halfparalysed knees just as a drowning man will clutch a floating bit of wreckage that helps him to keep his head above the water the stately trees of soigne were not far ahead now through the forest any track that bore to the left would strike the brussels road only a little more strengthanother effort or twothe cool solitude of the wood would ease the weight of the burden and the throbbing of nerves and brain the setting sun shone full upon the leafy edge of the wood hazelnut and beech and oak and clumps of briar rose quivered under the rough kiss of the wind that blew straight across the lowland from the southwest bringing with it still the confusion of soundsthe weird cannonades and dismal buglecallsin such strange contrast to the rustle of the leaves and the crackling of tiny twigs in the tangled coppice  how cool and delicious it must be under those treesand there was a narrow track which must lead straight to the brussels roadthe ground looked soft and mossy and damp after the rainoh for the strength to reach those leafy shadows to plunge under that thicket and brush with burning forehead against those soft green leaves heavy with moisture oh for the power to annihilate this distance of a few hundred yards that lie between this immense graveyard open to wind and scorching sun and the green cool moss and carpet of twigs and leaves and soft sweetsmelling earth on which a weary body and desolate soul might find eternal rest      v  on on through the forest of soigne there was no question as yet of rest  maurice had not yet wakened from his trance bobby vaguely wondered if he were not already dead there was no stain of blood upon his fine uniform but it was just possible that in stumbling running and falling he had hit his head or received a blow which had deprived him of consciousness directly after he had scrambled into the saddle  bobby remembered how pale and haggard he had looked and how his hand had by the merest instinct clutched at the saddlebow and then had dropped away from ithelpless and inert now he lay quite still with his head resting against bobbys shoulder  under the trees it was cool and the air was sweet and soothing bobby with his left hand contrived to tear a handful of leaves from the coppice as he passed they were full of moisture and he pressed them against maurices lips and against his own  the forest was full of sounds of running men and horses the rattle of wheels and the calls of terror and of pain with still and always that awesome background of persistent cannonade but bobby heard nothing saw nothing save the narrow track in front of him along which the horse now ambled leisurely and from time to timewhen he looked downthe pale haggard face of the man whom crystal loved  at one moment maurice opened his eyes and murmured feebly where am i  on the way to brussels bobby contrived to reply  a little later on horse and rider emerged out of the wood and the brussels road stretched out its long straight ribbon before bobby clyffurdes dull uncomprehending gaze  close by at his feet the milestone marked the last six kilomètres to brussels only another halfdozen kilomètresonly another hours ride at most    only    when even now he felt that the next few minutes must see him tumbling headforemost from the saddle  far away beyond the milestone on his rightin a meadow the boundary of which touched the edge of the woodwomen were busy tossing hay after the rain all unconscious of the simple little tragedy that was being enacted so close to them their cotton dresses and the kerchiefs round their heads stood out as trenchant vivid notes of colour against the dull grey landscape beyond a couple of haycarts were standing by beside them two men were lighting their pipes the wind was playing with the hay as the women tossed it and their shrill laughter came echoing across the meadow  and even now the ground was shaken with the repercussion of distant volleys of artillery and along the road a stream of men were running toward brussels horses galloped by frightened and riderless or dragging broken guncarriages behind them in the mud the whole of that stream was carrying the news of wellingtons disaster to brussels and to ghent not knowing that behind them had already sounded the passing bell for the empire of france  bobby had drawn rein on the edge of the wood to give his horse a rest and for a while he watched that running stream longing to shout to them to turn backthere was no occasion to runto see what had been done to take a share in that glorious final charge for victory but his throat was too parched for a shout and as he watched he saw in among a knot of mounted menfugitives like the others pale of face anxious of mien and with that intent look which men have when life is precious and has got to be savedhe saw a man in the same uniform that st genis worea brunswicker in black coat and silver galoonswho stared at him persistently and strangely as he rode by  the face though much altered by three days growth of beard and by the set of the shako worn right down to the brows was nevertheless a familiar one bobbystupefied deprived for the moment of thinking powers through sheer exhaustion and burning paintaxed his weary brain in vain to understand the look of recognition which the man in the black uniform cast upon him as he passed  until a lightly spoken hullo my dear clyffurde uttered gaily as the rider drew near to the edge of the road brought the name of victor de marmont to bobbys quivering lips  and just for the space of sixty seconds fate rubbed her gaunt hands complacently together seeing that she had brought these three men togetherhere on this spotthree men who loved the same woman each with the utmost ardour and passion at his commandeach even at this very moment striving to win her and to work for her happiness  behind them in the plains of waterloo the cannon still was roaring de marmont was on his way to redeem the fallen fortunes of the hero whom he worshipped and to win imperial regard imperial favours fortune and glory wherewith to conquer a girls obstinacy st genispale and unconsciousseemed even in his unconsciousness to defy the power of any rival by the might of early love of old associations of similarity of caste and of political ideals he had fought for the cause which she and he had both equally at heart and by his very helplessness now he seemed to prove that he could do no more than he had done and that he had the right to claim the solace and comfort which her girlish lips and her girlish love had promised him long ago  whilst bobby had nothing to promise and nothing to give save devotionhis hope his desire and his love were bounded by her happiness and since her happiness lay in the life of the man whom he had dragged out of the jaws of death what greater proof could he give of his love than to lay down his life for him and for her  de marmonts keen eyes took in the situation at a glance he threw a quick look of savage hatred on st genis and cast one of contemptuous pity on clyffurde then with a shrug of the shoulders and a light triumphant laugh he set spurs to his horse and rode swiftly away  bobbys lacklustre eyes followed horse and rider down the road till they grew smaller and smaller still and finally disappeared in the distance for a moment he felt puzzled what was de marmont doing in this stream of senseless panicstricken men what was he doing in the uniform of one of the allied nations why had he laughed so gaily and appeared so triumphant in his mien  did he not know then that his hero had fallen along with his mighty eagle that the brief adventure begun in the gulf of jouan had ended in a hopeless tragedy on the field of waterloo but why that uniform poor bobbys head ached too much to allow him to think and time was getting on  the road now was deserted the last of the fugitives formed but a cloud of black specks on the line of the horizon far off toward brussels from the hayfield there came the merry sound of womens laughter while far away cannon and musketry still roared and over the long straight roadbordered with straight poplar treesthe setting sun threw everlengthening shadows  maurice opened his eyes  where am i he asked again  close to brussels now replied bobby  to brussels murmured st genis feebly crystal  yes assented bobby crystal god bless her then as st genis was trying to move he added can you shift a little  i think so replied the other  if you could ease the pressure on my leg    steady now steady    can you sit up in the saddle    are you hurt     not much my head aches terribly i must have hit it against something but that is all i am only dizzy and sick  could you ride on to brussels alone think you  perhaps  it is not far the horse is very quiet he will amble along if you give him his head  but you  id like to rest ill find shelter in a cottage perhaps    or in the wood  st genis said nothing more for the moment he was intent on sliding down from the saddle without too much assistance from bobby when he had reached the ground it took him a little while to collect himself for his head was swimming he closed his eyes and put out a hand to steady himself against a tree  when maurice opened his eyes again bobby was sitting on the ground by the roadside the horse was nibbling a clump of fresh green grass  for the first time since that awful moment when stumbling and falling against a pile of dead with death behind and all around him he had heard the welcome call can you pull yourself up and felt the steadying grip upon his elbowmaurice de st genis looked upon the man to whom he owed his life  with that stained bandage round his head dulled and bloodshot eyes face blackened with powder and smoke and features drawn and haggard bobby clyffurde was indeed almost unrecognisable but maurice knew him on the instant hitherto he had not thought of how he had come out of that terrible hellfire behind la haye sainteindeed he had quickly lost consciousness and never regained it till now and now he knew that the same man who in the narrow hotel room near lyons had ungrudgingly rendered him a signal servicehad risked his life today for hismaurices sake  no one could have entered that awful mêlée and faced the bayonet charge of pelets cuirassiers and the hail of bullets from their tirailleurs without taking imminent risk of death yet clyffurde had done it why mauricewideeyed and sullencould only find one answer to that insistent question  that same deadly pang of jealousy which had assailed his heart after the midnight interview at the inn now held him in its cruel grip again he felt that he hated the man to whom he owed his life and that he hated himself for this mean and base ingratitude he would not trust himself to speak or to look on bobby at all lest the ugly thoughts which were floating through his mind set their stamp upon his face  will you ride on to brussels he said at last i can wait here    and perhaps you could send a conveyance for me later on m le comte de cambray would     m le comte de cambray and mademoiselle crystal are even now devoured with anxiety about you broke in clyffurde as firmly as he could and i could not ride to brusselseven though some one were waiting for me therei really am not able to ride further i would prefer to sit here and rest  i dont like to leave you    after    after what you have done for me    i would like to     i would like you to scramble into that saddle and go retorted bobby with a momentary return to his usual goodnatured irony and to leave me in peace  ill send out a conveyance for you rejoined st genis i know m le comte de cambray would wish     mention my name to m le comte at your peril    began clyffurde  but     by the lord man now exclaimed bobby with a sudden burst of energy if you do not go i vow that sick as i am and sick though you may be ill yet manage to punch your aching head  then as the otherstill reluctantlyturned to take hold of the horses bridle he added more gently can you mount  oh yes i am better now  you wont turn giddy and fall off your horse  i dont think so  talk about the halt leading the blind murmured clyffurde as he stretched himself out once more upon the soft ground whilst maurice contrived to hoist himself up into the saddle are you safe now he added as the young man collected the reins in his hand and planted his feet firmly into the stirrups  yes i am safe enough replied st genis it is only my head that aches and brussels is not far  then he paused a moment ere he started to gowith lips set tight and looking down on bobby whose pale face had taken on an ashen hue  how you must despise me he said bitterly  but bobby made no reply he was just longing to be left alone whilst the other still seemed inclined to linger  would to god maurice said with a sigh that m le comte heard the evil news from other lips than mine  evil news and bobby whom semiconsciousness was already taking off once more to the land of visions and of dreamswas brought back to realityas if with a sudden jerkwith those two preposterous little words  what evil news he asked  the allied armies have retreated all along the line    the corsican adventurer is victorious    our poor king     hold your tongue you young fool cried bobby hoarsely the lord help you but i do believe you are about to blaspheme     but     the allied armiesthe british army god bless ithave covered themselves with glorynapoleon and his empire have ceased to be the grand army is in full retreat    the prussians are in pursuit    the british have won the day by their pluck and their endurance    thank god i lived just long enough to see it all ere i fell     but when we charged the cuirassiers    began st genis not knowing really if bobby was raving in delirium or speaking of what he knew he wanted to ask further questions to hear something more before he started for brussels    the only thing which he remembered with absolute certainty was that awful charge of his regiment against the cuirassiers then the panic and the rout and he judged the whole issue of the battle by what had happened to a detachment of brunswickers  and yet of coursebefore the chargehe had seen and known all that bobby told him now that rush of the brunswickers and the dutch down the hillside was only a part of the huge and glorious charge of the whole of the allied troops against the routed grand army of napoleon he had neither the physical strength nor the desire to think out all that it would mean to him personally if what bobby now told him was indeed absolutely true  he was longing to make the wounded man rouse himself just once more and reiterate the glad news which meant so much to himmauriceand to crystal but it was useless to think of that now bobby was either unconscious or asleep for a moment a twinge of real pity made st genis heart ache for the man who seemed to be left so lonely and so desolate jealousy itself gave way before that more gentle feeling after all crystal could only be true to the love of her childhood her heart belonged to the companion the lover the ideal of her girlish dreams this stranger here loved herthat was obviousbut crystal had never looked on him with anything but indifference even that dance last night    but of this maurice would not think lest pity die out of his heart again    and jealousy and hate walk hand in hand with base ingratitude  he turned his horses head round to the road pressed his knees into its sides and then as the poor weary beast started to amble leisurely down the road maurice looked back for the last time on the prostrate pathetic figure of the lonely man who had given his all for him he looked at every landmark which would enable him to find that man againthe angle of the forest where it touched the meadowthe milestone the trees by the roadsideoh he meant to do his duty to do it well and quickly to send the conveyance to neglect nothing then with a sighhalf of bitterness yet full of satisfactionhe finally turned away and looked straight out before him into the distance where brussels lay and where the happiness of crystals love called to him and he would find rest and peace in the warm affection of her faithful heart     chapter xi  the losing hands   i  an hour later maurice de st genis was in brussels though his head still ached his mind was clear and thoughts of crystalof happiness with her now at last within sighthad chased every other thought away  his home had been with the de cambrays ever since those old sad days in england he had a home to go to nowa home where the kindly friendship of the comte as well as the love of crystal was ready to welcome him the warmth of anticipated happiness and wellbeing warmed his heart and gave strength to his body the horrors of the past few hours seemed all to have melted away behind him on the brussels road as did the remembrance of a manwounded himself and spentrisking his life for the sake of a friend not that st genis meant to be ungratefulnor did he forget that wounded manlying alone and sick on the fringe of the wood by the roadside  as soon as he had taken his horse round to the barracks in the rue des comédiens and before even he had a wash or had his uniform cleaned of stains and mud he rushed to the headquarters of the army service to see how soon a conveyance could be sent out to his friendand when he was unable to obtain what he wanted there he rushed from hospital to hospital thence to two or three doctors whom he knew of to see what could be done but the hospitals were already overfull and overbusy their ambulances were all already on the way as for the doctors they were all from homeall at work where their skill was most neededan army of doctors of ambulances and drivers would not suffice at this hour to bring all the wounded in from the spot where that awful battle was raging  and maurice saw time slipping by he had already spent an hour in a fruitless quest he longed to see crystal and waxed impatient at the delay anon at the english hospital a kindly personwho listened sympathetically to his talepromised him that the ambulance which was just setting out in the direction of mont saint jean would be on the lookout for his wounded friend by the roadside and maurice with a sigh of relief felt that he had indeed done his duty and done his best  at the english hospital clyffurde would be splendidly looked afternowhere else could he find such sympathetic treatment and maurice with a light heart went back to the barracks in the rue des comédiens where he had a wash and had his uniform cleaned somewhat refreshed though still very tired he hurried round to the rue du marais where the comte de cambray had his lodgings the first sight of brussels had already told him the whole pitiable tale of panic and of desolation which had filled the city in the wake of the fugitive troops the streets were encumbered with vehicles of every kindcarts barouches barrowswith horses loosely tethered with the wounded who lay about on litters of straw along the edges of the pavement in doorways under archways in the centre of open places with crowds of weeping women and crying children wandering aimlessly from place to place trying to find the loved one who might be lying here hurt or mayhap dying  and everywhere men in tattered uniforms with grimy hands and faces and boots kneedeep in stains of mud stood about or sat in the empty carts talking gesticulating giving sundry confused and contradictory accounts of the great battledescribing napoleons decisive victorywellingtons routthe prolonged absence of blücher and the prussians cause of the terrible disaster  m le comte dartois had rushed precipitately from brussels up to ghent to warn his majesty the king of france that all hope of saving his throne was now at an end and that the wisest course to pursue was to return to england and resign himself once more to obscurity and exile  m le prince de condé too had gone off to antwerp in a huge barouche having under his care the treasure and jewels of the crown hastily collected three months ago at the tuileries  in every open space a number of prisoners were being guarded by mixed patrols of dutch belgian or german soldiers and their cry of vive lempereur which they reiterated with unshakable obstinacy roused the ire of their captors and provoked many a savage blow and many a broken head  but st genis did not pause to look on these sights he had not the strength to stand up in the midst of these confused masses of terrordriven men and women and to shout to them that they were foolsthat all their panic must be turned to joy their lamentations to shouts of jubilation news of victory was bound to spread through the city within the next hour and he himself longed only to see crystal to reassure her as to his own safety to see the light of happiness kindled in her eyes by the news which he brought he had not the strength for more  it was old jeanne who opened the door at the lodgings in the rue du marais when maurice finally rang the bell there  m le marquis she exclaimed oh but you are ill  only very tired and weak jeanne he said it has been an awful day  ah but m le comte will be pleased  and mademoiselle crystal asked maurice with a smile which had in it all the selfconfidence of the accepted lover  mademoiselle crystal will be happy too said jeanne she has been so unhappy so desperately anxious all day  can i see her  mademoiselle is out for the moment m le marquis and m le comte has gone to the cercle des légitimistes in the rue des cendresperhaps m le marquis knowsit is not far  i would like to see mademoiselle crystal first you understand dont you jeanne  yes i do m le marquis sighed faithful jeanne who was always inclined to be sentimental  how long will she be do you think  oh another half hour perhaps more mademoiselle has gone to the cathedral if m le marquis will give himself the trouble to walk so far he cannot fail to see mademoiselle when she comes out of church  but alreadybefore jeanne had finished speakingmaurice had turned on his heel and was speeding back down the narrow street tired and weak as he was his one idea was to see crystal to hear her voice to see the lovelight in her eyes he felt that at sight of her all fatigue would be gone all recollections of the horrors of this day wiped out with the first look of joy and relief with which she would greet him   ii  the service was over and the congregation had filed out of the cathedral crystal was one of the last to go she stood for a long while in the porch looking down with unseeing eyes on the bustle and excitement which went on in the place down below her mind was not here it was far indeed from the crowd of terrorstricken or gossiping men and women of wounded soldiers terrified peasantry and anxious townsfolk that encumbered the precincts of the stately edifice  from the remote distanceout toward the southcame the boom and roar of cannon and musket firealmost incessant still there was her heart there her thoughts with the brave men who were fighting for their national existencewith the british troops and with their sufferingsand she stood here staring straight out before herdryeyed and pale and small white hands clasped tightly together  the greater part of today she had sat by the open window in the shabby drawingroom in the rue du marais listening to that awful fusillade wondering with mind wellnigh bursting with horror and with misery which of those cruel shots which she heard in the dim distance would still for ever the brave and loyal heart that had made so many silent sacrifices for her  and her father vaguely thinking that she was anxious about mauricevaguely wondering that she cared so muchhad done his best to try and comfort her she need not fear much for maurice he had told her as reassuringly as he couldthe brunswickers were not likely to suffer much the brunt of the conflict would fall upon the british ah but they would lose very heavily wellington had not more than seventy thousand men to put up against the corsicans troops and only a hundred and fifty cannon against two hundred and eighty yes the british would probably be annihilated by superior forces but no doubt the other alliesand the brunswickerswould come off a great deal better  but mme la duchesse douairière dagen offered no such consolation she contented herself with saying that she was sure in her mind that maurice would come through quite safely and that she prayed to god with all her heart and soul that the gallant british troops would not suffer too heavily then with her fine gentle hand she patted crystals fair curls which were clinging matted and damp against the young girls burning forehead and she stooped and kissed those aching dry blue eyes and whispered quite under her breath so that crystal could not be sure if she heard correctly may god protect him too he is a brave and a good man  and then crystal had gone out to seek peace and rest in beautiful old ste gudule so full of memories of other conflicts other prayers other deeds of heroism of long ago here in the dim light and the silence and the peace her quivering nerves had become somewhat stilled and when she came out she was able just for the moment neither to see or hear the terrormongers down below and only to think of the heroes out there on the field of battle for whom she had just prayed with such passionate earnestness  suddenly in the crowd she recognised maurice he was coming up the cathedral steps looking for her no doubtjeanne must have directed him when he drew near to her he saw that a look of happy surprise and of true joy lit up the delicate pathos of her face he ran quickly to her now he would have taken her in his armshere in face of the crowdbut there was something in her manner which instinctively sobered him and he had to be content with the little cold hands which she held out to him and with imprinting a kiss upon her finger tips  already in his eyes she had read that the news which he brought was not so bad as rumour had foretold  maurice she cried excitedly with a little catch in her throat you are well and safe thank god and what news     the news is good maurice replied victory is assured by now it has been a hard day but we have won  she said nothing for a moment but the tears gathered in her eyes her lips quivered and maurice knew that she was thanking god then she turned back to him and he could see her face glowing with excitement  and our allies she asked and now that little catch in her throat was more marked the british troops    we heard that they behaved like heroes and bore the brunt of this awful battle  i dont know much about the british troops my sweet he replied lightly but what news i have i will have to impart to your father as well as to you so it will have to keep until i see him    but just now crystal while we are alone    i have other things to say to you  but it is doubtful if crystal heard more than just the first words which he had spoken for she broke in quite irrelevantly  you dont know about the british troops maurice oh but you must know    dont you know what british regiments were engaged     i know that none of our own people were in british regiments crystal he retorted somewhat drily whereas the brunswickers and nassauers were as much french as german    they fought gallantly all day    you do not ask so much about them  but    she stammered while a hot flush spread over her cheeks i thought    you said     are you not content for the moment crystal he called out with tender reproach to know that victory has crowned our king and his allies and that i have come back to you safely out of that raging hell at waterloo are you not glad that i am here  he spoke more vehemently now for there was something in crystals calm attitude which had begun to chill him had he not been in deadly danger all the day had she not heard that distant cannons roar which had threatened his life throughout all these hours had he not come back out of the very jaws of death  and yet here she stood white as a lily and as unruffled except for that one first exclamation of joy not a single cry from the heart had forced itself through her pale slightly trembling lips yet she was sweet and girlish and tender as of old and even now at the implied reproach her eyes had quickly filled with tears  how can you ask maurice she protested gently i have thought of you and prayed for you all day  it was her quiet serenity that disconcerted himthe kindly tone of her voiceher calm unembarrassed manner checked his passionate impulse and caused him to bite his underlip with vexation until it bled  the shadows of evening were closing in around them from the windows of the houses close by dim yellow lights began to blink like eyes overhead the exquisite towers of ste gudule stood out against the stormy sky like perfect delicate lacework turned to stone whilst the glass of the west window glittered like a sheet of sapphires and emeralds and rubies as it caught the last rays of the sinking sun crystals graceful figure stood out in its white summer draperies clear and crystalline as herself against the sombre background of the cathedral porch  and maurice watched her through the dim shadows of gathering twilight he watched her as a fowler watches the bird which he has captured and never wholly tamed somehow he felt that her love for him was not quite what it had been until now that she was no longer the same girlish submissive creature on whose soft cheeks a word or look from him had the power to raise a flush of joy  she was different nowin a curious intangible way which he could not define  and jealousy reared up its threatening head more insistentlybitter jealousy which embraced de marmont clyffurde fate and circumstancebut clyffurde above allthe stranger hitherto deemed of no account but who nowwounded abandoned dying perhapsseemed a more formidable rival than maurice awhile ago had deemed possible  he cursed himself for that touch of sentimenthe called it cowardicewhich the other night after the ball had prompted him to write to crystal but for that voluntary confessionhe thoughtshe could never have despised him and following up the train of his own thoughts and realising that these had not been spoken aloud he suddenly called out abruptly  is it because of my letter crystal  she gave a start and turned even paler than she had been before obviously she had been brought roughly back from the land of dreams  your letter maurice she asked vaguely what do you mean  i wrote you a letter the other night he continued speaking quickly and harshly after the ball did you receive it  yes  and read it  of course  and is it because of it that your love for me has gone  he had not meant to put his horrible suspicions into words the very factnow that he had spokenappeared more tangible even irremediable she did not reply to his taunt and he came a little closer to her and took her hand and when she tried to withdraw it from his grasp he held it tightly and bent down his head so that in the gathering gloom he could read every line of her face  because of what i told you in my letter you despised me did you not he asked  again she made no reply what could she say that would not hurt him far more than did her silence the next moment he had drawn her back right into the shadow of the cathedral walls into a dark angle where no one could see either her or him he placed his hands upon her shoulders and compelled her to look him straight in the face  listen crystal he said slowly and with desperate earnestness once long ago i gave you up to de marmont to affluence and to considerations of your name and of our caste it all but broke my heart but i did it because your father demanded that sacrifice from you and from me i was ready then to stand aside and to give up all the dreams of my youth    but now everything is different for one thing the events of the past hundred days have made every man many years older the hell i went through today has helped to make a more sober more determined man of me now i will not give you up i will not my way is clear i can win you with your fathers consent and give him and you all that de marmont had promised the king trusts me and will give me what i ask i am no longer a wastrel no longer poor and obscure and i will not give you upi swear it by all that i have gone through today i will not if i have to kill with my own hand every one who stands in my way  and crystal smiling quite kindly and a little abstractedly at his impulsive earnestness gently removed his hands from her shoulders and said calmly  you are tired maurice and overwrought shall we go in and wait for father he will be getting anxious about me and without waiting to see if he followed her she turned to walk toward the steps  st genis smothered a violent oath but he said nothing more he was satisfied with what he had done he knew that women liked a masterful man and he meant every word which he said he would not give her up    not now    and not to    ye gods he would not think of thathe would not think of the lonely roadside nor of the wounded man who had robbed him of crystals love he had done his duty by clyffurdewhat more could he have done at this hourand he meant to do far more than thathe meant to go back to the english hospital as soon as possible to see that clyffurde had every attention every care every comfort that human sympathy can bestow what more could he do he would have done no good by going out with the ambulance himselfsurely nothe would have missed seeing crystaland she would have fretted and been still more anxious    his first duty was to crystal    and    and    st genis only thought of crystal and of himself and the voice of conscience was compulsorily stilled   iii  having lulled his conscience to sleep and satisfied his selflove by a passionate tirade maurice followed crystal down the steps at the west front of ste gudule  immediately opposite them at the corner of the narrow rue de ligne was the old auberge des trois rois from whence the diligence started twice a day in time to catch the tide and the english packet at ostend maurice and crystal stood for a moment together on the steps watching the bustle and excitement the comings and goings of the crowd which always attend such departures all day there had been a steady stream of fugitives out of the town taking their belongings with them the diligence was for the welltodo and the indifferent who hurried away to england to await the advent of more settled times  victor de marmont had secured his place inside the coach he had exchanged his borrowed uniform for civilian clothes he had bestowed his belongings in the vehicle and he was standing about desultorily waiting for the hour of departure the diligence would not arrive at ostend till five oclock in the morning then with the tide the packet would go out getting into london well after midday chance as represented by the tide had seriously handicapped de marmonts plans but enthusiasm and doggedness of purpose whispered to him that he still held the winning card the english packet was timed to arrive in london by two oclock in the afternoon he would still have two hours to his credit before closing time on change and another hour in the street time to find his broker and half an hour to spare that would still leave him an hour wherein to make a fortune for his emperor  at one time he was afraid that he would not be able to secure a seat in the diligence so numerous were the travellers who wished to leave brussels behind them but in this chance and the length of his purse favoured him he bought his seat for an exorbitant price but he bought it and at nine oclock the diligence was timed to start  it was now halfpast eight and just then de marmont caught sight of crystal and st genis coming down the cathedral steps  he had half an hour to spare and he followed them he wanted to speak to crystalhe had wanted it all daybut the difficulty of getting what clothes he required and the trouble and time spent in bargaining for a seat in the diligence had stood in his way m le comte de cambray would never of course admit him inside his doors and it would have meant hanging about in the rue du marais and trusting to a chance meeting with crystal when she went out and for this he had not the time  and the chance meeting had come about in spite of all adverse circumstances and de marmont followed crystal through the crowded streets hoping that st genis would take leave of her before she went indoors but even if he did not de marmont meant to have a few words with crystal he was going to win a gigantic fortune for the emperorone wherewith that greatest of all adventurers could once again recreate the empire of france he himselfrich alreadywould become richer still and alsoif his coup succeededone of the most trusted most influential men in the recreated empire he felt that with the offer of his name he could pour out a veritable cornucopia of abundant glory honours wealth at a womans feet and his ambition had always been bound up in a great measure with crystal de cambray he certainly loved her in his way for her beauty and her charm but above all he looked on her as the very personification of the old and proud regime which had thought fit to scorn the parvenu noblesse of the empire and for a powerful adherent of napoleon to be possessed of a wife out of that exclusive milieu was like a fresh and glorious trophy of war on a conquerors chariotwheel  de marmont had the supreme faith of an ambitious man in the power of wealth and of court favour he knew that napoleon was not a man who ever forgot a service efficiently rendered and would repay this onerendered at the supreme hour of disasterwith a surfeit of gratitude and of gifts which must perforce dazzle any womans eyes and conquer her imagination  besides his schemes his ambitions the future which awaited him what had an impecunious wastrel like st genis to offer to a woman like crystal de cambray   outside the house in the rue du marais where the comte de cambray lodged st genis and crystal paused and de marmont who still kept within the shadows waited for a favourable opportunity to make his presence known  ill find m le comte and bring him back with me he heard st genis saying you are sure i shall find him at the légitimiste  quite sure crystal replied he did not mean to leave the cercle till about nine he is sure to wait for every bit of news that comes in  it will be a great moment for me if i am the first to bring in authentic good news  you will be quite the first i should say she assented but dont let father stay too long talking bring him back quickly remember i havent heard all the news yet myself  st genis went up to the front door and rang the bell then he took leave of crystal de marmont waited his opportunity anon jeanne opened the door and st genis walked quickly back down the street  crystal paused a moment by the open door in order to talk to jeanne and while she did so de marmont slipped quickly past her into the house and was some way down the corridor before the two women had recovered from their surprise jeanne as was her wont was ready to scream but despite the fast gathering gloom crystal had at once recognised de marmont she turned a cold look upon him  an intrusion monsieur she asked quietly  well call it that mademoiselle an you will he replied imperturbably and if you will kindly order your servant to go it shall be a very brief one  my father is from home she said  de marmont smiled and shrugged his shoulders  i know that he said or i would not be here  then your intrusion is that of a coward if you knew that i was unprotected  are you afraid of me crystal he asked with a sneer  i am afraid of no one she replied but since you and i have nothing to say to one another i beg that you will no longer force your company upon me  your pardon but there is something very important which i must say to you i have news of todays doings out there at waterloo which bear upon the whole of your future and upon your happiness i myself leave for england in less than half an hour i was taking my place in the diligence outside the trois rois when i saw you coming down the cathedral steps fate has given me an opportunity for which i sought vainly all day you will never regret it crystal if you listen to me now  i listen she broke in coolly i pray you be as brief as you can  will you order the servant to go  for a moment longer she hesitated commonsense told her that it was neither prudent nor expedient to hold converse with this man who was an avowed and bitter enemy of her cause but he had spoken of the doings at waterloo and spoken of them in connection with her own future and her happiness andprudent or notshe wanted to hear what he had to say in the vague hope that from a chance word carelessly dropped by victor de marmont she would glean if only a scrap some news of that on which st genis would not dwell but on which hung her heart and her very lifethe fate of the british troops  after all he might know something he might say something which would help her to bear this intolerable misery of uncertainty and on the merest chance of that she threw prudence to the winds  you may go jeanne she said but remain within call leave the front door open she added m le comte and m le marquis will be here directly  oh you are well protected said victor de marmont with a careless shrug of the shoulders as jeannes heavy shuffling footsteps died away down the corridor  now m de marmont said crystal coolly i listen  she was leaning back against the wallher hands behind her her pale face and large blue eyes with their black dilated pupils turned questioningly upon him the walls of the corridor were painted white after the manner of flemish houses the tiled floor was white too and crystal herself was dressed all in white so that the whole scene made up of pale soft tints looked weird and ghostly in the twilight and crystal like an ethereal creature come down from the land of nymphs and of elves  and de marmont toolike st genis a while agofelt that never had this beautiful womanshe was no longer a girl nowlooked more exquisite and more desirable and heconscious of the power which fortune and success can give thought that he could woo and win her once again in spite of casteprejudice and of political hatred st genis had felt his position unassailable by virtue of old associations common sympathies and youthful vows de marmont relied on feminine ambition love of power of wealth and of station and at this moment in crystals shining eyes he only read excitement and the unspoken desire for all that he was prepared to offer  i have only a few moments to spare crystal he said slowly and with earnest emphasis so i will be very brief for the moment the emperor has suffered a defeatas he did at eylau or at leipzichis defeats are always momentary his victories alone are decisive and abiding the whole world knows that it needs no proclaiming from me but in order to retrieve that momentary defeat of today he has deigned to ask my help the gods are good to me they have put it within my power to help my emperor in his need i am going to england tonight in order to carry out his instructions by tomorrow afternoon i shall have finished my work the empire of france will once more rise triumphant and glorious out of the ashes of a brief defeat the emperor once more phœbuslike will drive the chariot of the sun lord and master of europe greater since his downfall more powerful more majestic than ever before and i who will have been the humble instrument of his reconquered glory will deserve to the full his bounty and his gratitude  he paused for lack of breath for indeed he had talked fast and volubly crystals voice cold and measured broke in on the silence that ensued  and in what way does all this concern me m de marmont she asked  it concerns your whole future crystal he replied with evergrowing solemnity and conviction you must have known all along that i have never ceased to love you you have always been the only possible woman for memy ideal in fact your fathers injustice i am willing to forget your troth was plighted to me and i have done nothing to deserve all the insults which he thought fit to heap upon me i wanted you to know crystal that my love is still yours and that the fortune and glory which i now go forth to win i will place with inexpressible joy at your feet  she shrugged her shoulders and an air of supreme indifference spread over her face is that all she asked coldly  all what do you mean i dont understand  i mean that you persuaded me to listen to you on the pretence that you had news to tell me of the doings at waterloonews on which my happiness depended you have not told me a single fact that concerns me in the least  it concerns you as it concerns me crystal your happiness is bound up with mine you are still my promised wife i go to win glory for my name which will soon be yours you and i crystal hand in hand think of it our love has survived the political turmoilsunited in love united in glory you and i will be the most brilliant stars that will shine at the imperial court of france  she did not try to interrupt his tirade but looked on him with cool wonderment as one gazes on some curious animal that is raving and raging behind iron bars when he had finished she said quietly  you are mad i think m de marmont at any rate you had better go now time is getting on and you will lose your place in the diligence  he was less to her than the dust under her feet and his protestations had not even the power to rouse her wrath indeed all that worried her at this moment was vexation with herself for having troubled to listen to him at all it had been worse than foolish to suppose that he had any news to impart which did not directly concern himself so now while he utterly taken aback was staring at her openmouthed and bewildered she turned away cold and full of disdain gathering her draperies round her and started to walk slowly toward the stairs her clinging white skirt made a soft swishing sound as it brushed the tiled floor and she herselfwith her slender figure graceful neck and crown of golden curls looked as the gloom of evening wrapped her in more like an intangible elfan apparitiongliding through space than just a scornful woman who had thought fit to reject the importunate addresses of an unwelcome suitor  she left de marmont standing there in the corridorlike some presumptuous beggarburning with rage and humiliation too insignificant even to be feared but he was not the man to accept such a situation calmly his love for crystal had never been anything but a selfish oneborn of the desire to possess a highborn elegant wife taken out of the very caste which had scorned him and his kind her acquiescence he had always taken for granted her love he meant to win after his wooing of her hand had been successfuluntil then he could wait so certain too was he of his own power to win her in virtue of all that he had to offer that he would not take her scorn for real or her refusal to listen to him as final   iv  before she had reached the foot of the stairs he was already by her side and with a masterful hand upon her arm had compelled her by physical strength to turn and to face him once more  crystal he said forcing himself to speak quietly even though his voice quivered with excitement and passionate wrath as you say i have only a few moments to spare but they are just long enough for me to tell you that it is you who are mad i daresay that it is difficult to believe in the immensity of a disaster m de st genis no doubt has been filling your ears with tales of the allied armies victories but look at me crystallook at me and tell me if you have ever seen a man more in deadly earnest i tell you that i am on my way to aid the emperor in reforming his empire on a more solid basis than it has ever stood before have you ever known napoleon to fail in what he set himself to do i tell you that he is not crushedthat he is not even defeated within a month the allies will be on their knees begging for peace the era of your bourbon kings is more absolutely dead today than it has ever been and after today there will be nothing for a royalist like your father or like maurice de st genis but exile and humiliation more dire than before your fathers fate rests entirely in your hands i can direct his destiny his life or his death just as i please when you are my wife i will forgive him the insults which he heaped on me at brestalou    but not before    as for maurice de st genis     and what of him you abominable cur  the shout which came from behind him checked the words on de marmonts lips he let go his hold of crystals arm as he felt two sinewy hands gripping him by the throat the attack was so swift and so unexpected that he was entirely off his guard he lost his footing upon the slippery floor and before he could recover himself he was being forced back and back until his spine was bent nearly double and his head pressed down backward almost to the level of his knees  let him go maurice you might kill him throw him out of the door  it was m le comte de cambray who spoke he and st genis had arrived just in time to save crystal from a further unpleasant scene she however had not lost her presence of mind she had certainly listened to de marmonts final tirade because she knew that she was helpless in his hands but she had never been frightened for a moment jeanne was within call and she herself had never been timorous at the same time she was thankful enough that her father and st genis were here  maurice was almost blind with rage he would have killed de marmont but for the comtes timely words which luckily had the effect of sobering him at this critical moment he relaxed his convulsive grip on de marmonts throat but the latter had already lost his balance he fell heavily his body sliding along the slippery floor while his head struck against the projecting woodwork of the door  he uttered a loud cry of pain as he fell then remained lying inert on the ground and in the dim light his face took on an ashen hue  in an instant crystal was by his side  you have killed him maurice she cried as womanliketender and full of compassion nowshe ran to the stricken man  i hope i have said st genis sullenly he deserved the death of a cur  father dear said crystal authoritatively will you call to jeanne to bring water a sponge towelsquickly also some brandy  she paid no heed to st genis and she had already forgotten de marmonts dastardly attitude toward herself she only saw that he was helpless and in pain she knelt by his side pillowed his head on her lap and with soothing gentle fingers felt his shoulders his arms to see where he was hurt he opened his eyes very soon and encountered those tender blue eyes so full of sweet pity now it is only my head i think he said  then he tried to move but fell back again with a groan of pain my leg is broken i am afraid he murmured feebly  i had best fetch a doctor rejoined m le comte  if you can find one father dear said crystal m de marmont ought to be moved at once to his home  no no protested victor feebly not home to the trois rois    the diligence    i must go to england tonight    the emperors orders  the doctor will decide said crystal gently father dear will you go  jeanne came with water and brandy de marmont drank eagerly of the one and then sipped the other  i must go he said more firmly the diligence starts at nine oclock  again he tried to move and a great cry of agony rose to his throatnot of physical pain though that was great too but the wild agonising shriek of mental torment of disappointment and wrath and misery greater than human heart could bear  the emperors orders he cried i must go  crystal was silent there was something great and majestic something that compelled admiration and respect in this tragic impotence this failure brought about by uncontrolled passion at the very hour when successperhapsmight yet have changed the whole destinies of the world de marmont lying here helpless to aid his emperorthrough the furious and jealous attack of a rivalwas at this moment more worthy of a good womans regard than he had been in the flush of his success and of his arrogance for his one thought was of the emperor and what he could no longer do for him he tried to move and could not the emperors orders came at times with pathetic persistence from his lips and crystalwomanliketried to soothe and comfort him in his failure even though his triumph would only have aroused her scorn  and time sped on from the towers of the cathedral came booming the hour of nine the shadows in the narrow street were long and dark only a pale thin reflex of the cold light of the moon struck into the open doorway and the white corridor and detached de marmonts pale face from the surrounding gloom  the emperors orders and because of a woman these could now no longer be obeyed if de marmont had not seen crystal on the cathedral steps if he had not followed herif he had not allowed his passion and arrogant selfwill to blind him to time and to surroundingswho knows but the whole map of europe might yet have been changed  a fortune in london was awaiting a gambler who chose to stake everything on a last throwa fortune wherewith the greatest adventurer the world has ever known might yet have reconstituted an army and reconquered an empireand he who might have won that fortune was lying in the narrow corridor of an humble lodging housewith a broken leghelpless and eating out his heart now with vain regret why because of a girl with fair curls and blue eyesjust a womanyoung and desirableanother tiny pawn in the hands of the great master of this worlds game  the rain in the morning at waterlooblüchers arrival or grouchysa mans selfish passion for a woman who cared nothing for himwho shall dare to say that these tiny trivial incidents changed the destinies of the world  think on it o ye materialists ye worshippers of chance is it indeed the infinitesimal doings of pigmies that bring about the great upheavals of the earth do ye not rather see gods will in that fall of rain gods breath in those dying heroes who fell on mont saint jean do ye not recognise that it was gods finger that pointed the way to blücher and stretched de marmont down helpless on the ground   v  the arrival of m le comte de cambray accompanied by a doctor and two men carrying an improvised stretcher broke the spell of silence that had fallen on this strange scene of pathetic failure which seemed but an humble counterpart of that great and irretrievable one which was being enacted at this same hour far away on the road to genappe  after the booming of the cathedral clock de marmont had ceased to struggle he accepted defeat probably because he tooin spite of himselfsaw that the day of his idols destiny was over and that the brilliant star which had glittered on the firmament of europe for a quarter of a century had by the will of god now irretrievably declined he had accepted crystals ministrations for his comfort with a look of gratitude jeanne had put a pillow to his head and he lay now outwardly placid and quiescent  even perhapsfor such is human nature and such the heart of youthas he saw crystals sweet face bent with so much pity toward him a sense of hope of happiness yet to be chased the more melancholy thoughts away crystal was kindhe argued to himselfshe has already forgivenwomen are so ready to forgive faults and errors that spring from an intensity of love  he sought her hand and she gave itjust as a sweet sister of mercy and gentleness would do for whom the individual maneven the enemydoes not existonly the suffering human creature whom her touch can soothe he persuaded himself easily enough that when he pressed her hand she returned the pressure and renewed hope went forth once more soaring upon the wings of fancy  then the doctor came m le comte had been fortunate in securing himhad with impulsive generosity promised him ample paymentand then brought him along without delay he praised mlle de cambray for her kindness to the patient asked a few questions as to how the accident had occurred and was satisfied that m de marmont had slipped on the tiled floor and then struck his head against the door he was not likely to examine the purple bruises on the patients throat his business began and ended with a broken leg to mend as m le comte de cambray assured him that m de marmont was very wealthy the worthy doctor most readily offered his patient the hospitality of his own house until complete recovery  he then superintended the lifting of the sick man on to the stretcher and having taken final leave of m le comte mademoiselle and all those concerned and given his instructions to the bearers he was the first to leave the house  m le comte pleasantly conscious of christian duty toward an enemy nobly fulfilled nodded curtly to de marmont whom he hated with all his heart and then turned his back on an exceedingly unpleasant scene fervently wishing that it had never occurred in his house and equally fervently thankful that the accident had not more fateful consequences he retired to his smokingroom calling to st genis and to crystal to follow him  but crystal did not go at once she stood in the dark corridorquite stillwatching the stretcher bearers in their careful silent work little guessing on what a filmy thread her whole destiny was hanging at this moment the fates were spinning spinning spinning and she did not know it had the solemn silence which hung so ominously in the twilight not been broken till after the sick man had been borne away the whole of crystals future would have been shaped differently  but as with the rain at waterloo god had need of a tool for the furtherance of his will and it was maurice de st genis whom he chosemaurice who with his own words set the final seal to his destiny  de marmonts eyes as he was being carried over the threshold dwelt upon the graceful form of crystalclad all in whiteall womanliness and gentleness nowher sweet face only faintly distinguishable in the gloom st genis whose nerves were still jarred with all that he had gone through today and irritated by crystals assiduity beside the sick man resented that last look of farewell which de marmont dared to throw upon the woman whom he loved an ungenerous impulse caused him to try and aim a last moral blow at his enemy  come crystal he said coldly the man has been better looked after than he deserves but for your fathers interference i should have wrung his neck like the cowardly brute that he was  and with the masterful air of a man who has both right and privilege on his side he put his arm round crystals waist and tried to draw her away and as he did so he whispered a tender come crystal in her ear  de marmontwho at this moment was taking a last fond look at the girl he loved and was busy the while making plans for a happy future wherein crystal would play the chief rôle and would console him for all disappointments by the magnitude of her lovede marmont was brought back from the land of dreams by the tender whisperings of his rival his own helplessness sent a flood of jealous wrath surging up to his brain the wild hatred which he had always felt for st genis ever since that awful humiliation which he had suffered at brestalou now blinded him to everything save to the fact that here was a rival who was gloating over his helplessnessa man who twice already had humiliated him before crystal de cambraya man who had every advantage of caste and of community of sympathy a man therefore who must be in his turn irretrievably crushed in the sight of the woman whom he still hoped to win  de marmont had no definite idea as to what he meant to do perhaps just at this moment the pale intangible shadow of reason had lifted up one corner of the veil that hid the truth from before his eyesthe absolute and naked fact that crystal de cambray was not destined for him she would never marry himnever the empire of france was no morethe emperor was a fugitive to st genis and his caste belonged the futureand the turn had come for the adherents of the fallen emperor to sink into obscurity or to go into exile  be that as it may it is certain that in this fateful moment de marmont was only conscious of an allpowerful overwhelming feeling of hatred and the determination that whatever happened to himself he must and would prevent st genis from ever approaching crystal de cambray with words of love again that he had the power to do this he was fully conscious  crystal he called and at the same time ordered the bearers to halt on the doorstep for a moment crystal will you give me your hand in farewell  the young girl would probably have complied with his wish but st genis interposed  crystal he said authoritatively your father has already called you you have done everything that christian charity demands    and once more he tried to draw the young girl away  do not touch her man called de marmont in a loud voice a coward like you has no right to touch the hand of a good woman  m de marmont broke in crystal hotly you presume on your helplessness     pay no heed to the ravings of a maniac crystal interposed st genis calmly he has fallen so low now that contemptuous pity is all that he deserves  and contempt without pity is all that you deserve m le marquis de st genis cried de marmont excitedly ask him mademoiselle crystal ask him where is the man who today saved his life whom i myself saw today on the roadside wounded and half dead with fatigue on horseback with the inert body of m de st genis lying across his saddlebow ask him how he came to lie across that saddlebow and whether his english friend and mine bobby clyffurde did notas any who passed by could guessdrag him out of that hell at waterloo and bring him into safety whilst risking his own life ask him he continued working himself up into a veritable fever of vengeful hatred as he saw that st genissullen and gloweringwas doing his best to drag crystal away to prevent her from listening further to this awful indictment these ravings of a lunatic halfdistraught with hate ask him where is clyffurde now to what lonely spot he has crawled in order to die while m le marquis de st genis came back in gay apparel to court mlle crystal de cambray ah m de st genis you tried to heap opprobrium upon meyou talked glibly of contempt and of pity of a truth tis i do pity you now for mademoiselle crystal will surely ask you all those questions and by the lord i marvel how you will answer them  he fell back exhausted in a dead faint no doubt and st genis with a wild cry like that of a beast in fury seized the nearest weapon that came to his handa heavy oak chair which stood against the wall in the corridorand brandished it over his head he wouldhad not crystal at once interposedhave killed de marmont with one blow even so he tried to avoid crystal in order to forge for himself a clear passage to free himself from all trammels so that he might indulge his lust to kill  take the sick man away quickly cried crystal to the stretcher bearers and theyrealising the dangerthe awfulness of the tragedy which with that clumsy weapon wielded by a man who was maddened with rage was hovering in the air hurried over the threshold with their burden as fast as they could then out into the street and crystal seizing hold of the front door shut it to with a loud bang after them   vi  then with a cry that was just primitive in its passionsavage almost like that of a lioness in the desert who has been robbed of her youngshe turned upon st genis  where is he now she called and her voice was quite unrecognisable harsh and hoarse and peremptory  crystal let me assure you protested maurice that i have already done all that lay in my power     where is he now she broke in with the same fierce intensity  she stood there before himwild haggard palpitatinga passionate creature passionately demanding to know where the loved one was it seemed as if she would have torn the words out of st genis throat so bitter and intense was the look of contempt and of hatred wherewith she looked on him  m le comtevery much upset and ruffled by all that he had heardcame out of his room just in time to see the stretcherbearers disappearing with their burden through the front door and the door itself closed to with a bang by crystal truly his sense of decorum and of the fitness of things had received a severe shock and now he had the additional mortification of seeing his beautiful daughterhis dainty and aristocratic crystalin a state bordering on frenzy  my darling crystal he exclaimed as he made his way quickly to her side and put a restraining hand upon her arm  but crystal now was far beyond his control she shook off his handshe paid no heed to him she went closer up to st genis and once more repeated her ardent passionate query  where is he now  at the english hospital i hope said st genis with as much cool dignity as he could command have i not assured you crystal that ive done all i could     at the english hospital    you hope    she retorted in a voice that sounded trenchant and shrill through the overwhelming passion which shook and choked it in her throat but the roadsidewhere you left him    to die in a ditch perhaps    like a dog that has no home    where was that  i gave full directions at the english hospital he replied i arranged for an ambulance to go and find him    for a bed for him    i     give me those directions she commanded  on the way to waterloo    on the left side of the road    close by the six kilomètre milestone    the angle of the forest of soigne is just there    and there is a meadow which joins the edge of the wood where they were making hay today    no driver can fail to find the place crystal    the ambulance     but now she was no longer listening to him she had abruptly turned her back on him and made for the door her father interposed  what do you want to do crystal he said peremptorily  go to him of course she said quietlyfor she was quite calm nowat any rate outwardlystrong and of set purpose  but you do not know where he is  ill go to the english hospital first    father dear will you let me pass  crystal said m le comte firmly as he stood his ground between his daughter and the door you cannot go rushing through the streets of brussels aloneat this hour of the nightthrough all the soldiery and all the drunken rabble  he is dying she retorted and i am going to find him     you have taken leave of your senses crystal said the comte sternly you seem to have forgotten your own personal dignity     father let me go she demandedfor she had tried to measure her physical strength against his and he was holding her wrists now whilst a look of great anger was on his face  i tell you crystal he said that you cannot go i will do all that lies in my power in the matter i promise you and maurice he added harshly if he has a spark of manhood left in him will do his best to second me    but i cannot allow my daughter to go into the streets at this hour of the night  but you cannot prevent your sister from doing as she likes here broke in a tart voice from the back of the corridor crystal child try and bear up while i run to the english hospital first and if necessary to the english doctor afterwards and you monsieur my brother be good enough to allow jeanne to open the door for me  and madame la duchesse dagen in bonnet and shawl helpful and practical made her way quietly to the door preceded by faithful jeanne with a cry of infinite reliefalmost of happinesscrystal at last managed to disengage herself from her fathers grasp and ran to the old woman ma tante she said imploringly take me with you    if i do not go to find him now    at once    my heart will break  m le comte shrugged his shoulders and stood aside he knew that in an argument with his sister he would surely be worsted and there was a look in madames face which even in this dim twilight he knew how to interpret it meant that madame would carry out her programme just as she had stated it and that she would take crystal with herwith or without the fathers consent so realising this m le comte had but one course left open to him and that was to safeguard his own dignity by making the best of this situationof which he still highly disapproved  well my dear sophie he said i suppose if you insist on having your way you must have it though what the women of our rank are coming to nowadays i cannot imagine at the same time i for my part must insist that crystal at least puts on a bonnet and shawl and does not career about the streets dressed like a kitchen wench  crystal whispered madame who was nothing if not practical do as your father wishesit will save a lot of argument and save time as well  but even before the words were out of madames mouth crystal was running along the corridorready to obey at the foot of the stairs st genis intercepted her  let me pass she cried wildly  not before you have said that you have forgiven me he entreated as he clung to her white draperies with a passionate gesture of appeal  an exclamation which was almost one of loathing escaped her lips and with a jerk she freed her skirt from his clutch then she ran quickly up the stairs outside the door of her own room on the first landing she paused for one minute and from out of the gloom her voice came to him like the knell of passing hope  if he comes back alive out of the hell to which you condemned him she said i may in the future endure the sight of you again    if he dies    may god forgive you  the opening and shutting of a door told him that she was gone and he was left in company with his shame     chapter xii  the winning hand   until far into the night the air reverberated with incessant cannonadefrom the direction of genappe and from that of wavrebut just before dawn all was still the stream of convoys which bore the wounded along the road to brussels from mont saint jean and hougoumont and la haye sainte had momentarily ceased its endless course the sky had that perfect serenity of a midsummers night starlit and azure with the honeycoloured moon sinking slowly down towards the west here at the edge of the wood the air had a sweet smell of wet earth and damp moss and freshly cut hay it had all the delicious softness of a loved ones embrace  through the roar of distant cannonade bobby had slept for a time after st genis left him he had watched the long straight road with dull unseeing eyeshe had seen the first convoy overfilled with wounded men lying huddled on heapedup straw and had thanked god that he was lying on this exquisitely soft carpet made of thousands of tiny green plantsmoss grass weeds young tendrils and growing buds and opening leaves that were delicious to the touch he had quite forgotten that he was woundedneither his head nor his leg nor his arm seemed to hurt him now and he was able to think in peace of crystal and of her happiness  st genis would have come to her by then she would be happy to see him safe and well and perhapsin the midst of her joyshe would think of the friend who so gladly offered up his life for her  when the air around was no longer shaken by constant repercussion bobby fell asleep it was not yet dawn even though far away in the east there was a luminous veil that made the sky look like living silver behind him among the trees there was a moving and a flutteringthe birds were no longer asleepthey had not begun to sing but they were shaking out their feathers and opening tiny round eyes in farewell to departing night  that gentle fluttering was a sweet lullaby and bobby slept and dreamedhe dreamed that the fluttering became louder and louder and that instead of birds it was a group of angels that shook their wings and stood around him as he slept  one of the angels came nearer and laid a hand upon his headand bobby dreamed that the angel spoke and the words that it said filled bobbys heart with unearthly happiness  my love my love the angel said will you try and live for my sake  and bobby would not open his eyes for fear the angel should go away and though he knew exactly where he was and could feel the soft carpet of leaves and smell the sweet moisture in the air he knew that he must still be dreaming for angels are not of this earth  then a strong kind hand touched his wrist and felt the beating of his heart and a rough pleasant voice said in english he is exhausted and very weak but the fever is not high he will soon be all right and to add to the wonderful strangeness of his dream the angels voice near him murmured thank god thank god  why should an angel thank god that hebobby clyffurdewas not likely to die  he opened his eyes to see what it all meant and he sawbending over hima face that was more exquisitely fair than any that man had ever seen eyes that were more blue than the sky above lips that trembled like roseleaves in the breeze he was still dreaming and there was a haze between him and that perfect vision of loveliness and the kind rough voice somewhere close by said have you got that stretcher ready and two other voices replied yes sir  but the lips close above him said nothing and it was bobby now who murmured my love is it you  your love for always the dear lips replied nothing shall part us now yours for always to bring you back to life yours when you will claim meyours for life  they lifted him onto a stretcher and then into a carriage and a very kind face which he quickly enough recognised as mme la duchesse dagens smiled very encouragingly upon him whereupon he could not help but ask a very pertinent question  mme la duchesse is all this really happening  why yes my good man madame replied and indeed there was nothing dreamlike in her tart dry voice crystal and i really have dragged dr scott away from the bedside of innumerable other sick and wounded men and also from any hope of wellearned rest tonight we have also really brought him to a spot very accurately described by our worthy friend st genis but where unfortunately you had not chosen to remain else we had found you an hour sooner is there anything else you want to know  oh yes madame la duchesse many things murmured bobby please go on telling me  madame laughed well she said perhaps you would like to know that some kind of instinct or perhaps the hand of god guided one of our party to the place where you had gone to sleep you may also wish to know that though you seem in a bad way for the present you are going to be nursed back to life under dr scotts own most hospitable roof but since crystal has undertaken to do the nursing i imagine that my time for the next six weeks will be taken up in arguing with my dear and pompous brother that he will now have to give his consent to his daughter becoming the wife of a vendor of gloves  bobby contrived to smile do you think that if i promised never to buy or sell gloves again but in future to try and live like a gentlemando you think then that he will consent  i think my dear boy said madame subduing her harsh voice to tones of gentleness that after my brother knows all that i know and all that his daughter desires he will be proud to welcome you as his son  the doctors wide barouche lumbered slowly along the wide straight road in the east the luminous veil that still hid the rising sun had taken on a hue of rosy gold the birds now fully awake sang their morning hymn from the direction of wavre came once more the cannons roar  inside the carriage dr scott sitting at the feet of his patient gave a peremptory order for silence but bobbyimmeasurably happy and contentedlooked up and saw crystal de cambrayno longer a girl now but a fair and beautiful woman who had learned to the last letter the fulsome lesson of love she sat close beside him and her arm was round his reclining head and looking at her he saw the lovelight in her dear eyes whenever she turned them on him and anon when mme la duchesse engaged dr scott in a close and heated argument bobby felt sweetscented lips pressed against his own   the end
