woke there was a door shutting from room to room they went hand in hand lifting here opening there making surea ghostly couple  here we left it she said and he added oh but here too its upstairs she murmured and in the garden he whispered quietly they said or we shall wake them  but it wasnt that you woke us oh no theyre looking for it theyre drawing the curtain one might say and so read on a page or two now theyve found it one would be certain stopping the pencil on the margin and then tired of reading one might rise and see for oneself the house all empty the doors standing open only the wood pigeons bubbling with content and the hum of the threshing machine sounding from the farm what did i come in here for what did i want to find my hands were empty perhaps its upstairs then the apples were in the loft and so down again the garden still as ever only the book had slipped into the grass  but they had found it in the drawing room not that one could ever see them the window panes reflected apples reflected roses all the leaves were green in the glass if they moved in the drawing room the apple only turned its yellow side yet the moment after if the door was opened spread about the floor hung upon the walls pendant from the ceilingwhat my hands were empty the shadow of a thrush crossed the carpet from the deepest wells of silence the wood pigeon drew its bubble of sound safe safe safe the pulse of the house beat softly the treasure buried the room  the pulse stopped short oh was that the buried treasure  a moment later the light had faded out in the garden then but the trees spun darkness for a wandering beam of sun so fine so rare coolly sunk beneath the surface the beam i sought always burnt behind the glass death was the glass death was between us coming to the woman first hundreds of years ago leaving the house sealing all the windows the rooms were darkened he left it left her went north went east saw the stars turned in the southern sky sought the house found it dropped beneath the downs safe safe safe the pulse of the house beat gladly the treasure yours  the wind roars up the avenue trees stoop and bend this way and that moonbeams splash and spill wildly in the rain but the beam of the lamp falls straight from the window the candle burns stiff and still wandering through the house opening the windows whispering not to wake us the ghostly couple seek their joy  here we slept she says and he adds kisses without number waking in the morning silver between the trees upstairs in the garden when summer came in winter snowtime the doors go shutting far in the distance gently knocking like the pulse of a heart  nearer they come cease at the doorway the wind falls the rain slides silver down the glass our eyes darken we hear no steps beside us we see no lady spread her ghostly cloak his hands shield the lantern look he breathes sound asleep love upon their lips  stooping holding their silver lamp above us long they look and deeply long they pause the wind drives straightly the flame stoops slightly wild beams of moonlight cross both floor and wall and meeting stain the faces bent the faces pondering the faces that search the sleepers and seek their hidden joy  safe safe safe the heart of the house beats proudly long years he sighs again you found me here she murmurs sleeping in the garden reading laughing rolling apples in the loft here we left our treasure stooping their light lifts the lids upon my eyes safe safe safe the pulse of the house beats wildly waking i cry oh is this your buried treasure the light in the heart     a society   this is how it all came about six or seven of us were sitting one day after tea some were gazing across the street into the windows of a milliners shop where the light still shone brightly upon scarlet feathers and golden slippers others were idly occupied in building little towers of sugar upon the edge of the tea tray after a time so far as i can remember we drew round the fire and began as usual to praise menhow strong how noble how brilliant how courageous how beautiful they werehow we envied those who by hook or by crook managed to get attached to one for lifewhen poll who had said nothing burst into tears poll i must tell you has always been queer for one thing her father was a strange man he left her a fortune in his will but on condition that she read all the books in the london library we comforted her as best we could but we knew in our hearts how vain it was for though we like her poll is no beauty leaves her shoe laces untied and must have been thinking while we praised men that not one of them would ever wish to marry her at last she dried her tears for some time we could make nothing of what she said strange enough it was in all conscience she told us that as we knew she spent most of her time in the london library reading she had begun she said with english literature on the top floor and was steadily working her way down to the times on the bottom and now half or perhaps only a quarter way through a terrible thing had happened she could read no more books were not what we thought them books she cried rising to her feet and speaking with an intensity of desolation which i shall never forget are for the most part unutterably bad  of course we cried out that shakespeare wrote books and milton and shelley  oh yes she interrupted us youve been well taught i can see but you are not members of the london library here her sobs broke forth anew at length recovering a little she opened one of the pile of books which she always carried about with herfrom a window or in a garden or some such name as that it was called and it was written by a man called benton or henson or something of that kind she read the first few pages we listened in silence but thats not a book someone said so she chose another this time it was a history but i have forgotten the writers name our trepidation increased as she went on not a word of it seemed to be true and the style in which it was written was execrable  poetry poetry we cried impatiently read us poetry i cannot describe the desolation which fell upon us as she opened a little volume and mouthed out the verbose sentimental foolery which it contained  it must have been written by a woman one of us urged but no she told us that it was written by a young man one of the most famous poets of the day i leave you to imagine what the shock of the discovery was though we all cried and begged her to read no more she persisted and read us extracts from the lives of the lord chancellors when she had finished jane the eldest and wisest of us rose to her feet and said that she for one was not convinced  why she asked if men write such rubbish as this should our mothers have wasted their youth in bringing them into the world  we were all silent and in the silence poor poll could be heard sobbing out why why did my father teach me to read  clorinda was the first to come to her senses its all our fault she said every one of us knows how to read but no one save poll has ever taken the trouble to do it i for one have taken it for granted that it was a womans duty to spend her youth in bearing children i venerated my mother for bearing ten still more my grandmother for bearing fifteen it was i confess my own ambition to bear twenty we have gone on all these ages supposing that men were equally industrious and that their works were of equal merit while we have borne the children they we supposed have borne the books and the pictures we have populated the world they have civilized it but now that we can read what prevents us from judging the results before we bring another child into the world we must swear that we will find out what the world is like  so we made ourselves into a society for asking questions one of us was to visit a manofwar another was to hide herself in a scholars study another was to attend a meeting of business men while all were to read books look at pictures go to concerts keep our eyes open in the streets and ask questions perpetually we were very young you can judge of our simplicity when i tell you that before parting that night we agreed that the objects of life were to produce good people and good books our questions were to be directed to finding out how far these objects were now attained by men we vowed solemnly that we would not bear a single child until we were satisfied  off we went then some to the british museum others to the kings navy some to oxford others to cambridge we visited the royal academy and the tate heard modern music in concert rooms went to the law courts and saw new plays no one dined out without asking her partner certain questions and carefully noting his replies at intervals we met together and compared our observations oh those were merry meetings never have i laughed so much as i did when rose read her notes upon honour and described how she had dressed herself as an Ã†thiopian prince and gone aboard one of his majestys ships discovering the hoax the captain visited her now disguised as a private gentleman and demanded that honour should be satisfied but how she asked how he bellowed with the cane of course seeing that he was beside himself with rage and expecting that her last moment had come she bent over and received to her amazement six light taps upon the behind the honour of the british navy is avenged he cried and raising herself she saw him with the sweat pouring down his face holding out a trembling right hand away she exclaimed striking an attitude and imitating the ferocity of his own expression my honour has still to be satisfied spoken like a gentleman he returned and fell into profound thought if six strokes avenge the honour of the kings navy he mused how many avenge the honour of a private gentleman he said he would prefer to lay the case before his brother officers she replied haughtily that she could not wait he praised her sensibility let me see he cried suddenly did your father keep a carriage no she said or a riding horse we had a donkey she bethought her which drew the mowing machine at this his face lighted my mothers name she added for gods sake man dont mention your mothers name he shrieked trembling like an aspen and flushing to the roots of his hair and it was ten minutes at least before she could induce him to proceed at length he decreed that if she gave him four strokes and a half in the small of the back at a spot indicated by himself the half conceded he said in recognition of the fact that her great grandmothers uncle was killed at trafalgar it was his opinion that her honour would be as good as new this was done they retired to a restaurant drank two bottles of wine for which he insisted upon paying and parted with protestations of eternal friendship  then we had fannys account of her visit to the law courts at her first visit she had come to the conclusion that the judges were either made of wood or were impersonated by large animals resembling man who had been trained to move with extreme dignity mumble and nod their heads to test her theory she had liberated a handkerchief of bluebottles at the critical moment of a trial but was unable to judge whether the creatures gave signs of humanity for the buzzing of the flies induced so sound a sleep that she only woke in time to see the prisoners led into the cells below but from the evidence she brought we voted that it is unfair to suppose that the judges are men  helen went to the royal academy but when asked to deliver her report upon the pictures she began to recite from a pale blue volume o for the touch of a vanished hand and the sound of a voice that is still home is the hunter home from the hill he gave his bridle reins a shake love is sweet love is brief spring the fair spring is the years pleasant king o to be in england now that aprils there men must work and women must weep the path of duty is the way to glory we could listen to no more of this gibberish  we want no more poetry we cried  daughters of england she began but here we pulled her down a vase of water getting spilt over her in the scuffle  thank god she exclaimed shaking herself like a dog now ill roll on the carpet and see if i cant brush off what remains of the union jack then perhaps here she rolled energetically getting up she began to explain to us what modern pictures are like when castalia stopped her  what is the average size of a picture she asked perhaps two feet by two and a half she said castalia made notes while helen spoke and when she had done and we were trying not to meet each others eyes rose and said at your wish i spent last week at oxbridge disguised as a charwoman i thus had access to the rooms of several professors and will now attempt to give you some ideaonly she broke off i cant think how to do it its all so queer these professors she went on live in large houses built round grass plots each in a kind of cell by himself yet they have every convenience and comfort you have only to press a button or light a little lamp their papers are beautifully filed books abound there are no children or animals save half a dozen stray cats and one aged bullfincha cock i remember she broke off an aunt of mine who lived at dulwich and kept cactuses you reached the conservatory through the double drawingroom and there on the hot pipes were dozens of them ugly squat bristly little plants each in a separate pot once in a hundred years the aloe flowered so my aunt said but she died before that happened we told her to keep to the point well she resumed when professor hobkin was out i examined his life work an edition of sappho its a queer looking book six or seven inches thick not all by sappho oh no most of it is a defence of sapphos chastity which some german had denied and i can assure you the passion with which these two gentlemen argued the learning they displayed the prodigious ingenuity with which they disputed the use of some implement which looked to me for all the world like a hairpin astounded me especially when the door opened and professor hobkin himself appeared a very nice mild old gentleman but what could he know about chastity we misunderstood her  no no she protested hes the soul of honour im surenot that he resembles roses sea captain in the least i was thinking rather of my aunts cactuses what could they know about chastity  again we told her not to wander from the pointdid the oxbridge professors help to produce good people and good booksthe objects of life  there she exclaimed it never struck me to ask it never occurred to me that they could possibly produce anything  i believe said sue that you made some mistake probably professor hobkin was a gynÃ¦cologist a scholar is a very different sort of man a scholar is overflowing with humour and inventionperhaps addicted to wine but what of thata delightful companion generous subtle imaginativeas stands to reason for he spends his life in company with the finest human beings that have ever existed  hum said castalia perhaps id better go back and try again  some three months later it happened that i was sitting alone when castalia entered i dont know what it was in the look of her that so moved me but i could not restrain myself and dashing across the room i clasped her in my arms not only was she very beautiful she seemed also in the highest spirits how happy you look i exclaimed as she sat down  ive been at oxbridge she said  asking questions  answering them she replied  you have not broken our vow i said anxiously noticing something about her figure  oh the vow she said casually im going to have a baby if thats what you mean you cant imagine she burst out how exciting how beautiful how satisfying  what is i asked  totoanswer questions she replied in some confusion whereupon she told me the whole of her story but in the middle of an account which interested and excited me more than anything i had ever heard she gave the strangest cry half whoop half holloa  chastity chastity wheres my chastity she cried help ho the scent bottle  there was nothing in the room but a cruet containing mustard which i was about to administer when she recovered her composure  you should have thought of that three months ago i said severely  true she replied theres not much good in thinking of it now it was unfortunate by the way that my mother had me called castalia  oh castalia your mother i was beginning when she reached for the mustard pot  no no no she said shaking her head if youd been a chaste woman yourself you would have screamed at the sight of meinstead of which you rushed across the room and took me in your arms no cassandra we are neither of us chaste so we went on talking  meanwhile the room was filling up for it was the day appointed to discuss the results of our observations everyone i thought felt as i did about castalia they kissed her and said how glad they were to see her again at length when we were all assembled jane rose and said that it was time to begin she began by saying that we had now asked questions for over five years and that though the results were bound to be inconclusivehere castalia nudged me and whispered that she was not so sure about that then she got up and interrupting jane in the middle of a sentence said  before you say any more i want to knowam i to stay in the room because she added i have to confess that i am an impure woman  everyone looked at her in astonishment  you are going to have a baby asked jane  she nodded her head  it was extraordinary to see the different expressions on their faces a sort of hum went through the room in which i could catch the words impure baby castalia and so on jane who was herself considerably moved put it to us  shall she go is she impure  such a roar filled the room as might have been heard in the street outside  no no no let her stay impure fiddlesticks yet i fancied that some of the youngest girls of nineteen or twenty held back as if overcome with shyness then we all came about her and began asking questions and at last i saw one of the youngest who had kept in the background approach shyly and say to her  what is chastity then i mean is it good or is it bad or is it nothing at all she replied so low that i could not catch what she said  you know i was shocked said another for at least ten minutes  in my opinion said poll who was growing crusty from always reading in the london library chastity is nothing but ignorancea most discreditable state of mind we should admit only the unchaste to our society i vote that castalia shall be our president  this was violently disputed  it is as unfair to brand women with chastity as with unchastity said poll some of us havent the opportunity either moreover i dont believe cassy herself maintains that she acted as she did from a pure love of knowledge  he is only twentyone and divinely beautiful said cassy with a ravishing gesture  i move said helen that no one be allowed to talk of chastity or unchastity save those who are in love  oh bother said judith who had been enquiring into scientific matters im not in love and im longing to explain my measures for dispensing with prostitutes and fertilizing virgins by act of parliament  she went on to tell us of an invention of hers to be erected at tube stations and other public resorts which upon payment of a small fee would safeguard the nations health accommodate its sons and relieve its daughters then she had contrived a method of preserving in sealed tubes the germs of future lord chancellors or poets or painters or musicians she went on supposing that is to say that these breeds are not extinct and that women still wish to bear children  of course we wish to bear children cried castalia impatiently jane rapped the table  that is the very point we are met to consider she said for five years we have been trying to find out whether we are justified in continuing the human race castalia has anticipated our decision but it remains for the rest of us to make up our minds  here one after another of our messengers rose and delivered their reports the marvels of civilisation far exceeded our expectations and as we learnt for the first time how man flies in the air talks across space penetrates to the heart of an atom and embraces the universe in his speculations a murmur of admiration burst from our lips  we are proud we cried that our mothers sacrificed their youth in such a cause as this castalia who had been listening intently looked prouder than all the rest then jane reminded us that we had still much to learn and castalia begged us to make haste on we went through a vast tangle of statistics we learnt that england has a population of so many millions and that such and such a proportion of them is constantly hungry and in prison that the average size of a working mans family is such and that so great a percentage of women die from maladies incident to childbirth reports were read of visits to factories shops slums and dockyards descriptions were given of the stock exchange of a gigantic house of business in the city and of a government office the british colonies were now discussed and some account was given of our rule in india africa and ireland i was sitting by castalia and i noticed her uneasiness  we shall never come to any conclusion at all at this rate she said as it appears that civilisation is so much more complex than we had any notion would it not be better to confine ourselves to our original enquiry we agreed that it was the object of life to produce good people and good books all this time we have been talking of aeroplanes factories and money let us talk about men themselves and their arts for that is the heart of the matter  so the diners out stepped forward with long slips of paper containing answers to their questions these had been framed after much consideration a good man we had agreed must at any rate be honest passionate and unworldly but whether or not a particular man possessed those qualities could only be discovered by asking questions often beginning at a remote distance from the centre is kensington a nice place to live in where is your son being educatedand your daughter now please tell me what do you pay for your cigars by the way is sir joseph a baronet or only a knight often it seemed that we learnt more from trivial questions of this kind than from more direct ones i accepted my peerage said lord bunkum because my wife wished it i forget how many titles were accepted for the same reason working fifteen hours out of the twentyfour as i do ten thousand professional men began  no no of course you can neither read nor write but why do you work so hard my dear lady with a growing family but why does your family grow their wives wished that too or perhaps it was the british empire but more significant than the answers were the refusals to answer very few would reply at all to questions about morality and religion and such answers as were given were not serious questions as to the value of money and power were almost invariably brushed aside or pressed at extreme risk to the asker im sure said jill that if sir harley tightboots hadnt been carving the mutton when i asked him about the capitalist system he would have cut my throat the only reason why we escaped with our lives over and over again is that men are at once so hungry and so chivalrous they despise us too much to mind what we say  of course they despise us said eleanor at the same time how do you account for thisi made enquiries among the artists now no woman has ever been an artist has she poll  janeaustencharlottebrontÃ«georgeeliot cried poll like a man crying muffins in a back street  damn the woman someone exclaimed what a bore she is  since sappho there has been no female of first rate eleanor began quoting from a weekly newspaper  its now well known that sappho was the somewhat lewd invention of professor hobkin ruth interrupted  anyhow there is no reason to suppose that any woman ever has been able to write or ever will be able to write eleanor continued and yet whenever i go among authors they never cease to talk to me about their books masterly i say or shakespeare himself for one must say something and i assure you they believe me  that proves nothing said jane they all do it only she sighed it doesnt seem to help us much perhaps we had better examine modern literature next liz its your turn  elizabeth rose and said that in order to prosecute her enquiry she had dressed as a man and been taken for a reviewer  i have read new books pretty steadily for the past five years said she mr wells is the most popular living writer then comes mr arnold bennett then mr compton mackenzie mr mckenna and mr walpole may be bracketed together she sat down  but youve told us nothing we expostulated or do you mean that these gentlemen have greatly surpassed janeelliot and that english fiction iswheres that review of yours oh yes safe in their hands  safe quite safe she said shifting uneasily from foot to foot and im sure that they give away even more than they receive  we were all sure of that but we pressed her do they write good books  good books she said looking at the ceiling you must remember she began speaking with extreme rapidity that fiction is the mirror of life and you cant deny that education is of the highest importance and that it would be extremely annoying if you found yourself alone at brighton late at night not to know which was the best boarding house to stay at and suppose it was a dripping sunday eveningwouldnt it be nice to go to the movies  but what has that got to do with it we asked  nothingnothingnothing whatever she replied  well tell us the truth we bade her  the truth but isnt it wonderful she broke offmr chitter has written a weekly article for the past thirty years upon love or hot buttered toast and has sent all his sons to eton  the truth we demanded  oh the truth she stammered the truth has nothing to do with literature and sitting down she refused to say another word  it all seemed to us very inconclusive  ladies we must try to sum up the results jane was beginning when a hum which had been heard for some time through the open window drowned her voice  war war war declaration of war men were shouting in the street below  we looked at each other in horror  what war we cried what war we remembered too late that we had never thought of sending anyone to the house of commons we had forgotten all about it we turned to poll who had reached the history shelves in the london library and asked her to enlighten us  why we cried do men go to war  sometimes for one reason sometimes for another she replied calmly in 1760 for example the shouts outside drowned her words again in 1797in 1804it was the austrians in 18661870 was the francoprussianin 1900 on the other hand  but its now 1914 we cut her short  ah i dont know what theyre going to war for now she admitted                                       the war was over and peace was in process of being signed when i once more found myself with castalia in the room where our meetings used to be held we began idly turning over the pages of our old minute books queer i mused to see what we were thinking five years ago we are agreed castalia quoted reading over my shoulder that it is the object of life to produce good people and good books we made no comment upon that a good man is at any rate honest passionate and unworldly what a womans language i observed oh dear cried castalia pushing the book away from her what fools we were it was all polls fathers fault she went on i believe he did it on purposethat ridiculous will i mean forcing poll to read all the books in the london library if we hadnt learnt to read she said bitterly we might still have been bearing children in ignorance and that i believe was the happiest life after all i know what youre going to say about war she checked me and the horror of bearing children to see them killed but our mothers did it and their mothers and their mothers before them and they didnt complain they couldnt read ive done my best she sighed to prevent my little girl from learning to read but whats the use i caught ann only yesterday with a newspaper in her hand and she was beginning to ask me if it was true next shell ask me whether mr lloyd george is a good man then whether mr arnold bennett is a good novelist and finally whether i believe in god how can i bring my daughter up to believe in nothing she demanded  surely you could teach her to believe that a mans intellect is and always will be fundamentally superior to a womans i suggested she brightened at this and began to turn over our old minutes again yes she said think of their discoveries their mathematics their science their philosophy their scholarship and then she began to laugh i shall never forget old hobkin and the hairpin she said and went on reading and laughing and i thought she was quite happy when suddenly she drew the book from her and burst out oh cassandra why do you torment me dont you know that our belief in mans intellect is the greatest fallacy of them all what i exclaimed ask any journalist schoolmaster politician or public house keeper in the land and they will all tell you that men are much cleverer than women as if i doubted it she said scornfully how could they help it havent we bred them and fed and kept them in comfort since the beginning of time so that they may be clever even if theyre nothing else its all our doing she cried we insisted upon having intellect and now weve got it and its intellect she continued thats at the bottom of it what could be more charming than a boy before he has begun to cultivate his intellect he is beautiful to look at he gives himself no airs he understands the meaning of art and literature instinctively he goes about enjoying his life and making other people enjoy theirs then they teach him to cultivate his intellect he becomes a barrister a civil servant a general an author a professor every day he goes to an office every year he produces a book he maintains a whole family by the products of his brainpoor devil soon he cannot come into a room without making us all feel uncomfortable he condescends to every woman he meets and dares not tell the truth even to his own wife instead of rejoicing our eyes we have to shut them if we are to take him in our arms true they console themselves with stars of all shapes ribbons of all shades and incomes of all sizesbut what is to console us that we shall be able in ten years time to spend a weekend at lahore or that the least insect in japan has a name twice the length of its body oh cassandra for heavens sake let us devise a method by which men may bear children it is our only chance for unless we provide them with some innocent occupation we shall get neither good people nor good books we shall perish beneath the fruits of their unbridled activity and not a human being will survive to know that there once was shakespeare  it is too late i replied we cannot provide even for the children that we have  and then you ask me to believe in intellect she said  while we spoke men were crying hoarsely and wearily in the street and listening we heard that the treaty of peace had just been signed the voices died away the rain was falling and interfered no doubt with the proper explosion of the fireworks  my cook will have bought the evening news said castalia and ann will be spelling it out over her tea i must go home  its no goodnot a bit of good i said once she knows how to read theres only one thing you can teach her to believe inand that is herself  well that would be a change sighed castalia  so we swept up the papers of our society and though ann was playing with her doll very happily we solemnly made her a present of the lot and told her we had chosen her to be president of the society of the futureupon which she burst into tears poor little girl     monday or tuesday   lazy and indifferent shaking space easily from his wings knowing his way the heron passes over the church beneath the sky white and distant absorbed in itself endlessly the sky covers and uncovers moves and remains a lake blot the shores of it out a mountain oh perfectthe sun gold on its slopes down that falls ferns then or white feathers for ever and ever

look almost a symbol of human destiny with it lifes what you see in peoples eyes lifes what they learn and having learnt it never though they seek to hide it cease to be aware ofwhat that lifes like that it seems five faces oppositefive mature facesand the knowledge in each face strange though how people want to conceal it marks of reticence are on all those faces lips shut eyes shaded each one of the five doing something to hide or stultify his knowledge one smokes another reads a third checks entries in a pocket book a fourth stares at the map of the line framed opposite and the fifththe terrible thing about the fifth is that she does nothing at all she looks at life ah but my poor unfortunate woman do play the gamedo for all our sakes conceal it  as if she heard me she looked up shifted slightly in her seat and sighed she seemed to apologise and at the same time to say to me if only you knew then she looked at life again but i do know i answered silently glancing at the times for manners sake i know the whole business peace between germany and the allied powers was yesterday officially ushered in at parissignor nitti the italian prime ministera passenger train at doncaster was in collision with a goods train we all knowthe times knowsbut we pretend we dont my eyes had once more crept over the papers rim she shuddered twitched her arm queerly to the middle of her back and shook her head again i dipped into my great reservoir of life take what you like i continued births deaths marriages court circular the habits of birds leonardo da vinci the sandhills murder high wages and the cost of livingoh take what you like i repeated its all in the times again with infinite weariness she moved her head from side to side until like a top exhausted with spinning it settled on her neck  the times was no protection against such sorrow as hers but other human beings forbade intercourse the best thing to do against life was to fold the paper so that it made a perfect square crisp thick impervious even to life this done i glanced up quickly armed with a shield of my own she pierced through my shield she gazed into my eyes as if searching any sediment of courage at the depths of them and damping it to clay her twitch alone denied all hope discounted all illusion  so we rattled through surrey and across the border into sussex but with my eyes upon life i did not see that the other travellers had left one by one till save for the man who read we were alone together here was three bridges station we drew slowly down the platform and stopped was he going to leave us i prayed both waysi prayed last that he might stay at that instant he roused himself crumpled his paper contemptuously like a thing done with burst open the door and left us alone  the unhappy woman leaning a little forward palely and colourlessly addressed metalked of stations and holidays of brothers at eastbourne and the time of year which was i forget now early or late but at last looking from the window and seeing i knew only life she breathed staying awaythats the drawback of it ah now we approached the catastrophe my sisterinlawthe bitterness of her tone was like lemon on cold steel and speaking not to me but to herself she muttered nonsense she would saythats what they all say and while she spoke she fidgeted as though the skin on her back were as a plucked fowls in a poulterers shopwindow  oh that cow she broke off nervously as though the great wooden cow in the meadow had shocked her and saved her from some indiscretion then she shuddered and then she made the awkward angular movement that i had seen before as if after the spasm some spot between the shoulders burnt or itched then again she looked the most unhappy woman in the world and i once more reproached her though not with the same conviction for if there were a reason and if i knew the reason the stigma was removed from life  sistersinlaw i said  her lips pursed as if to spit venom at the word pursed they remained all she did was to take her glove and rub hard at a spot on the windowpane she rubbed as if she would rub something out for eversome stain some indelible contamination indeed the spot remained for all her rubbing and back she sank with the shudder and the clutch of the arm i had come to expect something impelled me to take my glove and rub my window there too was a little speck on the glass for all my rubbing it remained and then the spasm went through me i crooked my arm and plucked at the middle of my back my skin too felt like the damp chickens skin in the poulterers shopwindow one spot between the shoulders itched and irritated felt clammy felt raw could i reach it surreptitiously i tried she saw me a smile of infinite irony infinite sorrow flitted and faded from her face but she had communicated shared her secret passed her poison she would speak no more leaning back in my corner shielding my eyes from her eyes seeing only the slopes and hollows greys and purples of the winters landscape i read her message deciphered her secret reading it beneath her gaze  hildas the sisterinlaw hilda hilda hilda marshhilda the blooming the full bosomed the matronly hilda stands at the door as the cab draws up holding a coin poor minnie more of a grasshopper than everold cloak she had last year well well with two children these days one cant do more no minnie ive

meagre nightgown stand side by side furred felt slippers the lookingglassno you avoid the lookingglass some methodical disposition of hatpins perhaps the shell box has something in it you shake it its the pearl stud there was last yearthats all and then the sniff the sigh the sitting by the window three oclock on a december afternoon the rain drizzling one light low in the skylight of a drapery emporium another high in a servants bedroomthis one goes out that gives her nothing to look at a moments blanknessthen what are you thinking let me peep across at her opposite shes asleep or pretending it so what would she think about sitting at the window at three oclock in the afternoon health money hills her god yes sitting on the very edge of the chair looking over the roofs of eastbourne minnie marsh prays to god thats all very well and she may rub the pane too as though to see god better but what god does she see whos the god of minnie marsh the god of the back streets of eastbourne the god of three oclock in the afternoon i too see roofs i see sky but oh dearthis seeing of gods more like president kruger than prince albertthats the best i can do for him and i see him on a chair in a black frockcoat not so very high up either i can manage a cloud or two for him to sit on and then his hand trailing in the cloud holds a rod a truncheon is itblack thick thorneda brutal old bullyminnies god did he send the itch and the patch and the twitch is that why she prays what she rubs on the window is the stain of sin oh she committed some crime  i have my choice of crimes the woods flit and flyin summer there are bluebells in the opening there when spring comes primroses a parting was it twenty years ago vows broken not minnies she was faithful how she nursed

perhaps a little commonplacesince one has a choice of crimes but then so many let me peep across againstill sleeping or pretending sleep white worn the mouth closeda touch of obstinacy more than one would thinkno hint of sexso many crimes arent your crime your crime was cheap only the retribution solemn for now the church door opens the hard wooden pew receives her on the brown tiles she kneels every day winter summer dusk dawn here shes at it prays all her sins fall fall for ever fall the spot receives them its raised its red its burning next she twitches small boys point bob at lunch

she takes a hollow shellan eggwho was saying that eggs were cheaper you or i oh it was you who said it on the way home you remember when the old gentleman suddenly opening his umbrellaor sneezing was it anyhow kruger went and you came home a back way and scraped your boots yes and now you lay across your knees a pockethandkerchief into which drop little angular fragments of eggshellfragments of a mapa puzzle i wish i could piece them together if you would only sit still shes moved her kneesthe maps in bits again down the slopes of the andes the white blocks of marble go bounding and hurtling crushing to death a whole troop of spanish muleteers with their convoydrakes booty gold and silver but to return  to what to where she opened the door and putting her umbrella in the standthat goes without saying so too the whiff of beef from the basement dot dot dot but what i cannot thus eliminate what i must head down eyes shut with the courage of a battalion and the blindness of a bull charge and disperse are indubitably the figures behind the ferns commercial travellers there ive hidden them all this time in the hope that somehow theyd disappear or better still emerge as indeed they must if the storys to go on gathering richness and rotundity destiny and tragedy as stories should rolling along with it two if not three commercial travellers and a whole grove of aspidistra the fronds of the aspidistra only partly concealed the commercial traveller rhododendrons would conceal him utterly and into the bargain give me my fling of red and white for which i starve and strive but rhododendrons in eastbournein decemberon the marshes tableno no i dare not its all a matter of crusts and cruets frills and ferns perhaps therell be a moment later by the sea moreover i feel pleasantly pricking through the green fretwork and over the glacis of cut glass a desire to peer and peep at the man oppositeones as much as i can manage james moggridge is it whom the marshes call jimmy minnie you must promise not to twitch till ive got this straight james moggridge travels inshall we say buttonsbut the times not come for bringing them inthe big and the little on the long cards some peacockeyed others dull gold cairngorms some and others coral spraysbut i say the times not come he travels and on thursdays his eastbourne day takes his meals with the marshes his red face his little steady eyesby no means altogether commonplacehis enormous appetite thats safe he wont look at minnie till the breads swamped the gravy dry napkin tucked diamondwisebut this is primitive and whatever it may do the reader dont take me in lets dodge to the moggridge household set that in motion well the family boots are mended on sundays by james himself he reads truth but his passion rosesand his wife a retired hospital nurseinterestingfor gods sake let me have one woman with a name i like but no shes of the unborn children of the mind illicit none the less loved like my rhododendrons how many die in every novel thats writtenthe best the dearest while moggridge lives its lifes fault heres minnie eating her egg at the moment opposite and at tother end of the lineare we past lewesthere must be jimmyor whats her twitch for  there must be moggridgelifes fault life imposes her laws life blocks the way lifes behind the fern lifes the tyrant oh but not the bully no for i assure you i come willingly i come wooed by heaven knows what compulsion across ferns and cruets table splashed and bottles smeared i come irresistibly to lodge myself somewhere on the firm flesh in the robust spine wherever i can penetrate or find foothold on the person in the soul of moggridge the man the enormous stability of the fabric the spine tough as whalebone straight as oaktree the ribs radiating branches the flesh taut tarpaulin the red hollows the suck and regurgitation of the heart while from above meat falls in brown cubes and beer gushes to be churned to blood againand so we reach the eyes behind the aspidistra they see something black white dismal now the plate again behind the aspidistra they see elderly woman marshs sister hildas more my sort the tablecloth now marsh would know whats wrong with morrises  talk that over cheese has come the plate again turn it roundthe enormous fingers now the woman opposite marshs sisternot a bit like marsh wretched elderly female you should feed your hens gods truth whats set her twitching not what i said dear dear dear these elderly women dear dear  yes minnie i know youve twitched but one momentjames moggridge  dear dear dear how beautiful the sound is like the knock of a mallet on seasoned timber like the throb of the heart of an ancient whaler when the seas press thick and the green is clouded dear dear what a passing bell for the souls of the fretful to soothe them and solace them lap them in linen saying so long good luck to you and then whats your pleasure for though moggridge would pluck his rose for her thats done thats over now whats the next thing madam youll miss your train for they dont linger  thats the mans way thats the sound that reverberates thats st pauls and the motoromnibuses but were brushing the crumbs off oh moggridge you wont stay you must be off are you driving through eastbourne this afternoon in one of those little carriages are you the man whos walled up in green cardboard boxes and sometimes has the blinds down and sometimes sits so solemn staring like a sphinx and always theres a look of the sepulchral something of the undertaker the coffin and the dusk about horse and driver do tell mebut the doors slammed we shall never meet again moggridge farewell  yes yes im coming right up to the top of the house one moment ill linger how the mud goes round in the mindwhat a swirl these monsters leave the waters rocking the weeds waving and green here black there striking to the sand till by degrees the atoms reassemble the deposit sifts itself and again through the eyes one sees clear and still and there comes to the lips some prayer for the departed some obsequy for the souls of those one nods to the people one never meets again  james moggridge is dead now gone for ever well minniei can face it no longer if she said thatlet me look at her she is brushing the eggshell into deep declivities she said it certainly leaning against the wall of the bedroom and plucking at the little balls which edge the claretcoloured curtain but when the self speaks to the self who is speakingthe entombed soul the spirit driven in in in to the central catacomb the self that took the veil and left the worlda coward perhaps yet somehow beautiful as it flits with its lantern restlessly up and down the dark corridors i can bear it no longer her spirit says that man at lunchhildathe children oh heavens her sob its the spirit wailing its destiny the spirit driven hither thither lodging on the diminishing carpetsmeagre footholdsshrunken shreds of all the vanishing universelove life faith husband children i know not what splendours and pageantries glimpsed in girlhood not for menot for me  but thenthe muffins the bald elderly dog bead mats i should fancy and the consolation of underlinen if minnie marsh were run over and taken to hospital nurses and doctors themselves would exclaim theres the vista and the visiontheres the distancethe blue blot at the end of the avenue while after all the tea is rich the muffin hot and the dogbenny to your basket sir and see what mothers brought you so taking the glove with the worn thumb defying once more the encroaching demon of whats called going in holes you renew the fortifications threading the grey wool running it in and out  running it in and out across and over spinning a web through which god himselfhush dont think of god how firm the stitches are you must be proud of your darning let nothing disturb her let the light fall gently and the clouds show an inner vest of the first green leaf let the sparrow perch on the twig and shake the raindrop hanging to the twigs elbow why look up was it a sound a thought oh heavens back again to the thing you did the plate glass with the violet loops but hilda will come ignominies humiliations oh close the breach  having mended her glove minnie marsh lays it in the drawer she shuts the drawer with decision i catch sight of her face in the glass lips are pursed chin held high next she laces her shoes then she touches her throat whats your brooch mistletoe or merrythought and what is happening unless im much mistaken the pulses quickened the moments coming the threads are racing niagaras ahead heres the crisis heaven be with you down she goes courage courage face it be it for gods sake dont wait on the mat now theres the door im on your side speak confront her confound her soul  oh i beg your pardon yes this is eastbourne ill reach it down for you let me try the handle but minnie though we keep up pretences ive read you rightim with you now

road side by side well my worlds done for what do i stand on what do i know thats not minnie there never was moggridge who am i lifes bare as bone  and yet the last look of themhe stepping from the kerb and she following him round the edge of the big building brims me with wonderfloods me anew mysterious figures mother and son who are you why do you walk down the street where tonight will you sleep and then tomorrow oh how it whirls and surgesfloats me afresh i start after them people drive this way and that the white light splutters and pours plateglass windows carnations chrysanthemums ivy in dark gardens milk carts at the door wherever i go mysterious figures i see you turning the corner mothers and sons you you you i hasten i follow this i fancy must be the sea grey is the landscape dim as ashes the water murmurs and moves if i fall on my knees if i go through the ritual the ancient antics its you unknown figures you i adore if i open my arms its you i embrace you i draw to meadorable world     the string quartet   well here we are and if you cast your eye over the room you will see that tubes and trams and omnibuses private carriages not a few even i venture to believe landaus with bays in them have been busy at it weaving threads from one end of london to the other yet i begin to have my doubts  if indeed its true as theyre saying that regent street is up and the treaty signed and the weather not cold for the time of year and even at that rent not a flat to be had and the worst of influenza its after effects if i bethink me of having forgotten to write about the leak in the larder and left my glove in the train if the ties of blood require me leaning forward to accept cordially the hand which is perhaps offered hesitatingly  seven years since we met  the last time in venice  and where are you living now  well the late afternoon suits me the best though if it werent asking too much  but i knew you at once  still the war made a break  if the minds shot through by such little arrows andfor human society compels itno sooner is one launched than another presses forward if this engenders heat and in addition theyve turned on the electric light if saying one thing does in so many cases leave behind it a need to improve and revise stirring besides regrets pleasures vanities and desiresif its all the facts i mean and the hats the fur boas the gentlemens swallowtail coats and pearl tiepins that come to the surfacewhat chance is there  of what it becomes every minute more difficult to say why in spite of everything i sit here believing i cant now say what or even remember the last time it happened  did you see the procession  the king looked cold  no no no but what was it  shes bought a house at malmesbury  how lucky to find one  on the contrary it seems to me pretty sure that she whoever she may be is damned since its all a matter of flats and hats and sea gulls or so it seems to be for a hundred people sitting here well dressed walled in furred replete not that i can boast since i too sit passive on a gilt chair only turning the earth above a buried memory as we all do for there are signs if im not mistaken that were all recalling something furtively seeking something why fidget why so anxious about the sit of cloaks and gloveswhether to button or unbutton then watch that elderly face against the dark canvas a moment ago urbane and flushed now taciturn and sad as if in shadow was it the sound of the second violin tuning in the anteroom here they come four black figures carrying instruments and seat themselves facing the white squares under the downpour of light rest the tips of their bows on the music stand with a simultaneous movement lift them lightly poise them and looking across at the player opposite the first violin counts one two three  flourish spring burgeon burst the pear tree on the top of the mountain fountains jet drops descend but the waters of the rhone flow swift and deep race under the arches and sweep the trailing water leaves washing shadows over the silver fish the spotted fish rushed down by the swift waters now swept into an eddy whereits difficult thisconglomeration of fish all in a pool leaping splashing scraping sharp fins and such a boil of current that the yellow pebbles are churned round and round round and roundfree now rushing downwards or even somehow ascending in exquisite spirals into the air curled like thin shavings from under a plane up and up how lovely goodness is in those who stepping lightly go smiling through the world also in jolly old fishwives squatted under arches obscene old women how deeply they laugh and shake and rollick when they walk from side to side hum hah  thats an early mozart of course  but the tune like all his tunes makes one despairi mean hope what do i mean thats the worst of music i want to dance laugh eat pink cakes yellow cakes drink thin sharp wine or an indecent story nowi could relish that the older one grows the more one likes indecency hah hah im laughing what at you said nothing nor did the old gentleman opposite but supposesupposehush  the melancholy river bears us on when the moon comes through the trailing willow boughs i see your face i hear your voice and the bird singing as we pass the osier bed what are you whispering sorrow sorrow joy joy woven together like reeds in moonlight woven together inextricably commingled bound in pain and strewn in sorrowcrash  the boat sinks rising the figures ascend but now leaf thin tapering to a dusky wraith which fiery tipped draws its twofold passion from my heart for me it sings unseals my sorrow thaws compassion floods with love the sunless world nor ceasing abates its tenderness but deftly subtly weaves in and out until in this pattern this consummation the cleft ones unify soar sob sink to rest sorrow and joy  why then grieve ask what remain unsatisfied i say alls been settled yes laid to rest under a coverlet of rose leaves falling falling ah but they cease one rose leaf falling from an enormous height like a little parachute dropped from an invisible balloon turns flutters waveringly it wont reach us  no no i noticed nothing thats the worst of musicthese silly dreams the second violin was late you say  theres old mrs munro feeling her way outblinder each year poor womanon this slippery floor  eyeless old age greyheaded sphinx there she stands on the pavement beckoning so sternly the red omnibus  how lovely how well they play howhowhow  the tongue is but a clapper simplicity itself the feathers in the hat next me are bright and pleasing as a childs rattle the leaf on the planetree flashes green through the chink in the curtain very strange very exciting  howhowhow hush  these are the lovers on the grass  if madam you will take my hand  sir i would trust you with my heart moreover we have left our bodies in the banqueting hall those on the turf are the shadows of our souls  then these are the embraces of our souls the lemons nod assent the swan pushes from the bank and floats dreaming into mid stream  but to return he followed me down the corridor and as we turned the corner trod on the lace of my petticoat what could i do but cry ah and stop to finger it at which he drew his sword made passes as if he were stabbing something to death and cried mad mad mad whereupon i screamed and the prince who was writing in the large vellum book in the oriel window came out in his velvet skullcap and furred slippers snatched a rapier from the wallthe king of spains gift you knowon which i escaped flinging on this cloak to hide the ravages to my skirtto hide but listen the horns  the gentleman replies so fast to the lady and she runs up the scale with such witty exchange of compliment now culminating in a sob of passion that the words are indistinguishable though the meaning is plain enoughlove laughter flight pursuit celestial blissall floated out on the gayest ripple of tender endearmentuntil the sound of the silver horns at first far distant gradually sounds more and more distinctly as if seneschals were saluting the dawn or proclaiming ominously the escape of the lovers the green garden moonlit pool lemons lovers and fish are all dissolved in the opal sky across which as the horns are joined by trumpets and supported by clarions there rise white arches firmly planted on marble pillars tramp and trumpeting clang and clangour firm establishment fast foundations march of myriads confusion and chaos trod to earth but this city to which we travel has neither stone nor marble hangs enduring stands unshakable nor does a face nor does a flag greet or welcome leave then to perish your hope droop in the desert my joy naked advance bare are the pillars auspicious to none casting no shade resplendent severe back then i fall eager no more desiring only to go find the street mark the buildings greet the applewoman say to the maid who opens the door a starry night   good night good night you go this way  alas i go that     blue  green   green  the pointed fingers of glass hang downwards the light slides down the glass and drops a pool of green all day long the ten fingers of the lustre drop green upon the marble the feathers of parakeetstheir harsh criessharp blades of palm treesgreen too green needles glittering in the sun but the hard glass drips on to the marble the pools hover above the dessert sand the camels lurch through them the pools settle on the marble rushes edge them weeds clog them here and there a white blossom the frog flops over at night the stars are set there unbroken evening comes and the shadow sweeps the green over the mantelpiece the ruffled surface of ocean no ships come the aimless waves sway beneath the empty sky its night the needles drip blots of blue the greens out   blue  the snubnosed monster rises to the surface and spouts through his blunt nostrils two columns of water which fierywhite in the centre spray off into a fringe of blue beads strokes of blue line the black tarpaulin of his hide slushing the water through mouth and nostrils he sings heavy with water and the blue closes over him dowsing the polished pebbles of his eyes thrown upon the beach he lies blunt obtuse shedding dry blue scales their metallic blue stains the rusty iron on the beach blue are the ribs of the wrecked rowing boat a wave rolls beneath the blue bells but the cathedrals different cold incense laden faint blue with the veils of madonnas     kew gardens   from the ovalshaped flowerbed there rose perhaps a hundred stalks spreading into heartshaped or tongueshaped leaves half way up and unfurling at the tip red or blue or yellow petals marked with spots of colour raised upon the surface and from the red blue or yellow gloom of the throat emerged a straight bar rough with gold dust and slightly clubbed at the end the petals were voluminous enough to be stirred by the summer breeze and when they moved the red blue and yellow lights passed one over the other staining an inch of the brown earth beneath with a spot of the most intricate colour the light fell either upon the smooth grey back of a pebble or the shell of a snail with its brown circular veins or falling into a raindrop it expanded with such intensity of red blue and yellow the thin walls of water that one expected them to burst and disappear instead the drop was left in a second silver grey once more and the light now settled upon the flesh of a leaf revealing the branching thread of fibre beneath the surface and again it moved on and spread its illumination in the vast green spaces beneath the dome of the heartshaped and tongueshaped leaves then the breeze stirred rather more briskly overhead and the colour was flashed into the air above into the eyes of the men and women who walk in kew gardens in july  the figures of these men and women straggled past the flowerbed with a curiously irregular movement not unlike that of the white and blue butterflies who crossed the turf in zigzag flights from bed to bed the man was about six inches in front of the woman strolling carelessly while she bore on with greater purpose only turning her head now and then to see that the children were not too far behind the man kept this distance in front of the woman purposely though perhaps unconsciously for he wished to go on with his thoughts  fifteen years ago i came here with lily he thought we sat somewhere over there by a lake and i begged her to marry me all through the hot afternoon how the dragonfly kept circling round us how clearly i see the dragonfly and her shoe with the square silver buckle at the toe all the time i spoke i saw her shoe and when it moved impatiently i knew without looking up what she was going to say the whole of her seemed to be in her shoe and my love my desire were in the dragonfly for some reason i thought that if it settled there on that leaf the broad one with the red flower in the middle of it if the dragonfly settled on the leaf she would say yes at once but the dragonfly went round and round it never settled anywhereof course not happily not or i shouldnt be walking here with eleanor and the childrentell me eleanor dyou ever think of the past  why do you ask simon  because ive been thinking of the past ive been thinking of lily the woman i might have married well why are you silent do you mind my thinking of the past  why should i mind simon doesnt one always think of the past in a garden with men and women lying under the trees arent they ones past all that remains of it those men and women those ghosts lying under the trees  ones happiness ones reality  for me a square silver shoe buckle and a dragonfly  for me a kiss imagine six little girls sitting before their easels twenty years ago down by the side of a lake painting the waterlilies the first red waterlilies id ever seen and suddenly a kiss there on the back of my neck and my hand shook all the afternoon so that i couldnt paint i took out my watch and marked the hour when i would allow myself to think of the kiss for five minutes onlyit was so preciousthe kiss of an old greyhaired woman with a wart on her nose the mother of all my kisses all my life come caroline come hubert  they walked on the past the flowerbed now walking four abreast and soon diminished in size among the trees and looked half transparent as the sunlight and shade swam over their backs in large trembling irregular patches  in the oval flower bed the snail whose shell had been stained red blue and yellow for the space of two minutes or so now appeared to be moving very slightly in its shell and next began to labour over the crumbs of loose earth which broke away and rolled down as it passed over them it appeared to have a definite goal in front of it differing in this respect from the singular high stepping angular green insect who attempted to cross in front of it and waited for a second with its antennÃ¦ trembling as if in deliberation and then stepped off as rapidly and strangely in the opposite direction brown cliffs with deep green lakes in the hollows flat bladelike trees that waved from root to tip round boulders of grey stone vast crumpled surfaces of a thin crackling textureall these objects lay across the snails progress between one stalk and another to his goal before he had decided whether to circumvent the arched tent of a dead leaf or to breast it there came past the bed the feet of other human beings  this time they were both men the younger of the two wore an expression of perhaps unnatural calm he raised his eyes and fixed them very steadily in front of him while his companion spoke and directly his companion had done speaking he looked on the ground again and sometimes opened his lips only after a long pause and sometimes did not open them at all the elder man had a curiously uneven and shaky method of walking jerking his hand forward and throwing up his head abruptly rather in the manner of an impatient carriage horse tired of waiting outside a house but in the man these gestures were irresolute and pointless he talked almost incessantly he smiled to himself and again began to talk as if the smile had been an answer he was talking about spiritsthe spirits of the dead who according to him were even now telling him all sorts of odd things about their experiences in heaven  heaven was known to the ancients as thessaly william and now with this war the spirit matter is rolling between the hills like thunder he paused seemed to listen smiled jerked his head and continued  you have a small electric battery and a piece of rubber to insulate the wireisolateinsulatewell well skip the details no good going into details that wouldnt be understoodand in short the little machine stands in any convenient position by the head of the bed we will say on a neat mahogany stand all arrangements being properly fixed by workmen under my direction the widow applies her ear and summons the spirit by sign as agreed women widows women in black  here he seemed to have caught sight of a womans dress in the distance which in the shade looked a purple black he took off his hat placed his hand upon his heart and hurried towards her muttering and gesticulating feverishly but william caught him by the sleeve and touched a flower with the tip of his walkingstick in order to divert the old mans attention after looking at it for a moment in some confusion the old man bent his ear to it and seemed to answer a voice speaking from it for he began talking about the forests of uruguay which he had visited hundreds of years ago in company with the most beautiful young woman in europe he could be heard murmuring about forests of uruguay blanketed with the wax petals of tropical roses nightingales sea beaches mermaids and women drowned at sea as he suffered himself to be moved on by william upon whose face the look of stoical patience grew slowly deeper and deeper  following his steps so closely as to be slightly puzzled by his gestures came two elderly women of the lower middle class one stout and ponderous the other rosy cheeked and nimble like most people of their station they were frankly fascinated by any signs of eccentricity betokening a disordered brain especially in the welltodo but they were too far off to be certain whether the gestures were merely eccentric or genuinely mad after they had scrutinised the old mans back in silence for a moment and given each other a queer sly look they went on energetically piecing together their very complicated dialogue  nell bert lot cess phil pa he says i says she says i says i says i says  my bert sis bill grandad the old man sugar        sugar flour kippers greens      sugar sugar sugar   the ponderous woman looked through the pattern of falling words at the flowers standing cool firm and upright in the earth with a curious expression she saw them as a sleeper waking from a heavy sleep sees a brass candlestick reflecting the light in an unfamiliar way and closes his eyes and opens them and seeing the brass candlestick again finally starts broad awake and stares at the candlestick with all his powers so the heavy woman came to a standstill opposite the ovalshaped flower bed and ceased even to pretend to listen to what the other woman was saying she stood there letting the words fall over her swaying the top part of her body slowly backwards and forwards looking at the flowers then she suggested that they should find a seat and have their tea  the snail had now considered every possible method of reaching his goal without going round the dead leaf or climbing over it let alone the effort needed for climbing a leaf he was doubtful whether the thin texture which vibrated with such an alarming crackle when touched even by the tip of his horns would bear his weight and this determined him finally to creep beneath it for there was a point where the leaf curved high enough from the ground to admit him he had just inserted his head in the opening and was taking stock of the high brown roof and was getting used to the cool brown light when two other people came past outside on the turf this time they were both young a young man and a young woman they were both in the prime of youth or even in that season which precedes the prime of youth the season before the smooth pink folds of the flower have burst their gummy case when the wings of the butterfly though fully grown are motionless in the sun  lucky it isnt friday he observed  why dyou believe in luck  they make you pay sixpence on friday  whats sixpence anyway isnt it worth sixpence  whats itwhat do you mean by it  o anythingi meanyou know what i mean  long pauses came between each of these remarks they were uttered in toneless and monotonous voices the couple stood still on the edge of the flower bed and together pressed the end of her parasol deep down into the soft earth the action and the fact that his hand rested on the top of hers expressed their feelings in a strange way as these short insignificant words also expressed something words with short wings for their heavy body of meaning inadequate to carry them far and thus alighting awkwardly upon the very common objects that surrounded them and were to their inexperienced touch so massive but who knows so they thought as they pressed the parasol into the earth what precipices arent concealed in them or what slopes of ice dont shine in the sun on the other side who knows who has ever seen this before even when she wondered what sort of tea they gave you at kew he felt that something loomed up behind her words and stood vast and solid behind them and the mist very slowly rose and uncoveredo heavens what were those shapeslittle white tables and waitresses who looked first at her and then at him and there was a bill that he would pay with a real two shilling piece and it was real all real he assured himself fingering the coin in his pocket real to everyone except to him and to her even to him it began to seem real and thenbut it was too exciting to stand and think any longer and he pulled the parasol out of the earth with a jerk and was impatient to find the place where one had tea with other people like other people  come along trissie its time we had our tea  wherever does one have ones tea she asked with the oddest thrill of excitement in her voice looking vaguely round and letting herself be drawn on down the grass path trailing her parasol turning her head this way and that way forgetting her tea wishing to go down there and then down there remembering orchids and cranes among wild flowers a chinese pagoda and a crimson crested bird but he bore her on  thus one couple after another with much the same irregular and aimless movement passed the flowerbed and were enveloped in layer after layer of green blue vapour in which at first their bodies had substance and a dash of colour but later both substance and colour dissolved in the greenblue atmosphere how hot it was so hot that even the thrush chose to hop like a mechanical bird in the shadow of the flowers with long pauses between one movement and the next instead of rambling vaguely the white butterflies danced one above another making with their white shifting flakes the outline of a shattered marble column above the tallest flowers the glass roofs of the palm house shone as if a whole market full of shiny green umbrellas had opened in the sun and in the drone of the aeroplane the voice of the summer sky murmured its fierce soul yellow and black pink and snow white shapes of all these colours men women and children were spotted for a second upon the horizon and then seeing the breadth of yellow that lay upon the grass they wavered and sought shade beneath the trees dissolving like drops of water in the yellow and green atmosphere staining it faintly with red and blue it seemed as if all gross and heavy bodies had sunk down in the heat motionless and lay huddled upon the ground but their voices went wavering from them as if they were flames lolling from the thick waxen bodies of candles voices yes voices wordless voices breaking the silence suddenly with such depth of contentment such passion of desire or in the voices of children such freshness of surprise breaking the silence but there was no silence all the time the motor omnibuses were turning their wheels and changing their gear like a vast nest of chinese boxes all of wrought steel turning ceaselessly one within another the city murmured on the top of which the voices cried aloud and the petals of myriads of flowers flashed their colours into the air     the mark on the wall   perhaps it was the middle of january in the present year that i first looked up and saw the mark on the wall in order to fix a date it is necessary to remember what one saw so now i think of the fire the steady film of yellow light upon the page of my book the three chrysanthemums in the round glass bowl on the mantelpiece yes it must have been the winter time and we had just finished our tea for i remember that i was smoking a cigarette when i looked up and saw the mark on the wall for the first time i looked up through the smoke of my cigarette and my eye lodged for a moment upon the burning coals and that old fancy of the crimson flag flapping from the castle tower came into my mind and i thought of the cavalcade of red knights riding up the side of the black rock rather to my relief the sight of the mark interrupted the fancy for it is an old fancy an automatic fancy made as a child perhaps the mark was a small round mark black upon the white wall about six or seven inches above the mantelpiece  how readily our thoughts swarm upon a new object lifting it a little way as ants carry a blade of straw so feverishly and then leave it if that mark was made by a nail it cant have been for a picture it must have been for a miniaturethe miniature of a lady with white powdered curls powderdusted cheeks and lips like red carnations a fraud of course for the people who had this house before us would have chosen pictures in that wayan old picture for an old room that is the sort of people they werevery interesting people and i think of them so often in such queer places because one will never see them again never know what happened next they wanted to leave this house because they wanted to change their style of furniture so he said and he was in process of saying that in his opinion art should have ideas behind it when we were torn asunder as one is torn from the old lady about to pour out tea and the young man about to hit the tennis ball in the back garden of the suburban villa as one rushes past in the train  but as for that mark im not sure about it i dont believe it was made by a nail after all its too big too round for that i might get up but if i got up and looked at it ten to one i shouldnt be able to say for certain because once a things done no one ever knows how it happened oh dear me the mystery of life the inaccuracy of thought the ignorance of humanity to show how very little control of our possessions we havewhat an accidental affair this living is after all our civilizationlet me just count over a few of the things lost in one lifetime beginning for that seems always the most mysterious of losseswhat cat would gnaw what rat would nibblethree pale blue canisters of bookbinding tools then there were the bird cages the iron hoops the steel skates the queen anne coalscuttle the bagatelle board the hand organall gone and jewels too opals and emeralds they lie about the roots of turnips what a scraping paring affair it is to be sure the wonder is that ive any clothes on my back that i sit surrounded by solid furniture at this moment why if one wants to compare life to anything one must liken it to being blown through the tube at fifty miles an hourlanding at the other end without a single hairpin in ones hair shot out at the feet of god entirely naked tumbling head over heels in the asphodel meadows like brown paper parcels pitched down a shoot in the post office with ones hair flying back like the tail of a racehorse yes that seems to express the rapidity of life the perpetual waste and repair all so casual all so haphazard  but after life the slow pulling down of thick green stalks so that the cup of the flower as it turns over deluges one with purple and red light why after all should one not be born there as one is born here helpless speechless unable to focus ones eyesight groping at the roots of the grass at the toes of the giants as for saying which are trees and which are men and women or whether there are such things that one wont be in a condition to do for fifty years or so there will be nothing but spaces of light and dark intersected by thick stalks and rather higher up perhaps roseshaped blots of an indistinct colourdim pinks and blueswhich will as time goes on become more definite becomei dont know what  and yet that mark on the wall is not a hole at all it may even be caused by some round black substance such as a small rose leaf left over from the summer and i not being a very vigilant housekeeperlook at the dust on the mantelpiece for example the dust which so they say buried troy three times over only fragments of pots utterly refusing annihilation as one can believe  the tree outside the window taps very gently on the pane i want to think quietly calmly spaciously never to be interrupted never to have to rise from my chair to slip easily from one thing to another without any sense of hostility or obstacle i want to sink deeper and deeper away from the surface with its hard separate facts to steady myself let me catch hold of the first idea that passes shakespeare well he will do as well as another a man who sat himself solidly in an armchair and looked into the fire soa shower of ideas fell perpetually from some very high heaven down through his mind he leant his forehead on his hand and people looking in through the open doorfor this scene is supposed to take place on a summers eveningbut how dull this is this historical fiction it doesnt interest me at all i wish i could hit upon a pleasant track of thought a track indirectly reflecting credit upon myself for those are the pleasantest thoughts and very frequent even in the minds of modest mousecoloured people who believe genuinely that they dislike to hear their own praises they are not thoughts directly praising oneself that is the beauty of them they are thoughts like this  and then i came into the room they were discussing botany i said how id seen a flower growing on a dust heap on the site of an old house in kingsway the seed i said must have been sown in the reign of charles the first what flowers grew in the reign of charles the first i askedbut i dont remember the answer tall flowers with purple tassels to them perhaps and so it goes on all the time im dressing up the figure of myself in my own mind lovingly stealthily not openly adoring it for if i did that i should catch myself out and stretch my hand at once for a book in selfprotection indeed it is curious how instinctively one protects the image of oneself from idolatry or any other handling that could make it ridiculous or too unlike the original to be believed in any longer or is it not so very curious after all it is a matter of great importance suppose the looking glass smashes the image disappears and the romantic figure with the green of forest depths all about it is there no longer but only that shell of a person which is seen by other peoplewhat an airless shallow bald prominent world it becomes a world not to be lived in as we face each other in omnibuses and underground railways we are looking into the mirror that accounts for the vagueness the gleam of glassiness in our eyes and the novelists in future will realize more and more the importance of these reflections for of course there is not one reflection but an almost infinite number those are the depths they will explore those the phantoms they will pursue leaving the description of reality more and more out of their stories taking a knowledge of it for granted as the greeks did and shakespeare perhapsbut these generalizations are very worthless the military sound of the word is enough it recalls leading articles cabinet ministersa whole class of things indeed which as a child one thought the thing itself the standard thing the real thing from which one could not depart save at the risk of nameless damnation generalizations bring back somehow sunday in london sunday afternoon walks sunday luncheons and also ways of speaking of the dead clothes and habitslike the habit of sitting all together in one room until a certain hour although nobody liked it there was a rule for everything the rule for tablecloths at that particular period was that they should be made of tapestry with little yellow compartments marked upon them such as you may see in photographs of the carpets in the corridors of the royal palaces tablecloths of a different kind were not real tablecloths how shocking and yet how wonderful it was to discover that these real things sunday luncheons sunday walks country houses and tablecloths were not entirely real were indeed half phantoms and the damnation which visited the disbeliever in them was only a sense of illegitimate freedom what now takes the place of those things i wonder those real standard things men perhaps should you be a woman the masculine point of view which governs our lives which sets the standard which establishes whitakers table of precedency which has become i suppose since the war half a phantom to many men and women which soon one may hope will be laughed into the dustbin where the phantoms go the mahogany sideboards and the landseer prints gods and devils hell and so forth leaving us all with an intoxicating sense of illegitimate freedomif freedom exists  in certain lights that mark on the wall seems actually to project from the wall nor is it entirely circular i cannot be sure but it seems to cast a perceptible shadow suggesting that if i ran my finger down that strip of the wall it would at a certain point mount and descend a small tumulus a smooth tumulus like those barrows on the south downs which are they say either tombs or camps of the two i should prefer them to be tombs desiring melancholy like most english people and finding it natural at the end of a walk to think of the bones stretched beneath the turf there must be some book about it some antiquary must have dug up those bones and given them a name what sort of a man is an antiquary i wonder retired colonels for the most part i daresay leading parties of aged labourers to the top here examining clods of earth and stone and getting into correspondence with the neighbouring clergy which being opened at breakfast time gives them a feeling of importance and the comparison of arrowheads necessitates crosscountry journeys to the county towns an agreeable necessity both to them and to their elderly wives who wish to make plum jam or to clean out the study and have every reason for keeping that great question of the camp or the tomb in perpetual suspension while the colonel himself feels agreeably philosophic in accumulating evidence on both sides of the question it is true that he does finally incline to believe in the camp and being opposed indites a pamphlet which he is about to read at the quarterly meeting of the local society when a stroke lays him low and his last conscious thoughts are not of wife or child but of the camp and that arrowhead there which is now in the case at the local museum together with the foot of a chinese murderess a handful of elizabethan nails a great many tudor clay pipes a piece of roman pottery and the wineglass that nelson drank out ofproving i really dont know what  no no nothing is proved nothing is known and if i were to get up at this very moment and ascertain that the mark on the wall is reallywhat shall we saythe head of a gigantic old nail driven in two hundred years ago which has now owing to the patient attrition of many generations of housemaids revealed its head above the coat of paint and is taking its first view of modern life in the sight of a whitewalled firelit room what should i gainknowledge matter for further speculation i can think sitting still as well as standing up and what is knowledge what are our learned men save the descendants of witches and hermits who crouched in caves and in woods brewing herbs interrogating shrewmice and writing down the language of the stars and the less we honour them as our superstitions dwindle and our respect for beauty and health of mind increases yes one could imagine a very pleasant world a quiet spacious world with the flowers so red and blue in the open fields a world without professors or specialists or housekeepers with the profiles of policemen a world which one could slice with ones thought as a fish slices the water with his fin grazing the stems of the waterlilies hanging suspended over nests of white sea eggs how peaceful it is down here rooted in the centre of the world and gazing up through the grey waters with their sudden gleams of light and their reflectionsif it were not for whitakers almanackif it were not for the table of precedency  i must jump up and see for myself what that mark on the wall really isa nail a roseleaf a crack in the wood  here is nature once more at her old game of selfpreservation this train of thought she perceives is threatening mere waste of energy even some collision with reality for who will ever be able to lift a finger against whitakers table of precedency the archbishop of canterbury is followed by the lord high chancellor the lord high chancellor is followed by the archbishop of york everybody follows somebody such is the philosophy of whitaker and the great thing is to know who follows whom whitaker knows and let that so nature counsels comfort you instead of enraging you and if you cant be comforted if you must shatter this hour of peace think of the mark on the wall  i understand natures gameher prompting to take action as a way of ending any thought that threatens to excite or to pain hence i suppose comes our slight contempt for men of actionmen we assume who dont think still theres no harm in putting a full stop to ones disagreeable thoughts by looking at a mark on the wall  indeed now that i have fixed my eyes upon it i feel that i have grasped a plank in the sea i feel a satisfying sense of reality which at once turns the two archbishops and the lord high chancellor to the shadows of shades here is something definite something real thus waking from a midnight dream of horror one hastily turns on the light and lies quiescent worshipping the chest of drawers worshipping solidity worshipping reality worshipping the impersonal world which is a proof of some existence other than ours that is what one wants to be sure of wood is a pleasant thing to think about it comes from a tree and trees grow and we dont know how they grow for years and years they grow without paying any attention to us in meadows in forests and by the side of riversall things one likes to think about the cows swish their tails beneath them on hot afternoons they paint rivers so green that when a moorhen dives one expects to see its feathers all green when it comes up again i like to think of the fish balanced against the stream like flags blown out and of waterbeetles slowly raising domes of mud upon the bed of the river i like to think of the tree itself first the close dry sensation of being wood then the grinding of the storm then the slow delicious ooze of sap i like to think of it too on winters nights standing in the empty field with all leaves closefurled nothing tender exposed to the iron bullets of the moon a naked mast upon an earth that goes tumbling tumbling all night long the song of birds must sound very loud and strange in june and how cold the feet of insects must feel upon it as they make laborious progresses up the creases of the bark or sun themselves upon the thin green awning of the leaves and look straight in front of them with diamondcut red eyes one by one the fibres snap beneath the immense cold pressure of the earth then the last storm comes and falling the highest branches drive deep into the ground again even so life isnt done with there are a million patient watchful lives still for a tree all over the world in bedrooms in ships on the pavement lining rooms where men and women sit after tea smoking cigarettes it is full of peaceful thoughts happy thoughts this tree i should like to take each one separatelybut something is getting in the way where was i what has it all been about a tree a river the downs whitakers almanack the fields of asphodel i cant remember a thing everythings moving falling slipping vanishing there is a vast upheaval of matter someone is standing over me and saying  im going out to buy a newspaper  yes  though its no good buying newspapers nothing ever happens curse this war god damn this war all the same i dont see why we should have a snail on our wall  ah the mark on the wall it was a snail
