trees      there had been phantoms paleremembered shapes     of this and this occasion sisterly     in their resemblances each effigy     crowned with the same bright hair above the napes     white rounded firmness and each body alert     with such swift loveliness that very rest     seemed a poised movement  phantoms that impressed     but a faint influence and could bless or hurt     no more than dreams and these ghost things were she     for formless still without identity     not one she seemed not clear but many and dim     one face among the legions of the street     indifferent mystery she was for him     something still uncreated incomplete       ii      bright windy sunshine and the shadow of cloud     quicken the heavy summer to new birth     of life and motion on the drowsing earth     the huge elms stir till all the air is loud     with their awakening from the muffled sleep     of long hot days and on the wavering line     that marks the alternate ebb of shade and shine     under the trees a little group is deep     in laughing talk the shadow as it flows     across them dims the lustre of a rose     quenches the bright clear gold of hair the green     of a girls dress and life seems faint the light     swings back and in the rose a fire is seen     gold hairs aflame and green grows emerald bright       iii      she leans and there is laughter in the face     she turns towards him and it seems a door     suddenly opened on some desolate place     with a burst of light and music what before     was hidden shines in loveliness revealed     now first he sees her beautiful and knows     that he must love her and the doom is sealed     of all his happiness and all the woes     that shall be born of pregnant years hereafter     the swift poise of a head a flutter of laughter     and love flows in on him its vastness pent     within his narrow life the pain it brings     boundless for love is infinite discontent     with the poor lonely life of transient things       iv      men see their god an immanence divine     smile through the curve of flesh or moulded clay     in bare ploughed lands that go sloping away     to meet the sky in one clean exquisite line     out of the shortseen dawns of ecstasy     they draw new beauty whence new thoughts are born     and in their turn conceive as grains of corn     germ and create new life and endlessly     shall live creating out of earthly seeds     springs the aerial flower one spirit proceeds     through change the same in body and in soul     the spirit of life and love that triumphs still     in its slow struggle towards some faroff goal     through lust and death and the bitterness of will       v      one spirit it is that stirs the fathomless deep     of human minds that shakes the elms in storm     that sings in passionate music or on warm     still evenings bosoms forth the tufted sleep     of thistleseeds that wait a travelling wind     one spirit shapes the subtle rhythms of thought     and the long thundering seas the soul is wrought     of one stuff with the bodymatter and mind     woven together in so close a mesh     that flowers may blossom into a song that flesh     may strangely teach the loveliest holiest things     to watching spirits truth is brought to birth     not in some vacant heaven its beauty springs     from the dear bosom of material earth       vi in the hayloft      the darkness in the loft is sweet and warm     with the stored hay  darkness intensified     by one bright shaft that enters through the wide     tall doors from under fringes of a storm     which makes the doomed sun brighter on the hay     perched mountainhigh they sit and silently     watch the motes dance and look at the dark sky     and mark how heartbreakingly far away     and yet how close and clear the distance seems     while all at hand is cloudbrightness of dreams     unrealisable yet seen so clear     so only just beyond the dark they wait     scarce knowing what they wait for half in fear     expectance draws the curtain from their fate       vii      the silence of the storm weighs heavily     on their strained spirits sometimes one will say     some trivial thing as though to ward away     mysterious powers that imminently lie     in wait with the strong exorcising grace     of everydays futility desire     becomes upon a sudden a crystal fire     defined and hardif he could kiss her face     could kiss her hair as if by chance her hand     brushes on his  ah can she understand     or is she pedestalled above the touch     of his desire he wonders dare he seek     from her that little that infinitely much     and suddenly she kissed him on the cheek       viii mountains      a stronger gust catches the cloud and twists     a spindle of rifted darkness through its heart     a gash in the damp grey which thrust apart     reveals black depths a moment then the mists     shut down again a white uneasy sea     heaves round the climbers and beneath their feet     he strains on upwards through the wind and sleet     poised or swift moving or laboriously     lifting his weight and if he should let go     what would he find down there down there below     the curtain of the mist what would he find     beyond the dim and stifling now and here     beneath the unsettled turmoil of his mind     oh there were nameless depths he shrank with fear       ix      the hills more glorious in their coat of snow     rise all around him in the valleys run     bright streams and there are lakes that catch the sun     and sunlit fields of emerald far below     that seem alive with inward light in smoke     the far horizons fade and there is peace     on everything a sense of blessed release     from wilful strife like some prophetic cloak     the spirit of the mountains has descended     on all the world and its unrest is ended     even the sea glimpsed far away seems still     hushed to a silver peace its storm and strife     mountains of vision calm above fate and will     you hold the promise of the freer life       x in the little room      london unfurls its incensecoloured dusk     before the panes rich but a while ago     with the charred gold and the red emberglow     of dying sunset houses quit the husk     of secrecy which through the day returns     a blank to all enquiry but at nights     the cheerfulness of fire and lamp invites     the darkness inward curious of what burns     with such a coloured life when all is dead     the daylight world outside with overhead     white clouds and where we walk the blaze     of wet and sunlit streets shops and the stream     of glittering trafficall that the nights erase     colour and speed surviving but in dream       xi      outside the dusk but in the little room     all is alive with light which brightly glints     on curving cup or the stiff folds of chintz     evoking its own whiteness shadows loom     bulging and black upon the walls where hang     rich coloured plates of beauties that appeal     less to the sense of sight than to the feel     so moistly satin are their breasts a pang     almost of pain runs through him when he sees     hanging a homeless marvel next to these     the silken breastplate of a mandarin     centuries dead which he had given her     exquisite miracle when men could spin     jays wing and belly of the kingfisher       xii      in silence and as though expectantly     she crouches at his feet while he caresses     his lightdrawn fingers with the touch of tresses     sleeked round her head closebanded lustrously     save where at nape and temple the smooth brown     sleaves out into a pale transparent mist     of hair and tangled light so to exist     poised twixt the deep of thought where spirits drown     life in a void impalpable nothingness     and on the other side the pain and stress     of clamorous action and the gnawing fire     of will focal upon a point of eartheven thus     to sit eternally without desire     and yet selfknown were happiness for us       xiii      she turns her head and in a flash of laughter     looks up at him and helplessly he feels     that life has circled with returning wheels     back to a startingpoint before and after     merge in this instant momently the same     for it was thus she leaned and laughing turned     when manifest the spirit of beauty burned     in her young body with an inward flame     and first he knew and loved her in full tide     life halts within him suddenly stupefied     sight blackness lightningstruck but blindly tender     he draws her up to meet him and she lies     close folded by his arms in glad surrender     smiling and with drooped head and half closed eyes       xiv      i give you all would that i might give more     he sees the colour dawn across her cheeks     and die again to white marks as she speaks     the trembling of her lips as though she bore     some sudden pain and hardly mastered it     within his arms he feels her shuddering     piteously trembling like some wild woodthing     caught unawares compassion infinite     mounts up within him thus to hold and keep     and comfort her distressed lull her to sleep     and gently kiss her brow and hair and eyes     seems love perfectedtempled high and white     against the calm of golden autumn skies     and shining quenchlessly with vestal light       xv      but passion ambushed by the aerial shrine     comes forth to dance a hoofed obscenity     his satyrs dance with laughter in his eye     and cruelty along the scarlet line     of his bright smiling mouth all uncontrolled     loves rebel servant he delights to beat     the maddening quick dry rhythm of goatish feet     even in the sanctuary and makes bold     to mime himself the godhead of the place     he turns in terror from her trancecalmed face     from the whitelidded languor of her eyes     from lips that passion never shook before     but glad in the promise of her sacrifice     i give you all would that i might give more       xvi      he is afraid seeing her lie so still     so utterly his own afraid lest she     should open wide her eyes and let him see     the passionate conquest of her virgin will     shine there in triumph starrybright with tears     he thrusts her from him face and hair and breast     hands he had touched lips that his lips had pressed     seem things deadly to be desired he fears     lest she should body forth in palpable shame     those dreams and longings that his blood aflame     through the hot dark of summer nights had dreamed     and longed must all his love then turn to this     was lust the end of what so pure had seemed     he must escape ah god her touch her kiss       xvii in the park      laughing tonight i said to him the park     has turned the garden of a symbolist     those old great trees that rise above the mist     gold with the light of evening and the dark     still water where the dying sun evokes     an echoed gloryhere i recognize     those ancient gardens mirrored by the eyes     of poets that hate the world of common folks     like you and me and that thin pious crowd     which yonder sings its hymns so humbly proud     of holiness the garden of escape     lies here a small green world and still the bride     of quietness although an imminent rape     roars ceaselessly about on every side       xviii      i had forgotten what i had lightly said     and without speech without a thought i went     steeped in that golden quiet all content     to drink the transient beauty as it sped     out of eternal darkness into time     to light and burn and know itself a fire     yet doomedah fate of the fulfilled desire     to fade a meteor paying for the crime     of living glorious in the denser air     of our material earth a strange despair     an agony yet strangely subtly sweet     and tender as an unpassionate caress     filled me  oh laughter youths conceit     grown almost conscious of youths feebleness       xix      he spoke abrupt across my dream dear garden     a stranger to your magic peace i stand     beyond your walls lost in a fevered land     of stones and fire would that the gods would harden     my soul against its torment or would blind     those yearning glimpses of a life at rest     in perfect beautyglimpses at the best     through unpassed bars and here without the wind     of scattering passion blows and women pass     glittereyed down putrid alleys where the glass     of some grimed window suddenly parades     ah sickening heartbeat of desirethe grace     of bare and milkwarm flesh the vision fades     and at the pane shows a blind tortured face       xx selftorment      the days pass by empty of thought and will     his thought grows stagnant at its very springs     with every channel on the world of things     dammed up and thus by its long standing still     poisons itself and sickens to decay     all his high love for her his fair desire     loses its light and a dull rancorous fire     burning darkness and bitterness that prey     upon his heart are left his spirit burns     sometimes with hatred or the hatred turns     to a fierce lust for her more cruel than hate     till he is weary wrestling with its force     and evermore she haunts him early and late     as pitilessly as an old remorse       xxi      streets and the solitude of country places     were once his friends but as a man born blind     opening his eyes from lovely dreams might find     the world a desert and mens larval faces     so hateful he would wish to seek again     the darkness and his old chimeric sight     of beauties inwardso that fresh delight     vision of bright fields and angelic men     that love which made him all the world is gone     hating and hated now he stands alone     an islandpoint measureless gulfs apart     from other lives from the old happiness     of being more than self when heart to heart     gave all yet grew the greater not the less       xxii the quarry in the wood      swiftly deliberate he seeks the place     a small wind stirs the copse is bright in the sun     like quicksilver the shine and shadow run     across the leaves a bramble whips his face     the tears spring fast and through the rainbow mist     he sees a world that wavers like the flame     of a blown candle tears of pain and shame     and lips that once had laughed and sung and kissed     trembling in the passion of his sobbing breath     the world a candle shuddering to its death     and life a darkness blind and utterly void     of any love or goodness all deceit     this friendship and this god all shams destroyed     and truth seen now                          earth fails beneath his feet         song of poplars       shepherd to yon tall poplars tune your flute     let them pierce keenly subtly shrill     the slow blue rumour of the hill     let the grass cry with an anguish of evening gold     and the great sky be mute      then hearken how the poplar trees unfold     their buds yet close and gummed and blind     in airy leafage of the mind     rustling in silvery whispers the twinhued scales     that fade not nor grow old      poplars and fountains and you cypress spires     springing in dark and rusty flame     seek you aught that hath a name     or say say are you all an upward agony     of undefined desires      say are you happy in the golden march     of sunlight all across the day     or do you watch the uncertain way     that leads the withering moon on cloudy stairs     over the heavens wide arch      is it towards sorrow or towards joy you lift     the sharpness of your trembling spears     or do you seek through the grey tears     that blur the sky in the heart of the triumphing blue     a deeper calmer rift      so i have tuned my music to the trees     and there were voices dim below     their shrillness voices swelling slow     in the blue murmur of hills and a golden cry     and then vast silences         the reef       my green aquarium of phantom fish     goggling in on me through the misty panes     my rotting leaves and fields spongy with rains     my few clear quiet autumn daysi wish      i could leave all clearness and mistiness     sodden or goldenly crystal all too still     yes and i too rot with the leaves that fill     the hollows in the woods i am grown less      than human listless aimless as the green     idiot fishes of my aquarium     who loiter down their dim tunnels and come     and look at me and drift away nought seen      or understood but only glazedly     reflected upwards upwards through the shadows     through the lush sponginess of deepsea meadows     where harelipped monsters batten let me ply      winged fins bursting this matrix dark to find     jewels and movement mintage of sunlight     scattered largely by the profuse wind     and gulfs of blue brightness too deep for sight      free newly born on roads of music and air     speeding and singing i shall seek the place     where all the shining threads of water race     drawn in green ropes and foamy meshes there      on the red fretted ramparts of a tower     of coral rooted in the depths shall break     an endless sequence of joy and speed and power     green shall shatter to foam flake with white flake      shall create an instants shining constellation     upon the blue and all the air shall be     full of a million wings that swift and free     laugh in the sun all power and strong elation      yes i shall seek that reef which is beyond     all isles however magically sleeping     in tideless seas uncharted and unconned     save by blind eyes beyond the laughter and weeping      that brood like a cloud over the lands of men     movement passion of colour and pure wings     curving to cut like knivesthese are the things     i search forpassion beyond the ken      of our foiled violences and more swift     than any blow which man aims against time     the invulnerable motion that shall rift     all dimness with the lightning of a rhyme      or note or colour and the body shall be     quick as the mind and will shall find release     from bondage to brute things and joyously     soul will and body in the strength of triune peace      shall live the perfect grace of power unwasted     and love consummate marvellously blending     passion and reverence in a single spring     of quickening force till now never yet tasted      but ever ceaselessly thirsted for shall crown     the new life with its ageless starry fire     i go to seek that reef far down far down     below the edge of everydays desire      beyond the magical islands where of old     i was content dreaming to give the lie     to misery they were all strong and bold     that thither came and shall i dare to try         winter dream       oh windswept towers     oh endlessly blossoming trees     white clouds and lucid eyes     and pools in the rocks whose unplumbed blue is pregnant     with who knows what of subtlety     and magical curves and limbs     white anadyomene and her shallow breasts     motherofpearled with light      and oh the april april of straight soft hair     falling smooth as the mountain water and brown     the april of little leaves unblinded     of rosy nipples and innocence     and the blue languor of weary eyelids      across a huge gulf i fling my voice     and my desires together     across a huge gulf  on the other bank     crouches april with her hair as smooth and straight and brown     as falling waters     oh brave curve upwards and outwards     oh despair of the downward tilting     despair still beautiful     as a great star one has watched all night     wheeling down under the hills     silence widens and darkens     voice and desires have dropped out of sight     i am all alone dreaming she would come and kiss me         the flowers       day after day     at springs return     i watch my flowers how they burn     their lives away      the candle crocus     and daffodil gold     drink fire of the sunshine     quickly cold      and the proud tulip     how red he glows     is quenched ere summer     can kindle the rose      purple as the innermost     core of a sinking flame     deep in the leaves the violets smoulder     to the dust whence they came      day after day     at springs return     i watch my flowers how they burn     their lives away     day after day          the elms       fine as the dust of plumy fountains blowing     across the lanterns of a revelling night     the tiny leaves of aprils earliest growing     powder the treesso vaporously light     they seem to float billows of emerald foam     blown by the south on its bright airy tide     seeming less trees than things beatified     come from the world of thought which was their home      for a while only rooted strong and fast     soon will they lift towards the summer sky     their mountainmass of clotted greenery     their immaterial season quickly past     they grow opaque and therefore needs must die     since every earth to earth returns at last         out of the window       in the middle of countries far from hills and sea     are the little places one passes by in trains     and never stops at where the skies extend     uninterrupted and the level plains     stretch green and yellow and green without an end     and behind the glass of their grand express     folk yawn away a province through     with nothing to think of nothing to do     nothing even to look atnever a view     in this damned wilderness     but i look out of the window and find     much to satisfy the mind     mark how the furrows formed and wheeled     in a motion orderly and staid     sweep as we pass across the field     like a drilled army on parade     and heres a marketgarden barred     with stripe on stripe of varied greens      bright potatoes flower starred     and the opacous colour of beans     each line deliberately swings     towards me till i see a straight     green avenue to the heart of things     the glimpse of a sudden opened gate     piercing the adverse walls of fate      a moment only and then fast fast     the gate swings to the avenue closes     fate laughs and once more interposes     its barriers                          the train has passed         inspiration       noonday upon the alpine meadows     pours its avalanche of light     and blazing flowers the very shadows     translucent are and bright     it seems a glory that nought surpasses     passion of angels in form and hue     when lo from the jewelled heaven of the grasses     leaps a lightning of sudden blue     dimming the sundrunk petals     bright even unto pain     the grasshopper flashes settles     and then is quenched again         summer stillness       the stars are golden instants in the deep     flawless expanse of night the moon is set     the river sleeps entranced a smooth cool sleep     seeming so motionless that i forget     the hollow booming bridges where it slides     dark with the sad looks that it bears along     towards a sea whose unreturning tides     ravish the sighted ships and the sailors song         anniversaries       once more the windless days are here     quiet of autumn when the year     halts and looks backward and draws breath     before it plunges into death     silver of mist and gossamers     throughshine of noondays glassy gold     pale blue of skies where nothing stirs     save one blanched leaf weary and old     that over and over slowly falls     from the mute elmtrees hanging on air     like tattered flags along the walls     of chapels deep in sunlit prayer     once more  within its flawless glass     today reflects that other day     when under the bracken on the grass     we who were lovers happily lay     and hardly spoke or framed a thought     that was not one with the calm hills     and crystal sky ourselves were nought     our gusty passions our burning wills     dissolved in boundlessness and we     were almost bodiless almost free      the wind has shattered silver and gold     night after night of sparkling cold     orion lifts his tangled feet     from where the tossing branches beat     in a fine surf against the sky     so the trance ended and we grew     restless we knew not how or why     and there were sudden gusts that blew     our dreaming banners into storm     we wore the uncertain crumbling form     of a brown swirl of windy leaves     a phantom shape that stirs and heaves     shuddering from earth to fall again     with a dry whisper of withered rain      last from the dead and shrunken days     we conjured spring lighting the blaze     of burnished tulips in the dark     and from black frost we struck a spark     of blue delight and fragrance new     a little world of flowers and dew     winter for us was over and done     the drought of fluttering leaves had grown     emerald shining in the sun     as light as glass as firm as stone     real once more for we had passed     through passion into thought again     shaped our desires and made that fast     which was before a cloudy pain     moulded the dimness fixed defined     in a fair statue strong and free     twin bodies flaming into mind     poised on the brink of ecstasy         italy       there is a country in my mind     lovelier than a poet blind     could dream of who had never known     this world of drought and dust and stone     in all its ugliness a place     full of an all but human grace     whose dells retain the printed form     of heavenly sleep and seem yet warm     from some pure body newly risen     where matter is no more a prison     but freedom for the soul to know     its native beauty for things glow     there with an inward truth and are     all fire and colour like a star     and in that land are domes and towers     that hang as light and bright as flowers     upon the sky and seem a birth     rather of air than solid earth      sometimes i dream that walking there     in the green shade all unaware     at a new turn of the golden glade     i shall see her and as though afraid     shall halt a moment and almost fall     for passing faintness like a man     who feels the sudden spirit of pan     brimming his narrow soul with all     the illimitable world and she     turning her head will let me see     the first sharp dawn of her surprise     turning to welcome in her eyes     and i shall come and take my lover     and looking on her rediscover     all her beautyher dark hair     and the little ears beneath it where     roses of lucid shadow sleep     her brooding mouth and in the deep     wells of her eyes reflected stars       oh the imperishable things     that hands and lips as well as words     shall speak oh movement of white wings     oh wheeling galaxies of birds          the alien       a petal drifted loose     from a great magnolia bloom     your face hung in the gloom     floating white and close      we seemed alone but another     bent oer you with lips of flame     unknown without a name     hated and yet my brother      your one short moan of pain     was an exorcising spell     the devil flew back to hell     we were alone again         a little memory       white in the moonlight     wet with dew     we have known the languor     of being two      we have been weary     as children are     when over them radiant     a stooping star      bends their goodnight     kissed and smiled     each was mother     each was child      child from your forehead     i kissed the hair     gently ah gently     and you were      mistress and mother     when on your breast     i lay so safely     and could rest         waking       darkness had stretched its colour     deep blue across the pane     no cloud to make night duller     no moon with its tarnish stain     but only here and there a star     one sharp point of frosty fire     hanging infinitely far     in mockery of our life and death     and all our small desire      now in this hour of waking     from under brows of stone     a new pale day is breaking     and the deep night is gone     sordid now and mean and small     the daylight world is seen again     with only the veils of mist that fall     deaf and muffling over all     to hide its ugliness and pain      but today this dawn of meanness     shines in my eyes as when     the new worlds brightness and cleanness     broke on the first of men     for the light that shows the huddled things     of this closepressing earth     shines also on your face and brings     all its dear beauty back to me     in a new miracle of birth      i see you asleep and unpassioned     whitefaced in the dusk of your hair     your beauty so fleetingly fashioned     that it filled me once with despair     to look on its exquisite transience     and think that our love and thought and laughter     puff out with the death of our flickering sense     while we pass ever on and away     towards some blank hereafter      but now i am happy knowing     that swift time is our friend     and that our loves passionate glowing     though it turn ash in the end     is a rose of fire that must blossom its way     through temporal stuff nor else could be     more than a nothing into day     the boundless spaces of night contract     and in your opening eyes i see     night born in day in time eternity         by the fire       we who are lovers sit by the fire     cradled warm twixt thought and will     sit and drowse like sleeping dogs     in the equipoise of all desire     sit and listen to the still     small hiss and whisper of green logs     that burn away that burn away     with the sound of a faroff falling stream     of threaded water blown to steam     grey ghost in the mountain world of grey     vapours blue as distance rise     between the hissing logs that show     a glimpse of rosy heat below     and candles watch with tireless eyes     while we sit drowsing here i know     dimly that there exists a world     that there is time perhaps and space     other and wider than this place     where at the fireside drowsily curled     we hear the whisper and watch the flame     burn blinkless and inscrutable     and then i know those other names     that through my brain from cell to cell     echoreverberated shout     of waiters mournful along corridors     but nobody carries the orders out     and the names dear friends your name and yours     evoke no sign but here i sit     on the wide hearth and there are you     that is enough and only true     the world and the friends that lived in it     are shadows you alone remain     real in this drowsing room     full of the whispers of distant rain     and candles staring into the gloom         valedictory       i had remarkedhow sharply one observes     when life is disappearing round the curves     of yet another corner out of sight     i had remarked when it was good luck and good night     and a good journey to you on her face     certain enigmas penned in the hieroglyphs     of that half frown and queer fixed smile and trace     of clouded thought in those brown eyes     always so happily clear of hows and ifs     my poor bleared mindand haunting whys      there i stood holding her farewell hand     pressing my life and soul and all     the world to one goodbye till small     and smaller pressed why there id stand     dead when they vanished with the sight of her     and i saw that she had grown aware     queer puzzled face of other things     beyond the present and her own young speed     of yesterday and what new days might breed     monstrously when the future brings     a charger with your latelamented head     aware of other peoples lives and will     aware perhaps aware even of me      the joyous hope of it but still     i pitied her for it was sad to see     a goddess shorn of her divinity     in the midst of her speed she had made pause     and doubts with all their threat of claws     outstripped till now by her unconsciousness     had seized on her she was proved mortal now     live only live for you were meant     never to know a thoughts distress     but a long glad astonishment     at the worlds beauty and your own     the pity of you goddess grown     perplexed and mortal                             yet  yet  can it be     that she is aware perhaps even of me      and life recedes recedes the curve is bare     my handkerchief flutters blankly in the air     and the question rumbles in the void     was she aware was she after all aware         love song

quietly quietly     what about god you said i have found     much to be said for totality     all i take it is god gods all     this bottle for instance  i recall     dimly that you took god by the neck     godinthebottleand pushed him across     but i without a moments loss     moved godinthesalt in front and shouted check         the life theoretic       while i have been fumbling over books     and thinking about god and the devil and all     other young men have been battling with the days     and others have been kissing the beautiful women     they have brazen faces like batteringrams     but i who think about books and such     i crumble to impotent dust before the struggling     and the women palsy me with fear     but when it comes to fumbling over books     and thinking about god

hullo here comes salome       i looked in the dirty giltedged glass     and oh salome there i was     positively jewelled half a vampire     with the soul in my eyes hanging dizzily     like the gatherer of proverbial samphire     over the brink of the crag of sense     looking down from perilous eminence     into a gulf of windy night     and theres straw in my tempestuous hair     and im not a poet but never despair     ill madly live the poems i shall never write         social amenities       i am getting on well with this anecdote     when suddenly i recall     the many times i have told it of old     and all the workedup phrases and the dying fall     of voice well timed in the crisis the note     of mockheroic ingeniously struck     the whole thing sticks in my throat     and my face all tingles and pricks with shame     for myself and my hearers     these are the social pleasures my god     but i finish the story triumphantly all the same         topiary       failing sometimes to understand     why there are folk whose flesh should seem     like carrion puffed with noisome steam     flyblown to the eye that looks on it     flyblown to the touch of a hand     why there are men without any legs     whizzing along on little trollies     with long long arms like apes     failing to see why god the topiarist     should train and carve and twist     mens bodies into such fantastic shapes     yes failing to see the point of it all i sometimes wish     that i were a fabulous thing in a fools mind     or at the ocean bottom in a world that is deaf and blind

pool of waters summerstill     and the stars are mirrored across me     those stabbing points of the sky     turned to a thread of shaken silver     a long fine thread         panic       the eyes of the portraits on the wall     look at me follow me     stare incessantly     i take it their glance means nothing at all     clearly oh clearly nothing at all       out in the gardens by the lake     the sleeping peacocks suddenly wake     out in the gardens moonlit and forlorn     each of them sounds his mournful horn     shrill peals that waver and crack and break     what can have made the peacocks wake         return from business       evenings in trains     when the little black twittering ghosts     along the brims of cuttings     against the luminous sky     interrupt with their hurrying rumour every thought     save that one is young and setting     headlong westering     and there is no recapture         stanzas       thought is an unseen net wherein our mind     is taken and vainly struggles to be free     words that should loose our spirit do but bind     new fetters on our hopedfor liberty     and action bears us onward like a stream     past fabulous shores scarce seen in our swift course     gloriousand yet its headlong currents seem     backwaters of some nobler purer force      there are slow curves more subtle far than thought     that stoop to carry the grace of a girls breast     and hanging flowers so exquisitely wrought     in airy metal that they seem possessed     of souls and there are distant hills that lift     the shoulder of a goddess towards the light     and arrowy trees sudden and sharp and swift     piercing the spirit deeply with delight      would i might make these miracles my own     like a pure angel thinking colour and form     hardening to rage in a flame of chiselled stone     spilling my love like sunlight golden and warm     on noonday flowers speaking the song of birds     among the branches whispering the fall of rain     beyond all thought past action and past words     i would live in beauty free from self and pain         poem       books and a coloured skein of thoughts were mine     and magic words lay ripening in my soul     till their muchwhispered music turned a wine     whose subtlest power was all in my control      these things were mine and they were real for me     as lips and darling eyes and a warm breast     for i could love a phrase a melody     like a fair woman worshipped and possessed      i scorned all fire that outward of the eyes     could kindle passion scorned yet was afraid     feared and yet envied those more deeply wise     who saw the bright earth beckon and obeyed      but a time came when turning full of hate     and weariness from my remembered themes     i wished my poets pipe could modulate     beauty more palpable than words and dreams      all loveliness with which an act informs     the dim uncertain chaos of desire     is mine today it touches me it warms     body and spirit with its outward fire      i am mine no more i have become a part     of that great earth that draws a breath and stirs     to meet the spring but i could wish my heart     were still a winter of frosty gossamers         scenes of the mind       i have run where festival was loud     with drum and brass among the crowd     of panic revellers whose cries     affront the quiet of the skies     whose dancing lights contract the deep     infinity of night and sleep     to a narrow turmoil of troubled fire     and i have found my hearts desire     in beechen caverns that autumn fills     with the blue shadowiness of distant hills     whose luminous grey pillars bear     the stooping sky calm is the air     nor any sound is heard to mar     that crystal silenceas from far     far off a man may see     the busy world all utterly     hushed as an old memorial scene     long evenings i have sat and been     strangely content while in my hands     i held a wealth of coloured strands     shimmering plaits of silk and skeins     of soft bright wool each colour drains     new life at the lamps round pool of gold     each sinks again when i withhold     the quickening radiance to a wan     and shadowy oblivion     of what it was and in my mind     beauty or sudden love has shined     and wakened colour in what was dead     and turned to gold the sullen lead     of mean desires and everydays     poor thoughts and customary ways     sometimes in lands where mountains throw     their silent spell on all below     drawing a magic circle wide     about their feet on every side     robbed of all speech and thought and act     i have seen god in the cataract     in falling water and in flame     never at rest yet still the same     god shows himself and i have known     the swift fire frozen into stone     and water frozen changelessly     into the death of gems and i     long sitting by the thunderous mill     have seen the headlong wheel made still     and in the silence that ensued     have known the endless solitude     of being dead and utterly nought     inhabitant of mine own thought     i look abroad and all i see     is my creation

true selfproving that i have known     no triumph but the shadow of a rose     but think these nymphs their loveliness  suppose     they bodied forth your senses fabulous thirst     illusion which the blue eyes of the first     as cold and chaste as is the weeping spring     beget the other sighing passioning     is she the wind warm in your fleece at noon     no through this quiet when a weary swoon     crushes and chokes the latest faint essay     of morning cool against the encroaching day     there is no murmuring water save the gush     of my clear fluted notes and in the hush     blows never a wind save that which through my reed     puffs out before the rain of notes can speed     upon the air with that calm breath of art     that mounts the unwrinkled zenith visibly     where inspiration seeks its native sky     you fringes of a calm sicilian lake     the suns own mirror which i love to take     silent beneath your starry flowers tell     how here i cut the hollow rushes well     tamed by my skill when on the glaucous gold     of distant lawns about their fountain cold     a living whiteness stirs like a lazy wave     and at the first slow notes my panpipes gave     these flocking swans these naiads rather fly     or dive noon burns inert and tawny dry     nor marks how clean that hymen slipped away     from me who seek in song the real a     wake then to the first ardour and the sight     o lonely faun of the old fierce white light     with lilies one of you for innocence     other than their lips delicate pretence     the light caress that quiets treacherous lovers     my breast i know not how to tell discovers     the bitten print of some immortals kiss     but hush a mystery so great as this     i dare not tell save to my double reed     which sharer of my every joy and need     dreams down its cadenced monologues that we     falsely confuse the beauties that we see     with the bright palpable shapes our song creates     my flute as loud as passion modulates     purges the common dream of flank and breast     seen through closed eyes and inwardly caressed     of every empty and monotonous line      bloom then o syrinx in thy flight malign     a reed once more beside our trystinglake     proud of my music let me often make     a song of goddesses and see their rape     profanely done on many a painted shape     so when the grapes transparent juice i drain     i quell regret for pleasures past and feign     a new real grape for holding towards the sky     the empty skin i blow it tight and lie     dreamdrunk till evening

    crying to the woods the rage of their desire     and their bright hair went down in jewelled fire     where crystal broke and dazzled shudderingly     i check my swift pursuit for see where lie     bruised being twins in love by languor sweet     two sleeping girls clasped at my very feet     i seize and run with them nor part the pair     breaking this covert of frail petals where     roses drink scent of the sun and our light play     mid tumbled flowers shall match the death of day     i love that virginal furyah the wild     thrill when a maiden body shrinks defiled     shuddering like arctic light from lips that sear     its nakedness  the flesh in secret fear     contagiously through my linked pair it flies     where innocence in either struggling dies     wet with fond tears or some less piteous dew     gay in the conquest of these fears i grew     so rash that i must needs the sheaf divide     of ruffled kisses heaven itself had tied     for as i leaned to stifle in the hair     of one my passionate laughter taking care     with a stretched finger that her innocence     might stain with her companions kindling sense     to touch the younger little one who lay     childlike unblushing my ungrateful prey     slips from me freed by passions sudden death     nor heeds the frenzy of my sobbing breath      let it pass others of their hair shall twist     a rope to drag me to those joys i missed     see how the ripe pomegranates bursting red     to quench the thirst of the mumbling bees have bled     so too our blood kindled by some chance fire     flows for the swarming legions of desire     at evening when the woodland green turns gold     and ashen grey mid the quenched leaves behold     red etna glows by venus visited     walking the lava with her snowy tread     wheneer the flames in thunderous slumber die     i hold the goddess                          ah sure penalty      but the unthinking soul and body swoon     at last beneath the heavy hush of noon     forgetful let me lie where summers drouth     sifts fine the sand and then with gaping mouth     dream planetstruck by the grapes round winered star      nymphs i shall see the shade that now you are         the lousehunters      from the french of rimbaud       when the childs forehead full of torments red     cries out for sleep and its pale host of dreams     his two big sisters come unto his bed     having long fingers tipped with silvery gleams      they set him at a casement open wide     on seas of flowers that stir in the blue airs     and through his curls all wet with dew they slide     those terrible searching fingertips of theirs      he hears them breathing softly fearfully     honeysweet ruminations slow respired     then a sharp hiss breaks time and melody     spittle indrawn old kisses newdesired      down through the perfumed silences he hears     their eyelids fluttering long fingers thrill     probing a lassitude bedimmed with tears     while the nails crunch at every louse they kill      he is drunk with languorsoft accordionsigh     delirious wine of love in idleness     longings for tears come welling up and die     as slow or swift he feels
