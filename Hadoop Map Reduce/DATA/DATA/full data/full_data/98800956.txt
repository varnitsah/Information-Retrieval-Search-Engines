98800956	vanity fair   by  william makepeace thackeray     before the curtain  as the manager of the performance sits before the curtain on the boards and looks into the fair a feeling of profound melancholy comes over him in his survey of the bustling place there is a great quantity of eating and drinking making love and jilting laughing and the contrary smoking cheating fighting dancing and fiddling there are bullies pushing about bucks ogling the women knaves picking pockets policemen on the lookout quacks other quacks plague take them bawling in front of their booths and yokels looking up at the tinselled dancers and poor old rouged tumblers while the lightfingered folk are operating upon their pockets behind yes this is vanity fair not a moral place certainly nor a merry one though very noisy  look at the faces of the actors and buffoons when they come off from their business and tom fool washing the paint off his cheeks before he sits down to dinner with his wife and the little jack puddings behind the canvas   the curtain will be up presently and he will be turning over head and heels and crying how are you  a man with a reflective turn of mind walking through an exhibition of this sort will not be oppressed i take it by his own or other peoples hilarity   an episode of humour or kindness touches and amuses him here and therea pretty child looking at a gingerbread stall a pretty girl blushing whilst her lover talks to her and chooses her fairing poor tom fool yonder behind the waggon mumbling his bone with the honest family which lives by his tumbling but the general impression is one more melancholy than mirthful  when you come home you sit down in a sober contemplative not uncharitable frame of mind and apply yourself to your books or your business  i have no other moral than this to tag to the present story of vanity fair some people consider fairs immoral altogether and eschew such with their servants and families very likely they are right  but persons who think otherwise and are of a lazy or a benevolent or a sarcastic mood may perhaps like to step in for half an hour and look at the performances there are scenes of all sorts some dreadful combats some grand and lofty horseriding some scenes of high life and some of very middling indeed some lovemaking for the sentimental and some light comic business the whole accompanied by appropriate scenery and brilliantly illuminated with the authors own candles  what more has the manager of the performance to sayto acknowledge the kindness with which it has been received in all the principal towns of england through which the show has passed and where it has been most favourably noticed by the respected conductors of the public press and by the nobility and gentry  he is proud to think that his puppets have given satisfaction to the very best company in this empire  the famous little becky puppet has been pronounced to be uncommonly flexible in the joints and lively on the wire the amelia doll though it has had a smaller circle of admirers has yet been carved and dressed with the greatest care by the artist the dobbin figure though apparently clumsy yet dances in a very amusing and natural manner the little boys dance has been liked by some and please to remark the richly dressed figure of the wicked nobleman on which no expense has been spared and which old nick will fetch away at the end of this singular performance  and with this and a profound bow to his patrons the manager retires and the curtain rises  london june 28 1848    contents         i  chiswick mall

great iron gate of miss pinkertons academy for young ladies on chiswick mall a large family coach with two fat horses in blazing harness driven by a fat coachman in a threecornered hat and wig at the rate of four miles an hour  a black servant who reposed on the box beside the fat coachman uncurled his bandy legs as soon as the equipage drew up opposite miss pinkertons shining brass plate and as he pulled the bell at least a score of young heads were seen peering out of the narrow windows of the stately old brick house  nay the acute observer might have recognized the little red nose of goodnatured miss jemima pinkerton herself rising over some geranium pots in the window of that ladys own drawingroom  it is mrs sedleys coach sister said miss jemima sambo the black servant has just rung the bell and the coachman has a new red waistcoat  have you completed all the necessary preparations incident to miss sedleys departure miss jemima asked miss pinkerton herself that majestic lady the semiramis of hammersmith the friend of doctor johnson the correspondent of mrs chapone herself  the girls were up at four this morning packing her trunks sister replied miss jemima we have made her a bowpot  say a bouquet sister jemima tis more genteel  well a booky as big almost as a haystack i have put up two bottles of the gillyflower water for mrs sedley and the receipt for making it in amelias box  and i trust miss jemima you have made a copy of miss sedleys account  this is it is it very goodninetythree pounds four shillings  be kind enough to address it to john sedley esquire and to seal this billet which i have written to his lady  in miss jemimas eyes an autograph letter of her sister miss pinkerton was an object of as deep veneration as would have been a letter from a sovereign  only when her pupils quitted the establishment or when they were about to be married and once when poor miss birch died of the scarlet fever was miss pinkerton known to write personally to the parents of her pupils and it was jemimas opinion that if anything could console mrs birch for her daughters loss it would be that pious and eloquent composition in which miss pinkerton announced the event  in the present instance miss pinkertons billet was to the following effect  the mall chiswick june 15 18  madamafter her six years residence at the mall i have the honour and happiness of presenting miss amelia sedley to her parents as a young lady not unworthy to occupy a fitting position in their polished and refined circle  those virtues which characterize the young english gentlewoman those accomplishments which become her birth and station will not be found wanting in the amiable miss sedley whose industry and obedience have endeared her to her instructors and whose delightful sweetness of temper has charmed her aged and her youthful companions  in music in dancing in orthography in every variety of embroidery and needlework she will be found to have realized her friends fondest wishes  in geography there is still much to be desired and a careful and undeviating use of the backboard for four hours daily during the next three years is recommended as necessary to the acquirement of that dignified deportment and carriage so requisite for every young lady of fashion  in the principles of religion and morality miss sedley will be found worthy of an establishment which has been honoured by the presence of the great lexicographer and the patronage of the admirable mrs chapone  in leaving the mall miss amelia carries with her the hearts of her companions and the affectionate regards of her mistress who has the honour to subscribe herself  madam your most obliged humble servant barbara pinkerton  psmiss sharp accompanies miss sedley  it is particularly requested that miss sharps stay in russell square may not exceed ten days  the family of distinction with whom she is engaged desire to avail themselves of her services as soon as possible   this letter completed miss pinkerton proceeded to write her own name and miss sedleys in the flyleaf of a johnsons dictionarythe interesting work which she invariably presented to her scholars on their departure from the mall  on the cover was inserted a copy of lines addressed to a young lady on quitting miss pinkertons school at the mall by the late revered doctor samuel johnson in fact the lexicographers name was always on the lips of this majestic woman and a visit he had paid to her was the cause of her reputation and her fortune  being commanded by her elder sister to get the dictionary from the cupboard miss jemima had extracted two copies of the book from the receptacle in question  when miss pinkerton had finished the inscription in the first jemima with rather a dubious and timid air handed her the second  for whom is this miss jemima said miss pinkerton with awful coldness  for becky sharp answered jemima trembling very much and blushing over her withered face and neck as she turned her back on her sister for becky sharp shes going too  miss jemima exclaimed miss pinkerton in the largest capitals are you in your senses replace the dixonary in the closet and never venture to take such a liberty in future  well sister its only twoandninepence and poor becky will be miserable if she dont get one  send miss sedley instantly to me said miss pinkerton and so venturing not to say another word poor jemima trotted off exceedingly flurried and nervous  miss sedleys papa was a merchant in london and a man of some wealth whereas miss sharp was an articled pupil for whom miss pinkerton had done as she thought quite enough without conferring upon her at parting the high honour of the dixonary  although schoolmistresses letters are to be trusted no more nor less than churchyard epitaphs yet as it sometimes happens that a person departs this life who is really deserving of all the praises the stone cutter carves over his bones who is a good christian a good parent child wife or husband who actually does leave a disconsolate family to mourn his loss so in academies of the male and female sex it occurs every now and then that the pupil is fully worthy of the praises bestowed by the disinterested instructor now miss amelia sedley was a young lady of this singular species and deserved not only all that miss pinkerton said in her praise but had many charming qualities which that pompous old minerva of a woman could not see from the differences of rank and age between her pupil and herself  for she could not only sing like a lark or a mrs billington and dance like hillisberg or parisot and embroider beautifully and spell as well as a dixonary itself but she had such a kindly smiling tender gentle generous heart of her own as won the love of everybody who came near her from minerva herself down to the poor girl in the scullery and the oneeyed tartwomans daughter who was permitted to vend her wares once a week to the young ladies in the mall  she had twelve intimate and bosom friends out of the twentyfour young ladies even envious miss briggs never spoke ill of her high and mighty miss saltire lord dexters granddaughter allowed that her figure was genteel and as for miss swartz the rich woollyhaired mulatto from st kitts on the day amelia went away she was in such a passion of tears that they were obliged to send for dr floss and half tipsify her with salvolatile  miss pinkertons attachment was as may be supposed from the high position and eminent virtues of that lady calm and dignified but miss jemima had already whimpered several times at the idea of amelias departure and but for fear of her sister would have gone off in downright hysterics like the heiress who paid double of st kitts  such luxury of grief however is only allowed to parlourboarders honest jemima had all the bills and the washing and the mending and the puddings and the plate and crockery and the servants to superintend  but why speak about her  it is probable that we shall not hear of her again from this moment to the end of time and that when the great filigree iron gates are once closed on her she and her awful sister will never issue therefrom into this little world of history  but as we are to see a great deal of amelia there is no harm in saying at the outset of our acquaintance that she was a dear little creature and a great mercy it is both in life and in novels which and the latter especially abound in villains of the most sombre sort that we are to have for a constant companion so guileless and goodnatured a person  as she is not a heroine there is no need to describe her person indeed i am afraid that her nose was rather short than otherwise and her cheeks a great deal too round and red for a heroine but her face blushed with rosy health and her lips with the freshest of smiles and she had a pair of eyes which sparkled with the brightest and honestest goodhumour except indeed when they filled with tears and that was a great deal too often for the silly thing would cry over a dead canarybird or over a mouse that the cat haply had seized upon or over the end of a novel were it ever so stupid and as for saying an unkind word to her were any persons hardhearted enough to do sowhy so much the worse for them  even miss pinkerton that austere and godlike woman ceased scolding her after the first time and though she no more comprehended sensibility than she did algebra gave all masters and teachers particular orders to treat miss sedley with the utmost gentleness as harsh treatment was injurious to her  so that when the day of departure came between her two customs of laughing and crying miss sedley was greatly puzzled how to act she was glad to go home and yet most woefully sad at leaving school  for three days before little laura martin the orphan followed her about like a little dog  she had to make and receive at least fourteen presentsto make fourteen solemn promises of writing every week send my letters under cover to my grandpapa the earl of dexter said miss saltire who by the way was rather shabby  never mind the postage but write every day you dear darling said the impetuous and woollyheaded but generous and affectionate miss swartz and the orphan little laura martin who was just in roundhand took her friends hand and said looking up in her face wistfully amelia when i write to you i shall call you mamma all which details i have no doubt jones who reads this book at his club will pronounce to be excessively foolish trivial twaddling and ultrasentimental  yes i can see jones at this minute rather flushed with his joint of mutton and half pint of wine taking out his pencil and scoring under the words foolish twaddling c and adding to them his own remark of quite true well he is a lofty man of genius and admires the great and heroic in life and novels and so had better take warning and go elsewhere  well then  the flowers and the presents and the trunks and bonnetboxes of miss sedley having been arranged by mr sambo in the carriage together with a very small and weatherbeaten old cowsskin trunk with miss sharps card neatly nailed upon it which was delivered by sambo with a grin and packed by the coachman with a corresponding sneerthe hour for parting came and the grief of that moment was considerably lessened by the admirable discourse which miss pinkerton addressed to her pupil  not that the parting speech caused amelia to philosophise or that it armed her in any way with a calmness the result of argument but it was intolerably dull pompous and tedious and having the fear of her schoolmistress greatly before her eyes miss sedley did not venture in her presence to give way to any ebullitions of private grief  a seedcake and a bottle of wine were produced in the drawingroom as on the solemn occasions of the visits of parents and these refreshments being partaken of miss sedley was at liberty to depart  youll go in and say goodby to miss pinkerton becky said miss jemima to a young lady of whom nobody took any notice and who was coming downstairs with her own bandbox  i suppose i must said miss sharp calmly and much to the wonder of miss jemima and the latter having knocked at the door and receiving permission to come in miss sharp advanced in a very unconcerned manner and said in french and with a perfect accent mademoiselle je viens vous faire mes adieux  miss pinkerton did not understand french she only directed those who did but biting her lips and throwing up her venerable and romannosed head on the top of which figured a large and solemn turban she said miss sharp i wish you a good morning as the hammersmith semiramis spoke she waved one hand both by way of adieu and to give miss sharp an opportunity of shaking one of the fingers of the hand which was left out for that purpose  miss sharp only folded her own hands with a very frigid smile and bow and quite declined to accept the proffered honour on which semiramis tossed up her turban more indignantly than ever  in fact it was a little battle between the young lady and the old one and the latter was worsted  heaven bless you my child said she embracing amelia and scowling the while over the girls shoulder at miss sharp  come away becky said miss jemima pulling the young woman away in great alarm and the drawingroom door closed upon them for ever  then came the struggle and parting below  words refuse to tell it all the servants were there in the hallall the dear friendall the young ladiesthe dancingmaster who had just arrived and there was such a scuffling and hugging and kissing and crying with the hysterical yoops of miss swartz the parlourboarder from her room as no pen can depict and as the tender heart would fain pass over the embracing was over they partedthat is miss sedley parted from her friends  miss sharp had demurely entered the carriage some minutes before  nobody cried for leaving her  sambo of the bandy legs slammed the carriage door on his young weeping mistress  he sprang up behind the carriage  stop cried miss jemima rushing to the gate with a parcel  its some sandwiches my dear said she to amelia you may be hungry you know and becky becky sharp heres a book for you that my sisterthat is ijohnsons dixonary you know you mustnt leave us without that  goodby  drive on coachman  god bless you  and the kind creature retreated into the garden overcome with emotion  but lo and just as the coach drove off miss sharp put her pale face out of the window and actually flung the book back into the garden  this almost caused jemima to faint with terror  well i neversaid shewhat an audaciousemotion prevented her from completing either sentence  the carriage rolled away the great gates were closed the bell rang for the dancing lesson  the world is before the two young ladies and so farewell to chiswick mall    chapter ii  in which miss sharp and miss sedley prepare to open the campaign  when miss sharp had performed the heroical act mentioned in the last chapter and had seen the dixonary flying over the pavement of the little garden fall at length at the feet of the astonished miss jemima the young ladys countenance which had before worn an almost livid look of hatred assumed a smile that perhaps was scarcely more agreeable and she sank back in the carriage in an easy frame of mind sayingso much for the dixonary and thank god im out of chiswick  miss sedley was almost as flurried at the act of defiance as miss jemima had been for consider it was but one minute that she had left school and the impressions of six years are not got over in that space of time  nay with some persons those awes and terrors of youth last for ever and ever  i know for instance an old gentleman of sixtyeight who said to me one morning at breakfast with a very agitated countenance i dreamed last night that i was flogged by dr raine fancy had carried him back fiveandfifty years in the course of that evening  dr raine and his rod were just as awful to him in his heart then at sixtyeight as they had been at thirteen  if the doctor with a large birch had appeared bodily to him even at the age of threescore and eight and had said in awful voice boy take down your pant well well miss sedley was exceedingly alarmed at this act of insubordination  how could you do so rebecca at last she said after a pause  why do you think miss pinkerton will come out and order me back to the blackhole said rebecca laughing  no but  i hate the whole house continued miss sharp in a fury  i hope i may never set eyes on it again  i wish it were in the bottom of the thames i do and if miss pinkerton were there i wouldnt pick her out that i wouldnt  o how i should like to see her floating in the water yonder turban and all with her train streaming after her and her nose like the beak of a wherry  hush cried miss sedley  why will the black footman tell tales cried miss rebecca laughing he may go back and tell miss pinkerton that i hate her with all my soul and i wish he would and i wish i had a means of proving it too for two years i have only had insults and outrage from her i have been treated worse than any servant in the kitchen i have never had a friend or a kind word except from you  i have been made to tend the little girls in the lower schoolroom and to talk french to the misses until i grew sick of my mother tongue but that talking french to miss pinkerton was capital fun wasnt it she doesnt know a word of french and was too proud to confess it  i believe it was that which made her part with me and so thank heaven for french  vive la france vive lempereur vive bonaparte  o rebecca rebecca for shame cried miss sedley for this was the greatest blasphemy rebecca had as yet uttered and in those days in england to say long live bonaparte was as much as to say long live lucifer how can youhow dare you have such wicked revengeful thoughts  revenge may be wicked but its natural answered miss rebecca im no angel and to say the truth she certainly was not  for it may be remarked in the course of this little conversation which took place as the coach rolled along lazily by the river side that though miss rebecca sharp has twice had occasion to thank heaven it has been in the first place for ridding her of some person whom she hated and secondly for enabling her to bring her enemies to some sort of perplexity or confusion neither of which are very amiable motives for religious gratitude or such as would be put forward by persons of a kind and placable disposition  miss rebecca was not then in the least kind or placable  all the world used her ill said this young misanthropist and we may be pretty certain that persons whom all the world treats ill deserve entirely the treatment they get  the world is a lookingglass and gives back to every man the reflection of his own face  frown at it and it will in turn look sourly upon you laugh at it and with it and it is a jolly kind companion and so let all young persons take their choice this is certain that if the world neglected miss sharp she never was known to have done a good action in behalf of anybody nor can it be expected that twentyfour young ladies should all be as amiable as the heroine of this work miss sedley whom we have selected for the very reason that she was the bestnatured of all otherwise what on earth was to have prevented us from putting up miss swartz or miss crump or miss hopkins as heroine in her place it could not be expected that every one should be of the humble and gentle temper of miss amelia sedley should take every opportunity to vanquish rebeccas hardheartedness and illhumour and by a thousand kind words and offices overcome for once at least her hostility to her kind  miss sharps father was an artist and in that quality had given lessons of drawing at miss pinkertons school he was a clever man a pleasant companion a careless student with a great propensity for running into debt and a partiality for the tavern  when he was drunk he used to beat his wife and daughter and the next morning with a headache he would rail at the world for its neglect of his genius and abuse with a good deal of cleverness and sometimes with perfect reason the fools his brother painters  as it was with the utmost difficulty that he could keep himself and as he owed money for a mile round soho where he lived he thought to better his circumstances by marrying a young woman of the french nation who was by profession an operagirl  the humble calling of her female parent miss sharp never alluded to but used to state subsequently that the entrechats were a noble family of gascony and took great pride in her descent from them and curious it is that as she advanced in life this young ladys ancestors increased in rank and splendour  rebeccas mother had had some education somewhere and her daughter spoke french with purity and a parisian accent  it was in those days rather a rare accomplishment and led to her engagement with the orthodox miss pinkerton  for her mother being dead her father finding himself not likely to recover after his third attack of delirium tremens wrote a manly and pathetic letter to miss pinkerton recommending the orphan child to her protection and so descended to the grave after two bailiffs had quarrelled over his corpse  rebecca was seventeen when she came to chiswick and was bound over as an articled pupil her duties being to talk french as we have seen and her privileges to live cost free and with a few guineas a year to gather scraps of knowledge from the professors who attended the school  she was small and slight in person pale sandyhaired and with eyes habitually cast down when they looked up they were very large odd and attractive so attractive that the reverend mr crisp fresh from oxford and curate to the vicar of chiswick the reverend mr flowerdew fell in love with miss sharp being shot dead by a glance of her eyes which was fired all the way across chiswick church from the schoolpew to the readingdesk  this infatuated young man used sometimes to take tea with miss pinkerton to whom he had been presented by his mamma and actually proposed something like marriage in an intercepted note which the oneeyed applewoman was charged to deliver  mrs crisp was summoned from buxton and abruptly carried off her darling boy but the idea even of such an eagle in the chiswick dovecot caused a great flutter in the breast of miss pinkerton who would have sent away miss sharp but that she was bound to her under a forfeit and who never could thoroughly believe the young ladys protestations that she had never exchanged a single word with mr crisp except under her own eyes on the two occasions when she had met him at tea  by the side of many tall and bouncing young ladies in the establishment rebecca sharp looked like a child  but she had the dismal precocity of poverty  many a dun had she talked to and turned away from her fathers door many a tradesman had she coaxed and wheedled into goodhumour and into the granting of one meal more she sate commonly with her father who was very proud of her wit and heard the talk of many of his wild companionsoften but illsuited for a girl to hear  but she never had been a girl she said she had been a woman since she was eight years old  oh why did miss pinkerton let such a dangerous bird into her cage  the fact is the old lady believed rebecca to be the meekest creature in the world so admirably on the occasions when her father brought her to chiswick used rebecca to perform the part of the ingenue and only a year before the arrangement by which rebecca had been admitted into her house and when rebecca was sixteen years old miss pinkerton majestically and with a little speech made her a present of a dollwhich was by the way the confiscated property of miss swindle discovered surreptitiously nursing it in schoolhours how the father and daughter laughed as they trudged home together after the evening party it was on the occasion of the speeches when all the professors were invited and how miss pinkerton would have raged had she seen the caricature of herself which the little mimic rebecca managed to make out of her doll becky used to go through dialogues with it it formed the delight of newman street gerrard street and the artists quarter and the young painters when they came to take their ginandwater with their lazy dissolute clever jovial senior used regularly to ask rebecca if miss pinkerton was at home she was as well known to them poor soul as mr lawrence or president west  once rebecca had the honour to pass a few days at chiswick after which she brought back jemima and erected another doll as miss jemmy for though that honest creature had made and given her jelly and cake enough for three children and a sevenshilling piece at parting the girls sense of ridicule was far stronger than her gratitude and she sacrificed miss jemmy quite as pitilessly as her sister  the catastrophe came and she was brought to the mall as to her home the rigid formality of the place suffocated her the prayers and the meals the lessons and the walks which were arranged with a conventual regularity oppressed her almost beyond endurance and she looked back to the freedom and the beggary of the old studio in soho with so much regret that everybody herself included fancied she was consumed with grief for her father  she had a little room in the garret where the maids heard her walking and sobbing at night but it was with rage and not with grief  she had not been much of a dissembler until now her loneliness taught her to feign she had never mingled in the society of women her father reprobate as he was was a man of talent his conversation was a thousand times more agreeable to her than the talk of such of her own sex as she now encountered the pompous vanity of the old schoolmistress the foolish goodhumour of her sister the silly chat and scandal of the elder girls and the frigid correctness of the governesses equally annoyed her and she had no soft maternal heart this unlucky girl otherwise the prattle and talk of the younger children with whose care she was chiefly intrusted might have soothed and interested her but she lived among them two years and not one was sorry that she went away  the gentle tenderhearted amelia sedley was the only person to whom she could attach herself in the least and who could help attaching herself to amelia  the happiness the superior advantages of the young women round about her gave rebecca inexpressible pangs of envy  what airs that girl gives herself because she is an earls granddaughter she said of one  how they cringe and bow to that creole because of her hundred thousand pounds  i am a thousand times cleverer and more charming than that creature for all her wealth i am as well bred as the earls granddaughter for all her fine pedigree and yet every one passes me by here  and yet when i was at my fathers did not the men give up their gayest balls and parties in order to pass the evening with me she determined at any rate to get free from the prison in which she found herself and now began to act for herself and for the first time to make connected plans for the future  she took advantage therefore of the means of study the place offered her and as she was already a musician and a good linguist she speedily went through the little course of study which was considered necessary for ladies in those days  her music she practised incessantly and one day when the girls were out and she had remained at home she was overheard to play a piece so well that minerva thought wisely she could spare herself the expense of a master for the juniors and intimated to miss sharp that she was to instruct them in music for the future  the girl refused and for the first time and to the astonishment of the majestic mistress of the school  i am here to speak french with the children rebecca said abruptly not to teach them music and save money for you  give me money and i will teach them  minerva was obliged to yield and of course disliked her from that day  for fiveandthirty years she said and with great justice i never have seen the individual who has dared in my own house to question my authority  i have nourished a viper in my bosom  a vipera fiddlestick said miss sharp to the old lady almost fainting with astonishment  you took me because i was useful there is no question of gratitude between us  i hate this place and want to leave it  i will do nothing here but what i am obliged to do  it was in vain that the old lady asked her if she was aware she was speaking to miss pinkerton  rebecca laughed in her face with a horrid sarcastic demoniacal laughter that almost sent the schoolmistress into fits give me a sum of money said the girl and get rid of meor if you like better get me a good place as governess in a noblemans familyyou can do so if you please  and in their further disputes she always returned to this point get me a situationwe hate each other and i am ready to go  worthy miss pinkerton although she had a roman nose and a turban and was as tall as a grenadier and had been up to this time an irresistible princess had no will or strength like that of her little apprentice and in vain did battle against her and tried to overawe her attempting once to scold her in public rebecca hit upon the beforementioned plan of answering her in french which quite routed the old woman  in order to maintain authority in her school it became necessary to remove this rebel this monster this serpent this firebrand and hearing about this time that sir pitt crawleys family was in want of a governess she actually recommended miss sharp for the situation firebrand and serpent as she was  i cannot certainly she said find fault with miss sharps conduct except to myself and must allow that her talents and accomplishments are of a high order as far as the head goes at least she does credit to the educational system pursued at my establishment  and so the schoolmistress reconciled the recommendation to her conscience and the indentures were cancelled and the apprentice was free  the battle here described in a few lines of course lasted for some months  and as miss sedley being now in her seventeenth year was about to leave school and had a friendship for miss sharp tis the only point in amelias behaviour said minerva which has not been satisfactory to her mistress miss sharp was invited by her friend to pass a week with her at home before she entered upon her duties as governess in a private family  thus the world began for these two young ladies  for amelia it was quite a new fresh brilliant world with all the bloom upon it  it was not quite a new one for rebeccaindeed if the truth must be told with respect to the crisp affair the tartwoman hinted to somebody who took an affidavit of the fact to somebody else that there was a great deal more than was made public regarding mr crisp and miss sharp and that his letter was in answer to another letter  but who can tell you the real truth of the matter at all events if rebecca was not beginning the world she was beginning it over again  by the time the young ladies reached kensington turnpike amelia had not forgotten her companions but had dried her tears and had blushed very much and been delighted at a young officer of the life guards who spied her as he was riding by and said a dem fine gal egad and before the carriage arrived in russell square a great deal of conversation had taken place about the drawingroom and whether or not young ladies wore powder as well as hoops when presented and whether she was to have that honour to the lord mayors ball she knew she was to go  and when at length home was reached miss amelia sedley skipped out on sambos arm as happy and as handsome a girl as any in the whole big city of london  both he and coachman agreed on this point and so did her father and mother and so did every one of the servants in the house as they stood bobbing and curtseying and smiling in the hall to welcome their young mistress  you may be sure that she showed rebecca over every room of the house and everything in every one of her drawers and her books and her piano and her dresses and all her necklaces brooches laces and gimcracks she insisted upon rebecca accepting the white cornelian and the turquoise rings and a sweet sprigged muslin which was too small for her now though it would fit her friend to a nicety and she determined in her heart to ask her mothers permission to present her white cashmere shawl to her friend  could she not spare it and had not her brother joseph just brought her two from india  when rebecca saw the two magnificent cashmere shawls which joseph sedley had brought home to his sister she said with perfect truth that it must be delightful to have a brother and easily got the pity of the tenderhearted amelia for being alone in the world an orphan without friends or kindred  not alone said amelia you know rebecca i shall always be your friend and love you as a sisterindeed i will  ah but to have parents as you havekind rich affectionate parents who give you everything you ask for and their love which is more precious than all my poor papa could give me nothing and i had but two frocks in all the world and then to have a brother a dear brother oh how you must love him  amelia laughed  what dont you love him you who say you love everybody  yes of course i doonly  only what  only joseph doesnt seem to care much whether i love him or not he gave me two fingers to shake when he arrived after ten years absence he is very kind and good but he scarcely ever speaks to me i think he loves his pipe a great deal better than hisbut here amelia checked herself for why should she speak ill of her brother he was very kind to me as a child she added i was but five years old when he went away  isnt he very rich said rebecca  they say all indian nabobs are enormously rich  i believe he has a very large income  and is your sisterinlaw a nice pretty woman  la joseph is not married said amelia laughing again  perhaps she had mentioned the fact already to rebecca but that young lady did not appear to have remembered it indeed vowed and protested that she expected to see a number of amelias nephews and nieces  she was quite disappointed that mr sedley was not married she was sure amelia had said he was and she doted so on little children  i think you must have had enough of them at chiswick said amelia rather wondering at the sudden tenderness on her friends part and indeed in later days miss sharp would never have committed herself so far as to advance opinions the untruth of which would have been so easily detected  but we must remember that she is but nineteen as yet unused to the art of deceiving poor innocent creature and making her own experience in her own person  the meaning of the above series of queries as translated in the heart of this ingenious young woman was simply this if mr joseph sedley is rich and unmarried why should i not marry him i have only a fortnight to be sure but there is no harm in trying and she determined within herself to make this laudable attempt  she redoubled her caresses to amelia she kissed the white cornelian necklace as she put it on and vowed she would never never part with it  when the dinnerbell rang she went downstairs with her arm round her friends waist as is the habit of young ladies she was so agitated at the drawingroom door that she could hardly find courage to enter  feel my heart how it beats dear said she to her friend  no it doesnt said amelia  come in dont be frightened  papa wont do you any harm    chapter iii  rebecca is in presence of the enemy  a very stout puffy man in buckskins and hessian boots with several immense neckcloths that rose almost to his nose with a red striped waistcoat and an apple green coat with steel buttons almost as large as crown pieces it was the morning costume of a dandy or blood of those days was reading the paper by the fire when the two girls entered and bounced off his armchair and blushed excessively and hid his entire face almost in his neckcloths at this apparition  its only your sister joseph said amelia laughing and shaking the two fingers which he held out  ive come home for good you know and this is my friend miss sharp whom you have heard me mention  no never upon my word said the head under the neckcloth shaking very muchthat is yeswhat abominably cold weather missand herewith he fell to poking the fire with all his might although it was in the middle of june  hes very handsome whispered rebecca to amelia rather loud  do you think so said the latter  ill tell him  darling not for worlds said miss sharp starting back as timid as a fawn  she had previously made a respectful virginlike curtsey to the gentleman and her modest eyes gazed so perseveringly on the carpet that it was a wonder how she should have found an opportunity to see him  thank you for the beautiful shawls brother said amelia to the fire poker  are they not beautiful rebecca  o heavenly said miss sharp and her eyes went from the carpet straight to the chandelier  joseph still continued a huge clattering at the poker and tongs puffing and blowing the while and turning as red as his yellow face would allow him  i cant make you such handsome presents joseph continued his sister but while i was at school i have embroidered for you a very beautiful pair of braces  good gad amelia cried the brother in serious alarm what do you mean and plunging with all his might at the bellrope that article of furniture came away in his hand and increased the honest fellows confusion  for heavens sake see if my buggys at the door  i cant wait  i must go  d that groom of mine i must go  at this minute the father of the family walked in rattling his seals like a true british merchant  whats the matter emmy says he  joseph wants me to see if hishis buggy is at the door  what is a buggy papa  it is a onehorse palanquin said the old gentleman who was a wag in his way  joseph at this burst out into a wild fit of laughter in which encountering the eye of miss sharp he stopped all of a sudden as if he had been shot  this young lady is your friend miss sharp i am very happy to see you  have you and emmy been quarrelling already with joseph that he wants to be off  i promised bonamy of our service sir said joseph to dine with him  o fie didnt you tell your mother you would dine here  but in this dress its impossible  look at him isnt he handsome enough to dine anywhere miss sharp  on which of course miss sharp looked at her friend and they both set off in a fit of laughter highly agreeable to the old gentleman  did you ever see a pair of buckskins like those at miss pinkertons continued he following up his advantage  gracious heavens father cried joseph  there now i have hurt his feelings  mrs sedley my dear i have hurt your sons feelings  i have alluded to his buckskins  ask miss sharp if i havent come joseph be friends with miss sharp and let us all go to dinner  theres a pillau joseph just as you like it and papa has brought home the best turbot in billingsgate  come come sir walk downstairs with miss sharp and i will follow with these two young women said the father and he took an arm of wife and daughter and walked merrily off  if miss rebecca sharp had determined in her heart upon making the conquest of this big beau i dont think ladies we have any right to blame her for though the task of husbandhunting is generally and with becoming modesty entrusted by young persons to their mammas recollect that miss sharp had no kind parent to arrange these delicate matters for her and that if she did not get a husband for herself there was no one else in the wide world who would take the trouble off her hands  what causes young people to come out but the noble ambition of matrimony what sends them trooping to wateringplaces what keeps them dancing till five oclock in the morning through a whole mortal season what causes them to labour at pianoforte sonatas and to learn four songs from a fashionable master at a guinea a lesson and to play the harp if they have handsome arms and neat elbows and to wear lincoln green toxophilite hats and feathers but that they may bring down some desirable young man with those killing bows and arrows of theirs what causes respectable parents to take up their carpets set their houses topsyturvy and spend a fifth of their years income in ball suppers and iced champagne is it sheer love of their species and an unadulterated wish to see young people happy and dancing psha they want to marry their daughters and as honest mrs sedley has in the depths of her kind heart already arranged a score of little schemes for the settlement of her amelia so also had our beloved but unprotected rebecca determined to do her very best to secure the husband who was even more necessary for her than for her friend she had a vivid imagination she had besides read the arabian nights and guthries geography and it is a fact that while she was dressing for dinner and after she had asked amelia whether her brother was very rich she had built for herself a most magnificent castle in the air of which she was mistress with a husband somewhere in the background she had not seen him as yet and his figure would not therefore be very distinct she had arrayed herself in an infinity of shawls turbans and diamond necklaces and had mounted upon an elephant to the sound of the march in bluebeard in order to pay a visit of ceremony to the grand mogul charming alnaschar visions it is the happy privilege of youth to construct you and many a fanciful young creature besides rebecca sharp has indulged in these delightful daydreams ere now  joseph sedley was twelve years older than his sister amelia  he was in the east india companys civil service and his name appeared at the period of which we write in the bengal division of the east india register as collector of boggley wollah an honourable and lucrative post as everybody knows in order to know to what higher posts joseph rose in the service the reader is referred to the same periodical  boggley wollah is situated in a fine lonely marshy jungly district famous for snipeshooting and where not unfrequently you may flush a tiger  ramgunge where there is a magistrate is only forty miles off and there is a cavalry station about thirty miles farther so joseph wrote home to his parents when he took possession of his collectorship  he had lived for about eight years of his life quite alone at this charming place scarcely seeing a christian face except twice a year when the detachment arrived to carry off the revenues which he had collected to calcutta  luckily at this time he caught a liver complaint for the cure of which he returned to europe and which was the source of great comfort and amusement to him in his native country  he did not live with his family while in london but had lodgings of his own like a gay young bachelor  before he went to india he was too young to partake of the delightful pleasures of a man about town and plunged into them on his return with considerable assiduity  he drove his horses in the park he dined at the fashionable taverns for the oriental club was not as yet invented he frequented the theatres as the mode was in those days or made his appearance at the opera laboriously attired in tights and a cocked hat  on returning to india and ever after he used to talk of the pleasure of this period of his existence with great enthusiasm and give you to understand that he and brummel were the leading bucks of the day  but he was as lonely here as in his jungle at boggley wollah  he scarcely knew a single soul in the metropolis and were it not for his doctor and the society of his bluepill and his liver complaint he must have died of loneliness he was lazy peevish and a bonvivant the appearance of a lady frightened him beyond measure hence it was but seldom that he joined the paternal circle in russell square where there was plenty of gaiety and where the jokes of his goodnatured old father frightened his amourpropre  his bulk caused joseph much anxious thought and alarm now and then he would make a desperate attempt to get rid of his superabundant fat but his indolence and love of good living speedily got the better of these endeavours at reform and he found himself again at his three meals a day  he never was well dressed but he took the hugest pains to adorn his big person and passed many hours daily in that occupation his valet made a fortune out of his wardrobe his toilettable was covered with as many pomatums and essences as ever were employed by an old beauty he had tried in order to give himself a waist every girth stay and waistband then invented  like most fat men he would have his clothes made too tight and took care they should be of the most brilliant colours and youthful cut  when dressed at length in the afternoon he would issue forth to take a drive with nobody in the park and then would come back in order to dress again and go and dine with nobody at the piazza coffeehouse he was as vain as a girl and perhaps his extreme shyness was one of the results of his extreme vanity if miss rebecca can get the better of him and at her first entrance into life she is a young person of no ordinary cleverness  the first move showed considerable skill  when she called sedley a very handsome man she knew that amelia would tell her mother who would probably tell joseph or who at any rate would be pleased by the compliment paid to her son  all mothers are  if you had told sycorax that her son caliban was as handsome as apollo she would have been pleased witch as she was  perhaps too joseph sedley would overhear the complimentrebecca spoke loud enoughand he did hear and thinking in his heart that he was a very fine man the praise thrilled through every fibre of his big body and made it tingle with pleasure  then however came a recoil  is the girl making fun of me he thought and straightway he bounced towards the bell and was for retreating as we have seen when his fathers jokes and his mothers entreaties caused him to pause and stay where he was  he conducted the young lady down to dinner in a dubious and agitated frame of mind does she really think i am handsome thought he or is she only making game of me we have talked of joseph sedley being as vain as a girl  heaven help us the girls have only to turn the tables and say of one of their own sex she is as vain as a man and they will have perfect reason  the bearded creatures are quite as eager for praise quite as finikin over their toilettes quite as proud of their personal advantages quite as conscious of their powers of fascination as any coquette in the world  downstairs then they went joseph very red and blushing rebecca very modest and holding her green eyes downwards  she was dressed in white with bare shoulders as white as snowthe picture of youth unprotected innocence and humble virgin simplicity i must be very quiet thought rebecca and very much interested about india  now we have heard how mrs sedley had prepared a fine curry for her son just as he liked it and in the course of dinner a portion of this dish was offered to rebecca  what is it said she turning an appealing look to mr joseph  capital said he  his mouth was full of it his face quite red with the delightful exercise of gobbling mother its as good as my own curries in india  oh i must try some if it is an indian dish said miss rebecca i am sure everything must be good that comes from there  give miss sharp some curry my dear said mr sedley laughing  rebecca had never tasted the dish before  do you find it as good as everything else from india said mr sedley  oh excellent said rebecca who was suffering tortures with the cayenne pepper  try a chili with it miss sharp said joseph really interested  a chili said rebecca gasping  oh yes  she thought a chili was something cool as its name imported and was served with some how fresh and green they look she said and put one into her mouth  it was hotter than the curry flesh and blood could bear it no longer she laid down her fork  water for heavens sake water she cried mr sedley burst out laughing he was a coarse man from the stock exchange where they love all sorts of practical jokes  they are real indian i assure you said he  sambo give miss sharp some water  the paternal laugh was echoed by joseph who thought the joke capital the ladies only smiled a little  they thought poor rebecca suffered too much  she would have liked to choke old sedley but she swallowed her mortification as well as she had the abominable curry before it and as soon as she could speak said with a comical goodhumoured air i ought to have remembered the pepper which the princess of persia puts in the creamtarts in the arabian nights  do you put cayenne into your creamtarts in india sir  old sedley began to laugh and thought rebecca was a goodhumoured girl  joseph simply said creamtarts miss our cream is very bad in bengal  we generally use goats milk and gad do you know ive got to prefer it  you wont like everything from india now miss sharp said the old gentleman but when the ladies had retired after dinner the wily old fellow said to his son have a care joe that girl is setting her cap at you  pooh nonsense said joe highly flattered  i recollect sir there was a girl at dumdum a daughter of cutler of the artillery and afterwards married to lance the surgeon who made a dead set at me in the year 4at me and mulligatawney whom i mentioned to you before dinnera devilish good fellow mulligatawneyhes a magistrate at budgebudge and sure to be in council in five years well sir the artillery gave a ball and quintin of the kings 14th said to me sedley said he i bet you thirteen to ten that sophy cutler hooks either you or mulligatawney before the rains done says i and egad sirthis clarets very good  adamsons or carbonells  a slight snore was the only reply the honest stockbroker was asleep and so the rest of josephs story was lost for that day but he was always exceedingly communicative in a mans party and has told this delightful tale many scores of times to his apothecary dr gollop when he came to inquire about the liver and the bluepill  being an invalid joseph sedley contented himself with a bottle of claret besides his madeira at dinner and he managed a couple of plates full of strawberries and cream and twentyfour little rout cakes that were lying neglected in a plate near him and certainly for novelists have the privilege of knowing everything he thought a great deal about the girl upstairs  a nice gay merry young creature thought he to himself  how she looked at me when i picked up her handkerchief at dinner  she dropped it twice  whos that singing in the drawingroom gad shall i go up and see  but his modesty came rushing upon him with uncontrollable force his father was asleep his hat was in the hall there was a hackneycoach standing hard by in southampton row  ill go and see the forty thieves said he and miss decamps dance and he slipped away gently on the pointed toes of his boots and disappeared without waking his worthy parent  there goes joseph said amelia who was looking from the open windows of the drawingroom while rebecca was singing at the piano  miss sharp has frightened him away said mrs sedley  poor joe why will he be so shy    chapter iv  the green silk purse  poor joes panic lasted for two or three days during which he did not visit the house nor during that period did miss rebecca ever mention his name  she was all respectful gratitude to mrs sedley delighted beyond measure at the bazaars and in a whirl of wonder at the theatre whither the goodnatured lady took her  one day amelia had a headache and could not go upon some party of pleasure to which the two young people were invited nothing could induce her friend to go without her what you who have shown the poor orphan what happiness and love are for the first time in her lifequit you  never  and the green eyes looked up to heaven and filled with tears and mrs sedley could not but own that her daughters friend had a charming kind heart of her own  as for mr sedleys jokes rebecca laughed at them with a cordiality and perseverance which not a little pleased and softened that goodnatured gentleman  nor was it with the chiefs of the family alone that miss sharp found favour  she interested mrs blenkinsop by evincing the deepest sympathy in the raspberryjam preserving which operation was then going on in the housekeepers room she persisted in calling sambo sir and mr sambo to the delight of that attendant and she apologised to the ladys maid for giving her trouble in venturing to ring the bell with such sweetness and humility that the servants hall was almost as charmed with her as the drawing room  once in looking over some drawings which amelia had sent from school rebecca suddenly came upon one which caused her to burst into tears and leave the room it was on the day when joe sedley made his second appearance  amelia hastened after her friend to know the cause of this display of feeling and the goodnatured girl came back without her companion rather affected too  you know her father was our drawingmaster mamma at chiswick and used to do all the best parts of our drawings  my love im sure i always heard miss pinkerton say that he did not touch themhe only mounted them it was called mounting mamma rebecca remembers the drawing and her father working at it and the thought of it came upon her rather suddenlyand so you know she  the poor child is all heart said mrs sedley  i wish she could stay with us another week said amelia  shes devilish like miss cutler that i used to meet at dumdum only fairer  shes married now to lance the artillery surgeon  do you know maam that once quintin of the 14th bet me  o joseph we know that story said amelia laughing never mind about telling that but persuade mamma to write to sir something crawley for leave of absence for poor dear rebecca here she comes her eyes red with weeping  im better now said the girl with the sweetest smile possible taking goodnatured mrs sedleys extended hand and kissing it respectfully  how kind you all are to me all she added with a laugh except you mr joseph  me said joseph meditating an instant departure gracious heavens good gad miss sharp  yes how could you be so cruel as to make me eat that horrid pepperdish at dinner the first day i ever saw you you are not so good to me as dear amelia  he doesnt know you so well cried amelia  i defy anybody not to be good to you my dear said her mother  the curry was capital indeed it was said joe quite gravely perhaps there was not enough citron juice in itno there was not  and the chilis  by jove how they made you cry out said joe caught by the ridicule of the circumstance and exploding in a fit of laughter which ended quite suddenly as usual  i shall take care how i let you choose for me another time said rebecca as they went down again to dinner  i didnt think men were fond of putting poor harmless girls to pain  by gad miss rebecca i wouldnt hurt you for the world  no said she i know you wouldnt and then she gave him ever so gentle a pressure with her little hand and drew it back quite frightened and looked first for one instant in his face and then down at the carpetrods and i am not prepared to say that joes heart did not thump at this little involuntary timid gentle motion of regard on the part of the simple girl  it was an advance and as such perhaps some ladies of indisputable correctness and gentility will condemn the action as immodest but you see poor dear rebecca had all this work to do for herself  if a person is too poor to keep a servant though ever so elegant he must sweep his own rooms if a dear girl has no dear mamma to settle matters with the young man she must do it for herself  and oh what a mercy it is that these women do not exercise their powers oftener we cant resist them if they do  let them show ever so little inclination and men go down on their knees at once old or ugly it is all the same and this i set down as a positive truth a woman with fair opportunities and without an absolute hump may marry whom she likes only let us be thankful that the darlings are like the beasts of the field and dont know their own power  they would overcome us entirely if they did  egad thought joseph entering the diningroom i exactly begin to feel as i did at dumdum with miss cutler many sweet little appeals half tender half jocular did miss sharp make to him about the dishes at dinner for by this time she was on a footing of considerable familiarity with the family and as for the girls they loved each other like sisters  young unmarried girls always do if they are in a house together for ten days  as if bent upon advancing rebeccas plans in every waywhat must amelia do but remind her brother of a promise made last easter holidayswhen i was a girl at school said she laughinga promise that he joseph would take her to vauxhall  now she said that rebecca is with us will be the very time  o delightful said rebecca going to clap her hands but she recollected herself and paused like a modest creature as she was  tonight is not the night said joe  well tomorrow  tomorrow your papa and i dine out said mrs sedley  you dont suppose that im going mrs sed said her husband and that a woman of your years and size is to catch cold in such an abominable damp place  the children must have someone with them cried mrs sedley  let joe go saidhis father laughing  hes big enough at which speech even mr sambo at the sideboard burst out laughing and poor fat joe felt inclined to become a parricide almost  undo his stays continued the pitiless old gentleman fling some water in his face miss sharp or carry him upstairs the dear creatures fainting  poor victim carry him up hes as light as a feather  if i stand this sir im d roared joseph  order mr joss elephant sambo cried the father send to exeter change sambo but seeing jos ready almost to cry with vexation the old joker stopped his laughter and said holding out his hand to his son its all fair on the stock exchange josand sambo never mind the elephant but give me and mr jos a glass of champagne  boney himself hasnt got such in his cellar my boy  a goblet of champagne restored josephs equanimity and before the bottle was emptied of which as an invalid he took twothirds he had agreed to take the young ladies to vauxhall  the girls must have a gentleman apiece said the old gentleman jos will be sure to leave emmy in the crowd he will be so taken up with miss sharp here  send to 96 and ask george osborne if hell come  at this i dont know in the least for what reason mrs sedley looked at her husband and laughed  mr sedleys eyes twinkled in a manner indescribably roguish and he looked at amelia and amelia hanging down her head blushed as only young ladies of seventeen know how to blush and as miss rebecca sharp never blushed in her lifeat least not since she was eight years old and when she was caught stealing jam out of a cupboard by her godmother  amelia had better write a note said her father and let george osborne see what a beautiful handwriting we have brought back from miss pinkertons  do you remember when you wrote to him to come on twelfthnight emmy and spelt twelfth without the f  that was years ago said amelia  it seems like yesterday dont it john said mrs sedley to her husband and that night in a conversation which took place in a front room in the second floor in a sort of tent hung round with chintz of a rich and fantastic india pattern and double with calico of a tender rosecolour in the interior of which species of marquee was a featherbed on which were two pillows on which were two round red faces one in a laced nightcap and one in a simple cotton one ending in a tasselin a curtain lecture i say mrs sedley took her husband to task for his cruel conduct to poor joe  it was quite wicked of you mr sedley said she to torment the poor boy so  my dear said the cottontassel in defence of his conduct jos is a great deal vainer than you ever were in your life and thats saying a good deal  though some thirty years ago in the year seventeen hundred and eightywhat was itperhaps you had a right to be vaini dont say no  but ive no patience with jos and his dandified modesty it is outjosephing joseph my dear and all the while the boy is only thinking of himself and what a fine fellow he is  i doubt maam we shall have some trouble with him yet  here is emmys little friend making love to him as hard as she can thats quite clear and if she does not catch him some other will that man is destined to be a prey to woman as i am to go on change every day  its a mercy he did not bring us over a black daughterinlaw my dear  but mark my words the first woman who fishes for him hooks him  she shall go off tomorrow the little artful creature said mrs sedley with great energy  why not she as well as another mrs sedley the girls a white face at any rate  i dont care who marries him  let joe please himself  and presently the voices of the two speakers were hushed or were replaced by the gentle but unromantic music of the nose and save when the church bells tolled the hour and the watchman called it all was silent at the house of john sedley esquire of russell square and the stock exchange  when morning came the goodnatured mrs sedley no longer thought of executing her threats with regard to miss sharp for though nothing is more keen nor more common nor more justifiable than maternal jealousy yet she could not bring herself to suppose that the little humble grateful gentle governess would dare to look up to such a magnificent personage as the collector of boggley wollah the petition too for an extension of the young ladys leave of absence had already been despatched and it would be difficult to find a pretext for abruptly dismissing her  and as if all things conspired in favour of the gentle rebecca the very elements although she was not inclined at first to acknowledge their action in her behalf interposed to aid her  for on the evening appointed for the vauxhall party george osborne having come to dinner and the elders of the house having departed according to invitation to dine with alderman balls at highbury barn there came on such a thunderstorm as only happens on vauxhall nights and as obliged the young people perforce to remain at home  mr osborne did not seem in the least disappointed at this occurrence he and joseph sedley drank a fitting quantity of portwine teteatete in the diningroom during the drinking of which sedley told a number of his best indian stories for he was extremely talkative in mans society and afterwards miss amelia sedley did the honours of the drawingroom and these four young persons passed such a comfortable evening together that they declared they were rather glad of the thunderstorm than otherwise which had caused them to put off their visit to vauxhall  osborne was sedleys godson and had been one of the family any time these threeandtwenty years  at six weeks old he had received from john sedley a present of a silver cup at six months old a coral with gold whistle and bells from his youth upwards he was tipped regularly by the old gentleman at christmas and on going back to school he remembered perfectly well being thrashed by joseph sedley when the latter was a big swaggering hobbadyhoy and george an impudent urchin of ten years old  in a word george was as familiar with the family as such daily acts of kindness and intercourse could make him  do you remember sedley what a fury you were in when i cut off the tassels of your hessian boots and how misshemhow amelia rescued me from a beating by falling down on her knees and crying out to her brother jos not to beat little george  jos remembered this remarkable circumstance perfectly well but vowed that he had totally forgotten it  well do you remember coming down in a gig to dr swishtails to see me before you went to india and giving me half a guinea and a pat on the head i always had an idea that you were at least seven feet high and was quite astonished at your return from india to find you no taller than myself  how good of mr sedley to go to your school and give you the money exclaimed rebecca in accents of extreme delight  yes and after i had cut the tassels of his boots too boys never forget those tips at school nor the givers  i delight in hessian boots said rebecca  jos sedley who admired his own legs prodigiously and always wore this ornamental chaussure was extremely pleased at this remark though he drew his legs under his chair as it was made  miss sharp said george osborne you who are so clever an artist you must make a grand historical picture of the scene of the boots sedley shall be represented in buckskins and holding one of the injured boots in one hand by the other he shall have hold of my shirtfrill  amelia shall be kneeling near him with her little hands up and the picture shall have a grand allegorical title as the frontispieces have in the medulla and the spellingbook  i shant have time to do it here said rebecca  ill do it whenwhen im gone and she dropped her voice and looked so sad and piteous that everybody felt how cruel her lot was and how sorry they would be to part with her  o that you could stay longer dear rebecca said amelia  why answered the other still more sadly  that i may be only the more unhapunwilling to lose you and she turned away her head amelia began to give way to that natural infirmity of tears which we have said was one of the defects of this silly little thing  george osborne looked at the two young women with a touched curiosity and joseph sedley heaved something very like a sigh out of his big chest as he cast his eyes down towards his favourite hessian boots  let us have some music miss sedleyamelia said george who felt at that moment an extraordinary almost irresistible impulse to seize the abovementioned young woman in his arms and to kiss her in the face of the company and she looked at him for a moment and if i should say that they fell in love with each other at that single instant of time i should perhaps be telling an untruth for the fact is that these two young people had been bred up by their parents for this very purpose and their banns had as it were been read in their respective families any time these ten years  they went off to the piano which was situated as pianos usually are in the back drawingroom and as it was rather dark miss amelia in the most unaffected way in the world put her hand into mr osbornes who of course could see the way among the chairs and ottomans a great deal better than she could  but this arrangement left mr joseph sedley teteatete with rebecca at the drawingroom table where the latter was occupied in knitting a green silk purse  there is no need to ask family secrets said miss sharp  those two have told theirs  as soon as he gets his company said joseph i believe the affair is settled  george osborne is a capital fellow  and your sister the dearest creature in the world said rebecca happy the man who wins her with this miss sharp gave a great sigh  when two unmarried persons get together and talk upon such delicate subjects as the present a great deal of confidence and intimacy is presently established between them  there is no need of giving a special report of the conversation which now took place between mr sedley and the young lady for the conversation as may be judged from the foregoing specimen was not especially witty or eloquent it seldom is in private societies or anywhere except in very highflown and ingenious novels as there was music in the next room the talk was carried on of course in a low and becoming tone though for the matter of that the couple in the next apartment would not have been disturbed had the talking been ever so loud so occupied were they with their own pursuits  almost for the first time in his life mr sedley found himself talking without the least timidity or hesitation to a person of the other sex  miss rebecca asked him a great number of questions about india which gave him an opportunity of narrating many interesting anecdotes about that country and himself  he described the balls at government house and the manner in which they kept themselves cool in the hot weather with punkahs tatties and other contrivances and he was very witty regarding the number of scotchmen whom lord minto the governorgeneral patronised and then he described a tigerhunt and the manner in which the mahout of his elephant had been pulled off his seat by one of the infuriated animals  how delighted miss rebecca was at the government balls and how she laughed at the stories of the scotch aidesdecamp and called mr sedley a sad wicked satirical creature and how frightened she was at the story of the elephant for your mothers sake dear mr sedley she said for the sake of all your friends promise never to go on one of those horrid expeditions  pooh pooh miss sharp said he pulling up his shirtcollars the danger makes the sport only the pleasanter he had never been but once at a tigerhunt when the accident in question occurred and when he was half killednot by the tiger but by the fright and as he talked on he grew quite bold and actually had the audacity to ask miss rebecca for whom she was knitting the green silk purse he was quite surprised and delighted at his own graceful familiar manner  for any one who wants a purse replied miss rebecca looking at him in the most gentle winning way sedley was going to make one of the most eloquent speeches possible and had beguno miss sharp how when some song which was performed in the other room came to an end and caused him to hear his own voice so distinctly that he stopped blushed and blew his nose in great agitation  did you ever hear anything like your brothers eloquence whispered mr osborne to amelia  why your friend has worked miracles  the more the better said miss amelia who like almost all women who are worth a pin was a matchmaker in her heart and would have been delighted that joseph should carry back a wife to india  she had too in the course of this few days constant intercourse warmed into a most tender friendship for rebecca and discovered a million of virtues and amiable qualities in her which she had not perceived when they were at chiswick together  for the affection of young ladies is of as rapid growth as jacks beanstalk and reaches up to the sky in a night  it is no blame to them that after marriage this sehnsucht nach der liebe subsides  it is what sentimentalists who deal in very big words call a yearning after the ideal and simply means that women are commonly not satisfied until they have husbands and children on whom they may centre affections which are spent elsewhere as it were in small change  having expended her little store of songs or having stayed long enough in the back drawingroom it now appeared proper to miss amelia to ask her friend to sing  you would not have listened to me she said to mr osborne though she knew she was telling a fib had you heard rebecca first  i give miss sharp warning though said osborne that right or wrong i consider miss amelia sedley the first singer in the world  you shall hear said amelia and joseph sedley was actually polite enough to carry the candles to the piano osborne hinted that he should like quite as well to sit in the dark but miss sedley laughing declined to bear him company any farther and the two accordingly followed mr joseph  rebecca sang far better than her friend though of course osborne was free to keep his opinion and exerted herself to the utmost and indeed to the wonder of amelia who had never known her perform so well  she sang a french song which joseph did not understand in the least and which george confessed he did not understand and then a number of those simple ballads which were the fashion forty years ago and in which british tars our king poor susan blueeyed mary and the like were the principal themes they are not it is said very brilliant in a musical point of view but contain numberless goodnatured simple appeals to the affections which people understood better than the milkandwater lagrime sospiri and felicita of the eternal donizettian music with which we are favoured nowadays  conversation of a sentimental sort befitting the subject was carried on between the songs to which sambo after he had brought the tea the delighted cook and even mrs blenkinsop the housekeeper condescended to listen on the landingplace  among these ditties was one the last of the concert and to the following effect  ah bleak and barren was the moor ah loud and piercing was the storm the cottage roof was shelterd sure the cottage hearth was bright and warman orphan boy the lattice passd and as he markd its cheerful glow felt doubly keen the midnight blast and doubly cold the fallen snow  they markd him as he onward prest with fainting heart and weary limb kind voices bade him turn and rest and gentle faces welcomed him the dawn is upthe guest is gone the cottage hearth is blazing still heaven pity all poor wanderers lone hark to the wind upon the hill  it was the sentiment of the beforementioned words when im gone over again  as she came to the last words miss sharps deeptoned voice faltered everybody felt the allusion to her departure and to her hapless orphan state  joseph sedley who was fond of music and softhearted was in a state of ravishment during the performance of the song and profoundly touched at its conclusion if he had had the courage if george and miss sedley had remained according to the formers proposal in the farther room joseph sedleys bachelorhood would have been at an end and this work would never have been written but at the close of the ditty rebecca quitted the piano and giving her hand to amelia walked away into the front drawingroom twilight and at this moment mr sambo made his appearance with a tray containing sandwiches jellies and some glittering glasses and decanters on which joseph sedleys attention was immediately fixed when the parents of the house of sedley returned from their dinnerparty they found the young people so busy in talking that they had not heard the arrival of the carriage and mr joseph was in the act of saying my dear miss sharp one little teaspoonful of jelly to recruit you after your immenseyouryour delightful exertions  bravo jos said mr sedley on hearing the bantering of which wellknown voice jos instantly relapsed into an alarmed silence and quickly took his departure he did not lie awake all night thinking whether or not he was in love with miss sharp the passion of love never interfered with the appetite or the slumber of mr joseph sedley but he thought to himself how delightful it would be to hear such songs as those after cutcherrywhat a distinguee girl she washow she could speak french better than the governorgenerals lady herselfand what a sensation she would make at the calcutta balls its evident the poor devils in love with me thought he  she is just as rich as most of the girls who come out to india  i might go farther and fare worse egad and in these meditations he fell asleep  how miss sharp lay awake thinking will he come or not tomorrow need not be told here  tomorrow came and as sure as fate mr joseph sedley made his appearance before luncheon  he had never been known before to confer such an honour on russell square george osborne was somehow there already sadly putting out amelia who was writing to her twelve dearest friends at chiswick mall and rebecca was employed upon her yesterdays work  as joes buggy drove up and while after his usual thundering knock and pompous bustle at the door the excollector of boggley wollah laboured up stairs to the drawingroom knowing glances were telegraphed between osborne and miss sedley and the pair smiling archly looked at rebecca who actually blushed as she bent her fair ringlets over her knitting  how her heart beat as joseph appearedjoseph puffing from the staircase in shining creaking bootsjoseph in a new waistcoat red with heat and nervousness and blushing behind his wadded neckcloth  it was a nervous moment for all and as for amelia i think she was more frightened than even the people most concerned  sambo who flung open the door and announced mr joseph followed grinning in the collectors rear and bearing two handsome nosegays of flowers which the monster had actually had the gallantry to purchase in covent garden market that morningthey were not as big as the haystacks which ladies carry about with them nowadays in cones of filigree paper but the young women were delighted with the gift as joseph presented one to each with an exceedingly solemn bow  bravo jos cried osborne  thank you dear joseph said amelia quite ready to kiss her brother if he were so minded  and i think for a kiss from such a dear creature as amelia i would purchase all mr lees conservatories out of hand  o heavenly heavenly flowers exclaimed miss sharp and smelt them delicately and held them to her bosom and cast up her eyes to the ceiling in an ecstasy of admiration  perhaps she just looked first into the bouquet to see whether there was a billetdoux hidden among the flowers but there was no letter  do they talk the language of flowers at boggley wollah sedley asked osborne laughing  pooh nonsense replied the sentimental youth bought em at nathans very glad you like em and eh amelia my dear i bought a pineapple at the same time which i gave to sambo  lets have it for tiffin very cool and nice this hot weather rebecca said she had never tasted a pine and longed beyond everything to taste one  so the conversation went on  i dont know on what pretext osborne left the room or why presently amelia went away perhaps to superintend the slicing of the pineapple but jos was left alone with rebecca who had resumed her work and the green silk and the shining needles were quivering rapidly under her white slender fingers  what a beautiful byooootiful song that was you sang last night dear miss sharp said the collector  it made me cry almost pon my honour it did  because you have a kind heart mr joseph all the sedleys have i think  it kept me awake last night and i was trying to hum it this morning in bed i was upon my honour  gollop my doctor came in at eleven for im a sad invalid you know and see gollop every day and gad there i was singing away likea robin  o you droll creature do let me hear you sing it  me no you miss sharp my dear miss sharp do sing it  not now mr sedley said rebecca with a sigh  my spirits are not equal to it besides i must finish the purse  will you help me mr sedley and before he had time to ask how mr joseph sedley of the east india companys service was actually seated teteatete with a young lady looking at her with a most killing expression his arms stretched out before her in an imploring attitude and his hands bound in a web of green silk which she was unwinding  in this romantic position osborne and amelia found the interesting pair when they entered to announce that tiffin was ready  the skein of silk was just wound round the card but mr jos had never spoken  i am sure he will tonight dear amelia said as she pressed rebeccas hand and sedley too had communed with his soul and said to himself gad ill pop the question at vauxhall    chapter v  dobbin of ours  cuffs fight with dobbin and the unexpected issue of that contest will long be remembered by every man who was educated at dr swishtails famous school  the latter youth who used to be called heighho dobbin geeho dobbin and by many other names indicative of puerile contempt was the quietest the clumsiest and as it seemed the dullest of all dr swishtails young gentlemen his parent was a grocer in the city and it was bruited abroad that he was admitted into dr swishtails academy upon what are called mutual principlesthat is to say the expenses of his board and schooling were defrayed by his father in goods not money and he stood theremost at the bottom of the schoolin his scraggy corduroys and jacket through the seams of which his great big bones were burstingas the representative of so many pounds of tea candles sugar mottledsoap plums of which a very mild proportion was supplied for the puddings of the establishment and other commodities  a dreadful day it was for young dobbin when one of the youngsters of the school having run into the town upon a poaching excursion for hardbake and polonies espied the cart of dobbin  rudge grocers and oilmen thames street london at the doctors door discharging a cargo of the wares in which the firm dealt  young dobbin had no peace after that  the jokes were frightful and merciless against him  hullo dobbin one wag would say heres good news in the paper  sugars is ris my boy another would set a sumif a pound of muttoncandles cost sevenpencehalfpenny how much must dobbin cost and a roar would follow from all the circle of young knaves usher and all who rightly considered that the selling of goods by retail is a shameful and infamous practice meriting the contempt and scorn of all real gentlemen  your fathers only a merchant osborne dobbin said in private to the little boy who had brought down the storm upon him  at which the latter replied haughtily my fathers a gentleman and keeps his carriage and mr william dobbin retreated to a remote outhouse in the playground where he passed a halfholiday in the bitterest sadness and woe  who amongst us is there that does not recollect similar hours of bitter bitter childish grief who feels injustice who shrinks before a slight who has a sense of wrong so acute and so glowing a gratitude for kindness as a generous boy and how many of those gentle souls do you degrade estrange torture for the sake of a little loose arithmetic and miserable doglatin  now william dobbin from an incapacity to acquire the rudiments of the above language as they are propounded in that wonderful book the eton latin grammar was compelled to remain among the very last of doctor swishtails scholars and was taken down continually by little fellows with pink faces and pinafores when he marched up with the lower form a giant amongst them with his downcast stupefied look his dogseared primer and his tight corduroys  high and low all made fun of him  they sewed up those corduroys tight as they were they cut his bedstrings  they upset buckets and benches so that he might break his shins over them which he never failed to do  they sent him parcels which when opened were found to contain the paternal soap and candles  there was no little fellow but had his jeer and joke at dobbin and he bore everything quite patiently and was entirely dumb and miserable  cuff on the contrary was the great chief and dandy of the swishtail seminary  he smuggled wine in  he fought the townboys ponies used to come for him to ride home on saturdays  he had his topboots in his room in which he used to hunt in the holidays  he had a gold repeater and took snuff like the doctor  he had been to the opera and knew the merits of the principal actors preferring mr kean to mr kemble  he could knock you off forty latin verses in an hour  he could make french poetry what else didnt he know or couldnt he do they said even the doctor himself was afraid of him  cuff the unquestioned king of the school ruled over his subjects and bullied them with splendid superiority this one blacked his shoes that toasted his bread others would fag out and give him balls at cricket during whole summer afternoons  figs was the fellow whom he despised most and with whom though always abusing him and sneering at him he scarcely ever condescended to hold personal communication  one day in private the two young gentlemen had had a difference figs alone in the schoolroom was blundering over a home letter when cuff entering bade him go upon some message of which tarts were probably the subject  i cant says dobbin i want to finish my letter  you cant says mr cuff laying hold of that document in which many words were scratched out many were misspelt on which had been spent i dont know how much thought and labour and tears for the poor fellow was writing to his mother who was fond of him although she was a grocers wife and lived in a back parlour in thames street  you cant says mr cuff i should like to know why pray cant you write to old mother figs tomorrow  dont call names dobbin said getting off the bench very nervous  well sir will you go crowed the cock of the school  put down the letter dobbin replied no gentleman readth letterth  well now will you go says the other  no i wont  dont strike or ill thmash you roars out dobbin springing to a leaden inkstand and looking so wicked that mr cuff paused turned down his coat sleeves again put his hands into his pockets and walked away with a sneer  but he never meddled personally with the grocers boy after that though we must do him the justice to say he always spoke of mr dobbin with contempt behind his back  some time after this interview it happened that mr cuff on a sunshiny afternoon was in the neighbourhood of poor william dobbin who was lying under a tree in the playground spelling over a favourite copy of the arabian nights which he had apart from the rest of the school who were pursuing their various sportsquite lonely and almost happy  if people would but leave children to themselves if teachers would cease to bully them if parents would not insist upon directing their thoughts and dominating their feelingsthose feelings and thoughts which are a mystery to all for how much do you and i know of each other of our children of our fathers of our neighbour and how far more beautiful and sacred are the thoughts of the poor lad or girl whom you govern likely to be than those of the dull and worldcorrupted person who rules himif i say parents and masters would leave their children alone a little more small harm would accrue although a less quantity of as in praesenti might be acquired  well william dobbin had for once forgotten the world and was away with sindbad the sailor in the valley of diamonds or with prince ahmed and the fairy peribanou in that delightful cavern where the prince found her and whither we should all like to make a tour when shrill cries as of a little fellow weeping woke up his pleasant reverie and looking up he saw cuff before him belabouring a little boy  it was the lad who had peached upon him about the grocers cart but he bore little malice not at least towards the young and small how dare you sir break the bottle says cuff to the little urchin swinging a yellow cricketstump over him  the boy had been instructed to get over the playground wall at a selected spot where the broken glass had been removed from the top and niches made convenient in the brick to run a quarter of a mile to purchase a pint of rumshrub on credit to brave all the doctors outlying spies and to clamber back into the playground again during the performance of which feat his foot had slipt and the bottle was broken and the shrub had been spilt and his pantaloons had been damaged and he appeared before his employer a perfectly guilty and trembling though harmless wretch  how dare you sir break it says cuff you blundering little thief you drank the shrub and now you pretend to have broken the bottle hold out your hand sir  down came the stump with a great heavy thump on the childs hand  a moan followed  dobbin looked up the fairy peribanou had fled into the inmost cavern with prince ahmed the roc had whisked away sindbad the sailor out of the valley of diamonds out of sight far into the clouds and there was everyday life before honest william and a big boy beating a little one without cause  hold out your other hand sir roars cuff to his little schoolfellow whose face was distorted with pain dobbin quivered and gathered himself up in his narrow old clothes  take that you little devil cried mr cuff and down came the wicket again on the childs handdont be horrified ladies every boy at a public school has done it your children will so do and be done by in all probability  down came the wicket again and dobbin started up  i cant tell what his motive was  torture in a public school is as much licensed as the knout in russia  it would be ungentlemanlike in a manner to resist it perhaps dobbins foolish soul revolted against that exercise of tyranny or perhaps he had a hankering feeling of revenge in his mind and longed to measure himself against that splendid bully and tyrant who had all the glory pride pomp circumstance banners flying drums beating guards saluting in the place  whatever may have been his incentive however up he sprang and screamed out hold off cuff dont bully that child any more or ill  or youll what cuff asked in amazement at this interruption hold out your hand you little beast  ill give you the worst thrashing you ever had in your life dobbin said in reply to the first part of cuffs sentence and little osborne gasping and in tears looked up with wonder and incredulity at seeing this amazing champion put up suddenly to defend him while cuffs astonishment was scarcely less  fancy our late monarch george iii when he heard of the revolt of the north american colonies fancy brazen goliath when little david stepped forward and claimed a meeting and you have the feelings of mr reginald cuff when this rencontre was proposed to him  after school says he of course after a pause and a look as much as to say make your will and communicate your last wishes to your friends between this time and that  as you please dobbin said  you must be my bottle holder osborne  well if you like little osborne replied for you see his papa kept a carriage and he was rather ashamed of his champion  yes when the hour of battle came he was almost ashamed to say go it figs and not a single other boy in the place uttered that cry for the first two or three rounds of this famous combat at the commencement of which the scientific cuff with a contemptuous smile on his face and as light and as gay as if he was at a ball planted his blows upon his adversary and floored that unlucky champion three times running  at each fall there was a cheer and everybody was anxious to have the honour of offering the conqueror a knee  what a licking i shall get when its over young osborne thought picking up his man  youd best give in he said to dobbin its only a thrashing figs and you know im used to it but figs all whose limbs were in a quiver and whose nostrils were breathing rage put his little bottleholder aside and went in for a fourth time  as he did not in the least know how to parry the blows that were aimed at himself and cuff had begun the attack on the three preceding occasions without ever allowing his enemy to strike figs now determined that he would commence the engagement by a charge on his own part and accordingly being a lefthanded man brought that arm into action and hit out a couple of times with all his mightonce at mr cuffs left eye and once on his beautiful roman nose  cuff went down this time to the astonishment of the assembly well hit by jove says little osborne with the air of a connoisseur clapping his man on the back give it him with the left figs my boy  figss left made terrific play during all the rest of the combat cuff went down every time  at the sixth round there were almost as many fellows shouting out go it figs as there were youths exclaiming go it cuff at the twelfth round the latter champion was all abroad as the saying is and had lost all presence of mind and power of attack or defence  figs on the contrary was as calm as a quaker  his face being quite pale his eyes shining open and a great cut on his underlip bleeding profusely gave this young fellow a fierce and ghastly air which perhaps struck terror into many spectators nevertheless his intrepid adversary prepared to close for the thirteenth time  if i had the pen of a napier or a bells life i should like to describe this combat properly  it was the last charge of the guardthat is it would have been only waterloo had not yet taken placeit was neys column breasting the hill of la haye sainte bristling with ten thousand bayonets and crowned with twenty eaglesit was the shout of the beefeating british as leaping down the hill they rushed to hug the enemy in the savage arms of battlein other words cuff coming up full of pluck but quite reeling and groggy the figmerchant put in his left as usual on his adversarys nose and sent him down for the last time  i think that will do for him figs said as his opponent dropped as neatly on the green as i have seen jack spots ball plump into the pocket at billiards and the fact is when time was called mr reginald cuff was not able or did not choose to stand up again  and now all the boys set up such a shout for figs as would have made you think he had been their darling champion through the whole battle and as absolutely brought dr swishtail out of his study curious to know the cause of the uproar  he threatened to flog figs violently of course but cuff who had come to himself by this time and was washing his wounds stood up and said its my fault sirnot figsnot dobbins  i was bullying a little boy and he served me right by which magnanimous speech he not only saved his conqueror a whipping but got back all his ascendancy over the boys which his defeat had nearly cost him  young osborne wrote home to his parents an account of the transaction   sugarcane house richmond march 18  dear mamai hope you are quite well  i should be much obliged to you to send me a cake and five shillings there has been a fight here between cuff  dobbin cuff you know was the cock of the school they fought thirteen rounds and dobbin licked  so cuff is now only second cock  the fight was about me  cuff was licking me for breaking a bottle of milk and figs wouldnt stand it  we call him figs because his father is a grocerfigs  rudge thames st cityi think as he fought for me you ought to buy your tea  sugar at his fathers  cuff goes home every saturday but cant this because he has 2 black eyes he has a white pony to come and fetch him and a groom in livery on a bay mare  i wish my papa would let me have a pony and i am  your dutiful son george sedley osborne  psgive my love to little emmy  i am cutting her out a coach in cardboard  please not a seedcake but a plumcake   in consequence of dobbins victory his character rose prodigiously in the estimation of all his schoolfellows and the name of figs which had been a byword of reproach became as respectable and popular a nickname as any other in use in the school  after all its not his fault that his fathers a grocer george osborne said who though a little chap had a very high popularity among the swishtail youth and his opinion was received with great applause it was voted low to sneer at dobbin about this accident of birth old figs grew to be a name of kindness and endearment and the sneak of an usher jeered at him no longer  and dobbins spirit rose with his altered circumstances he made wonderful advances in scholastic learning  the superb cuff himself at whose condescension dobbin could only blush and wonder helped him on with his latin verses coached him in playhours carried him triumphantly out of the littleboy class into the middlesized form and even there got a fair place for him  it was discovered that although dull at classical learning at mathematics he was uncommonly quick  to the contentment of all he passed third in algebra and got a french prizebook at the public midsummer examination you should have seen his mothers face when telemaque that delicious romance was presented to him by the doctor in the face of the whole school and the parents and company with an inscription to gulielmo dobbin  all the boys clapped hands in token of applause and sympathy  his blushes his stumbles his awkwardness and the number of feet which he crushed as he went back to his place who shall describe or calculate old dobbin his father who now respected him for the first time gave him two guineas publicly most of which he spent in a general tuckout for the school and he came back in a tailcoat after the holidays  dobbin was much too modest a young fellow to suppose that this happy change in all his circumstances arose from his own generous and manly disposition he chose from some perverseness to attribute his good fortune to the sole agency and benevolence of little george osborne to whom henceforth he vowed such a love and affection as is only felt by childrensuch an affection as we read in the charming fairybook uncouth orson had for splendid young valentine his conqueror  he flung himself down at little osbornes feet and loved him even before they were acquainted he had admired osborne in secret  now he was his valet his dog his man friday  he believed osborne to be the possessor of every perfection to be the handsomest the bravest the most active the cleverest the most generous of created boys  he shared his money with him bought him uncountable presents of knives pencilcases gold seals toffee little warblers and romantic books with large coloured pictures of knights and robbers in many of which latter you might read inscriptions to george sedley osborne esquire from his attached friend william dobbinthe which tokens of homage george received very graciously as became his superior merit  so that lieutenant osborne when coming to russell square on the day of the vauxhall party said to the ladies mrs sedley maam i hope you have room ive asked dobbin of ours to come and dine here and go with us to vauxhall  hes almost as modest as jos  modesty pooh said the stout gentleman casting a vainqueur look at miss sharp  he isbut you are incomparably more graceful sedley osborne added laughing  i met him at the bedford when i went to look for you and i told him that miss amelia was come home and that we were all bent on going out for a nights pleasuring and that mrs sedley had forgiven his breaking the punchbowl at the childs party dont you remember the catastrophe maam seven years ago  over mrs flamingos crimson silk gown said goodnatured mrs sedley  what a gawky it was and his sisters are not much more graceful  lady dobbin was at highbury last night with three of them such figures my dears  the aldermans very rich isnt he osborne said archly  dont you think one of the daughters would be a good spec for me maam  you foolish creature who would take you i should like to know with your yellow face  mine a yellow face stop till you see dobbin  why he had the yellow fever three times twice at nassau and once at st kitts  well well yours is quite yellow enough for us  isnt it emmy mrs sedley said at which speech miss amelia only made a smile and a blush and looking at mr george osbornes pale interesting countenance and those beautiful black curling shining whiskers which the young gentleman himself regarded with no ordinary complacency she thought in her little heart that in his majestys army or in the wide world there never was such a face or such a hero i dont care about captain dobbins complexion she said or about his awkwardness i shall always like him i know her little reason being that he was the friend and champion of george  theres not a finer fellow in the service osborne said nor a better officer though he is not an adonis certainly and he looked towards the glass himself with much naivete and in so doing caught miss sharps eye fixed keenly upon him at which he blushed a little and rebecca thought in her heart ah mon beau monsieur i think i have your gaugethe little artful minx  that evening when amelia came tripping into the drawingroom in a white muslin frock prepared for conquest at vauxhall singing like a lark and as fresh as a rosea very tall ungainly gentleman with large hands and feet and large ears set off by a closely cropped head of black hair and in the hideous military frogged coat and cocked hat of those times advanced to meet her and made her one of the clumsiest bows that was ever performed by a mortal  this was no other than captain william dobbin of his majestys regiment of foot returned from yellow fever in the west indies to which the fortune of the service had ordered his regiment whilst so many of his gallant comrades were reaping glory in the peninsula  he had arrived with a knock so very timid and quiet that it was inaudible to the ladies upstairs otherwise you may be sure miss amelia would never have been so bold as to come singing into the room as it was the sweet fresh little voice went right into the captains heart and nestled there  when she held out her hand for him to shake before he enveloped it in his own he paused and thoughtwell is it possibleare you the little maid i remember in the pink frock such a short time agothe night i upset the punchbowl just after i was gazetted are you the little girl that george osborne said should marry him  what a blooming young creature you seem and what a prize the rogue has got all this he thought before he took amelias hand into his own and as he let his cocked hat fall  his history since he left school until the very moment when we have the pleasure of meeting him again although not fully narrated has yet i think been indicated sufficiently for an ingenious reader by the conversation in the last page  dobbin the despised grocer was alderman dobbinalderman dobbin was colonel of the city light horse then burning with military ardour to resist the french invasion colonel dobbins corps in which old mr osborne himself was but an indifferent corporal had been reviewed by the sovereign and the duke of york and the colonel and alderman had been knighted  his son had entered the army and young osborne followed presently in the same regiment  they had served in the west indies and in canada  their regiment had just come home and the attachment of dobbin to george osborne was as warm and generous now as it had been when the two were schoolboys  so these worthy people sat down to dinner presently they talked about war and glory and boney and lord wellington and the last gazette  in those famous days every gazette had a victory in it and the two gallant young men longed to see their own names in the glorious list and cursed their unlucky fate to belong to a regiment which had been away from the chances of honour  miss sharp kindled with this exciting talk but miss sedley trembled and grew quite faint as she heard it mr jos told several of his tigerhunting stories finished the one about miss cutler and lance the surgeon helped rebecca to everything on the table and himself gobbled and drank a great deal  he sprang to open the door for the ladies when they retired with the most killing graceand coming back to the table filled himself bumper after bumper of claret which he swallowed with nervous rapidity  hes priming himself osborne whispered to dobbin and at length the hour and the carriage arrived for vauxhall    chapter vi  vauxhall  i know that the tune i am piping is a very mild one although there are some terrific chapters coming presently and must beg the goodnatured reader to remember that we are only discoursing at present about a stockbrokers family in russell square who are taking walks or luncheon or dinner or talking and making love as people do in common life and without a single passionate and wonderful incident to mark the progress of their loves  the argument stands thusosborne in love with amelia has asked an old friend to dinner and to vauxhalljos sedley is in love with rebecca  will he marry her that is the great subject now in hand  we might have treated this subject in the genteel or in the romantic or in the facetious manner  suppose we had laid the scene in grosvenor square with the very same adventureswould not some people have listened suppose we had shown how lord joseph sedley fell in love and the marquis of osborne became attached to lady amelia with the full consent of the duke her noble father or instead of the supremely genteel suppose we had resorted to the entirely low and described what was going on in mr sedleys kitchenhow black sambo was in love with the cook as indeed he was and how he fought a battle with the coachman in her behalf how the knifeboy was caught stealing a cold shoulder of mutton and miss sedleys new femme de chambre refused to go to bed without a wax candle such incidents might be made to provoke much delightful laughter and be supposed to represent scenes of life or if on the contrary we had taken a fancy for the terrible and made the lover of the new femme de chambre a professional burglar who bursts into the house with his band slaughters black sambo at the feet of his master and carries off amelia in her nightdress not to be let loose again till the third volume we should easily have constructed a tale of thrilling interest through the fiery chapters of which the reader should hurry panting  but my readers must hope for no such romance only a homely story and must be content with a chapter about vauxhall which is so short that it scarce deserves to be called a chapter at all  and yet it is a chapter and a very important one too  are not there little chapters in everybodys life that seem to be nothing and yet affect all the rest of the history  let us then step into the coach with the russell square party and be off to the gardens  there is barely room between jos and miss sharp who are on the front seat  mr osborne sitting bodkin opposite between captain dobbin and amelia  every soul in the coach agreed that on that night jos would propose to make rebecca sharp mrs sedley  the parents at home had acquiesced in the arrangement though between ourselves old mr sedley had a feeling very much akin to contempt for his son  he said he was vain selfish lazy and effeminate  he could not endure his airs as a man of fashion and laughed heartily at his pompous braggadocio stories i shall leave the fellow half my property he said and he will have besides plenty of his own but as i am perfectly sure that if you and i and his sister were to die tomorrow he would say good gad and eat his dinner just as well as usual i am not going to make myself anxious about him let him marry whom he likes  its no affair of mine  amelia on the other hand as became a young woman of her prudence and temperament was quite enthusiastic for the match  once or twice jos had been on the point of saying something very important to her to which she was most willing to lend an ear but the fat fellow could not be brought to unbosom himself of his great secret and very much to his sisters disappointment he only rid himself of a large sigh and turned away  this mystery served to keep amelias gentle bosom in a perpetual flutter of excitement  if she did not speak with rebecca on the tender subject she compensated herself with long and intimate conversations with mrs blenkinsop the housekeeper who dropped some hints to the ladysmaid who may have cursorily mentioned the matter to the cook who carried the news i have no doubt to all the tradesmen so that mr joss marriage was now talked of by a very considerable number of persons in the russell square world  it was of course mrs sedleys opinion that her son would demean himself by a marriage with an artists daughter  but lor maam ejaculated mrs blenkinsop we was only grocers when we married mr s who was a stockbrokers clerk and we hadnt five hundred pounds among us and were rich enough now and amelia was entirely of this opinion to which gradually the goodnatured mrs sedley was brought  mr sedley was neutral  let jos marry whom he likes he said its no affair of mine  this girl has no fortune no more had mrs sedley she seems goodhumoured and clever and will keep him in order perhaps  better she my dear than a black mrs sedley and a dozen of mahogany grandchildren  so that everything seemed to smile upon rebeccas fortunes  she took joss arm as a matter of course on going to dinner she had sate by him on the box of his open carriage a most tremendous buck he was as he sat there serene in state driving his greys and though nobody said a word on the subject of the marriage everybody seemed to understand it  all she wanted was the proposal and ah how rebecca now felt the want of a mothera dear tender mother who would have managed the business in ten minutes and in the course of a little delicate confidential conversation would have extracted the interesting avowal from the bashful lips of the young man  such was the state of affairs as the carriage crossed westminster bridge  the party was landed at the royal gardens in due time as the majestic jos stepped out of the creaking vehicle the crowd gave a cheer for the fat gentleman who blushed and looked very big and mighty as he walked away with rebecca under his arm  george of course took charge of amelia  she looked as happy as a rosetree in sunshine  i say dobbin says george just look to the shawls and things theres a good fellow and so while he paired off with miss sedley and jos squeezed through the gate into the gardens with rebecca at his side honest dobbin contented himself by giving an arm to the shawls and by paying at the door for the whole party  he walked very modestly behind them  he was not willing to spoil sport  about rebecca and jos he did not care a fig  but he thought amelia worthy even of the brilliant george osborne and as he saw that goodlooking couple threading the walks to the girls delight and wonder he watched her artless happiness with a sort of fatherly pleasure  perhaps he felt that he would have liked to have something on his own arm besides a shawl the people laughed at seeing the gawky young officer carrying this female burthen but william dobbin was very little addicted to selfish calculation at all and so long as his friend was enjoying himself how should he be discontented and the truth is that of all the delights of the gardens of the hundred thousand extra lamps which were always lighted the fiddlers in cocked hats who played ravishing melodies under the gilded cockleshell in the midst of the gardens the singers both of comic and sentimental ballads who charmed the ears there the country dances formed by bouncing cockneys and cockneyesses and executed amidst jumping thumping and laughter the signal which announced that madame saqui was about to mount skyward on a slackrope ascending to the stars the hermit that always sat in the illuminated hermitage the dark walks so favourable to the interviews of young lovers the pots of stout handed about by the people in the shabby old liveries and the twinkling boxes in which the happy feasters madebelieve to eat slices of almost invisible hamof all these things and of the gentle simpson that kind smiling idiot who i daresay presided even then over the placecaptain william dobbin did not take the slightest notice  he carried about amelias white cashmere shawl and having attended under the gilt cockleshell while mrs salmon performed the battle of borodino a savage cantata against the corsican upstart who had lately met with his russian reversesmr dobbin tried to hum it as he walked away and found he was hummingthe tune which amelia sedley sang on the stairs as she came down to dinner  he burst out laughing at himself for the truth is he could sing no better than an owl  it is to be understood as a matter of course that our young people being in parties of two and two made the most solemn promises to keep together during the evening and separated in ten minutes afterwards parties at vauxhall always did separate but twas only to meet again at suppertime when they could talk of their mutual adventures in the interval  what were the adventures of mr osborne and miss amelia that is a secret  but be sure of thisthey were perfectly happy and correct in their behaviour and as they had been in the habit of being together any time these fifteen years their teteatete offered no particular novelty  but when miss rebecca sharp and her stout companion lost themselves in a solitary walk in which there were not above five score more of couples similarly straying they both felt that the situation was extremely tender and critical and now or never was the moment miss sharp thought to provoke that declaration which was trembling on the timid lips of mr sedley  they had previously been to the panorama of moscow where a rude fellow treading on miss sharps foot caused her to fall back with a little shriek into the arms of mr sedley and this little incident increased the tenderness and confidence of that gentleman to such a degree that he told her several of his favourite indian stories over again for at least the sixth time  how i should like to see india said rebecca  should you said joseph with a most killing tenderness and was no doubt about to follow up this artful interrogatory by a question still more tender for he puffed and panted a great deal and rebeccas hand which was placed near his heart could count the feverish pulsations of that organ when oh provoking the bell rang for the fireworks and a great scuffling and running taking place these interesting lovers were obliged to follow in the stream of people  captain dobbin had some thoughts of joining the party at supper as in truth he found the vauxhall amusements not particularly livelybut he paraded twice before the box where the now united couples were met and nobody took any notice of him  covers were laid for four  the mated pairs were prattling away quite happily and dobbin knew he was as clean forgotten as if he had never existed in this world  i should only be de trop said the captain looking at them rather wistfully  id best go and talk to the hermitand so he strolled off out of the hum of men and noise and clatter of the banquet into the dark walk at the end of which lived that wellknown pasteboard solitary  it wasnt very good fun for dobbinand indeed to be alone at vauxhall i have found from my own experience to be one of the most dismal sports ever entered into by a bachelor  the two couples were perfectly happy then in their box where the most delightful and intimate conversation took place  jos was in his glory ordering about the waiters with great majesty  he made the salad and uncorked the champagne and carved the chickens and ate and drank the greater part of the refreshments on the tables finally he insisted upon having a bowl of rack punch everybody had rack punch at vauxhall waiter rack punch  that bowl of rack punch was the cause of all this history  and why not a bowl of rack punch as well as any other cause was not a bowl of prussic acid the cause of fair rosamonds retiring from the world was not a bowl of wine the cause of the demise of alexander the great or at least does not dr lempriere say soso did this bowl of rack punch influence the fates of all the principal characters in this novel without a hero which we are now relating  it influenced their life although most of them did not taste a drop of it  the young ladies did not drink it osborne did not like it and the consequence was that jos that fat gourmand drank up the whole contents of the bowl and the consequence of his drinking up the whole contents of the bowl was a liveliness which at first was astonishing and then became almost painful for he talked and laughed so loud as to bring scores of listeners round the box much to the confusion of the innocent party within it and volunteering to sing a song which he did in that maudlin high key peculiar to gentlemen in an inebriated state he almost drew away the audience who were gathered round the musicians in the gilt scollopshell and received from his hearers a great deal of applause  brayvo fat un said one angcore daniel lambert said another what a figure for the tightrope exclaimed another wag to the inexpressible alarm of the ladies and the great anger of mr osborne  for heavens sake jos let us get up and go cried that gentleman and the young women rose  stop my dearest diddlediddledarling shouted jos now as bold as a lion and clasping miss rebecca round the waist  rebecca started but she could not get away her hand  the laughter outside redoubled  jos continued to drink to make love and to sing and winking and waving his glass gracefully to his audience challenged all or any to come in and take a share of his punch  mr osborne was just on the point of knocking down a gentleman in topboots who proposed to take advantage of this invitation and a commotion seemed to be inevitable when by the greatest good luck a gentleman of the name of dobbin who had been walking about the gardens stepped up to the box  be off you fools said this gentlemanshouldering off a great number of the crowd who vanished presently before his cocked hat and fierce appearanceand he entered the box in a most agitated state  good heavens dobbin where have you been osborne said seizing the white cashmere shawl from his friends arm and huddling up amelia in itmake yourself useful and take charge of jos here whilst i take the ladies to the carriage  jos was for rising to interferebut a single push from osbornes finger sent him puffing back into his seat again and the lieutenant was enabled to remove the ladies in safety  jos kissed his hand to them as they retreated and hiccupped out bless you bless you then seizing captain dobbins hand and weeping in the most pitiful way he confided to that gentleman the secret of his loves  he adored that girl who had just gone out he had broken her heart he knew he had by his conduct he would marry her next morning at st georges hanover square hed knock up the archbishop of canterbury at lambeth he would by jove and have him in readiness and acting on this hint captain dobbin shrewdly induced him to leave the gardens and hasten to lambeth palace and when once out of the gates easily conveyed mr jos sedley into a hackneycoach which deposited him safely at his lodgings  george osborne conducted the girls home in safety and when the door was closed upon them and as he walked across russell square laughed so as to astonish the watchman  amelia looked very ruefully at her friend as they went up stairs and kissed her and went to bed without any more talking  he must propose tomorrow thought rebecca  he called me his souls darling four times he squeezed my hand in amelias presence  he must propose tomorrow and so thought amelia too and i dare say she thought of the dress she was to wear as bridesmaid and of the presents which she should make to her nice little sisterinlaw and of a subsequent ceremony in which she herself might play a principal part c and c and c and c  oh ignorant young creatures how little do you know the effect of rack punch what is the rack in the punch at night to the rack in the head of a morning to this truth i can vouch as a man there is no headache in the world like that caused by vauxhall punch through the lapse of twenty years i can remember the consequence of two glasses two wineglasses but two upon the honour of a gentleman and joseph sedley who had a liver complaint had swallowed at least a quart of the abominable mixture  that next morning which rebecca thought was to dawn upon her fortune found sedley groaning in agonies which the pen refuses to describe sodawater was not invented yet  small beerwill it be believedwas the only drink with which unhappy gentlemen soothed the fever of their previous nights potation  with this mild beverage before him george osborne found the excollector of boggley wollah groaning on the sofa at his lodgings  dobbin was already in the room goodnaturedly tending his patient of the night before  the two officers looking at the prostrate bacchanalian and askance at each other exchanged the most frightful sympathetic grins  even sedleys valet the most solemn and correct of gentlemen with the muteness and gravity of an undertaker could hardly keep his countenance in order as he looked at his unfortunate master  mr sedley was uncommon wild last night sir he whispered in confidence to osborne as the latter mounted the stair  he wanted to fight the ackneycoachman sir the capting was obliged to bring him upstairs in his harms like a babby a momentary smile flickered over mr brushs features as he spoke instantly however they relapsed into their usual unfathomable calm as he flung open the drawingroom door and announced mr hosbin  how are you sedley that young wag began after surveying his victim  no bones broke theres a hackneycoachman downstairs with a black eye and a tiedup head vowing hell have the law of you  what do you meanlaw sedley faintly asked  for thrashing him last nightdidnt he dobbin you hit out sir like molyneux  the watchman says he never saw a fellow go down so straight  ask dobbin  you did have a round with the coachman captain dobbin said and showed plenty of fight too  and that fellow with the white coat at vauxhall how jos drove at him how the women screamed by jove sir it did my heart good to see you i thought you civilians had no pluck but ill never get in your way when you are in your cups jos  i believe im very terrible when im roused ejaculated jos from the sofa and made a grimace so dreary and ludicrous that the captains politeness could restrain him no longer and he and osborne fired off a ringing volley of laughter  osborne pursued his advantage pitilessly  he thought jos a milksop he had been revolving in his mind the marriage question pending between jos and rebecca and was not over well pleased that a member of a family into which he george osborne of the th was going to marry should make a mesalliance with a little nobodya little upstart governess  you hit you poor old fellow said osborne you terrible why man you couldnt standyou made everybody laugh in the gardens though you were crying yourself  you were maudlin jos dont you remember singing a song  a what jos asked  a sentimental song and calling rosa rebecca whats her name amelias little friendyour dearest diddlediddledarling and this ruthless young fellow seizing hold of dobbins hand acted over the scene to the horror of the original performer and in spite of dobbins goodnatured entreaties to him to have mercy  why should i spare him osborne said to his friends remonstrances when they quitted the invalid leaving him under the hands of doctor gollop  what the deuce right has he to give himself his patronizing airs and make fools of us at vauxhall whos this little schoolgirl that is ogling and making love to him hang it the familys low enough already without her  a governess is all very well but id rather have a lady for my sisterinlaw im a liberal man but ive proper pride and know my own station let her know hers  and ill take down that great hectoring nabob and prevent him from being made a greater fool than he is  thats why i told him to look out lest she brought an action against him  i suppose you know best dobbin said though rather dubiously you always were a tory and your familys one of the oldest in england but  come and see the girls and make love to miss sharp yourself the lieutenant here interrupted his friend but captain dobbin declined to join osborne in his daily visit to the young ladies in russell square  as george walked down southampton row from holborn he laughed as he saw at the sedley mansion in two different stories two heads on the lookout  the fact is miss amelia in the drawingroom balcony was looking very eagerly towards the opposite side of the square where mr osborne dwelt on the watch for the lieutenant himself and miss sharp from her little bedroom on the second floor was in observation until mr josephs great form should heave in sight  sister anne is on the watchtower said he to amelia but theres nobody coming and laughing and enjoying the joke hugely he described in the most ludicrous terms to miss sedley the dismal condition of her brother  i think its very cruel of you to laugh george she said looking particularly unhappy but george only laughed the more at her piteous and discomfited mien persisted in thinking the joke a most diverting one and when miss sharp came downstairs bantered her with a great deal of liveliness upon the effect of her charms on the fat civilian  o miss sharp if you could but see him this morning he saidmoaning in his flowered dressinggownwrithing on his sofa if you could but have seen him lolling out his tongue to gollop the apothecary  see whom said miss sharp  whom o whom  captain dobbin of course to whom we were all so attentive by the way last night  we were very unkind to him emmy said blushing very much  ii quite forgot him  of course you did cried osborne still on the laugh  one cant be always thinking about dobbin you know amelia  can one miss sharp  except when he overset the glass of wine at dinner miss sharp said with a haughty air and a toss of the head i never gave the existence of captain dobbin one single moments consideration  very good miss sharp ill tell him osborne said and as he spoke miss sharp began to have a feeling of distrust and hatred towards this young officer which he was quite unconscious of having inspired  he is to make fun of me is he thought rebecca  has he been laughing about me to joseph  has he frightened him perhaps he wont comea film passed over her eyes and her heart beat quite quick  youre always joking said she smiling as innocently as she could joke away mr george theres nobody to defend me and george osborne as she walked awayand amelia looked reprovingly at himfelt some little manly compunction for having inflicted any unnecessary unkindness upon this helpless creature  my dearest amelia said he you are too goodtoo kind  you dont know the world  i do  and your little friend miss sharp must learn her station  dont you think jos will  upon my word my dear i dont know  he may or may not  im not his master  i only know he is a very foolish vain fellow and put my dear little girl into a very painful and awkward position last night  my dearest diddlediddledarling he was off laughing again and he did it so drolly that emmy laughed too  all that day jos never came  but amelia had no fear about this for the little schemer had actually sent away the page mr sambos aidedecamp to mr josephs lodgings to ask for some book he had promised and how he was and the reply through joss man mr brush was that his master was ill in bed and had just had the doctor with him  he must come tomorrow she thought but she never had the courage to speak a word on the subject to rebecca nor did that young woman herself allude to it in any way during the whole evening after the night at vauxhall  the next day however as the two young ladies sate on the sofa pretending to work or to write letters or to read novels sambo came into the room with his usual engaging grin with a packet under his arm and a note on a tray  note from mr jos miss says sambo  how amelia trembled as she opened it  so it ran  dear ameliai send you the orphan of the forest i was too ill to come yesterday  i leave town today for cheltenham  pray excuse me if you can to the amiable miss sharp for my conduct at vauxhall and entreat her to pardon and forget every word i may have uttered when excited by that fatal supper  as soon as i have recovered for my health is very much shaken i shall go to scotland for some months and am  truly yours jos sedley  it was the deathwarrant  all was over  amelia did not dare to look at rebeccas pale face and burning eyes but she dropt the letter into her friends lap and got up and went upstairs to her room and cried her little heart out  blenkinsop the housekeeper there sought her presently with consolation on whose shoulder amelia wept confidentially and relieved herself a good deal  dont take on miss  i didnt like to tell you but none of us in the house have liked her except at fust  i sor her with my own eyes reading your mas letters  pinner says shes always about your trinketbox and drawers and everybodys drawers and shes sure shes put your white ribbing into her box  i gave it her i gave it her amelia said  but this did not alter mrs blenkinsops opinion of miss sharp  i dont trust them governesses pinner she remarked to the maid they give themselves the hairs and hupstarts of ladies and their wages is no better than you nor me  it now became clear to every soul in the house except poor amelia that rebecca should take her departure and high and low always with the one exception agreed that that event should take place as speedily as possible our good child ransacked all her drawers cupboards reticules and gimcrack boxespassed in review all her gowns fichus tags bobbins laces silk stockings and fallalsselecting this thing and that and the other to make a little heap for rebecca  and going to her papa that generous british merchant who had promised to give her as many guineas as she was years oldshe begged the old gentleman to give the money to dear rebecca who must want it while she lacked for nothing  she even made george osborne contribute and nothing loth for he was as freehanded a young fellow as any in the army he went to bond street and bought the best hat and spenser that money could buy  thats georges present to you rebecca dear said amelia quite proud of the bandbox conveying these gifts  what a taste he has theres nobody like him  nobody rebecca answered  how thankful i am to him she was thinking in her heart it was george osborne who prevented my marriageand she loved george osborne accordingly  she made her preparations for departure with great equanimity and accepted all the kind little amelias presents after just the proper degree of hesitation and reluctance  she vowed eternal gratitude to mrs sedley of course but did not intrude herself upon that good lady too much who was embarrassed and evidently wishing to avoid her  she kissed mr sedleys hand when he presented her with the purse and asked permission to consider him for the future as her kind kind friend and protector  her behaviour was so affecting that he was going to write her a cheque for twenty pounds more but he restrained his feelings the carriage was in waiting to take him to dinner so he tripped away with a god bless you my dear always come here when you come to town you knowdrive to the mansion house james  finally came the parting with miss amelia over which picture i intend to throw a veil  but after a scene in which one person was in earnest and the other a perfect performerafter the tenderest caresses the most pathetic tears the smellingbottle and some of the very best feelings of the heart had been called into requisitionrebecca and amelia parted the former vowing to love her friend for ever and ever and ever    chapter vii  crawley of queens crawley  among the most respected of the names beginning in c which the courtguide contained in the year 18 was that of crawley sir pitt baronet great gaunt street and queens crawley hants  this honourable name had figured constantly also in the parliamentary list for many years in conjunction with that of a number of other worthy gentlemen who sat in turns for the borough  it is related with regard to the borough of queens crawley that queen elizabeth in one of her progresses stopping at crawley to breakfast was so delighted with some remarkably fine hampshire beer which was then presented to her by the crawley of the day a handsome gentleman with a trim beard and a good leg that she forthwith erected crawley into a borough to send two members to parliament and the place from the day of that illustrious visit took the name of queens crawley which it holds up to the present moment  and though by the lapse of time and those mutations which age produces in empires cities and boroughs queens crawley was no longer so populous a place as it had been in queen besss timenay was come down to that condition of borough which used to be denominated rottenyet as sir pitt crawley would say with perfect justice in his elegant way rotten be hangedit produces me a good fifteen hundred a year  sir pitt crawley named after the great commoner was the son of walpole crawley first baronet of the tape and sealingwax office in the reign of george ii when he was impeached for peculation as were a great number of other honest gentlemen of those days and walpole crawley was as need scarcely be said son of john churchill crawley named after the celebrated military commander of the reign of queen anne  the family tree which hangs up at queens crawley furthermore mentions charles stuart afterwards called barebones crawley son of the crawley of james the firsts time and finally queen elizabeths crawley who is represented as the foreground of the picture in his forked beard and armour  out of his waistcoat as usual grows a tree on the main branches of which the above illustrious names are inscribed  close by the name of sir pitt crawley baronet the subject of the present memoir are written that of his brother the reverend bute crawley the great commoner was in disgrace when the reverend gentleman was born rector of crawleycumsnailby and of various other male and female members of the crawley family  sir pitt was first married to grizzel sixth daughter of mungo binkie lord binkie and cousin in consequence of mr dundas  she brought him two sons pitt named not so much after his father as after the heavenborn minister and rawdon crawley from the prince of waless friend whom his majesty george iv forgot so completely many years after her ladyships demise sir pitt led to the altar rosa daughter of mr g dawson of mudbury by whom he had two daughters for whose benefit miss rebecca sharp was now engaged as governess  it will be seen that the young lady was come into a family of very genteel connexions and was about to move in a much more distinguished circle than that humble one which she had just quitted in russell square  she had received her orders to join her pupils in a note which was written upon an old envelope and which contained the following words  sir pitt crawley begs miss sharp and baggidge may be hear on tuesday as i leaf for queens crawley tomorrow morning erly  great gaunt street  rebecca had never seen a baronet as far as she knew and as soon as she had taken leave of amelia and counted the guineas which goodnatured mr sedley had put into a purse for her and as soon as she had done wiping her eyes with her handkerchief which operation she concluded the very moment the carriage had turned the corner of the street she began to depict in her own mind what a baronet must be i wonder does he wear a star thought she or is it only lords that wear stars but he will be very handsomely dressed in a court suit with ruffles and his hair a little powdered like mr wroughton at covent garden  i suppose he will be awfully proud and that i shall be treated most contemptuously  still i must bear my hard lot as well as i canat least i shall be amongst gentlefolks and not with vulgar city people and she fell to thinking of her russell square friends with that very same philosophical bitterness with which in a certain apologue the fox is represented as speaking of the grapes  having passed through gaunt square into great gaunt street the carriage at length stopped at a tall gloomy house between two other tall gloomy houses each with a hatchment over the middle drawingroom window as is the custom of houses in great gaunt street in which gloomy locality death seems to reign perpetual  the shutters of the firstfloor windows of sir pitts mansion were closedthose of the diningroom were partially open and the blinds neatly covered up in old newspapers  john the groom who had driven the carriage alone did not care to descend to ring the bell and so prayed a passing milkboy to perform that office for him  when the bell was rung a head appeared between the interstices of the diningroom shutters and the door was opened by a man in drab breeches and gaiters with a dirty old coat a foul old neckcloth lashed round his bristly neck a shining bald head a leering red face a pair of twinkling grey eyes and a mouth perpetually on the grin  this sir pitt crawleys says john from the box  ees says the man at the door with a nod  hand down these ere trunks then said john  hand n down yourself said the porter  dont you see i cant leave my hosses come bear a hand my fine feller and miss will give you some beer said john with a horselaugh for he was no longer respectful to miss sharp as her connexion with the family was broken off and as she had given nothing to the servants on coming away  the baldheaded man taking his hands out of his breeches pockets advanced on this summons and throwing miss sharps trunk over his shoulder carried it into the house  take this basket and shawl if you please and open the door said miss sharp and descended from the carriage in much indignation  i shall write to mr sedley and inform him of your conduct said she to the groom  dont replied that functionary  i hope youve forgot nothink miss melias gowndshave you got themas the ladys maid was to have ad i hope theyll fit you shut the door jim youll get no good out of er continued john pointing with his thumb towards miss sharp a bad lot i tell you a bad lot and so saying mr sedleys groom drove away  the truth is he was attached to the ladys maid in question and indignant that she should have been robbed of her perquisites  on entering the diningroom by the orders of the individual in gaiters rebecca found that apartment not more cheerful than such rooms usually are when genteel families are out of town  the faithful chambers seem as it were to mourn the absence of their masters  the turkey carpet has rolled itself up and retired sulkily under the sideboard the pictures have hidden their faces behind old sheets of brown paper the ceiling lamp is muffled up in a dismal sack of brown holland the windowcurtains have disappeared under all sorts of shabby envelopes the marble bust of sir walpole crawley is looking from its black corner at the bare boards and the oiled fireirons and the empty cardracks over the mantelpiece the cellaret has lurked away behind the carpet the chairs are turned up heads and tails along the walls and in the dark corner opposite the statue is an oldfashioned crabbed knifebox locked and sitting on a dumb waiter  two kitchen chairs and a round table and an attenuated old poker and tongs were however gathered round the fireplace as was a saucepan over a feeble sputtering fire  there was a bit of cheese and bread and a tin candlestick on the table and a little black porter in a pintpot  had your dinner i suppose it is not too warm for you like a drop of beer  where is sir pitt crawley said miss sharp majestically  he he im sir pitt crawley  reklect you owe me a pint for bringing down your luggage  he he ask tinker if i aynt  mrs tinker miss sharp miss governess mrs charwoman  ho ho  the lady addressed as mrs tinker at this moment made her appearance with a pipe and a paper of tobacco for which she had been despatched a minute before miss sharps arrival and she handed the articles over to sir pitt who had taken his seat by the fire  wheres the farden said he  i gave you three halfpence wheres the change old tinker  there replied mrs tinker flinging down the coin its only baronets as cares about farthings  a farthing a day is seven shillings a year answered the mp seven shillings a year is the interest of seven guineas  take care of your farthings old tinker and your guineas will come quite natral  you may be sure its sir pitt crawley young woman said mrs tinker surlily because he looks to his farthings  youll know him better afore long  and like me none the worse miss sharp said the old gentleman with an air almost of politeness  i must be just before im generous  he never gave away a farthing in his life growled tinker  never and never will its against my principle  go and get another chair from the kitchen tinker if you want to sit down and then well have a bit of supper  presently the baronet plunged a fork into the saucepan on the fire and withdrew from the pot a piece of tripe and an onion which he divided into pretty equal portions and of which he partook with mrs tinker you see miss sharp when im not here tinkers on board wages when im in town she dines with the family haw haw im glad miss sharps not hungry aint you tink and they fell to upon their frugal supper  after supper sir pitt crawley began to smoke his pipe and when it became quite dark he lighted the rushlight in the tin candlestick and producing from an interminable pocket a huge mass of papers began reading them and putting them in order  im here on law business my dear and thats how it happens that i shall have the pleasure of such a pretty travelling companion tomorrow  hes always at law business said mrs tinker taking up the pot of porter  drink and drink about said the baronet  yes my dear tinker is quite right ive lost and won more lawsuits than any man in england look here at crawley bart v snaffle  ill throw him over or my names not pitt crawley  podder and another versus crawley bart overseers of snaily parish against crawley bart they cant prove its common ill defy em the lands mine it no more belongs to the parish than it does to you or tinker here  ill beat em if it cost me a thousand guineas look over the papers you may if you like my dear do you write a good hand ill make you useful when were at queens crawley depend on it miss sharp now the dowagers dead i want some one  she was as bad as he said tinker  she took the law of every one of her tradesmen and turned away fortyeight footmen in four year  she was closevery close said the baronet simply but she was a valyble woman to me and saved me a stewardand in this confidential strain and much to the amusement of the newcomer the conversation continued for a considerable time  whatever sir pitt crawleys qualities might be good or bad he did not make the least disguise of them  he talked of himself incessantly sometimes in the coarsest and vulgarest hampshire accent sometimes adopting the tone of a man of the world  and so with injunctions to miss sharp to be ready at five in the morning he bade her good night youll sleep with tinker tonight he said its a big bed and theres room for two lady crawley died in it  good night  sir pitt went off after this benediction and the solemn tinker rushlight in hand led the way up the great bleak stone stairs past the great dreary drawingroom doors with the handles muffled up in paper into the great front bedroom where lady crawley had slept her last  the bed and chamber were so funereal and gloomy you might have fancied not only that lady crawley died in the room but that her ghost inhabited it  rebecca sprang about the apartment however with the greatest liveliness and had peeped into the huge wardrobes and the closets and the cupboards and tried the drawers which were locked and examined the dreary pictures and toilette appointments while the old charwoman was saying her prayers  i shouldnt like to sleep in this yeer bed without a good conscience miss said the old woman  theres room for us and a halfdozen of ghosts in it says rebecca  tell me all about lady crawley and sir pitt crawley and everybody my dear mrs tinker  but old tinker was not to be pumped by this little crossquestioner and signifying to her that bed was a place for sleeping not conversation set up in her corner of the bed such a snore as only the nose of innocence can produce  rebecca lay awake for a long long time thinking of the morrow and of the new world into which she was going and of her chances of success there  the rushlight flickered in the basin  the mantelpiece cast up a great black shadow over half of a mouldy old sampler which her defunct ladyship had worked no doubt and over two little family pictures of young lads one in a college gown and the other in a red jacket like a soldier when she went to sleep rebecca chose that one to dream about  at four oclock on such a roseate summers morning as even made great gaunt street look cheerful the faithful tinker having wakened her bedfellow and bid her prepare for departure unbarred and unbolted the great hall door the clanging and clapping whereof startled the sleeping echoes in the street and taking her way into oxford street summoned a coach from a stand there  it is needless to particularize the number of the vehicle or to state that the driver was stationed thus early in the neighbourhood of swallow street in hopes that some young buck reeling homeward from the tavern might need the aid of his vehicle and pay him with the generosity of intoxication  it is likewise needless to say that the driver if he had any such hopes as those above stated was grossly disappointed and that the worthy baronet whom he drove to the city did not give him one single penny more than his fare  it was in vain that jehu appealed and stormed that he flung down miss sharps bandboxes in the gutter at the necks and swore he would take the law of his fare  youd better not said one of the ostlers its sir pitt crawley  so it is joe cried the baronet approvingly and id like to see the man can do me  so should oi said joe grinning sulkily and mounting the baronets baggage on the roof of the coach  keep the box for me leader exclaims the member of parliament to the coachman who replied yes sir pitt with a touch of his hat and rage in his soul for he had promised the box to a young gentleman from cambridge who would have given a crown to a certainty and miss sharp was accommodated with a back seat inside the carriage which might be said to be carrying her into the wide world  how the young man from cambridge sulkily put his five greatcoats in front but was reconciled when little miss sharp was made to quit the carriage and mount up beside himwhen he covered her up in one of his benjamins and became perfectly goodhumouredhow the asthmatic gentleman the prim lady who declared upon her sacred honour she had never travelled in a public carriage before there is always such a lady in a coachalas was for the coaches where are they and the fat widow with the brandybottle took their places insidehow the porter asked them all for money and got sixpence from the gentleman and five greasy halfpence from the fat widowand how the carriage at length drove awaynow threading the dark lanes of aldersgate anon clattering by the blue cupola of st pauls jingling

marketgardens of knightsbridgehow turnhamgreen brentwood bagshot were passedneed not be told here but the writer of these pages who has pursued in former days and in the same bright weather the same remarkable journey cannot but think of it with a sweet and tender regret  where is the road now and its merry incidents of life is there no chelsea or greenwich for the old honest pimplenosed coachmen  i wonder where are they those good fellows is old weller alive or dead and the waiters yea and the inns at which they waited and the cold rounds of beef inside and the stunted ostler with his blue

miss rebecca sharp speeds there    chapter viii  private and confidential  miss rebecca sharp to miss amelia sedley russell square london freepitt crawley  my dearest sweetest amelia  with what mingled joy and sorrow do i take up the pen to write to my dearest friend  oh what a change between today and yesterday now i am friendless and alone yesterday i was at home in the sweet company of a sister whom i shall ever ever cherish  i will not tell you in what tears and sadness i passed the fatal night in which i separated from you  you went on tuesday to joy and happiness with your mother and your devoted young soldier by your side and i thought of you all night dancing at the perkinss the prettiest i am sure of all the young ladies at the ball  i was brought by the groom in the old carriage to sir pitt crawleys town house where after john the groom had behaved most rudely and insolently to me alas twas safe to insult poverty and misfortune i was given over to sir ps care and made to pass the night in an old gloomy bed and by the side of a horrid gloomy old charwoman who keeps the house  i did not sleep one single wink the whole night  sir pitt is not what we silly girls when we used to read cecilia at chiswick imagined a baronet must have been  anything indeed less like lord orville cannot be imagined  fancy an old stumpy short vulgar and very dirty man in old clothes and shabby old gaiters who smokes a horrid pipe and cooks his own horrid supper in a saucepan he speaks with a country accent and swore a great deal at the old charwoman at the hackney coachman who drove us to the inn where the coach went from and on which i made the journey outside for the greater part of the way  i was awakened at daybreak by the charwoman and having arrived at the inn was at first placed inside the coach  but when we got to a place called leakington where the rain began to fall very heavilywill you believe iti was forced to come outside for sir pitt is a proprietor of the coach and as a passenger came at mudbury who wanted an inside place i was obliged to go outside in the rain where however a young gentleman from cambridge college sheltered me very kindly in one of his several great coats  this gentleman and the guard seemed to know sir pitt very well and laughed at him a great deal  they both agreed in calling him an old screw which means a very stingy avaricious person  he never gives any money to anybody they said and this meanness i hate and the young gentleman made me remark that we drove very slow for the last two stages on the road because sir pitt was on the box and because he is proprietor of the horses for this part of the journey  but wont i flog em on to squashmore when i take the ribbons said the young cantab  and sarve em right master jack said the guard  when i comprehended the meaning of this phrase and that master jack intended to drive the rest of the way and revenge himself on sir pitts horses of course i laughed too  a carriage and four splendid horses covered with armorial bearings however awaited us at mudbury four miles from queens crawley and we made our entrance to the baronets park in state  there is a fine avenue of a mile long leading to the house and the woman at the lodgegate over the pillars of which are a serpent and a dove the supporters of the crawley arms made us a number of curtsies as she flung open the old iron carved doors which are something like those at odious chiswick  theres an avenue said sir pitt a mile long theres six thousand pound of timber in them there trees  do you call that nothing he pronounced avenueevenue and nothingnothink so droll and he had a mr hodson his hind from mudbury into the carriage with him and they talked about distraining and selling up and draining and subsoiling and a great deal about tenants and farmingmuch more than i could understand  sam miles had been caught poaching and peter bailey had gone to the workhouse at last serve him right said sir pitt him and his family has been cheating me on that farm these hundred and fifty years some old tenant i suppose who could not pay his rent sir pitt might have said he and his family to be sure but rich baronets do not need to be careful about grammar as poor governesses must be  as we passed i remarked a beautiful churchspire rising above some old elms in the park and before them in the midst of a lawn and some outhouses an old red house with tall chimneys covered with ivy and the windows shining in the sun  is that your church sir i said  yes hang it said sir pitt only he used dear a much wickeder word hows buty hodson butys my brother bute my dearmy brother the parson  buty and the beast i call him ha ha  hodson laughed too and then looking more grave and nodding his head said im afraid hes better sir pitt  he was out on his pony yesterday looking at our corn  looking after his tithes hangun only he used the same wicked word will brandy and water never kill him hes as tough as old whatdyecallumold methusalem  mr hodson laughed again  the young men is home from college theyve whopped john scroggins till hes well nigh dead  whop my second keeper roared out sir pitt  he was on the parsons ground sir replied mr hodson and sir pitt in a fury swore that if he ever caught em poaching on his ground hed transport em by the lord he would  however he said ive sold the presentation of the living hodson none of that breed shall get it i warnt and mr hodson said he was quite right and i have no doubt from this that the two brothers are at varianceas brothers often are and sisters too  dont you remember the two miss scratchleys at chiswick how they used always to fight and quarreland mary box how she was always thumping louisa  presently seeing two little boys gathering sticks in the wood mr hodson jumped out of the carriage at sir pitts order and rushed upon them with his whip  pitch into em hodson roared the baronet flog their little souls out and bring em up to the house the vagabonds ill commit em as sure as my names pitt and presently we heard mr hodsons whip cracking on the shoulders of the poor little blubbering wretches and sir pitt seeing that the malefactors were in custody drove on to the hall  all the servants were ready to meet us and     here my dear i was interrupted last night by a dreadful thumping at my door and who do you think it was sir pitt crawley in his nightcap and dressinggown such a figure as i shrank away from such a visitor he came forward and seized my candle  no candles after eleven oclock miss becky said he  go to bed in the dark you pretty little hussy that is what he called me and unless you wish me to come for the candle every night mind and be in bed at eleven and with this he and mr horrocks the butler went off laughing  you may be sure i shall not encourage any more of their visits  they let loose two immense bloodhounds at night which all last night were yelling and howling at the moon  i call the dog gorer said sir pitt hes killed a man that dog has and is master of a bull and the mother i used to call flora but now i calls her aroarer for shes too old to bite  haw haw  before the house of queens crawley which is an odious oldfashioned red brick mansion with tall chimneys and gables of the style of queen bess there is a terrace flanked by the family dove and serpent and on which the great halldoor opens  and oh my dear the great hall i am sure is as big and as glum as the great hall in the dear castle of udolpho  it has a large fireplace in which we might put half miss pinkertons school and the grate is big enough to roast an ox at the very least  round the room hang i dont know how many generations of crawleys some with beards and ruffs some with huge wigs and toes turned out some dressed in long straight stays and gowns that look as stiff as towers and some with long ringlets and oh my dear scarcely any stays at all  at one end of the hall is the great staircase all in black oak as dismal as may be and on either side are tall doors with stags heads over them leading to the billiardroom and the library and the great yellow saloon and the morningrooms  i think there are at least twenty bedrooms on the first floor one of them has the bed in which queen elizabeth slept and i have been taken by my new pupils through all these fine apartments this morning  they are not rendered less gloomy i promise you by having the shutters always shut and there is scarce one of the apartments but when the light was let into it i expected to see a ghost in the room  we have a schoolroom on the second floor with my bedroom leading into it on one side and that of the young ladies on the other  then there are mr pitts apartmentsmr crawley he is calledthe eldest son and mr rawdon crawleys roomshe is an officer like somebody and away with his regiment  there is no want of room i assure you  you might lodge all the people in russell square in the house i think and have space to spare  half an hour after our arrival the great dinnerbell was rung and i came down with my two pupils they are very thin insignificant little chits of ten and eight years old  i came down in your dear muslin gown about which that odious mrs pinner was so rude because you gave it me for i am to be treated as one of the family except on company days when the young ladies and i are to dine upstairs  well the great dinnerbell rang and we all assembled in the little drawingroom where my lady crawley sits  she is the second lady crawley and mother of the young ladies  she was an ironmongers daughter and her marriage was thought a great match  she looks as if she had been handsome once and her eyes are always weeping for the loss of her beauty  she is pale and meagre and highshouldered and has not a word to say for herself evidently  her stepson mr crawley was likewise in the room  he was in full dress as pompous as an undertaker  he is pale thin ugly silent he has thin legs no chest haycoloured whiskers and strawcoloured hair  he is the very picture of his sainted mother over the mantelpiecegriselda of the noble house of binkie  this is the new governess mr crawley said lady crawley coming forward and taking my hand  miss sharp  o said mr crawley and pushed his head once forward and began again to read a great pamphlet with which he was busy  i hope you will be kind to my girls said lady crawley with her pink eyes always full of tears  law ma of course she will said the eldest and i saw at a glance that i need not be afraid of that woman my lady is served says the butler in black in an immense white shirtfrill that looked as if it had been one of the queen elizabeths ruffs depicted in the hall and so taking mr crawleys arm she led the way to the diningroom whither i followed with my little pupils in each hand  sir pitt was already in the room with a silver jug  he had just been to the cellar and was in full dress too that is he had taken his gaiters off and showed his little dumpy legs in black worsted stockings  the sideboard was covered with glistening old plateold cups both gold and silver old salvers and cruetstands like rundell and bridges shop  everything on the table was in silver too and two footmen with red hair and canarycoloured liveries stood on either side of the sideboard  mr crawley said a long grace and sir pitt said amen and the great silver dishcovers were removed  what have we for dinner betsy said the baronet  mutton broth i believe sir pitt answered lady crawley  mouton aux navets added the butler gravely pronounce if you please moutongonavvy and the soup is potage de mouton a lecossaise  the sidedishes contain pommes de terre au naturel and choufleur a leau  muttons mutton said the baronet and a devilish good thing what ship was it horrocks and when did you kill  one of the blackfaced scotch sir pitt we killed on thursday  who took any  steel of mudbury took the saddle and two legs sir pitt but he says the last was too young and confounded woolly sir pitt  will you take some potage miss ahmiss blunt said mr crawley  capital scotch broth my dear said sir pitt though they call it by a french name  i believe it is the custom sir in decent society said mr crawley haughtily to call the dish as i have called it and it was served to us on silver soup plates by the footmen in the canary coats with the mouton aux navets  then ale and water were brought and served to us young ladies in wineglasses  i am not a judge of ale but i can say with a clear conscience i prefer water  while we were enjoying our repast sir pitt took occasion to ask what had become of the shoulders of the mutton  i believe they were eaten in the servants hall said my lady humbly  they was my lady said horrocks and precious little else we get there neither  sir pitt burst into a horselaugh and continued his conversation with mr horrocks  that there little black pig of the kent sows breed must be uncommon fat now  its not quite busting sir pitt said the butler with the gravest air at which sir pitt and with him the young ladies this time began to laugh violently  miss crawley miss rose crawley said mr crawley your laughter strikes me as being exceedingly out of place  never mind my lord said the baronet well try the porker on saturday  kill un on saturday morning john horrocks  miss sharp adores pork dont you miss sharp  and i think this is all the conversation that i remember at dinner when the repast was concluded a jug of hot water was placed before sir pitt with a casebottle containing i believe rum  mr horrocks served myself and my pupils with three little glasses of wine and a bumper was poured out for my lady  when we retired she took from her workdrawer an enormous interminable piece of knitting the young ladies began to play at cribbage with a dirty pack of cards  we had but one candle lighted but it was in a magnificent old silver candlestick and after a very few questions from my lady i had my choice of amusement between a volume of sermons and a pamphlet on the cornlaws which mr crawley had been reading before dinner  so we sat for an hour until steps were heard  put away the cards girls cried my lady in a great tremor put down mr crawleys books miss sharp and these orders had been scarcely obeyed when mr crawley entered the room  we will resume yesterdays discourse young ladies said he and you shall each read a page by turns so that miss amiss short may have an opportunity of hearing you and the poor girls began to spell a long dismal sermon delivered at bethesda chapel liverpool on behalf of the mission for the chickasaw indians was it not a charming evening  at ten the servants were told to call sir pitt and the household to prayers  sir pitt came in first very much flushed and rather unsteady in his gait and after him the butler the canaries mr crawleys man three other men smelling very much of the stable and four women one of whom i remarked was very much overdressed and who flung me a look of great scorn as she plumped down on her knees  after mr crawley had done haranguing and expounding we received our candles and then we went to bed and then i was disturbed in my writing as i have described to my dearest sweetest amelia  good night  a thousand thousand thousand kisses  saturdaythis morning at five i heard the shrieking of the little black pig  rose and violet introduced me to it yesterday and to the stables and to the kennel and to the gardener who was picking fruit to send to market and from whom they begged hard a bunch of hothouse grapes but he said that sir pitt had numbered every man jack of them and it would be as much as his place was worth to give any away the darling girls caught a colt in a paddock and asked me if i would ride and began to ride themselves when the groom coming with horrid oaths drove them away  lady crawley is always knitting the worsted  sir pitt is always tipsy every night and i believe sits with horrocks the butler mr crawley always reads sermons in the evening and in the morning is locked up in his study or else rides to mudbury on county business or to squashmore where he preaches on wednesdays and fridays to the tenants there  a hundred thousand grateful loves to your dear papa and mamma  is your poor brother recovered of his rackpunch oh dear oh dear how men should beware of wicked punch  ever and ever thine own rebecca  everything considered i think it is quite as well for our dear amelia sedley in russell square that miss sharp and she are parted  rebecca is a droll funny creature to be sure and those descriptions of the poor lady weeping for the loss of her beauty and the gentleman with haycoloured whiskers and strawcoloured hair are very smart doubtless and show a great knowledge of the world  that she might when on her knees have been thinking of something better than miss horrockss ribbons has possibly struck both of us  but my kind reader will please to remember that this history has vanity fair for a title and that vanity fair is a very vain wicked foolish place full of all sorts of humbugs and falsenesses and pretensions  and while the moralist who is holding forth on the cover  an accurate portrait of your humble servant professes to wear neither gown nor bands but only the very same longeared livery in which his congregation is arrayed yet look you one is bound to speak the truth as far as one knows it whether one mounts a cap and bells or a shovel hat and a deal of disagreeable matter must come out in the course of such an undertaking  i have heard a brother of the storytelling trade at naples preaching to a pack of goodfornothing honest lazy fellows by the seashore work himself up into such a rage and passion with some of the villains whose wicked deeds he was describing and inventing that the audience could not resist it and they and the poet together would burst out into a roar of oaths and execrations against the fictitious monster of the tale so that the hat went round and the bajocchi tumbled into it in the midst of a perfect storm of sympathy  at the little paris theatres on the other hand you will not only hear the people yelling out ah gredin ah monstre and cursing the tyrant of the play from the boxes but the actors themselves positively refuse to play the wicked parts such as those of infames anglais brutal cossacks and what not and prefer to appear at a smaller salary in their real characters as loyal frenchmen  i set the two stories one against the other so that you may see that it is not from mere mercenary motives that the present performer is desirous to show up and trounce his villains but because he has a sincere hatred of them which he cannot keep down and which must find a vent in suitable abuse and bad language  i warn my kyind friends then that i am going to tell a story of harrowing villainy and complicatedbut as i trust intensely interestingcrime  my rascals are no milkandwater rascals i promise you  when we come to the proper places we wont spare fine languageno no but when we are going over the quiet country we must perforce be calm  a tempest in a slopbasin is absurd  we will reserve that sort of thing for the mighty ocean and the lonely midnight  the present chapter is very mild  othersbut we will not anticipate those  and as we bring our characters forward i will ask leave as a man and a brother not only to introduce them but occasionally to step down from the platform and talk about them if they are good and kindly to love them and shake them by the hand if they are silly to laugh at them confidentially in the readers sleeve if they are wicked and heartless to abuse them in the strongest terms which politeness admits of  otherwise you might fancy it was i who was sneering at the practice of devotion which miss sharp finds so ridiculous that it was i who laughed goodhumouredly at the reeling old silenus of a baronetwhereas the laughter comes from one who has no reverence except for prosperity and no eye for anything beyond success such people there are living and flourishing in the worldfaithless hopeless charityless let us have at them dear friends with might and main some there are and very successful too mere quacks and fools and it was to combat and expose such as those no doubt that laughter was made    chapter ix  family portraits  sir pitt crawley was a philosopher with a taste for what is called low life  his first marriage with the daughter of the noble binkie had been made under the auspices of his parents and as he often told lady crawley in her lifetime she was such a confounded quarrelsome highbred jade that when she died he was hanged if he would ever take another of her sort at her ladyships demise he kept his promise and selected for a second wife miss rose dawson daughter of mr john thomas dawson ironmonger of mudbury what a happy woman was rose to be my lady crawley  let us set down the items of her happiness  in the first place she gave up peter butt a young man who kept company with her and in consequence of his disappointment in love took to smuggling poaching and a thousand other bad courses  then she quarrelled as in duty bound with all the friends and intimates of her youth who of course could not be received by my lady at queens crawleynor did she find in her new rank and abode any persons who were willing to welcome her who ever did sir huddleston fuddleston had three daughters who all hoped to be lady crawley  sir giles wapshots family were insulted that one of the wapshot girls had not the preference in the marriage and the remaining baronets of the county were indignant at their comrades misalliance  never mind the commoners whom we will leave to grumble anonymously  sir pitt did not care as he said a brass farden for any one of them he had his pretty rose and what more need a man require than to please himself so he used to get drunk every night to beat his pretty rose sometimes to leave her in hampshire when he went to london for the parliamentary session without a single friend in the wide world  even mrs bute crawley the rectors wife refused to visit her as she said she would never give the pas to a tradesmans daughter  as the only endowments with which nature had gifted lady crawley were those of pink cheeks and a white skin and as she had no sort of character nor talents nor opinions nor occupations nor amusements nor that vigour of soul and ferocity of temper which often falls to the lot of entirely foolish women her hold upon sir pitts affections was not very great  her roses faded out of her cheeks and the pretty freshness left her figure after the birth of a couple of children and she became a mere machine in her husbands house of no more use than the late lady crawleys grand piano being a lightcomplexioned woman she wore light clothes as most blondes will and appeared in preference in draggled seagreen or slatternly skyblue  she worked that worsted day and night or other pieces like it  she had counterpanes in the course of a few years to all the beds in crawley she had a small flowergarden for which she had rather an affection but beyond this no other like or disliking  when her husband was rude to her she was apathetic whenever he struck her she cried  she had not character enough to take to drinking and moaned about slipshod and in curlpapers all day  o vanity fairvanity fair this might have been but for you a cheery lasspeter butt and rose a happy man and wife in a snug farm with a hearty family and an honest portion of pleasures cares hopes and strugglesbut a title and a coach and four are toys more precious than happiness in vanity fair and if harry the eighth or bluebeard were alive now and wanted a tenth wife do you suppose he could not get the prettiest girl that shall be presented this season  the languid dulness of their mamma did not as it may be supposed awaken much affection in her little daughters but they were very happy in the servants hall and in the stables and the scotch gardener having luckily a good wife and some good children they got a little wholesome society and instruction in his lodge which was the only education bestowed upon them until miss sharp came  her engagement was owing to the remonstrances of mr pitt crawley the only friend or protector lady crawley ever had and the only person besides her children for whom she entertained a little feeble attachment  mr pitt took after the noble binkies from whom he was descended and was a very polite and proper gentleman  when he grew to mans estate and came back from christchurch he began to reform the slackened discipline of the hall in spite of his father who stood in awe of him  he was a man of such rigid refinement that he would have starved rather than have dined without a white neckcloth  once when just from college and when horrocks the butler brought him a letter without placing it previously on a tray he gave that domestic a look and administered to him a speech so cutting that horrocks ever after trembled before him the whole household bowed to him lady crawleys curlpapers came off earlier when he was at home sir pitts muddy gaiters disappeared and if that incorrigible old man still adhered to other old habits he never fuddled himself with rumandwater in his sons presence and only talked to his servants in a very reserved and polite manner and those persons remarked that sir pitt never swore at lady crawley while his son was in the room  it was he who taught the butler to say my lady is served and who insisted on handing her ladyship in to dinner  he seldom spoke to her but when he did it was with the most powerful respect and he never let her quit the apartment without rising in the most stately manner to open the door and making an elegant bow at her egress  at eton he was called miss crawley and there i am sorry to say his younger brother rawdon used to lick him violently  but though his parts were not brilliant he made up for his lack of talent by meritorious industry and was never known during eight years at school to be subject to that punishment which it is generally thought none but a cherub can escape  at college his career was of course highly creditable and here he prepared himself for public life into which he was to be introduced by the patronage of his grandfather lord binkie by studying the ancient and modern orators with great assiduity and by speaking unceasingly at the debating societies  but though he had a fine flux of words and delivered his little voice with great pomposity and pleasure to himself and never advanced any sentiment or opinion which was not perfectly trite and stale and supported by a latin quotation yet he failed somehow in spite of a mediocrity which ought to have insured any man a success  he did not even get the prize poem which all his friends said he was sure of  after leaving college he became private secretary to lord binkie and was then appointed attache to the legation at pumpernickel which post he filled with perfect honour and brought home despatches consisting of strasburg pie to the foreign minister of the day  after remaining ten years attache several years after the lamented lord binkies demise and finding the advancement slow he at length gave up the diplomatic service in some disgust and began to turn country gentleman  he wrote a pamphlet on malt on returning to england for he was an ambitious man and always liked to be before the public and took a strong part in the negro emancipation question  then he became a friend of mr wilberforces whose politics he admired and had that famous correspondence with the reverend silas hornblower on the ashantee mission  he was in london if not for the parliament session at least in may for the religious meetings  in the country he was a magistrate and an active visitor and speaker among those destitute of religious instruction  he was said to be paying his addresses to lady jane sheepshanks lord southdowns third daughter and whose sister lady emily wrote those sweet tracts the sailors true binnacle and the applewoman of finchley common  miss sharps accounts of his employment at queens crawley were not caricatures  he subjected the servants there to the devotional exercises before mentioned in which and so much the better he brought his father to join  he patronised an independent meetinghouse in crawley parish much to the indignation of his uncle the rector and to the consequent delight of sir pitt who was induced to go himself once or twice which occasioned some violent sermons at crawley parish church directed pointblank at the baronets old gothic pew there honest sir pitt however did not feel the force of these discourses as he always took his nap during sermontime  mr crawley was very earnest for the good of the nation and of the christian world that the old gentleman should yield him up his place in parliament but this the elder constantly refused to do both were of course too prudent to give up the fifteen hundred a year which was brought in by the second seat at this period filled by mr quadroon with carte blanche on the slave question indeed the family estate was much embarrassed and the income drawn from the borough was of great use to the house of queens crawley  it had never recovered the heavy fine imposed upon walpole crawley first baronet for peculation in the tape and sealing wax office sir walpole was a jolly fellow eager to seize and to spend money alieni appetens sui profusus as mr crawley would remark with a sigh and in his day beloved by all the county for the constant drunkenness and hospitality which was maintained at queens crawley the cellars were filled with burgundy then the kennels with hounds and the stables with gallant hunters now such horses as queens crawley possessed went to plough or ran in the trafalgar coach and it was with a team of these very horses on an offday that miss sharp was brought to the hall for boor as he was sir pitt was a stickler for his dignity while at home and seldom drove out but with four horses and though he dined off boiled mutton had always three footmen to serve it  if mere parsimony could have made a man rich sir pitt crawley might have become very wealthyif he had been an attorney in a country town with no capital but his brains it is very possible that he would have turned them to good account and might have achieved for himself a very considerable influence and competency but he was unluckily endowed with a good name and a large though encumbered estate both of which went rather to injure than to advance him  he had a taste for law which cost him many thousands yearly and being a great deal too clever to be robbed as he said by any single agent allowed his affairs to be mismanaged by a dozen whom he all equally mistrusted he was such a sharp landlord that he could hardly find any but bankrupt tenants and such a close farmer as to grudge almost the seed to the ground whereupon revengeful nature grudged him the crops which she granted to more liberal husbandmen he speculated in every possible way he worked mines bought canalshares horsed coaches took government contracts and was the busiest man and magistrate of his county  as he would not pay honest agents at his granite quarry he had the satisfaction of finding that four overseers ran away and took fortunes with them to america  for want of proper precautions his coalmines filled with water the government flung his contract of damaged beef upon his hands and for his coachhorses every mail proprietor in the kingdom knew that he lost more horses than any man in the country from underfeeding and buying cheap in disposition he was sociable and far from being proud nay he rather preferred the society of a farmer or a horsedealer to that of a gentleman like my lord his son he was fond of drink of swearing of joking with the farmers daughters he was never known to give away a shilling or to do a good action but was of a pleasant sly laughing mood and would cut his joke and drink his glass with a tenant and sell him up the next day or have his laugh with the poacher he was transporting with equal good humour  his politeness for the fair sex has already been hinted at by miss rebecca sharpin a word the whole baronetage peerage commonage of england did not contain a more cunning mean selfish foolish disreputable old man  that bloodred hand of sir pitt crawleys would be in anybodys pocket except his own and it is with grief and pain that as admirers of the british aristocracy we find ourselves obliged to admit the existence of so many ill qualities in a person whose name is in debrett  one great cause why mr crawley had such a hold over the affections of his father resulted from money arrangements  the baronet owed his son a sum of money out of the jointure of his mother which he did not find it convenient to pay indeed he had an almost invincible repugnance to paying anybody and could only be brought by force to discharge his debts  miss sharp calculated for she became as we shall hear speedily inducted into most of the secrets of the family that the mere payment of his creditors cost the honourable baronet several hundreds yearly but this was a delight he could not forego he had a savage pleasure in making the poor wretches wait and in shifting from court to court and from term to term the period of satisfaction whats the good of being in parliament he said if you must pay your debts hence indeed his position as a senator was not a little useful to him  vanity fairvanity fair  here was a man who could not spell and did not care to readwho had the habits and the cunning of a boor whose aim in life was pettifogging who never had a taste or emotion or enjoyment but what was sordid and foul and yet he had rank and honours and power somehow and was a dignitary of the land and a pillar of the state  he was high sheriff and rode in a golden coach great ministers and statesmen courted him and in vanity fair he had a higher place than the most brilliant genius or spotless virtue  sir pitt had an unmarried halfsister who inherited her mothers large fortune and though the baronet proposed to borrow this money of her on mortgage miss crawley declined the offer and preferred the security of the funds she had signified however her intention of leaving her inheritance between sir pitts second son and the family at the rectory and had once or twice paid the debts of rawdon crawley in his career at college and in the army miss crawley was in consequence an object of great respect when she came to queens crawley for she had a balance at her bankers which would have made her beloved anywhere  what a dignity it gives an old lady that balance at the bankers how tenderly we look at her faults if she is a relative and may every reader have a score of such what a kind goodnatured old creature we find her  how the junior partner of hobbs and dobbs leads her smiling to the carriage with the lozenge upon it and the fat wheezy coachman how when she comes to pay us a visit we generally find an opportunity to let our friends know her station in the world  we say and with perfect truth i wish i had miss macwhirters signature to a cheque for five thousand pounds  she wouldnt miss it says your wife  she is my aunt say you in an easy careless way when your friend asks if miss macwhirter is any relative  your wife is perpetually sending her little testimonies of affection your little girls work endless worsted baskets cushions and footstools for her  what a good fire there is in her room when she comes to pay you a visit although your wife laces her stays without one  the house during her stay assumes a festive neat warm jovial snug appearance not visible at other seasons you yourself dear sir forget to go to sleep after dinner and find yourself all of a sudden though you invariably lose very fond of a rubber  what good dinners you havegame every day malmseymadeira and no end of fish from london  even the servants in the kitchen share in the general prosperity and somehow during the stay of miss macwhirters fat coachman the beer is grown much stronger and the consumption of tea and sugar in the nursery where her maid takes her meals is not regarded in the least  is it so or is it not so  i appeal to the middle classes  ah gracious powers i wish you would send me an old aunta maiden auntan aunt with a lozenge on her carriage and a front of light coffeecoloured hairhow my children should work workbags for her and my julia and i would make her comfortable sweetsweet vision foolishfoolish dream    chapter x  miss sharp begins to make friends  and now being received as a member of the amiable family whose portraits we have sketched in the foregoing pages it became naturally rebeccas duty to make herself as she said agreeable to her benefactors and to gain their confidence to the utmost of her power who can but admire this quality of gratitude in an unprotected orphan and if there entered some degree of selfishness into her calculations who can say but that her prudence was perfectly justifiable  i am alone in the world said the friendless girl  i have nothing to look for but what my own labour can bring me and while that little pinkfaced chit amelia with not half my sense has ten thousand pounds and an establishment secure poor rebecca and my figure is far better than hers has only herself and her own wits to trust to  well let us see if my wits cannot provide me with an honourable maintenance and if some day or the other i cannot show miss amelia my real superiority over her not that i dislike poor amelia who can dislike such a harmless goodnatured creatureonly it will be a fine day when i can take my place above her in the world as why indeed should i not thus it was that our little romantic friend formed visions of the future for herselfnor must we be scandalised that in all her castles in the air a husband was the principal inhabitant  of what else have young ladies to think but husbands of what else do their dear mammas think  i must be my own mamma said rebecca not without a tingling consciousness of defeat as she thought over her little misadventure with jos sedley  so she wisely determined to render her position with the queens crawley family comfortable and secure and to this end resolved to make friends of every one around her who could at all interfere with her comfort  as my lady crawley was not one of these personages and a woman moreover so indolent and void of character as not to be of the least consequence in her own house rebecca soon found that it was not at all necessary to cultivate her good willindeed impossible to gain it she used to talk to her pupils about their poor mamma and though she treated that lady with every demonstration of cool respect it was to the rest of the family that she wisely directed the chief part of her attentions  with the young people whose applause she thoroughly gained her method was pretty simple  she did not pester their young brains with too much learning but on the contrary let them have their own way in regard to educating themselves for what instruction is more effectual than selfinstruction the eldest was rather fond of books and as there was in the old library at queens crawley a considerable provision of works of light literature of the last century both in the french and english languages they had been purchased by the secretary of the tape and sealing wax office at the period of his disgrace and as nobody ever troubled the bookshelves but herself rebecca was enabled agreeably and as it were in playing to impart a great deal of instruction to miss rose crawley  she and miss rose thus read together many delightful french and english works among which may be mentioned those of the learned dr smollett of the ingenious mr henry fielding of the graceful and fantastic monsieur crebillon the younger whom our immortal poet gray so much admired and of the universal monsieur de voltaire once when mr crawley asked what the young people were reading the governess replied smollett oh smollett said mr crawley quite satisfied  his history is more dull but by no means so dangerous as that of mr hume it is history you are reading yes said miss rose without however adding that it was the history of mr humphrey clinker  on another occasion he was rather scandalised at finding his sister with a book of french plays but as the governess remarked that it was for the purpose of acquiring the french idiom in conversation he was fain to be content  mr crawley as a diplomatist was exceedingly proud of his own skill in speaking the french language for he was of the world still and not a little pleased with the compliments which the governess continually paid him upon his proficiency  miss violets tastes were on the contrary more rude and boisterous than those of her sister  she knew the sequestered spots where the hens laid their eggs  she could climb a tree to rob the nests of the feathered songsters of their speckled spoils  and her pleasure was to ride the young colts and to scour the plains like camilla she was the favourite of her father and of the stablemen she was the darling and withal the terror of the cook for she discovered the haunts of the jampots and would attack them when they were within her reach she and her sister were engaged in constant battles  any of which peccadilloes if miss sharp discovered she did not tell them to lady crawley who would have told them to the father or worse to mr crawley but promised not to tell if miss violet would be a good girl and love her governess  with mr crawley miss sharp was respectful and obedient  she used to consult him on passages of french which she could not understand though her mother was a frenchwoman and which he would construe to her satisfaction and besides giving her his aid in profane literature he was kind enough to select for her books of a more serious tendency and address to her much of his conversation  she admired beyond measure his speech at the quashimabooaid society took an interest in his pamphlet on malt was often affected even to tears by his discourses of an evening and would sayoh thank you sir with a sigh and a look up to heaven that made him occasionally condescend to shake hands with her  blood is everything after all would that aristocratic religionist say how miss sharp is awakened by my words when not one of the people here is touched  i am too fine for themtoo delicate i must familiarise my stylebut she understands it  her mother was a montmorency  indeed it was from this famous family as it appears that miss sharp by the mothers side was descended of course she did not say that her mother had been on the stage it would have shocked mr crawleys religious scruples  how many noble emigres had this horrid revolution plunged in poverty  she had several stories about her ancestors ere she had been many months in the house some of which mr crawley happened to find in dhoziers dictionary which was in the library and which strengthened his belief in their truth and in the highbreeding of rebecca  are we to suppose from this curiosity and prying into dictionaries could our heroine suppose that mr crawley was interested in herno only in a friendly way  have we not stated that he was attached to lady jane sheepshanks  he took rebecca to task once or twice about the propriety of playing at backgammon with sir pitt saying that it was a godless amusement and that she would be much better engaged in reading thrumps legacy or the blind washerwoman of moorfields or any work of a more serious nature but miss sharp said her dear mother used often to play the same game with the old count de trictrac and the venerable abbe du cornet and so found an excuse for this and other worldly amusements  but it was not only by playing at backgammon with the baronet that the little governess rendered herself agreeable to her employer she found many different ways of being useful to him  she read over with indefatigable patience all those law papers with which before she came to queens crawley he had promised to entertain her  she volunteered to copy many of his letters and adroitly altered the spelling of them so as to suit the usages of the present day  she became interested in everything appertaining to the estate to the farm the park the garden and the stables and so delightful a companion was she that the baronet would seldom take his afterbreakfast walk without her and the children of course when she would give her advice as to the trees which were to be lopped in the shrubberies the gardenbeds to be dug the crops which were to be cut the horses which were to go to cart or plough before she had been a year at queens crawley she had quite won the baronets confidence and the conversation at the dinnertable which before used to be held between him and mr horrocks the butler was now almost exclusively between sir pitt and miss sharp she was almost mistress of the house when mr crawley was absent but conducted herself in her new and exalted situation with such circumspection and modesty as not to offend the authorities of the kitchen and stable among whom her behaviour was always exceedingly modest and affable  she was quite a different person from the haughty shy dissatisfied little girl whom we have known previously and this change of temper proved great prudence a sincere desire of amendment or at any rate great moral courage on her part  whether it was the heart which dictated this new system of complaisance and humility adopted by our rebecca is to be proved by her afterhistory  a system of hypocrisy which lasts through whole years is one seldom satisfactorily practised by a person of oneandtwenty however our readers will recollect that though young in years our heroine was old in life and experience and we have written to no purpose if they have not discovered that she was a very clever woman  the elder and younger son of the house of crawley were like the gentleman and lady in the weatherbox never at home togetherthey hated each other cordially indeed rawdon crawley the dragoon had a great contempt for the establishment altogether and seldom came thither except when his aunt paid her annual visit  the great good quality of this old lady has been mentioned  she possessed seventy thousand pounds and had almost adopted rawdon she disliked her elder nephew exceedingly and despised him as a milksop in return he did not hesitate to state that her soul was irretrievably lost and was of opinion that his brothers chance in the next world was not a whit better  she is a godless woman of the world would mr crawley say she lives with atheists and frenchmen  my mind shudders when i think of her awful awful situation and that near as she is to the grave she should be so given up to vanity licentiousness profaneness and folly in fact the old lady declined altogether to hear his hours lecture of an evening and when she came to queens crawley alone he was obliged to pretermit his usual devotional exercises  shut up your sarmons pitt when miss crawley comes down said his father she has written to say that she wont stand the preachifying  o sir consider the servants  the servants be hanged said sir pitt and his son thought even worse would happen were they deprived of the benefit of his instruction  why hang it pitt said the father to his remonstrance you wouldnt be such a flat as to let three thousand a year go out of the family  what is money compared to our souls sir continued mr crawley  you mean that the old lady wont leave the money to youand who knows but it was mr crawleys meaning  old miss crawley was certainly one of the reprobate she had a snug little house in park lane and as she ate and drank a great deal too much during the season in london she went to harrowgate or cheltenham for the summer  she was the most hospitable and jovial of old vestals and had been a beauty in her day she said all old women were beauties once we very well know she was a bel esprit and a dreadful radical for those days  she had been in france where st just they say inspired her with an unfortunate passion and loved ever after french novels french cookery and french wines  she read voltaire and had rousseau by heart talked very lightly about divorce and most energetically of the rights of women  she had pictures of mr fox in every room in the house when that statesman was in opposition i am not sure that she had not flung a main with him and when he came into office she took great credit for bringing over to him sir pitt and his colleague for queens crawley although sir pitt would have come over himself without any trouble on the honest ladys part  it is needless to say that sir pitt was brought to change his views after the death of the great whig statesman  this worthy old lady took a fancy to rawdon crawley when a boy sent him to cambridge in opposition to his brother at oxford and when the young man was requested by the authorities of the firstnamed university to quit after a residence of two years she bought him his commission in the life guards green  a perfect and celebrated blood or dandy about town was this young officer  boxing rathunting the fives court and fourinhand driving were then the fashion of our british aristocracy and he was an adept in all these noble sciences  and though he belonged to the household troops who as it was their duty to rally round the prince regent had not shown their valour in foreign service yet rawdon crawley had already apropos of play of which he was immoderately fond fought three bloody duels in which he gave ample proofs of his contempt for death  and for what follows after death would mr crawley observe throwing his gooseberrycoloured eyes up to the ceiling  he was always thinking of his brothers soul or of the souls of those who differed with him in opinion it is a sort of comfort which many of the serious give themselves  silly romantic miss crawley far from being horrified at the courage of her favourite always used to pay his debts after his duels and would not listen to a word that was whispered against his morality he will sow his wild oats she would say and is worth far more than that puling hypocrite of a brother of his    chapter xi  arcadian simplicity  besides these honest folks at the hall whose simplicity and sweet rural purity surely show the advantage of a country life over a town one we must introduce the reader to their relatives and neighbours at the rectory bute crawley and his wife  the reverend bute crawley was a tall stately jolly shovelhatted man far more popular in his county than the baronet his brother at college he pulled strokeoar in the christchurch boat and had thrashed all the best bruisers of the town he carried his taste for boxing and athletic exercises into private life there was not a fight within twenty miles at which he was not present nor a race nor a coursing match nor a regatta nor a ball nor an election nor a visitation dinner nor indeed a good dinner in the whole county but he found means to attend it  you might see his bay mare and giglamps a score of miles away from his rectory house whenever there was any dinnerparty at fuddleston or at roxby or at wapshot hall or at the great lords of the county with all of whom he was intimate  he had a fine voice sang a southerly wind and a cloudy sky and gave the whoop in chorus with general applause  he rode to hounds in a pepperandsalt frock and was one of the best fishermen in the county  mrs crawley the rectors wife was a smart little body who wrote this worthy divines sermons  being of a domestic turn and keeping the house a great deal with her daughters she ruled absolutely within the rectory wisely giving her husband full liberty without he was welcome to come and go and dine abroad as many days as his fancy dictated for mrs crawley was a saving woman and knew the price of port wine  ever since mrs bute carried off the young rector of queens crawley she was of a good family daughter of the late lieutcolonel hector mctavish and she and her mother played for bute and won him at harrowgate she had been a prudent and thrifty wife to him  in spite of her care however he was always in debt  it took him at least ten years to pay off his college bills contracted during his fathers lifetime in the year 179 when he was just clear of these incumbrances he gave the odds of 100 to 1 in twenties against kangaroo who won the derby  the rector was obliged to take up the money at a ruinous interest and had been struggling ever since  his sister helped him with a hundred now and then but of course his great hope was in her deathwhen hang it as he would say matilda must leave me half her money  so that the baronet and his brother had every reason which two brothers possibly can have for being by the ears  sir pitt had had the better of bute in innumerable family transactions  young pitt not only did not hunt but set up a meeting house under his uncles very nose rawdon it was known was to come in for the bulk of miss crawleys property  these money transactionsthese speculations in life and deaththese silent battles for reversionary spoilmake brothers very loving towards each other in vanity fair  i for my part have known a fivepound note to interpose and knock up a half centurys attachment between two brethren and cant but admire as i think what a fine and durable thing love is among worldly people  it cannot be supposed that the arrival of such a personage as rebecca at queens crawley and her gradual establishment in the good graces of all people there could be unremarked by mrs bute crawley  mrs bute who knew how many days the sirloin of beef lasted at the hall how much linen was got ready at the great wash how many peaches were on the south wall how many doses her ladyship took when she was illfor such points are matters of intense interest to certain persons in the countrymrs bute i say could not pass over the hall governess without making every inquiry respecting her history and character there was always the best understanding between the servants at the rectory and the hall there was always a good glass of ale in the kitchen of the former place for the hall people whose ordinary drink was very smalland indeed the rectors lady knew exactly how much malt went to every barrel of hall beerties of relationship existed between the hall and rectory domestics as between their masters and through these channels each family was perfectly well acquainted with the doings of the other  that by the way may be set down as a general remark  when you and your brother are friends his doings are indifferent to you  when you have quarrelled all his outgoings and incomings you know as if you were his spy  very soon then after her arrival rebecca began to take a regular place in mrs crawleys bulletin from the hall it was to this effect the black porkers killedweighed x stonesalted the sidespigs pudding and leg of pork for dinner  mr cramp from mudbury over with sir pitt about putting john blackmore in gaolmr pitt at meeting with all the names of the people who attendedmy lady as usualthe young ladies with the governess  then the report would comethe new governess be a rare managersir pitt be very sweet on hermr crawley toohe be reading tracts to herwhat an abandoned wretch said little eager active blackfaced mrs bute crawley  finally the reports were that the governess had come round everybody wrote sir pitts letters did his business managed his accountshad the upper hand of the whole house my lady mr crawley the girls and allat which mrs crawley declared she was an artful hussy and had some dreadful designs in view  thus the doings at the hall were the great food for conversation at the rectory and mrs butes bright eyes spied out everything that took place in the enemys campeverything and a great deal besides   mrs bute crawley to miss pinkerton the mall chiswick  rectory queens crawley december  my dear madamalthough it is so many years since i profited by your delightful and invaluable instructions yet i have ever retained the fondest and most reverential regard for miss pinkerton and dear chiswick  i hope your health is good  the world and the cause of education cannot afford to lose miss pinkerton for many many years when my friend lady fuddleston mentioned that her dear girls required an instructress i am too poor to engage a governess for mine but was i not educated at chiswickwho i exclaimed can we consult but the excellent the incomparable miss pinkerton in a word have you dear madam any ladies on your list whose services might be made available to my kind friend and neighbour i assure you she will take no governess but of your choosing  my dear husband is pleased to say that he likes everything which comes from miss pinkertons school  how i wish i could present him and my beloved girls to the friend of my youth and the admired of the great lexicographer of our country if you ever travel into hampshire mr crawley begs me to say he hopes you will adorn our rural rectory with your presence  tis the humble but happy home of  your affectionate martha crawley  ps  mr crawleys brother the baronet with whom we are not alas upon those terms of unity in which it becomes brethren to dwell has a governess for his little girls who i am told had the good fortune to be educated at chiswick  i hear various reports of her and as i have the tenderest interest in my dearest little nieces whom i wish in spite of family differences to see among my own childrenand as i long to be attentive to any pupil of yoursdo my dear miss pinkerton tell me the history of this young lady whom for your sake i am most anxious to befriendm c   miss pinkerton to mrs bute crawley  johnson house chiswick dec 18  dear madami have the honour to acknowledge your polite communication to which i promptly reply tis most gratifying to one in my most arduous position to find that my maternal cares have elicited a responsive affection and to recognize in the amiable mrs bute crawley my excellent pupil of former years the sprightly and accomplished miss martha mactavish  i am happy to have under my charge now the daughters of many of those who were your contemporaries at my establishmentwhat pleasure it would give me if your own beloved young ladies had need of my instructive superintendence  presenting my respectful compliments to lady fuddleston i have the honour epistolarily to introduce to her ladyship my two friends miss tuffin and miss hawky  either of these young ladies is perfectly qualified to instruct in greek latin and the rudiments of hebrew in mathematics and history in spanish french italian and geography in music vocal and instrumental in dancing without the aid of a master and in the elements of natural sciences  in the use of the globes both are proficients  in addition to these miss tuffin who is daughter of the late reverend thomas tuffin fellow of corpus college cambridge can instruct in the syriac language and the elements of constitutional law but as she is only eighteen years of age and of exceedingly pleasing personal appearance perhaps this young lady may be objectionable in sir huddleston fuddlestons family  miss letitia hawky on the other hand is not personally wellfavoured she istwentynine her face is much pitted with the smallpox  she has a halt in her gait red hair and a trifling obliquity of vision both ladies are endowed with every moral and religious virtue  their terms of course are such as their accomplishments merit  with my most grateful respects to the reverend bute crawley i have the honour to be  dear madam  your most faithful and obedient servant barbara pinkerton  ps  the miss sharp whom you mention as governess to sir pitt crawley bart mp was a pupil of mine and i have nothing to say in her disfavour though her appearance is disagreeable we cannot control the operations of nature and though her parents were disreputable her father being a painter several times bankrupt and her mother as i have since learned with horror a dancer at the opera yet her talents are considerable and i cannot regret that i received her out of charity  my dread is lest the principles of the motherwho was represented to me as a french countess forced to emigrate in the late revolutionary horrors but who as i have since found was a person of the very lowest order and moralsshould at any time prove to be hereditary in the unhappy young woman whom i took as an outcast  but her principles have hitherto been correct i believe and i am sure nothing will occur to injure them in the elegant and refined circle of the eminent sir pitt crawley   miss rebecca sharp to miss amelia sedley  i have not written to my beloved amelia for these many weeks past for what news was there to tell of the sayings and doings at humdrum hall as i have christened it and what do you care whether the turnip crop is good or bad whether the fat pig weighed thirteen stone or fourteen and whether the beasts thrive well upon mangelwurzel every day since i last wrote has been like its neighbour  before breakfast a walk with sir pitt and his spud after breakfast studies such as they are in the schoolroom after schoolroom reading and writing about lawyers leases coalmines canals with sir pitt whose secretary i am become after dinner mr crawleys discourses on the baronets backgammon during both of which amusements my lady looks on with equal placidity  she has become rather more interesting by being ailing of late which has brought a new visitor to the hall in the person of a young doctor well my dear young women need never despair  the young doctor gave a certain friend of yours to understand that if she chose to be mrs glauber she was welcome to ornament the surgery i told his impudence that the gilt pestle and mortar was quite ornament enough as if i was born indeed to be a country surgeons wife mr glauber went home seriously indisposed at his rebuff took a cooling draught and is now quite cured  sir pitt applauded my resolution highly he would be sorry to lose his little secretary i think and i believe the old wretch likes me as much as it is in his nature to like any one  marry indeed and with a country apothecary after  no no one cannot so soon forget old associations about which i will talk no more  let us return to humdrum hall  for some time past it is humdrum hall no longer my dear miss crawley has arrived with her fat horses fat servants fat spanielthe great rich miss crawley with seventy thousand pounds in the five per cents whom or i had better say which her two brothers adore  she looks very apoplectic the dear soul no wonder her brothers are anxious about her  you should see them struggling to settle her cushions or to hand her coffee when i come into the country she says for she has a great deal of humour i leave my toady miss briggs at home my brothers are my toadies here my dear and a pretty pair they are  when she comes into the country our hall is thrown open and for a month at least you would fancy old sir walpole was come to life again  we have dinnerparties and drive out in the coachandfour the footmen put on their newest canarycoloured liveries we drink claret and champagne as if we were accustomed to it every day  we have wax candles in the schoolroom and fires to warm ourselves with  lady crawley is made to put on the brightest peagreen in her wardrobe and my pupils leave off their thick shoes and tight old tartan pelisses and wear silk stockings and muslin frocks as fashionable baronets daughters should  rose came in yesterday in a sad plightthe wiltshire sow an enormous pet of hers ran her down and destroyed a most lovely flowered lilac silk dress by dancing over ithad this happened a week ago sir pitt would have sworn frightfully have boxed the poor wretchs ears and put her upon bread and water for a month all he said was ill serve you out miss when your aunts gone and laughed off the accident as quite trivial  let us hope his wrath will have passed away before miss crawleys departure  i hope so for miss roses sake i am sure what a charming reconciler and peacemaker money is  another admirable effect of miss crawley and her seventy thousand pounds is to be seen in the conduct of the two brothers crawley  i mean the baronet and the rector not our brothersbut the former who hate each other all the year round become quite loving at christmas i wrote to you last year how the abominable horseracing rector was in the habit of preaching clumsy sermons at us at church and how sir pitt snored in answer  when miss crawley arrives there is no such thing as quarrelling heard ofthe hall visits the rectory and vice versathe parson and the baronet talk about the pigs and the poachers and the county business in the most affable manner and without quarrelling in their cups i believeindeed miss crawley wont hear of their quarrelling and vows that she will leave her money to the shropshire crawleys if they offend her  if they were clever people those shropshire crawleys they might have it all i think but the shropshire crawley is a clergyman like his hampshire cousin and mortally offended miss crawley who had fled thither in a fit of rage against her impracticable brethren by some straitlaced notions of morality  he would have prayers in the house i believe  our sermon books are shut up when miss crawley arrives and mr pitt whom she abominates finds it convenient to go to town  on the other hand the young dandyblood i believe is the termcaptain crawley makes his appearance and i suppose you will like to know what sort of a person he is  well he is a very large young dandy  he is six feet high and speaks with a great voice and swears a great deal and orders about the servants who all adore him nevertheless for he is very generous of his money and the domestics will do anything for him last week the keepers almost killed a bailiff and his man who came down from london to arrest the captain and who were found lurking about the park wallthey beat them ducked them and were going to shoot them for poachers but the baronet interfered  the captain has a hearty contempt for his father i can see and calls him an old put an old snob an old chawbacon and numberless other pretty names  he has a dreadful reputation among the ladies he brings his hunters home with him lives with the squires of the county asks whom he pleases to dinner and sir pitt dares not say no for fear of offending miss crawley and missing his legacy when she dies of her apoplexy shall i tell you a compliment the captain paid me  i must it is so pretty  one evening we actually had a dance there was sir huddleston fuddleston and his family sir giles wapshot and his young ladies and i dont know how many more  well i heard him sayby jove shes a neat little filly meaning your humble servant and he did me the honour to dance two countrydances with me  he gets on pretty gaily with the young squires with whom he drinks bets rides and talks about hunting and shooting but he says the country girls are bores indeed i dont think he is far wrong you should see the contempt with which they look down on poor me when they dance i sit and play the piano very demurely but the other night coming in rather flushed from the diningroom and seeing me employed in this way he swore out loud that i was the best dancer in the room and took a great oath that he would have the fiddlers from mudbury  ill go and play a countrydance said mrs bute crawley very readily she is a little blackfaced old woman in a turban rather crooked and with very twinkling eyes and after the captain and your poor little rebecca had performed a dance together do you know she actually did me the honour to compliment me upon my steps such a thing was never heard of before the proud mrs bute crawley first cousin to the earl of tiptoff who wont condescend to visit lady crawley except when her sister is in the country  poor lady crawley during most part of these gaieties she is upstairs taking pills  mrs bute has all of a sudden taken a great fancy to me  my dear miss sharp she says why not bring over your girls to the rectorytheir cousins will be so happy to see them i know what she means  signor clementi did not teach us the piano for nothing at which price mrs bute hopes to get a professor for her children i can see through her schemes as though she told them to me but i shall go as i am determined to make myself agreeableis it not a poor governesss duty who has not a friend or protector in the world the rectors wife paid me a score of compliments about the progress my pupils made and thought no doubt to touch my heartpoor simple country soulas if i cared a fig about my pupils  your india muslin and your pink silk dearest amelia are said to become me very well  they are a good deal worn now but you know we poor girls cant afford des fraiches toilettes  happy happy you who have but to drive to st jamess street and a dear mother who will give you any thing you ask  farewell dearest girl  your affectionate rebecca  psi wish you could have seen the faces of the miss blackbrooks admiral blackbrooks daughters my dear fine young ladies with dresses from london when captain rawdon selected poor me for a partner   when mrs bute crawley whose artifices our ingenious rebecca had so soon discovered had procured from miss sharp the promise of a visit she induced the allpowerful miss crawley to make the necessary application to sir pitt and the goodnatured old lady who loved to be gay herself and to see every one gay and happy round about her was quite charmed and ready to establish a reconciliation and intimacy between her two brothers it was therefore agreed that the young people of both families should visit each other frequently for the future and the friendship of course lasted as long as the jovial old mediatrix was there to keep the peace  why did you ask that scoundrel rawdon crawley to dine said the rector to his lady as they were walking home through the park  i dont want the fellow  he looks down upon us country people as so many blackamoors hes never content unless he gets my yellowsealed wine which costs me ten shillings a bottle hang him besides hes such an infernal characterhes a gamblerhes a drunkardhes a profligate in every way  he shot a man in a duelhes over head and ears in debt and hes robbed me and mine of the best part of miss crawleys fortune  waxy says she has himhere the rector shook his fist at the moon with something very like an oath and added in a melancholious tone down in her will for fifty thousand and there wont be above thirty to divide  i think shes going said the rectors wife  she was very red in the face when we left dinner  i was obliged to unlace her  she drank seven glasses of champagne said the reverend gentleman in a low voice and filthy champagne it is too that my brother poisons us withbut you women never know whats what  we know nothing said mrs bute crawley  she drank cherrybrandy after dinner continued his reverence and took curacao with her coffee  i wouldnt take a glass for a fivepound note it kills me with heartburn  she cant stand it mrs crawleyshe must goflesh and blood wont bear it and i lay five to two matilda drops in a year  indulging in these solemn speculations and thinking about his debts and his son jim at college and frank at woolwich and the four girls who were no beauties poor things and would not have a penny but what they got from the aunts expected legacy the rector and his lady walked on for a while  pitt cant be such an infernal villain as to sell the reversion of the living  and that methodist milksop of an eldest son looks to parliament continued mr crawley after a pause  sir pitt crawley will do anything said the rectors wife  we must get miss crawley to make him promise it to james  pitt will promise anything replied the brother  he promised hed pay my college bills when my father died he promised hed build the new wing to the rectory he promised hed let me have jibbs field and the sixacre meadowand much he executed his promises and its to this mans sonthis scoundrel gambler swindler murderer of a rawdon crawley that matilda leaves the bulk of her money  i say its unchristian  by jove it is the infamous dog has got every vice except hypocrisy and that belongs to his brother  hush my dearest love were in sir pitts grounds interposed his wife  i say he has got every vice mrs crawley  dont maam bully me didnt he shoot captain marker didnt he rob young lord dovedale at the cocoatree didnt he cross the fight between bill soames and the cheshire trump by which i lost forty pound you know he did and as for the women why you heard that before me in my own magistrates room  for heavens sake mr crawley said the lady spare me the details  and you ask this villain into your house continued the exasperated rector  you the mother of a young familythe wife of a clergyman of the church of england  by jove  bute crawley you are a fool said the rectors wife scornfully  well maam fool or notand i dont say martha im so clever as you are i never did  but i wont meet rawdon crawley thats flat ill go over to huddleston that i will and see his black greyhound mrs crawley and ill run lancelot against him for fifty  by jove i will or against any dog in england  but i wont meet that beast rawdon crawley  mr crawley you are intoxicated as usual replied his wife  and the next morning when the rector woke and called for small beer she put him in mind of his promise to visit sir huddleston fuddleston on saturday and as he knew he should have a wet night it was agreed that he might gallop back again in time for church on sunday morning  thus it will be seen that the parishioners of crawley were equally happy in their squire and in their rector  miss crawley had not long been established at the hall before rebeccas fascinations had won the heart of that goodnatured london rake as they had of the country innocents whom we have been describing  taking her accustomed drive one day she thought fit to order that that little governess should accompany her to mudbury before they had returned rebecca had made a conquest of her having made her laugh four times and amused her during the whole of the little journey  not let miss sharp dine at table said she to sir pitt who had arranged a dinner of ceremony and asked all the neighbouring baronets my dear creature do you suppose i can talk about the nursery with lady fuddleston or discuss justices business with that goose old sir giles wapshot i insist upon miss sharp appearing  let lady crawley remain upstairs if there is no room but little miss sharp why shes the only person fit to talk to in the county  of course after such a peremptory order as this miss sharp the governess received commands to dine with the illustrious company below stairs  and when sir huddleston had with great pomp and ceremony handed miss crawley in to dinner and was preparing to take his place by her side the old lady cried out in a shrill voice becky sharp miss sharp  come you and sit by me and amuse me and let sir huddleston sit by lady wapshot  when the parties were over and the carriages had rolled away the insatiable miss crawley would say come to my dressing room becky and let us abuse the companywhich between them this pair of friends did perfectly  old sir huddleston wheezed a great deal at dinner sir giles wapshot had a particularly noisy manner of imbibing his soup and her ladyship a wink of the left eye all of which becky caricatured to admiration as well as the particulars of the nights conversation the politics the war the quartersessions the famous run with the hh and those heavy and dreary themes about which country gentlemen converse  as for the misses wapshots toilettes and lady fuddlestons famous yellow hat miss sharp tore them to tatters to the infinite amusement of her audience  my dear you are a perfect trouvaille miss crawley would say  i wish you could come to me in london but i couldnt make a butt of you as i do of poor briggs no no you little sly creature you are too cleverisnt she firkin  mrs firkin who was dressing the very small remnant of hair which remained on miss crawleys pate flung up her head and said i think miss is very clever with the most killing sarcastic air  in fact mrs firkin had that natural jealousy which is one of the main principles of every honest woman  after rebuffing sir huddleston fuddleston miss crawley ordered that rawdon crawley should lead her in to dinner every day and that becky should follow with her cushionor else she would have beckys arm and rawdon with the pillow  we must sit together she said were the only three christians in the county my lovein which case it must be confessed that religion was at a very low ebb in the county of hants  besides being such a fine religionist miss crawley was as we have said an ultraliberal in opinions and always took occasion to express these in the most candid manner  what is birth my dear she would say to rebeccalook at my brother pitt look at the huddlestons who have been here since henry ii look at poor bute at the parsonageis any one of them equal to you in intelligence or breeding equal to youthey are not even equal to poor dear briggs my companion or bowls my butler you my love are a little paragonpositively a little jewelyou have more brains than half the shireif merit had its reward you ought to be a duchessno there ought to be no duchesses at allbut you ought to have no superior and i consider you my love as my equal in every respect andwill you put some coals on the fire my dear and will you pick this dress of mine and alter it you who can do it so well so this old philanthropist used to make her equal run of her errands execute her millinery and read her to sleep with french novels every night  at this time as some old readers may recollect the genteel world had been thrown into a considerable state of excitement by two events which as the papers say might give employment to the gentlemen of the long robe ensign shafton had run away with lady barbara fitzurse the earl of bruins daughter and heiress and poor vere vane a gentleman who up to forty had maintained a most respectable character and reared a numerous family suddenly and outrageously left his home for the sake of mrs rougemont the actress who was sixtyfive years of age  that was the most beautiful part of dear lord nelsons character miss crawley said  he went to the deuce for a woman  there must be good in a man who will do that  i adore all impudent matches  what i like best is for a nobleman to marry a millers daughter as lord flowerdale didit makes all the women so angryi wish some great man would run away with you my dear im sure youre pretty enough  two postboysoh it would be delightful rebecca owned  and what i like next best is for a poor fellow to run away with a rich girl  i have set my heart on rawdon running away with some one  a rich some one or a poor some one  why you goose rawdon has not a shilling but what i give him  he is crible de detteshe must repair his fortunes and succeed in the world  is he very clever rebecca asked  clever my lovenot an idea in the world beyond his horses and his regiment and his hunting and his play but he must succeedhes so delightfully wicked  dont you know he has hit a man and shot an injured father through the hat only hes adored in his regiment and all the young men at wattiers and the cocoatree swear by him  when miss rebecca sharp wrote to her beloved friend the account of the little ball at queens crawley and the manner in which for the first time captain crawley had distinguished her she did not strange to relate give an altogether accurate account of the transaction  the captain had distinguished her a great number of times before  the captain had met her in a halfscore of walks the captain had lighted upon her in a halfhundred of corridors and passages  the captain had hung over her piano twenty times of an evening my lady was now upstairs being ill and nobody heeded her as miss sharp sang  the captain had written her notes the best that the great blundering dragoon could devise and spell but dulness gets on as well as any other quality with women  but when he put the first of the notes into the leaves of the song she was singing the little governess rising and looking him steadily in the face took up the triangular missive daintily and waved it about as if it were a cocked hat and she advancing to the enemy popped the note into the fire and made him a very low curtsey and went back to her place and began to sing away again more merrily than ever  whats that said miss crawley interrupted in her afterdinner doze by the stoppage of the music  its a false note miss sharp said with a laugh and rawdon crawley fumed with rage and mortification  seeing the evident partiality of miss crawley for the new governess how good it was of mrs bute crawley not to be jealous and to welcome the young lady to the rectory and not only her but rawdon crawley her husbands rival in the old maids five per cents they became very fond of each others society mrs crawley and her nephew  he gave up hunting he declined entertainments at fuddleston he would not dine with the mess of the depot at mudbury his great pleasure was to stroll over to crawley parsonagewhither miss crawley came too and as their mamma was ill why not the children with miss sharp so the children little dears came with miss sharp and of an evening some of the party would walk back together  not miss crawleyshe preferred her carriagebut the walk over the rectory fields and in at the little park wicket and through the dark plantation and up the checkered avenue to queens crawley was charming in the moonlight to two such lovers of the picturesque as the captain and miss rebecca  o those stars those stars miss rebecca would say turning her twinkling green eyes up towards them  i feel myself almost a spirit when i gaze upon them  oahgadyes so do i exactly miss sharp the other enthusiast replied  you dont mind my cigar do you miss sharp  miss sharp loved the smell of a cigar out of doors beyond everything in the worldand she just tasted one too in the prettiest way possible and gave a little puff and a little scream and a little giggle and restored the delicacy to the captain who twirled his moustache and straightway puffed it into a blaze that glowed quite red in the dark plantation and sworejoveawgadawits the finest segaw i ever smoked in the world aw for his intellect and conversation were alike brilliant and becoming to a heavy young dragoon  old sir pitt who was taking his pipe and beer and talking to john horrocks about a ship that was to be killed espied the pair so occupied from his studywindow and with dreadful oaths swore that if it wasnt for miss crawley hed take rawdon and bundle un out of doors like a rogue as he was  he be a badn sure enough mr horrocks remarked and his man flethers is wuss and have made such a row in the housekeepers room about the dinners and hale as no lord would makebut i think miss sharps a match forn sir pitt he added after a pause  and so in truth she wasfor father and son too    chapter xii  quite a sentimental chapter  we must now take leave of arcadia and those amiable people practising the rural virtues there and travel back to london to inquire what has become of miss amelia we dont care a fig for her writes some unknown correspondent with a pretty little handwriting and a pink seal to her note  she is fade and insipid and adds some more kind remarks in this strain which i should never have repeated at all but that they are in truth prodigiously complimentary to the young lady whom they concern  has the beloved reader in his experience of society never heard similar remarks by goodnatured female friends who always wonder what you can see in miss smith that is so fascinating or what could induce major jones to propose for that silly insignificant simpering miss thompson who has nothing but her waxdoll face to recommend her what is there in a pair of pink cheeks and blue eyes forsooth these dear moralists ask and hint wisely that the gifts of genius the accomplishments of the mind the mastery of mangnalls questions and a ladylike knowledge of botany and geology the knack of making poetry the power of rattling sonatas in the herzmanner and so forth are far more valuable endowments for a female than those fugitive charms which a few years will inevitably tarnish  it is quite edifying to hear women speculate upon the worthlessness and the duration of beauty  but though virtue is a much finer thing and those hapless creatures who suffer under the misfortune of good looks ought to be continually put in mind of the fate which awaits them and though very likely the heroic female character which ladies admire is a more glorious and beautiful object than the kind fresh smiling artless tender little domestic goddess whom men are inclined to worshipyet the latter and inferior sort of women must have this consolationthat the men do admire them after all and that in spite of all our kind friends warnings and protests we go on in our desperate error and folly and shall to the end of the chapter indeed for my own part though i have been repeatedly told by persons for whom i have the greatest respect that miss brown is an insignificant chit and mrs white has nothing but her petit minois chiffonne and mrs black has not a word to say for herself yet i know that i have had the most delightful conversations with mrs black of course my dear madam they are inviolable i see all the men in a cluster round mrs whites chair all the young fellows battling to dance with miss brown and so i am tempted to think that to be despised by her sex is a very great compliment to a woman  the young ladies in amelias society did this for her very satisfactorily  for instance there was scarcely any point upon which the misses osborne georges sisters and the mesdemoiselles dobbin agreed so well as in their estimate of her very trifling merits and their wonder that their brothers could find any charms in her  we are kind to her the misses osborne said a pair of fine blackbrowed young ladies who had had the best of governesses masters and milliners and they treated her with such extreme kindness and condescension and patronised her so insufferably that the poor little thing was in fact perfectly dumb in their presence and to all outward appearance as stupid as they thought her  she made efforts to like them as in duty bound and as sisters of her future husband  she passed long mornings with themthe most dreary and serious of forenoons  she drove out solemnly in their great family coach with them and miss wirt their governess that rawboned vestal  they took her to the ancient concerts by way of a treat and to the oratorio and to st pauls to see the charity children where in such terror was she of her friends she almost did not dare be affected by the hymn the children sang  their house was comfortable their papas table rich and handsome their society solemn and genteel their selfrespect prodigious they had the best pew at the foundling all their habits were pompous and orderly and all their amusements intolerably dull and decorous after every one of her visits and oh how glad she was when they were over miss osborne and miss maria osborne and miss wirt the vestal governess asked each other with increased wonder what could george find in that creature  how is this some carping reader exclaims  how is it that amelia who had such a number of friends at school and was so beloved there comes out into the world and is spurned by her discriminating sex my dear sir there were no men at miss pinkertons establishment except the old dancingmaster and you would not have had the girls fall out about him when george their handsome brother ran off directly after breakfast and dined from home halfadozen times a week no wonder the neglected sisters felt a little vexation  when young bullock of the firm of hulker bullock  co bankers lombard street who had been making up to miss maria the last two seasons actually asked amelia to dance the cotillon could you expect that the former young lady should be pleased and yet she said she was like an artless forgiving creature  im so delighted you like dear amelia she said quite eagerly to mr bullock after the dance  shes engaged to my brother george theres not much in her but shes the bestnatured and most unaffected young creature at home were all so fond of her dear girl who can calculate the depth of affection expressed in that enthusiastic so  miss wirt and these two affectionate young women so earnestly and frequently impressed upon george osbornes mind the enormity of the sacrifice he was making and his romantic generosity in throwing himself away upon amelia that im not sure but that he really thought he was one of the most deserving characters in the british army and gave himself up to be loved with a good deal of easy resignation  somehow although he left home every morning as was stated and dined abroad six days in the week when his sisters believed the infatuated youth to be at miss sedleys apronstrings he was not always with amelia whilst the world supposed him at her feet certain it is that on more occasions than one when captain dobbin called to look for his friend miss osborne who was very attentive to the captain and anxious to hear his military stories and to know about the health of his dear mamma would laughingly point to the opposite side of the square and say oh you must go to the sedleys to ask for george we never see him from morning till night at which kind of speech the captain would laugh in rather an absurd constrained manner and turn off the conversation like a consummate man of the world to some topic of general interest such as the opera the princes last ball at carlton house or the weatherthat blessing to society  what an innocent it is that pet of yours miss maria would then say to miss jane upon the captains departure  did you see how he blushed at the mention of poor george on duty  its a pity frederick bullock hadnt some of his modesty maria replies the elder sister with a toss of he head  modesty  awkwardness you mean jane  i dont want frederick to trample a hole in my muslin frock as captain dobbin did in yours at mrs perkins  in your frock he he  how could he wasnt he dancing with amelia  the fact is when captain dobbin blushed so and looked so awkward he remembered a circumstance of which he did not think it was necessary to inform the young ladies viz that he had been calling at mr sedleys house already on the pretence of seeing george of course and george wasnt there only poor little amelia with rather a sad wistful face seated near the drawingroom window who after some very trifling stupid talk ventured to ask was there any truth in the report that the regiment was soon to be ordered abroad and had captain dobbin seen mr osborne that day  the regiment was not ordered abroad as yet and captain dobbin had not seen george  he was with his sister most likely the captain said should he go and fetch the truant  so she gave him her hand kindly and gratefully and he crossed the square and she waited and waited but george never came  poor little tender heart and so it goes on hoping and beating and longing and trusting  you see it is not much of a life to describe there is not much of what you call incident in it  only one feeling all daywhen will he come only one thought to sleep and wake upon i believe george was playing billiards with captain cannon in swallow street at the time when amelia was asking captain dobbin about him for george was a jolly sociable fellow and excellent in all games of skill  once after three days of absence miss amelia put on her bonnet and actually invaded the osborne house what leave our brother to come to us said the young ladies  have you had a quarrel amelia do tell us no indeed there had been no quarrel  who could quarrel with him says she with her eyes filled with tears she only came over toto see her dear friends they had not met for so long  and this day she was so perfectly stupid and awkward that the misses osborne and their governess who stared after her as she went sadly away wondered more than ever what george could see in poor little amelia  of course they did  how was she to bare that timid little heart for the inspection of those young ladies with their bold black eyes it was best that it should shrink and hide itself  i know the misses osborne were excellent critics of a cashmere shawl or a pink satin slip and when miss turner had hers dyed purple and made into a spencer and when miss pickford had her ermine tippet twisted into a muff and trimmings i warrant you the changes did not escape the two intelligent young women before mentioned  but there are things look you of a finer texture than fur or satin and all solomons glories and all the wardrobe of the queen of shebathings whereof the beauty escapes the eyes of many connoisseurs  and there are sweet modest little souls on which you light fragrant and blooming tenderly in quiet shady places and there are gardenornaments as big as brass warmingpans that are fit to stare the sun itself out of countenance  miss sedley was not of the sunflower sort and i say it is out of the rules of all proportion to draw a violet of the size of a double dahlia  no indeed the life of a good young girl who is in the paternal nest as yet cant have many of those thrilling incidents to which the heroine of romance commonly lays claim  snares or shot may take off the old birds foraging withouthawks may be abroad from which they escape or by whom they suffer but the young ones in the nest have a pretty comfortable unromantic sort of existence in the down and the straw till it comes to their turn too to get on the wing while becky sharp was on her own wing in the country hopping on all sorts of twigs and amid a multiplicity of traps and pecking up her food quite harmless and successful amelia lay snug in her home of russell square if she went into the world it was under the guidance of the elders nor did it seem that any evil could befall her or that opulent cheery comfortable home in which she was affectionately sheltered mamma had her morning duties and her daily drive and the delightful round of visits and shopping which forms the amusement or the profession as you may call it of the rich london lady  papa conducted his mysterious operations in the citya stirring place in those days when war was raging all over europe and empires were being staked when the courier newspaper had tens of thousands of subscribers when one day brought you a battle of vittoria another a burning of moscow or a newsmans horn blowing down russell square about dinnertime announced such a fact asbattle of leipsicsix hundred thousand men engagedtotal defeat of the frenchtwo hundred thousand killed old sedley once or twice came home with a very grave face and no wonder when such news as this was agitating all the hearts and all the stocks of europe  meanwhile matters went on in russell square bloomsbury just as if matters in europe were not in the least disorganised  the retreat from leipsic made no difference in the number of meals mr sambo took in the servants hall the allies poured into france and the dinnerbell rang at five oclock just as usual  i dont think poor amelia cared anything about brienne and montmirail or was fairly interested in the war until the abdication of the emperor when she clapped her hands and said prayersoh how grateful and flung herself into george osbornes arms with all her soul to the astonishment of everybody who witnessed that ebullition of sentiment the fact is peace was declared europe was going to be at rest the corsican was overthrown and lieutenant osbornes regiment would not be ordered on service  that was the way in which miss amelia reasoned  the fate of europe was lieutenant george osborne to her  his dangers being over she sang te deum  he was her europe her emperor her allied monarchs and august prince regent  he was her sun and moon and i believe she thought the grand illumination and ball at the mansion house given to the sovereigns were especially in honour of george osborne  we have talked of shift self and poverty as those dismal instructors under whom poor miss becky sharp got her education now love was miss amelia sedleys last tutoress and it was amazing what progress our young lady made under that popular teacher  in the course of fifteen or eighteen months daily and constant attention to this eminent finishing governess what a deal of secrets amelia learned which miss wirt and the blackeyed young ladies over the way which old miss pinkerton of chiswick herself had no cognizance of  as indeed how should any of those prim and reputable virgins  with misses p and w the tender passion is out of the question i would not dare to breathe such an idea regarding them  miss maria osborne it is true was attached to mr frederick augustus bullock of the firm of hulker bullock  bullock but hers was a most respectable attachment and she would have taken bullock senior just the same her mind being fixedas that of a wellbred young woman should beupon a house in park lane a country house at wimbledon a handsome chariot and two prodigious tall horses and footmen and a fourth of the annual profits of the eminent firm of hulker  bullock all of which advantages were represented in the person of frederick augustus had orange blossoms been invented then those touching emblems of female purity imported by us from france where peoples daughters are universally sold in marriage miss maria i say would have assumed the spotless wreath and stepped into the travelling carriage by the side of gouty old baldheaded bottlenosed bullock senior and devoted her beautiful existence to his happiness with perfect modestyonly the old gentleman was married already so she bestowed her young affections on the junior partner sweet blooming orange flowers  the other day i saw miss trotter that was arrayed in them trip into the travelling carriage at st georges hanover square and lord methuselah hobbled in after with what an engaging modesty she pulled down the blinds of the chariotthe dear innocent  there were half the carriages of vanity fair at the wedding  this was not the sort of love that finished amelias education and in the course of a year turned a good young girl into a good young womanto be a good wife presently when the happy time should come this young person perhaps it was very imprudent in her parents to encourage her and abet her in such idolatry and silly romantic ideas loved with all her heart the young officer in his majestys service with whom we have made a brief acquaintance  she thought about him the very first moment on waking and his was the very last name mentioned in her prayers  she never had seen a man so beautiful or so clever such a figure on horseback such a dancer such a hero in general talk of the princes bow what was it to georges she had seen mr brummell whom everybody praised so  compare such a person as that to her george not amongst all the beaux at the opera and there were beaux in those days with actual opera hats was there any one to equal him  he was only good enough to be a fairy prince and oh what magnanimity to stoop to such a humble cinderella  miss pinkerton would have tried to check this blind devotion very likely had she been amelias confidante but not with much success depend upon it  it is in the nature and instinct of some women  some are made to scheme and some to love and i wish any respected bachelor that reads this may take the sort that best likes him  while under this overpowering impression miss amelia neglected her twelve dear friends at chiswick most cruelly as such selfish people commonly will do  she had but this subject of course to think about and miss saltire was too cold for a confidante and she couldnt bring her mind to tell miss swartz the woollyhaired young heiress from st kitts  she had little laura martin home for the holidays and my belief is she made a confidante of her and promised that laura should come and live with her when she was married and gave laura a great deal of information regarding the passion of love which must have been singularly useful and novel to that little person  alas alas  i fear poor emmy had not a wellregulated mind  what were her parents doing not to keep this little heart from beating so fast  old sedley did not seem much to notice matters he was graver of late and his city affairs absorbed him  mrs sedley was of so easy and uninquisitive a nature that she wasnt even jealous  mr jos was away being besieged by an irish widow at cheltenham  amelia had the house to herselfah too much to herself sometimesnot that she ever doubted for to be sure george must be at the horse guards and he cant always get leave from chatham and he must see his friends and sisters and mingle in society when in town he such an ornament to every society and when he is with the regiment he is too tired to write long letters i know where she kept that packet she hadand can steal in and out of her chamber like iachimolike iachimo  nothat is a bad part i will only act moonshine and peep harmless into the bed where faith and beauty and innocence lie dreaming  but if osbornes were short and soldierlike letters it must be confessed that were miss sedleys letters to mr osborne to be published we should have to extend this novel to such a multiplicity of volumes as not the most sentimental reader could support that she not only filled sheets of large paper but crossed them with the most astonishing perverseness that she wrote whole pages out of poetrybooks without the least pity that she underlined words and passages with quite a frantic emphasis and in fine gave the usual tokens of her condition  she wasnt a heroine her letters were full of repetition  she wrote rather doubtful grammar sometimes and in her verses took all sorts of liberties with the metre  but oh mesdames if you are not allowed to touch the heart sometimes in spite of syntax and are not to be loved until you all know the difference between trimeter and tetrameter may all poetry go to the deuce and every schoolmaster perish miserably    chapter xiii  sentimental and otherwise  i fear the gentleman to whom miss amelias letters were addressed was rather an obdurate critic  such a number of notes followed lieutenant osborne about the country that he became almost ashamed of the jokes of his messroom companions regarding them and ordered his servant never to deliver them except at his private apartment he was seen lighting his cigar with one to the horror of captain dobbin who it is my belief would have given a banknote for the document  for some time george strove to keep the liaison a secret  there was a woman in the case that he admitted and not the first either said ensign spooney to ensign stubble  that osbornes a devil of a fellow there was a judges daughter at demerara went almost mad about him then there was that beautiful quadroon girl miss pye at st vincents you know and since hes been home they say hes a regular don giovanni by jove  stubble and spooney thought that to be a regular don giovanni by jove was one of the finest qualities a man could possess and osbornes reputation was prodigious amongst the young men of the regiment  he was famous in fieldsports famous at a song famous on parade free with his money which was bountifully supplied by his father  his coats were better made than any mans in the regiment and he had more of them  he was adored by the men  he could drink more than any officer of the whole mess including old heavytop the colonel  he could spar better than knuckles the private who would have been a corporal but for his drunkenness and who had been in the prizering and was the best batter and bowler out and out of the regimental club he rode his own horse greased lightning and won the garrison cup at quebec races  there were other people besides amelia who worshipped him  stubble and spooney thought him a sort of apollo dobbin took him to be an admirable crichton and mrs major odowd acknowledged he was an elegant young fellow and put her in mind of fitzjurld fogarty lord castlefogartys second son  well stubble and spooney and the rest indulged in most romantic conjectures regarding this female correspondent of osbornesopining that it was a duchess in london who was in love with himor that it was a generals daughter who was engaged to somebody else and madly attached to himor that it was a member of parliaments lady who proposed four horses and an elopementor that it was some other victim of a passion delightfully exciting romantic and disgraceful to all parties on none of which conjectures would osborne throw the least light leaving his young admirers and friends to invent and arrange their whole history  and the real state of the case would never have been known at all in the regiment but for captain dobbins indiscretion  the captain was eating his breakfast one day in the messroom while cackle the assistantsurgeon and the two abovenamed worthies were speculating upon osbornes intriguestubble holding out that the lady was a duchess about queen charlottes court and cackle vowing she was an operasinger of the worst reputation at this idea dobbin became so moved that though his mouth was full of eggs and breadandbutter at the time and though he ought not to have spoken at all yet he couldnt help blurting out cackle youre a stupid fool youre always talking nonsense and scandal  osborne is not going to run off with a duchess or ruin a milliner miss sedley is one of the most charming young women that ever lived  hes been engaged to her ever so long and the man who calls her names had better not do so in my hearing with which turning exceedingly red dobbin ceased speaking and almost choked himself with a cup of tea  the story was over the regiment in halfanhour and that very evening mrs major odowd wrote off to her sister glorvina at odowdstown not to hurry from dublinyoung osborne being prematurely engaged already  she complimented the lieutenant in an appropriate speech over a glass of whiskytoddy that evening and he went home perfectly furious to quarrel with dobbin who had declined mrs major odowds party and sat in his own room playing the flute and i believe writing poetry in a very melancholy mannerto quarrel with dobbin for betraying his secret  who the deuce asked you to talk about my affairs osborne shouted indignantly  why the devil is all the regiment to know that i am going to be married why is that tattling old harridan peggy odowd to make free with my name at her dd suppertable and advertise my engagement over the three kingdoms after all what right have you to say i am engaged or to meddle in my business at all dobbin  it seems to me captain dobbin began  seems be hanged dobbin his junior interrupted him  i am under obligations to you i know it a dd deal too well too but i wont be always sermonised by you because youre five years my senior im hanged if ill stand your airs of superiority and infernal pity and patronage  pity and patronage i should like to know in what im your inferior  are you engaged captain dobbin interposed  what the devils that to you or any one here if i am  are you ashamed of it dobbin resumed  what right have you to ask me that question sir i should like to know george said  good god you dont mean to say you want to break off asked dobbin starting up  in other words you ask me if im a man of honour said osborne fiercely is that what you mean youve adopted such a tone regarding me lately that im  if ill bear it any more  what have i done ive told you you were neglecting a sweet girl george  ive told you that when you go to town you ought to go to her and not to the gamblinghouses about st jamess  you want your money back i suppose said george with a sneer  of course i doi always did didnt i says dobbin you speak like a generous fellow  no hang it william i beg your pardonhere george interposed in a fit of remorse you have been my friend in a hundred ways heaven knows  youve got me out of a score of scrapes  when crawley of the guards won that sum of money of me i should have been done but for you i know i should  but you shouldnt deal so hardly with me you shouldnt be always catechising me i am very fond of amelia i adore her and that sort of thing  dont look angry  shes faultless i know she is but you see theres no fun in winning a thing unless you play for it  hang it the regiments just back from the west indies i must have a little fling and then when im married ill reform i will upon my honour now  andi saydobdont be angry with me and ill give you a hundred next month when i know my father will stand something handsome and ill ask heavytop for leave and ill go to town and see amelia tomorrowthere now will that satisfy you  it is impossible to be long angry with you george said the goodnatured captain and as for the money old boy you know if i wanted it youd share your last shilling with me  that i would by jove dobbin george said with the greatest generosity though by the way he never had any money to spare  only i wish you had sown those wild oats of yours george  if you could have seen poor little miss emmys face when she asked me about you the other day you would have pitched those billiardballs to the deuce  go and comfort her you rascal  go and write her a long letter  do something to make her happy a very little will  i believe shes dd fond of me the lieutenant said with a selfsatisfied air and went off to finish the evening with some jolly fellows in the messroom  amelia meanwhile in russell square was looking at the moon which was shining upon that peaceful spot as well as upon the square of the chatham barracks where lieutenant osborne was quartered and thinking to herself how her hero was employed  perhaps he is visiting the sentries thought she perhaps he is bivouacking perhaps he is attending the couch of a wounded comrade or studying the art of war up in his own desolate chamber and her kind thoughts sped away as if they were angels and had wings and flying down the river to chatham and rochester strove to peep into the barracks where george was    all things considered i think it was as well the gates were shut and the sentry allowed no one to pass so that the poor little whiterobed angel could not hear the songs those young fellows were roaring over the whiskypunch  the day after the little conversation at chatham barracks young osborne to show that he would be as good as his word prepared to go to town thereby incurring captain dobbins applause  i should have liked to make her a little present osborne said to his friend in confidence only i am quite out of cash until my father tips up but dobbin would not allow this good nature and generosity to be balked and so accommodated mr osborne with a few pound notes which the latter took after a little faint scruple  and i dare say he would have bought something very handsome for amelia only getting off the coach in fleet street he was attracted by a handsome shirtpin in a jewellers window which he could not resist and having paid for that had very little money to spare for indulging in any further exercise of kindness  never mind you may be sure it was not his presents amelia wanted  when he came to russell square her face lighted up as if he had been sunshine  the little cares fears tears timid misgivings sleepless fancies of i dont know how many days and nights were forgotten under one moments influence of that familiar irresistible smile  he beamed on her from the drawingroom doormagnificent with ambrosial whiskers like a god sambo whose face as he announced captain osbin having conferred a brevet rank on that young officer blazed with a sympathetic grin saw the little girl start and flush and jump up from her watchingplace in the window and sambo retreated and as soon as the door was shut she went fluttering to lieutenant george osbornes heart as if it was the only natural home for her to nestle in  oh thou poor panting little soul  the very finest tree in the whole forest with the straightest stem and the strongest arms and the thickest foliage wherein you choose to build and coo may be marked for what you know and may be down with a crash ere long  what an old old simile that is between man and timber  in the meanwhile george kissed her very kindly on her forehead and glistening eyes and was very gracious and good and she thought his diamond shirtpin which she had not known him to wear before the prettiest ornament ever seen  the observant reader who has marked our young lieutenants previous behaviour and has preserved our report of the brief conversation which he has just had with captain dobbin has possibly come to certain conclusions regarding the character of mr osborne  some cynical frenchman has said that there are two parties to a lovetransaction the one who loves and the other who condescends to be so treated perhaps the love is occasionally on the mans side perhaps on the ladys perhaps some infatuated swain has ere this mistaken insensibility for modesty dulness for maiden reserve mere vacuity for sweet bashfulness and a goose in a word for a swan perhaps some beloved female subscriber has arrayed an ass in the splendour and glory of her imagination admired his dulness as manly simplicity worshipped his selfishness as manly superiority treated his stupidity as majestic gravity and used him as the brilliant fairy titania did a certain weaver at athens  i think i have seen such comedies of errors going on in the world  but this is certain that amelia believed her lover to be one of the most gallant and brilliant men in the empire and it is possible lieutenant osborne thought so too  he was a little wild how many young men are and dont girls like a rake better than a milksop  he hadnt sown his wild oats as yet but he would soon and quit the army now that peace was proclaimed the corsican monster locked up at elba promotion by consequence over and no chance left for the display of his undoubted military talents and valour and his allowance with amelias settlement would enable them to take a snug place in the country somewhere in a good sporting neighbourhood and he would hunt a little and farm a little and they would be very happy  as for remaining in the army as a married man that was impossible fancy mrs george osborne in lodgings in a county town or worse still in the east or west indies with a society of officers and patronized by mrs major odowd amelia died with laughing at osbornes stories about mrs major odowd  he loved her much too fondly to subject her to that horrid woman and her vulgarities and the rough treatment of a soldiers wife  he didnt care for himselfnot he but his dear little girl should take the place in society to which as his wife she was entitled and to these proposals you may be sure she acceded as she would to any other from the same author  holding this kind of conversation and building numberless castles in the air which amelia adorned with all sorts of flowergardens rustic walks country churches sunday schools and the like while george had his minds eye directed to the stables the kennel and the cellar this young pair passed away a couple of hours very pleasantly and as the lieutenant had only that single day in town and a great deal of most important business to transact it was proposed that miss emmy should dine with her future sistersinlaw this invitation was accepted joyfully  he conducted her to his sisters where he left her talking and prattling in a way that astonished those ladies who thought that george might make something of her and he then went off to transact his business  in a word he went out and ate ices at a pastrycooks shop in charing cross tried a new coat in pall mall dropped in at the old slaughters and called for captain cannon played eleven games at billiards with the captain of which he won eight and returned to russell square half an hour late for dinner but in very good humour  it was not so with old mr osborne  when that gentleman came from the city and was welcomed in the drawingroom by his daughters and the elegant miss wirt they saw at once by his facewhich was puffy solemn and yellow at the best of timesand by the scowl and twitching of his black eyebrows that the heart within his large white waistcoat was disturbed and uneasy  when amelia stepped forward to salute him which she always did with great trembling and timidity he gave a surly grunt of recognition and dropped the little hand out of his great hirsute paw without any attempt to hold it there  he looked round gloomily at his eldest daughter who comprehending the meaning of his look which asked unmistakably why the devil is she here said at once  george is in town papa and has gone to the horse guards and will be back to dinner  o he is is he i wont have the dinner kept waiting for him jane with which this worthy man lapsed into his particular chair and then the utter silence in his genteel wellfurnished drawingroom was only interrupted by the alarmed ticking of the great french clock  when that chronometer which was surmounted by a cheerful brass group of the sacrifice of iphigenia tolled five in a heavy cathedral tone mr osborne pulled the bell at his right handviolently and the butler rushed up  dinner roared mr osborne  mr george isnt come in sir interposed the man  damn mr george sir  am i master of the house dinner mr osborne scowled  amelia trembled  a telegraphic communication of eyes passed between the other three ladies  the obedient bell in the lower regions began ringing the announcement of the meal  the tolling over the head of the family thrust his hands into the great tailpockets of his great blue coat with brass buttons and without waiting for a further announcement strode downstairs alone scowling over his shoulder at the four females  whats the matter now my dear asked one of the other as they rose and tripped gingerly behind the sire    i suppose the funds are falling whispered miss wirt and so trembling and in silence this hushed female company followed their dark leader  they took their places in silence  he growled out a blessing which sounded as gruffly as a curse  the great silver dishcovers were removed amelia trembled in her place for she was next to the awful osborne and alone on her side of the tablethe gap being occasioned by the absence of george  soup says mr osborne clutching the ladle fixing his eyes on her in a sepulchral tone and having helped her and the rest did not speak for a while  take miss sedleys plate away at last he said  she cant eat the soupno more can i  its beastly  take away the soup hicks and tomorrow turn the cook out of the house jane  having concluded his observations upon the soup mr osborne made a few curt remarks respecting the fish also of a savage and satirical tendency and cursed billingsgate with an emphasis quite worthy of the place then he lapsed into silence and swallowed sundry glasses of wine looking more and more terrible till a brisk knock at the door told of georges arrival when everybody began to rally  he could not come before  general daguilet had kept him waiting at the horse guards  never mind soup or fish  give him anythinghe didnt care what  capital muttoncapital everything his good humour contrasted with his fathers severity and he rattled on unceasingly during dinner to the delight of allof one especially who need not be mentioned  as soon as the young ladies had discussed the orange and the glass of wine which formed the ordinary conclusion of the dismal banquets at mr osbornes house the signal to make sail for the drawingroom was given and they all arose and departed  amelia hoped george would soon join them there  she began playing some of his favourite waltzes then newly imported at the great carvedlegged leathercased grand piano in the drawingroom overhead  this little artifice did not bring him he was deaf to the waltzes they grew fainter and fainter the discomfited performer left the huge instrument presently and though her three friends performed some of the loudest and most brilliant new pieces of their repertoire she did not hear a single note but sate thinking and boding evil  old osbornes scowl terrific always had never before looked so deadly to her  his eyes followed her out of the room as if she had been guilty of something when they brought her coffee she started as though it were a cup of poison which mr hicks the butler wished to propose to her  what mystery was there lurking oh those women they nurse and cuddle their presentiments and make darlings of their ugliest thoughts as they do of their deformed children  the gloom on the paternal countenance had also impressed george osborne with anxiety  with such eyebrows and a look so decidedly bilious how was he to extract that money from the governor of which george was consumedly in want he began praising his fathers wine  that was generally a successful means of cajoling the old gentleman  we never got such madeira in the west indies sir as yours colonel heavytop took off three bottles of that you sent me down under his belt the other day  did he said the old gentleman  it stands me in eight shillings a bottle  will you take six guineas a dozen for it sir said george with a laugh  theres one of the greatest men in the kingdom wants some  does he growled the senior  wish he may get it  when general daguilet was at chatham sir heavytop gave him a breakfast and asked me for some of the wine  the general liked it just as wellwanted a pipe for the commanderinchief  hes his royal highnesss righthand man  it is devilish fine wine said the eyebrows and they looked more goodhumoured and george was going to take advantage of this complacency and bring the supply question on the mahogany when the father relapsing into solemnity though rather cordial in manner bade him ring the bell for claret  and well see if thats as good as the madeira george to which his royal highness is welcome im sure  and as we are drinking it ill talk to you about a matter of importance  amelia heard the claret bell ringing as she sat nervously upstairs she thought somehow it was a mysterious and presentimental bell of the presentiments which some people are always having some surely must come right  what i want to know george the old gentleman said after slowly smacking his first bumperwhat i want to know is how you andahthat little thing upstairs are carrying on  i think sir it is not hard to see george said with a selfsatisfied grin  pretty clear sirwhat capital wine  what dyou mean pretty clear sir  why hang it sir dont push me too hard  im a modest man iahi dont set up to be a ladykiller but i do own that shes as devilish fond of me as she can be  anybody can see that with half an eye  and you yourself  why sir didnt you order me to marry her and aint i a good boy havent our papas settled it ever so long  a pretty boy indeed  havent i heard of your doings sir with lord tarquin captain crawley of the guards the honourable mr deuceace and that set  have a care sir have a care  the old gentleman pronounced these aristocratic names with the greatest gusto  whenever he met a great man he grovelled before him and mylorded him as only a freeborn briton can do  he came home and looked out his history in the peerage he introduced his name into his daily conversation he bragged about his lordship to his daughters  he fell down prostrate and basked in him as a neapolitan beggar does in the sun  george was alarmed when he heard the names  he feared his father might have been informed of certain transactions at play  but the old moralist eased him by saying serenely  well well young men will be young men  and the comfort to me is george that living in the best society in england as i hope you do as i think you do as my means will allow you to do  thank you sir says george making his point at once  one cant live with these great folks for nothing and my purse sir look at it and he held up a little token which had been netted by amelia and contained the very last of dobbins pound notes  you shant want sir  the british merchants son shant want sir my guineas are as good as theirs george my boy and i dont grudge em call on mr chopper as you go through the city tomorrow hell have something for you  i dont grudge money when i know youre in good society because i know that good society can never go wrong  theres no pride in me  i was a humbly born manbut you have had advantages make a good use of em  mix with the young nobility theres many of em who cant spend a dollar to your guinea my boy  and as for the pink bonnets here from under the heavy eyebrows there came a knowing and not very pleasing leerwhy boys will be boys  only theres one thing i order you to avoid which if you do not ill cut you off with a shilling by jove and thats gambling  oh of course sir said george  but to return to the other business about amelia why shouldnt you marry higher than a stockbrokers daughter georgethats what i want to know  its a family business sirsays george cracking filberts  you and mr sedley made the match a hundred years ago  i dont deny it but peoples positions alter sir  i dont deny that sedley made my fortune or rather put me in the way of acquiring by my own talents and genius that proud position which i may say i occupy in the tallow trade and the city of london ive shown my gratitude to sedley and hes tried it of late sir as my chequebook can show george  i tell you in confidence i dont like the looks of mr sedleys affairs  my chief clerk mr chopper does not like the looks of em and hes an old file and knows change as well as any man in london  hulker  bullock are looking shy at him  hes been dabbling on his own account i fear they say the jeune amelie was his which was taken by the yankee privateer molasses  and thats flatunless i see amelias ten thousand down you dont marry her  ill have no lame ducks daughter in my family  pass the wine siror ring for coffee  with which mr osborne spread out the evening paper and george knew from this signal that the colloquy was ended and that his papa was about to take a nap  he hurried upstairs to amelia in the highest spirits what was it that made him more attentive to her on that night than he had been for a long timemore eager to amuse her more tender more brilliant in talk  was it that his generous heart warmed to her at the prospect of misfortune or that the idea of losing the dear little prize made him value it more  she lived upon the recollections of that happy evening for many days afterwards remembering his words his looks the song he sang his attitude as he leant over her or looked at her from a distance  as it seemed to her no night ever passed so quickly at mr osbornes house before and for once this young person was almost provoked to be angry by the premature arrival of mr sambo with her shawl  george came and took a tender leave of her the next morning and then hurried off to the city where he visited mr chopper his fathers head man and received from that gentleman a document which he exchanged at hulker  bullocks for a whole pocketful of money as george entered the house old john sedley was passing out of the bankers parlour looking very dismal  but his godson was much too elated to mark the worthy stockbrokers depression or the dreary eyes which the kind old gentleman cast upon him  young bullock did not come grinning out of the parlour with him as had been his wont in former years  and as the swinging doors of hulker bullock  co closed upon mr sedley mr quill the cashier whose benevolent occupation it is to hand out crisp banknotes from a drawer and dispense sovereigns out of a copper shovel winked at mr driver the clerk at the desk on his right  mr driver winked again  no go mr d whispered  not at no price mr q said  mr george osborne  sir how will you take it george crammed eagerly a quantity of notes into his pockets and paid dobbin fifty pounds that very evening at mess  that very evening amelia wrote him the tenderest of long letters her heart was overflowing with tenderness but it still foreboded evil what was the cause of mr osbornes dark looks she asked had any difference arisen between him and her papa her poor papa returned so melancholy from the city that all were alarmed about him at homein fine there were four pages of loves and fears and hopes and forebodings  poor little emmydear little emmy  how fond she is of me george said as he perused the missiveand gad what a headache that mixed punch has given me poor little emmy indeed    chapter xiv  miss crawley at home  about this time there drove up to an exceedingly snug and wellappointed house in park lane a travelling chariot with a lozenge on the panels a discontented female in a green veil and crimped curls on the rumble and a large and confidential man on the box  it was the equipage of our friend miss crawley returning from hants  the carriage windows were shut the fat spaniel whose head and tongue ordinarily lolled out of one of them reposed on the lap of the discontented female  when the vehicle stopped a large round bundle of shawls was taken out of the carriage by the aid of various domestics and a young lady who accompanied the heap of cloaks  that bundle contained miss crawley who was conveyed upstairs forthwith and put into a bed and chamber warmed properly as for the reception of an invalid  messengers went off for her physician and medical man  they came consulted prescribed vanished  the young companion of miss crawley at the conclusion of their interview came in to receive their instructions and administered those antiphlogistic medicines which the eminent men ordered  captain crawley of the life guards rode up from knightsbridge barracks the next day his black charger pawed the straw before his invalid aunts door  he was most affectionate in his inquiries regarding that amiable relative  there seemed to be much source of apprehension he found miss crawleys maid the discontented female unusually sulky and despondent he found miss briggs her dame de compagnie in tears alone in the drawingroom  she had hastened home hearing of her beloved friends illness  she wished to fly to her couch that couch which she briggs had so often smoothed in the hour of sickness  she was denied admission to miss crawleys apartment  a stranger was administering her medicinesa stranger from the countryan odious miss  tears choked the utterance of the dame de compagnie and she buried her crushed affections and her poor old red nose in her pocket handkerchief  rawdon crawley sent up his name by the sulky femme de chambre and miss crawleys new companion coming tripping down from the sickroom put a little hand into his as he stepped forward eagerly to meet her gave a glance of great scorn at the bewildered briggs and beckoning the young guardsman out of the back drawingroom led him downstairs into that now desolate diningparlour where so many a good dinner had been celebrated  here these two talked for ten minutes discussing no doubt the symptoms of the old invalid above stairs at the end of which period the parlour bell was rung briskly and answered on that instant by mr bowls miss crawleys large confidential butler who indeed happened to be at the keyhole during the most part of the interview and the captain coming out curling his mustachios mounted the black charger pawing among the straw to the admiration of the little blackguard boys collected in the street  he looked in at the diningroom window managing his horse which curvetted and capered beautifullyfor one instant the young person might be seen at the window when her figure vanished and doubtless she went upstairs again to resume the affecting duties of benevolence  who could this young woman be i wonder  that evening a little dinner for two persons was laid in the diningroomwhen mrs firkin the ladys maid pushed into her mistresss apartment and bustled about there during the vacancy occasioned by the departure of the new nurseand the latter and miss briggs sat down to the neat little meal  briggs was so much choked by emotion that she could hardly take a morsel of meat  the young person carved a fowl with the utmost delicacy and asked so distinctly for eggsauce that poor briggs before whom that delicious condiment was placed started made a great clattering with the ladle and once more fell back in the most gushing hysterical state  had you not better give miss briggs a glass of wine said the person to mr bowls the large confidential man he did so  briggs seized it mechanically gasped it down convulsively moaned a little and began to play with the chicken on her plate  i think we shall be able to help each other said the person with great suavity and shall have no need of mr bowlss kind services mr bowls if you please we will ring when we want you he went downstairs where by the way he vented the most horrid curses upon the unoffending footman his subordinate  it is a pity you take on so miss briggs the young lady said with a cool slightly sarcastic air  my dearest friend is so ill and wooont see me gurgled out briggs in an agony of renewed grief  shes not very ill any more  console yourself dear miss briggs she has only overeaten herselfthat is all she is greatly better she will soon be quite restored again she is weak from being cupped and from medical treatment but she will rally immediately  pray console yourself and take a little more wine  but why why wont she see me again miss briggs bleated out oh matilda matilda after threeandtwenty years tenderness is this the return to your poor poor arabella  dont cry too much poor arabella the other said with ever so little of a grin she only wont see you because she says you dont nurse her as well as i do its no pleasure to me to sit up all night i wish you might do it instead  have i not tended that dear couch for years arabella said and now  now she prefers somebody else  well sick people have these fancies and must be humoured  when shes well i shall go  never never arabella exclaimed madly inhaling her saltsbottle  never be well or never go miss briggs the other said with the same provoking goodnature  poohshe will be well in a fortnight when i shall go back to my little pupils at queens crawley and to their mother who is a great deal more sick than our friend  you need not be jealous about me my dear miss briggs  i am a poor little girl without any friends or any harm in me i dont want to supplant you in miss crawleys good graces  she will forget me a week after i am gone and her affection for you has been the work of years  give me a little wine if you please my dear miss briggs and let us be friends  im sure i want friends  the placable and softhearted briggs speechlessly pushed out her hand at this appeal but she felt the desertion most keenly for all that and bitterly bitterly moaned the fickleness of her matilda at the end of half an hour the meal over miss rebecca sharp for such astonishing to state is the name of her who has been described ingeniously as the person hitherto went upstairs again to her patients rooms from which with the most engaging politeness she eliminated poor firkin thank you mrs firkin that will quite do how nicely you make it i will ring when anything is wanted thank you and firkin came downstairs in a tempest of jealousy only the more dangerous because she was forced to confine it in her own bosom  could it be the tempest which as she passed the landing of the first floor blew open the drawingroom door no it was stealthily opened by the hand of briggs briggs had been on the watch briggs too well heard the creaking firkin descend the stairs and the clink of the spoon and gruelbasin the neglected female carried  well firkin says she as the other entered the apartment well jane  wuss and wuss miss b firkin said wagging her head  is she not better then  she never spoke but once and i asked her if she felt a little more easy and she told me to hold my stupid tongue oh miss b i never thought to have seen this day  and the waterworks again began to play  what sort of a person is this miss sharp firkin i little thought while enjoying my christmas revels in the elegant home of my firm friends the reverend lionel delamere and his amiable lady to find a stranger had taken my place in the affections of my dearest my still dearest matilda  miss briggs it will be seen by her language was of a literary and sentimental turn and had once published a volume of poemstrills of the nightingaleby subscription  miss b they are all infatyated about that young woman firkin replied sir pitt wouldnt have let her go but he darednt refuse miss crawley anything mrs bute at the rectory jist as badnever happy out of her sight the capting quite wild about her mr crawley mortial jealous since miss c was took ill she wont have nobody near her but miss sharp i cant tell for where nor for why and i think somethink has bewidged everybody  rebecca passed that night in constant watching upon miss crawley the next night the old lady slept so comfortably that rebecca had time for several hours comfortable repose herself on the sofa at the foot of her patronesss bed very soon miss crawley was so well that she sat up and laughed heartily at a perfect imitation of miss briggs and her grief which rebecca described to her briggs weeping snuffle and her manner of using the handkerchief were so completely rendered that miss crawley became quite cheerful to the admiration of the doctors when they visited her who usually found this worthy woman of the world when the least sickness attacked her under the most abject depression and terror of death  captain crawley came every day and received bulletins from miss rebecca respecting his aunts health this improved so rapidly that poor briggs was allowed to see her patroness and persons with tender hearts may imagine the smothered emotions of that sentimental female and the affecting nature of the interview  miss crawley liked to have briggs in a good deal soon  rebecca used to mimic her to her face with the most admirable gravity thereby rendering the imitation doubly piquant to her worthy patroness  the causes which had led to the deplorable illness of miss crawley and her departure from her brothers house in the country were of such an unromantic nature that they are hardly fit to be explained in this genteel and sentimental novel  for how is it possible to hint of a delicate female living in good society that she ate and drank too much and that a hot supper of lobsters profusely enjoyed at the rectory was the reason of an indisposition which miss crawley herself persisted was solely attributable to the dampness of the weather  the attack was so sharp that matildaas his reverence expressed itwas very nearly off the hooks all the family were in a fever of expectation regarding the will and rawdon crawley was making sure of at least forty thousand pounds before the commencement of the london season  mr crawley sent over a choice parcel of tracts to prepare her for the change from vanity fair and park lane for another world but a good doctor from southampton being called in in time vanquished the lobster which was so nearly fatal to her and gave her sufficient strength to enable her to return to london the baronet did not disguise his exceeding mortification at the turn which affairs took  while everybody was attending on miss crawley and messengers every hour from the rectory were carrying news of her health to the affectionate folks there there was a lady in another part of the house being exceedingly ill of whom no one took any notice at all and this was the lady of crawley herself  the good doctor shook his head after seeing her to which visit sir pitt consented as it could be paid without a fee and she was left fading away in her lonely chamber with no more heed paid to her than to a weed in the park  the young ladies too lost much of the inestimable benefit of their governesss instruction so affectionate a nurse was miss sharp that miss crawley would take her medicines from no other hand firkin had been deposed long before her mistresss departure from the country that faithful attendant found a gloomy consolation on returning to london in seeing miss briggs suffer the same pangs of jealousy and undergo the same faithless treatment to which she herself had been subject  captain rawdon got an extension of leave on his aunts illness and remained dutifully at home  he was always in her antechamber  she lay sick in the state bedroom into which you entered by the little blue saloon his father was always meeting him there or if he came down the corridor ever so quietly his fathers door was sure to open and the hyena face of the old gentleman to glare out  what was it set one to watch the other so  a generous rivalry no doubt as to which should be most attentive to the dear sufferer in the state bedroom rebecca used to come out and comfort both of them or one or the other of them rather  both of these worthy gentlemen were most anxious to have news of the invalid from her little confidential messenger  at dinnerto which meal she descended for half an hourshe kept the peace between them after which she disappeared for the night when rawdon would ride over to the depot of the 150th at mudbury leaving his papa to the society of mr horrocks and his rum and water she passed as weary a fortnight as ever mortal spent in miss crawleys sickroom but her little nerves seemed to be of iron as she was quite unshaken by the duty and the tedium of the sickchamber  she never told until long afterwards how painful that duty was how peevish a patient was the jovial old lady how angry how sleepless in what horrors of death during what long nights she lay moaning and in almost delirious agonies respecting that future world which she quite ignored when she was in good healthpicture to yourself oh fair young reader a worldly selfish graceless thankless religionless old woman writhing in pain and fear and without her wig  picture her to yourself and ere you be old learn to love and pray  sharp watched this graceless bedside with indomitable patience nothing escaped her and like a prudent steward she found a use for everything  she told many a good story about miss crawleys illness in after daysstories which made the lady blush through her artificial carnations  during the illness she was never out of temper always alert she slept light having a perfectly clear conscience and could take that refreshment at almost any minutes warning  and so you saw very few traces of fatigue in her appearance  her face might be a trifle paler and the circles round her eyes a little blacker than usual but whenever she came out from the sickroom she was always smiling fresh and neat and looked as trim in her little dressinggown and cap as in her smartest evening suit  the captain thought so and raved about her in uncouth convulsions the barbed shaft of love had penetrated his dull hide  six weeksappropinquityopportunityhad victimised him completely  he made a confidante of his aunt at the rectory of all persons in the world  she rallied him about it she had perceived his folly she warned him she finished by owning that little sharp was the most clever droll odd goodnatured simple kindly creature in england  rawdon must not trifle with her affections thoughdear miss crawley would never pardon him for that for she too was quite overcome by the little governess and loved sharp like a daughter  rawdon must go awaygo back to his regiment and naughty london and not play with a poor artless girls feelings  many and many a time this goodnatured lady compassionating the forlorn lifeguardsmans condition gave him an opportunity of seeing miss sharp at the rectory and of walking home with her as we have seen  when men of a certain sort ladies are in love though they see the hook and the string and the whole apparatus with which they are to be taken they gorge the bait neverthelessthey must come to itthey must swallow itand are presently struck and landed gasping  rawdon saw there was a manifest intention on mrs butes part to captivate him with rebecca  he was not very wise but he was a man about town and had seen several seasons  a light dawned upon his dusky soul as he thought through a speech of mrs butes  mark my words rawdon she said  you will have miss sharp one day for your relation  what relationmy cousin hey mrs bute james sweet on her hey inquired the waggish officer  more than that mrs bute said with a flash from her black eyes  not pitt  he shant have her  the sneak ant worthy of her hes booked to lady jane sheepshanks  you men perceive nothing  you silly blind creatureif anything happens to lady crawley miss sharp will be your motherinlaw and thats what will happen  rawdon crawley esquire gave vent to a prodigious whistle in token of astonishment at this announcement he couldnt deny it  his fathers evident liking for miss sharp had not escaped him  he knew the old gentlemans character well and a more unscrupulous oldwhyouhe did not conclude the sentence but walked home curling his mustachios and convinced he had found a clue to mrs butes mystery  by jove its too bad thought rawdon too bad by jove i do believe the woman wants the poor girl to be ruined in order that she shouldnt come into the family as lady crawley  when he saw rebecca alone he rallied her about his fathers attachment in his graceful way  she flung up her head scornfully looked him full in the face and said  well suppose he is fond of me  i know he is and others too  you dont think i am afraid of him captain crawley  you dont suppose i cant defend my own honour said the little woman looking as stately as a queen  oh ah whygive you fair warninglook out you knowthats all said the mustachiotwiddler  you hint at something not honourable then said she flashing out  o gadreallymiss rebecca the heavy dragoon interposed  do you suppose i have no feeling of selfrespect because i am poor and friendless and because rich people have none  do you think because i am a governess i have not as much sense and feeling and good breeding as you gentlefolks in hampshire im a montmorency do you suppose a montmorency is not as good as a crawley  when miss sharp was agitated and alluded to her maternal relatives she spoke with ever so slight a foreign accent which gave a great charm to her clear ringing voice  no she continued kindling as she spoke to the captain i can endure poverty but not shameneglect but not insult and insult fromfrom you  her feelings gave way and she burst into tears  hang it miss sharprebeccaby joveupon my soul i wouldnt for a thousand pounds  stop rebecca  she was gone  she drove out with miss crawley that day  it was before the latters illness  at dinner she was unusually brilliant and lively but she would take no notice of the hints or the nods or the clumsy expostulations of the humiliated infatuated guardsman skirmishes of this sort passed perpetually during the little campaigntedious to relate and similar in result  the crawley heavy cavalry was maddened by defeat and routed every day  if the baronet of queens crawley had not had the fear of losing his sisters legacy before his eyes he never would have permitted his dear girls to lose the educational blessings which their invaluable governess was conferring upon them  the old house at home seemed a desert without her so useful and pleasant had rebecca made herself there  sir pitts letters were not copied and corrected his books not made up his household business and manifold schemes neglected now that his little secretary was away  and it was easy to see how necessary such an amanuensis was to him by the tenor and spelling of the numerous letters which he sent to her entreating her and commanding her to return  almost every day brought a frank from the baronet enclosing the most urgent prayers to becky for her return or conveying pathetic statements to miss crawley regarding the neglected state of his daughters education of which documents miss crawley took very little heed  miss briggs was not formally dismissed but her place as companion was a sinecure and a derision and her company was the fat spaniel in the drawingroom or occasionally the discontented firkin in the housekeepers closet  nor though the old lady would by no means hear of rebeccas departure was the latter regularly installed in office in park lane  like many wealthy people it was miss crawleys habit to accept as much service as she could get from her inferiors and goodnaturedly to take leave of them when she no longer found them useful  gratitude among certain rich folks is scarcely natural or to be thought of  they take needy peoples services as their due  nor have you o poor parasite and humble hangeron much reason to complain  your friendship for dives is about as sincere as the return which it usually gets  it is money you love and not the man and were croesus and his footman to change places you know you poor rogue who would have the benefit of your allegiance  and i am not sure that in spite of rebeccas simplicity and activity and gentleness and untiring good humour the shrewd old london lady upon whom these treasures of friendship were lavished had not a lurking suspicion all the while of her affectionate nurse and friend it must have often crossed miss crawleys mind that nobody does anything for nothing  if she measured her own feeling towards the world she must have been pretty well able to gauge those of the world towards herself and perhaps she reflected that it is the ordinary lot of people to have no friends if they themselves care for nobody  well meanwhile becky was the greatest comfort and convenience to her and she gave her a couple of new gowns and an old necklace and shawl and showed her friendship by abusing all her intimate acquaintances to her new confidante than which there cant be a more touching proof of regard and meditated vaguely some great future benefitto marry her perhaps to clump the apothecary or to settle her in some advantageous way of life or at any rate to send her back to queens crawley when she had done with her and the full london season had begun  when miss crawley was convalescent and descended to the drawingroom becky sang to her and otherwise amused her when she was well enough to drive out becky accompanied her  and amongst the drives which they took whither of all places in the world did miss crawleys admirable goodnature and friendship actually induce her to penetrate but to russell square bloomsbury and the house of john sedley esquire  ere that event many notes had passed as may be imagined between the two dear friends  during the months of rebeccas stay in hampshire the eternal friendship had must it be owned suffered considerable diminution and grown so decrepit and feeble with old age as to threaten demise altogether  the fact is both girls had their own real affairs to think of rebecca her advance with her employersamelia her own absorbing topic  when the two girls met and flew into each others arms with that impetuosity which distinguishes the behaviour of young ladies towards each other rebecca performed her part of the embrace with the most perfect briskness and energy  poor little amelia blushed as she kissed her friend and thought she had been guilty of something very like coldness towards her  their first interview was but a very short one  amelia was just ready to go out for a walk  miss crawley was waiting in her carriage below her people wondering at the locality in which they found themselves and gazing upon honest sambo the black footman of bloomsbury as one of the queer natives of the place  but when amelia came down with her kind smiling looks rebecca must introduce her to her friend miss crawley was longing to see her and was too ill to leave her carriagewhen i say amelia came down the park lane shoulderknot aristocracy wondered more and more that such a thing could come out of bloomsbury and miss crawley was fairly captivated by the sweet blushing face of the young lady who came forward so timidly and so gracefully to pay her respects to the protector of her friend  what a complexion my dear what a sweet voice miss crawley said as they drove away westward after the little interview  my dear sharp your young friend is charming  send for her to park lane do you hear miss crawley had a good taste  she liked natural mannersa little timidity only set them off  she liked pretty faces near her as she liked pretty pictures and nice china  she talked of amelia with rapture half a dozen times that day  she mentioned her to rawdon crawley who came dutifully to partake of his aunts chicken  of course on this rebecca instantly stated that amelia was engaged to be marriedto a lieutenant osbornea very old flame  is he a man in a lineregiment captain crawley asked remembering after an effort as became a guardsman the number of the regiment the th  rebecca thought that was the regiment  the captains name she said was captain dobbin  a lanky gawky fellow said crawley tumbles over everybody  i know him and osbornes a goodishlooking fellow with large black whiskers  enormous miss rebecca sharp said and enormously proud of them i assure you  captain rawdon crawley burst into a horselaugh by way of reply and being pressed by the ladies to explain did so when the explosion of hilarity was over  he fancies he can play at billiards said he i won two hundred of him at the cocoatree  he play the young flat hed have played for anything that day but his friend captain dobbin carried him off hang him  rawdon rawdon dont be so wicked miss crawley remarked highly pleased  why maam of all the young fellows ive seen out of the line i think this fellows the greenest  tarquin and deuceace get what money they like out of him  hed go to the deuce to be seen with a lord  he pays their dinners at greenwich and they invite the company  and very pretty company too i dare say  quite right miss sharp  right as usual miss sharp uncommon pretty companyhaw haw and the captain laughed more and more thinking he had made a good joke  rawdon dont be naughty his aunt exclaimed  well his fathers a city manimmensely rich they say  hang those city fellows they must bleed and ive not done with him yet i can tell you  haw haw  fie captain crawley i shall warn amelia  a gambling husband  horrid aint he hey the captain said with great solemnity and then added a sudden thought having struck him gad i say maam well have him here  is he a presentable sort of a person the aunt inquired  presentableoh very well  you wouldnt see any difference captain crawley answered  do lets have him when you begin to see a few people and his whatdyecallemhis inamoratoeh miss sharp thats what you call itcomes  gad ill write him a note and have him and ill try if he can play piquet as well as billiards where does he live miss sharp  miss sharp told crawley the lieutenants town address and a few days after this conversation lieutenant osborne received a letter in captain rawdons schoolboy hand and enclosing a note of invitation from miss crawley  rebecca despatched also an invitation to her darling amelia who you may be sure was ready enough to accept it when she heard that george was to be of the party  it was arranged that amelia was to spend the morning with the ladies of park lane where all were very kind to her rebecca patronised her with calm superiority she was so much the cleverer of the two and her friend so gentle and unassuming that she always yielded when anybody chose to command and so took rebeccas orders with perfect meekness and good humour miss crawleys graciousness was also remarkable  she continued her raptures about little amelia talked about her before her face as if she were a doll or a servant or a picture and admired her with the most benevolent wonder possible  i admire that admiration which the genteel world sometimes extends to the commonalty there is no more agreeable object in life than to see mayfair folks condescending  miss crawleys prodigious benevolence rather fatigued poor little amelia and i am not sure that of the three ladies in park lane she did not find honest miss briggs the most agreeable  she sympathised with briggs as with all neglected or gentle people she wasnt what you call a woman of spirit  george came to dinnera repast en garcon with captain crawley  the great family coach of the osbornes transported him to park lane from russell square where the young ladies who were not themselves invited and professed the greatest indifference at that slight nevertheless looked at sir pitt crawleys name in the baronetage and learned everything which that work had to teach about the crawley family and their pedigree and the binkies their relatives c c rawdon crawley received george osborne with great frankness and graciousness praised his play at billiards asked him when he would have his revenge was interested about osbornes regiment and would have proposed piquet to him that very evening but miss crawley absolutely forbade any gambling in her house so that the young lieutenants purse was not lightened by his gallant patron for that day at least  however they made an engagement for the next somewhere to look at a horse that crawley had to sell and to try him in the park and to dine together and to pass the evening with some jolly fellows  that is if youre not on duty to that pretty miss sedley crawley said with a knowing wink monstrous nice girl pon my honour though osborne he was good enough to add  lots of tin i suppose eh  osborne wasnt on duty he would join crawley with pleasure and the latter when they met the next day praised his new friends horsemanshipas he might with perfect honestyand introduced him to three or four young men of the first fashion whose acquaintance immensely elated the simple young officer  hows little miss sharp bythebye osborne inquired of his friend over their wine with a dandified air goodnatured little girl that does she suit you well at queens crawley miss sedley liked her a good deal last year  captain crawley looked savagely at the lieutenant out of his little blue eyes and watched him when he went up to resume his acquaintance with the fair governess  her conduct must have relieved crawley if there was any jealousy in the bosom of that lifeguardsman  when the young men went upstairs and after osbornes introduction to miss crawley he walked up to rebecca with a patronising easy swagger he was going to be kind to her and protect her  he would even shake hands with her as a friend of amelias and saying ah miss sharp howdydoo held out his left hand towards her expecting that she would be quite confounded at the honour  miss sharp put out her right forefinger and gave him a little nod so cool and killing that rawdon crawley watching the operations from the other room could hardly restrain his laughter as he saw the lieutenants entire discomfiture the start he gave the pause and the perfect clumsiness with which he at length condescended to take the finger which was offered for his embrace  shed beat the devil by jove the captain said in a rapture and the lieutenant by way of beginning the conversation agreeably asked rebecca how she liked her new place  my place said miss sharp coolly how kind of you to remind me of it  its a tolerably good place the wages are pretty goodnot so good as miss wirts i believe with your sisters in russell square how are those young ladiesnot that i ought to ask  why not mr osborne said amazed  why they never condescended to speak to me or to ask me into their house whilst i was staying with amelia but we poor governesses you know are used to slights of this sort  my dear miss sharp osborne ejaculated  at least in some families rebecca continued  you cant think what a difference there is though  we are not so wealthy in hampshire as you lucky folks of the city but then i am in a gentlemans familygood old english stock  i suppose you know sir pitts father refused a peerage  and you see how i am treated  i am pretty comfortable  indeed it is rather a good place  but how very good of you to inquire  osborne was quite savage  the little governess patronised him and persiffled him until this young british lion felt quite uneasy nor could he muster sufficient presence of mind to find a pretext for backing out of this most delectable conversation  i thought you liked the city families pretty well he said haughtily  last year you mean when i was fresh from that horrid vulgar school of course i did  doesnt every girl like to come home for the holidays  and how was i to know any better  but oh mr osborne what a difference eighteen months experience makes eighteen months spent pardon me for saying so with gentlemen  as for dear amelia she i grant you is a pearl and would be charming anywhere  there now i see you are beginning to be in a good humour but oh these queer odd city people and mr joshow is that wonderful mr joseph  it seems to me you didnt dislike that wonderful mr joseph last year osborne said kindly  how severe of you  well entre nous i didnt break my heart about him yet if he had asked me to do what you mean by your looks and very expressive and kind they are too i wouldnt have said no  mr osborne gave a look as much as to say indeed how very obliging  what an honour to have had you for a brotherinlaw you are thinking to be sisterinlaw to george osborne esquire son of john osborne esquire son ofwhat was your grandpapa mr osborne well dont be angry  you cant help your pedigree and i quite agree with you that i would have married mr joe sedley for could a poor penniless girl do better  now you know the whole secret  im frank and open considering all things it was very kind of you to allude to the circumstancevery kind and polite  amelia dear mr osborne and i were talking about your poor brother joseph how is he  thus was george utterly routed  not that rebecca was in the right but she had managed most successfully to put him in the wrong  and he now shamefully fled feeling if he stayed another minute that he would have been made to look foolish in the presence of amelia  though rebecca had had the better of him george was above the meanness of talebearing or revenge upon a ladyonly he could not help cleverly confiding to captain crawley next day some notions of his regarding miss rebeccathat she was a sharp one a dangerous one a desperate flirt c in all of which opinions crawley agreed laughingly and with every one of which miss rebecca was made acquainted before twentyfour hours were over  they added to her original regard for mr osborne  her womans instinct had told her that it was george who had interrupted the success of her first lovepassage and she esteemed him accordingly  i only just warn you he said to rawdon crawley with a knowing lookhe had bought the horse and lost some score of guineas after dinner i just warn youi know women and counsel you to be on the lookout  thank you my boy said crawley with a look of peculiar gratitude youre wide awake i see and george went off thinking crawley was quite right  he told amelia of what he had done and how he had counselled rawdon crawleya devilish good straightforward fellowto be on his guard against that little sly scheming rebecca  against whom amelia cried  your friend the governessdont look so astonished  o george what have you done amelia said  for her womans eyes which love had made sharpsighted had in one instant discovered a secret which was invisible to miss crawley to poor virgin briggs and above all to the stupid peepers of that young whiskered prig lieutenant osborne  for as rebecca was shawling her in an upper apartment where these two friends had an opportunity for a little of that secret talking and conspiring which form the delight of female life amelia coming up to rebecca and taking her two little hands in hers said rebecca i see it all  rebecca kissed her  and regarding this delightful secret not one syllable more was said by either of the young women  but it was destined to come out before long  some short period after the above events and miss rebecca sharp still remaining at her patronesss house in park lane one more hatchment might have been seen in great gaunt street figuring amongst the many which usually ornament that dismal quarter  it was over sir pitt crawleys house but it did not indicate the worthy baronets demise it was a feminine hatchment and indeed a few years back had served as a funeral compliment to sir pitts old mother the late dowager lady crawley its period of service over the hatchment had come down from the front of the house and lived in retirement somewhere in the back premises of sir pitts mansion it reappeared now for poor rose dawson sir pitt was a widower again  the arms quartered on the shield along with his own were not to be sure poor roses she had no arms  but the cherubs painted on the scutcheon answered as well for her as for sir pitts mother and resurgam was written under the coat flanked by the crawley dove and serpent  arms and hatchments resurgamhere is an opportunity for moralising  mr crawley had tended that otherwise friendless bedside  she went out of the world strengthened by such words and comfort as he could give her  for many years his was the only kindness she ever knew the only friendship that solaced in any way that feeble lonely soul her heart was dead long before her body  she had sold it to become sir pitt crawleys wife  mothers and daughters are making the same bargain every day in vanity fair  when the demise took place her husband was in london attending to some of his innumerable schemes and busy with his endless lawyers he had found time nevertheless to call often in park lane and to despatch many notes to rebecca entreating her enjoining her commanding her to return to her young pupils in the country who were now utterly without companionship during their mothers illness  but miss crawley would not hear of her departure for though there was no lady of fashion in london who would desert her friends more complacently as soon as she was tired of their society and though few tired of them sooner yet as long as her engoument lasted her attachment was prodigious and she clung still with the greatest energy to rebecca  the news of lady crawleys death provoked no more grief or comment than might have been expected in miss crawleys family circle  i suppose i must put off my party for the 3rd miss crawley said and added after a pause i hope my brother will have the decency not to marry again what a confounded rage pitt will be in if he does rawdon remarked with his usual regard for his elder brother rebecca said nothing  she seemed by far the gravest and most impressed of the family  she left the room before rawdon went away that day but they met by chance below as he was going away after taking leave and had a parley together  on the morrow as rebecca was gazing from the window she startled miss crawley who was placidly occupied with a french novel by crying out in an alarmed tone heres sir pitt maam and the baronets knock followed this announcement  my dear i cant see him  i wont see him  tell bowls not at home or go downstairs and say im too ill to receive any one  my nerves really wont bear my brother at this moment cried out miss crawley and resumed the novel  shes too ill to see you sir rebecca said tripping down to sir pitt who was preparing to ascend  so much the better sir pitt answered  i want to see you miss becky  come along a me into the parlour and they entered that apartment together  i wawnt you back at queens crawley miss the baronet said fixing his eyes upon her and taking off his black gloves and his hat with its great crape hatband his eyes had such a strange look and fixed upon her so steadfastly that rebecca sharp began almost to tremble  i hope to come soon she said in a low voice as soon as miss crawley is betterand return toto the dear children  youve said so these three months becky replied sir pitt and still you go hanging on to my sister wholl fling you off like an old shoe when shes wore you out i tell you i want you  im going back to the vuneral will you come back  yes or no  i darenti dont thinkit would be rightto be alonewith you sir becky said seemingly in great agitation  i say agin i want you sir pitt said thumping the table  i cant git on without you  i didnt see what it was till you went away  the house all goes wrong  its not the same place  all my accounts has got muddled agin you must come back  do come back dear becky do come  comeas what sir rebecca gasped out  come as lady crawley if you like the baronet said grasping his crape hat  there will that zatusfy you come back and be my wife your vit vort  birth be hanged  youre as good a lady as ever i see youve got more brains in your little vinger than any baronets wife in the county  will you come yes or no  oh sir pitt rebecca said very much moved  say yes becky sir pitt continued  im an old man but a goodn im good for twenty years  ill make you happy zee if i dont  you shall do what you like spend what you like and ave it all your own way  ill make you a zettlement  ill do everything reglar  look year and the old man fell down on his knees and leered at her like a satyr  rebecca started back a picture of consternation  in the course of this history we have never seen her lose her presence of mind but she did now and wept some of the most genuine tears that ever fell from her eyes  oh sir pitt she said  oh siriim married already    chapter xv  in which rebeccas husband appears for a short time  every reader of a sentimental turn and we desire no other must have been pleased with the tableau with which the last act of our little drama concluded for what can be prettier than an image of love on his knees before beauty  but when love heard that awful confession from beauty that she was married already he bounced up from his attitude of humility on the carpet uttering exclamations which caused poor little beauty to be more frightened than she was when she made her avowal  married youre joking the baronet cried after the first explosion of rage and wonder  youre making vun of me becky  whod ever go to marry you without a shilling to your vortune  married married rebecca said in an agony of tearsher voice choking with emotion her handkerchief up to her ready eyes fainting against the mantelpiece a figure of woe fit to melt the most obdurate heart  o sir pitt dear sir pitt do not think me ungrateful for all your goodness to me  it is only your generosity that has extorted my secret  generosity be hanged sir pitt roared out  who is it tu then youre married where was it  let me come back with you to the country sir  let me watch over you as faithfully as ever  dont dont separate me from dear queens crawley  the feller has left you has he the baronet said beginning as he fancied to comprehend  well beckycome back if you like you cant eat your cake and have it  any ways i made you a vair offer  coom back as governessyou shall have it all your own way she held out one hand  she cried fit to break her heart her ringlets fell over her face and over the marble mantelpiece where she laid it  so the rascal ran off eh  sir pitt said with a hideous attempt at consolation  never mind becky ill take care of ee  oh sir it would be the pride of my life to go back to queens crawley and take care of the children and of you as formerly when you said you were pleased with the services of your little rebecca when i think of what you have just offered me my heart fills with gratitude indeed it does  i cant be your wife sir let melet me be your daughter  saying which rebecca went down on her knees in a most tragical way and taking sir pitts horny black hand between her own two which were very pretty and white and as soft as satin looked up in his face with an expression of exquisite pathos and confidence whenwhen the door opened and miss crawley sailed in  mrs firkin and miss briggs who happened by chance to be at the parlour door soon after the baronet and rebecca entered the apartment had also seen accidentally through the keyhole the old gentleman prostrate before the governess and had heard the generous proposal which he made her  it was scarcely out of his mouth when mrs firkin and miss briggs had streamed up the stairs had rushed into the drawingroom where miss crawley was reading the french novel and had given that old lady the astounding intelligence that sir pitt was on his knees proposing to miss sharp  and if you calculate the time for the above dialogue to take placethe time for briggs and firkin to fly to the drawingroomthe time for miss crawley to be astonished and to drop her volume of pigault le brunand the time for her to come downstairsyou will see how exactly accurate this history is and how miss crawley must have appeared at the very instant when rebecca had assumed the attitude of humility  it is the lady on the ground and not the gentleman miss crawley said with a look and voice of great scorn they told me that you were on your knees sir pitt do kneel once more and let me see this pretty couple  i have thanked sir pitt crawley maam rebecca said rising and have told him thatthat i never can become lady crawley  refused him  miss crawley said more bewildered than ever briggs and firkin at the door opened the eyes of astonishment and the lips of wonder  yesrefused rebecca continued with a sad tearful voice  and am i to credit my ears that you absolutely proposed to her sir pitt the old lady asked  ees said the baronet i did  and she refused you as she says  ees sir pitt said his features on a broad grin  it does not seem to break your heart at any rate miss crawley remarked  nawt a bit answered sir pitt with a coolness and goodhumour which set miss crawley almost mad with bewilderment  that an old gentleman of station should fall on his knees to a penniless governess and burst out laughing because she refused to marry himthat a penniless governess should refuse a baronet with four thousand a yearthese were mysteries which miss crawley could never comprehend  it surpassed any complications of intrigue in her favourite pigault le brun  im glad you think it good sport brother she continued groping wildly through this amazement  vamous said sir pitt  whod ha thought it what a sly little devil what a little fox it waws he muttered to himself chuckling with pleasure  whod have thought what cries miss crawley stamping with her foot pray miss sharp are you waiting for the prince regents divorce that you dont think our family good enough for you  my attitude rebecca said when you came in maam did not look as if i despised such an honour as this goodthis noble man has deigned to offer me  do you think i have no heart  have you all loved me and been so kind to the poor orphandesertedgirl and am i to feel nothing  o my friends  o my benefactors may not my love my life my duty try to repay the confidence you have shown me  do you grudge me even gratitude miss crawley  it is too muchmy heart is too full and she sank down in a chair so pathetically that most of the audience present were perfectly melted with her sadness  whether you marry me or not youre a good little girl becky and im your vriend mind said sir pitt and putting on his crapebound hat he walked awaygreatly to rebeccas relief for it was evident that her secret was unrevealed to miss crawley and she had the advantage of a brief reprieve  putting her handkerchief to her eyes and nodding away honest briggs who would have followed her upstairs she went up to her apartment while briggs and miss crawley in a high state of excitement remained to discuss the strange event and firkin not less moved dived down into the kitchen regions and talked of it with all the male and female company there  and so impressed was mrs firkin with the news that she thought proper to write off by that very nights post with her humble duty to mrs bute crawley and the family at the rectory and sir pitt has been and proposed for to marry miss sharp wherein she has refused him to the wonder of all  the two ladies in the diningroom where worthy miss briggs was delighted to be admitted once more to confidential conversation with her patroness wondered to their hearts content at sir pitts offer and rebeccas refusal briggs very acutely suggesting that there must have been some obstacle in the shape of a previous attachment otherwise no young woman in her senses would ever have refused so advantageous a proposal  you would have accepted it yourself wouldnt you briggs miss crawley said kindly  would it not be a privilege to be miss crawleys sister briggs replied with meek evasion  well becky would have made a good lady crawley after all miss crawley remarked who was mollified by the girls refusal and very liberal and generous now there was no call for her sacrifices she has brains in plenty much more wit in her little finger than you have my poor dear briggs in all your head  her manners are excellent now i have formed her  she is a montmorency briggs and blood is something though i despise it for my part and she would have held her own amongst those pompous stupid hampshire people much better than that unfortunate ironmongers daughter  briggs coincided as usual and the previous attachment was then discussed in conjectures  you poor friendless creatures are always having some foolish tendre miss crawley said  you yourself you know were in love with a writingmaster dont cry briggsyoure always crying and it wont bring him to life again and i suppose this unfortunate becky has been silly and sentimental toosome apothecary or housesteward or painter or young curate or something of that sort  poor thing poor thing says briggs who was thinking of twentyfour years back and that hectic young writingmaster whose lock of yellow hair and whose letters beautiful in their illegibility she cherished in her old desk upstairs  poor thing poor thing says briggs once more she was a freshcheeked lass of eighteen she was at evening church and the hectic writingmaster and she were quavering out of the same psalmbook  after such conduct on rebeccas part miss crawley said enthusiastically our family should do something find out who is the objet briggs  ill set him up in a shop or order my portrait of him you know or speak to my cousin the bishop and ill doter becky and well have a wedding briggs and you shall make the breakfast and be a bridesmaid  briggs declared that it would be delightful and vowed that her dear miss crawley was always kind and generous and went up to rebeccas bedroom to console her and prattle about the offer and the refusal and the cause thereof and to hint at the generous intentions of miss crawley and to find out who was the gentleman that had the mastery of miss sharps heart  rebecca was very kind very affectionate and affectedresponded to briggss offer of tenderness with grateful fervourowned there was a secret attachmenta delicious mysterywhat a pity miss briggs had not remained half a minute longer at the keyhole  rebecca might perhaps have told more but five minutes after miss briggss arrival in rebeccas apartment miss crawley actually made her appearance therean unheardof honourher impatience had overcome her she could not wait for the tardy operations of her ambassadress so she came in person and ordered briggs out of the room and expressing her approval of rebeccas conduct she asked particulars of the interview and the previous transactions which had brought about the astonishing offer of sir pitt  rebecca said she had long had some notion of the partiality with which sir pitt honoured her for he was in the habit of making his feelings known in a very frank and unreserved manner but not to mention private reasons with which she would not for the present trouble miss crawley sir pitts age station and habits were such as to render a marriage quite impossible and could a woman with any feeling of selfrespect and any decency listen to proposals at such a moment when the funeral of the lovers deceased wife had not actually taken place  nonsense my dear you would never have refused him had there not been some one else in the case miss crawley said coming to her point at once  tell me the private reasons what are the private reasons there is some one who is it that has touched your heart  rebecca cast down her eyes and owned there was you have guessed right dear lady she said with a sweet simple faltering voice you wonder at one so poor and friendless having an attachment dont you i have never heard that poverty was any safeguard against it  i wish it were  my poor dear child cried miss crawley who was always quite ready to be sentimental is our passion unrequited then  are we pining in secret tell me all and let me console you  i wish you could dear madam rebecca said in the same tearful tone indeed indeed i need it and she laid her head upon miss crawleys shoulder and wept there so naturally that the old lady surprised into sympathy embraced her with an almost maternal kindness uttered many soothing protests of regard and affection for her vowed that she loved her as a daughter and would do everything in her power to serve her and now who is it my dear  is it that pretty miss sedleys brother you said something about an affair with him ill ask him here my dear  and you shall have him indeed you shall  dont ask me now rebecca said  you shall know all soon  indeed you shall  dear kind miss crawleydear friend may i say so  that you may my child the old lady replied kissing her  i cant tell you now sobbed out rebecca i am very miserable but o love me alwayspromise you will love me always and in the midst of mutual tearsfor the emotions of the younger woman had awakened the sympathies of the elderthis promise was solemnly given by miss crawley who left her little protege blessing and admiring her as a dear artless tenderhearted affectionate incomprehensible creature  and now she was left alone to think over the sudden and wonderful events of the day and of what had been and what might have been what think you were the private feelings of miss no begging her pardon of mrs rebecca  if a few pages back the present writer claimed the privilege of peeping into miss amelia sedleys bedroom and understanding with the omniscience of the novelist all the gentle pains and passions which were tossing upon that innocent pillow why should he not declare himself to be rebeccas confidante too master of her secrets and sealkeeper of that young womans conscience  well then in the first place rebecca gave way to some very sincere and touching regrets that a piece of marvellous good fortune should have been so near her and she actually obliged to decline it  in this natural emotion every properly regulated mind will certainly share what good mother is there that would not commiserate a penniless spinster who might have been my lady and have shared four thousand a year  what wellbred young person is there in all vanity fair who will not feel for a hardworking ingenious meritorious girl who gets such an honourable advantageous provoking offer just at the very moment when it is out of her power to accept it  i am sure our friend beckys disappointment deserves and will command every sympathy  i remember one night being in the fair myself at an evening party i observed old miss toady there also present single out for her special attentions and flattery little mrs briefless the barristers wife who is of a good family certainly but as we all know is as poor as poor can be  what i asked in my own mind can cause this obsequiousness on the part of miss toady has briefless got a county court or has his wife had a fortune left her miss toady explained presently with that simplicity which distinguishes all her conduct  you know she said mrs briefless is granddaughter of sir john redhand who is so ill at cheltenham that he cant last six months  mrs brieflesss papa succeeds so you see she will be a baronets daughter and toady asked briefless and his wife to dinner the very next week  if the mere chance of becoming a baronets daughter can procure a lady such homage in the world surely surely we may respect the agonies of a young woman who has lost the opportunity of becoming a baronets wife  who would have dreamed of lady crawley dying so soon  she was one of those sickly women that might have lasted these ten yearsrebecca thought to herself in all the woes of repentanceand i might have been my lady  i might have led that old man whither i would  i might have thanked mrs bute for her patronage and mr pitt for his insufferable condescension  i would have had the townhouse newly furnished and decorated  i would have had the handsomest carriage in london and a box at the opera and i would have been presented next season  all this might have been and nownow all was doubt and mystery  but rebecca was a young lady of too much resolution and energy of character to permit herself much useless and unseemly sorrow for the irrevocable past so having devoted only the proper portion of regret to it she wisely turned her whole attention towards the future which was now vastly more important to her  and she surveyed her position and its hopes doubts and chances  in the first place she was marriedthat was a great fact  sir pitt knew it  she was not so much surprised into the avowal as induced to make it by a sudden calculation it must have come some day and why not now as at a later period he who would have married her himself must at least be silent with regard to her marriage how miss crawley would bear the newswas the great question misgivings rebecca had but she remembered all miss crawley had said the old ladys avowed contempt for birth her daring liberal opinions her general romantic propensities her almost doting attachment to her nephew and her repeatedly expressed fondness for rebecca herself  she is so fond of him rebecca thought that she will forgive him anything she is so used to me that i dont think she could be comfortable without me when the eclaircissement comes there will be a scene and hysterics and a great quarrel and then a great reconciliation  at all events what use was there in delaying the die was thrown and now or tomorrow the issue must be the same  and so resolved that miss crawley should have the news the young person debated in her mind as to the best means of conveying it to her and whether she should face the storm that must come or fly and avoid it until its first fury was blown over  in this state of meditation she wrote the following letter  dearest friend  the great crisis which we have debated about so often is come  half of my secret is known and i have thought and thought until i am quite sure that now is the time to reveal the whole of the mystery sir pitt came to me this morning and madewhat do you thinka declaration in form  think of that  poor little me  i might have been lady crawley how pleased mrs bute would have been and ma tante if i had taken precedence of her i might have been somebodys mamma instead ofo i tremble i tremble when i think how soon we must tell all  sir pitt knows i am married and not knowing to whom is not very much displeased as yet  ma tante is actually angry that i should have refused him  but she is all kindness and graciousness  she condescends to say i would have made him a good wife and vows that she will be a mother to your little rebecca  she will be shaken when she first hears the news  but need we fear anything beyond a momentary anger  i think not i am sure not  she dotes upon you so you naughty goodfornothing man that she would pardon you anything and indeed i believe the next place in her heart is mine and that she would be miserable without me dearest something tells me we shall conquer  you shall leave that odious regiment quit gaming racing and be a good boy and we shall all live in park lane and ma tante shall leave us all her money  i shall try and walk tomorrow at 3 in the usual place if miss b accompanies me you must come to dinner and bring an answer and put it in the third volume of porteuss sermons  but at all events come to your own  r  to miss eliza styles at mr barnets saddler knightsbridge  and i trust there is no reader of this little story who has not discernment enough to perceive that the miss eliza styles an old schoolfellow rebecca said with whom she had resumed an active correspondence of late and who used to fetch these letters from the saddlers wore brass spurs and large curling mustachios and was indeed no other than captain rawdon crawley    chapter xvi  the letter on the pincushion  how they were married is not of the slightest consequence to anybody what is to hinder a captain who is a major and a young lady who is of age from purchasing a licence and uniting themselves at any church in this town  who needs to be told that if a woman has a will she will assuredly find a waymy belief is that one day when miss sharp had gone to pass the forenoon with her dear friend miss amelia sedley in russell square a lady very like her might have been seen entering a church in the city in company with a gentleman with dyed mustachios who after a quarter of an hours interval escorted her back to the hackneycoach in waiting and that this was a quiet bridal party  and who on earth after the daily experience we have can question the probability of a gentleman marrying anybody how many of the wise and learned have married their cooks  did not lord eldon himself the most prudent of men make a runaway match were not achilles and ajax both in love with their servant maids and are we to expect a heavy dragoon with strong desires and small brains who had never controlled a passion in his life to become prudent all of a sudden and to refuse to pay any price for an indulgence to which he had a mind  if people only made prudent marriages what a stop to population there would be  it seems to me for my part that mr rawdons marriage was one of the honestest actions which we shall have to record in any portion of that gentlemans biography which has to do with the present history  no one will say it is unmanly to be captivated by a woman or being captivated to marry her and the admiration the delight the passion the wonder the unbounded confidence and frantic adoration with which by degrees this big warrior got to regard the little rebecca were feelings which the ladies at least will pronounce were not altogether discreditable to him  when she sang every note thrilled in his dull soul and tingled through his huge frame  when she spoke he brought all the force of his brains to listen and wonder if she was jocular he used to revolve her jokes in his mind and explode over them half an hour afterwards in the street to the surprise of the groom in the tilbury by his side or the comrade riding with him in rotten row her words were oracles to him her smallest actions marked by an infallible grace and wisdom how she singshow she paints thought he  how she rode that kicking mare at queens crawley  and he would say to her in confidential moments by jove beck youre fit to be commanderinchief or archbishop of canterbury by jove  is his case a rare one and dont we see every day in the world many an honest hercules at the apronstrings of omphale and great whiskered samsons prostrate in delilahs lap  when then becky told him that the great crisis was near and the time for action had arrived rawdon expressed himself as ready to act under her orders as he would be to charge with his troop at the command of his colonel  there was no need for him to put his letter into the third volume of porteus  rebecca easily found a means to get rid of briggs her companion and met her faithful friend in the usual place on the next day  she had thought over matters at night and communicated to rawdon the result of her determinations he agreed of course to everything was quite sure that it was all right that what she proposed was best that miss crawley would infallibly relent or come round as he said after a time  had rebeccas resolutions been entirely different he would have followed them as implicitly  you have head enough for both of us beck said he  youre sure to get us out of the scrape  i never saw your equal and ive met with some clippers in my time too and with this simple confession of faith the lovestricken dragoon left her to execute his part of the project which she had formed for the pair  it consisted simply in the hiring of quiet lodgings at brompton or in the neighbourhood of the barracks for captain and mrs crawley for rebecca had determined and very prudently we think to fly rawdon was only too happy at her resolve he had been entreating her to take this measure any time for weeks past  he pranced off to engage the lodgings with all the impetuosity of love  he agreed to pay two guineas a week so readily that the landlady regretted she had asked him so little he ordered in a piano and half a nurseryhouse full of flowers and a heap of good things  as for shawls kid gloves silk stockings gold french watches bracelets and perfumery he sent them in with the profusion of blind love and unbounded credit  and having relieved his mind by this outpouring of generosity he went and dined nervously at the club waiting until the great moment of his life should come  the occurrences of the previous day the admirable conduct of rebecca in refusing an offer so advantageous to her the secret unhappiness preying upon her the sweetness and silence with which she bore her affliction made miss crawley much more tender than usual  an event of this nature a marriage or a refusal or a proposal thrills through a whole household of women and sets all their hysterical sympathies at work  as an observer of human nature i regularly frequent st georges hanover square during the genteel marriage season and though i have never seen the bridegrooms male friends give way to tears or the beadles and officiating clergy any way affected yet it is not at all uncommon to see women who are not in the least concerned in the operations going onold ladies who are long past marrying stout middleaged females with plenty of sons and daughters let alone pretty young creatures in pink bonnets who are on their promotion and may naturally take an interest in the ceremonyi say it is quite common to see the women present piping sobbing sniffling hiding their little faces in their little useless pockethandkerchiefs and heaving old and young with emotion  when my friend the fashionable john pimlico married the lovely lady belgravia green parker the excitement was so general that even the little snuffy old pewopener who let me into the seat was in tears  and wherefore i inquired of my own soul she was not going to be married  miss crawley and briggs in a word after the affair of sir pitt indulged in the utmost luxury of sentiment and rebecca became an object of the most tender interest to them  in her absence miss crawley solaced herself with the most sentimental of the novels in her library  little sharp with her secret griefs was the heroine of the day  that night rebecca sang more sweetly and talked more pleasantly than she had ever been heard to do in park lane  she twined herself round the heart of miss crawley she spoke lightly and laughingly of sir pitts proposal ridiculed it as the foolish fancy of an old man and her eyes filled with tears and briggss heart with unutterable pangs of defeat as she said she desired no other lot than to remain for ever with her dear benefactress  my dear little creature the old lady said i dont intend to let you stir for years that you may depend upon it  as for going back to that odious brother of mine after what has passed it is out of the question  here you stay with me and briggs  briggs wants to go to see her relations very often  briggs you may go when you like but as for you my dear you must stay and take care of the old woman  if rawdon crawley had been then and there present instead of being at the club nervously drinking claret the pair might have gone down on their knees before the old spinster avowed all and been forgiven in a twinkling but that good chance was denied to the young couple doubtless in order that this story might be written in which numbers of their wonderful adventures are narratedadventures which could never have occurred to them if they had been housed and sheltered under the comfortable uninteresting forgiveness of miss crawley  under mrs firkins orders in the park lane establishment was a young woman from hampshire whose business it was among other duties to knock at miss sharps door with that jug of hot water which firkin would rather have perished than have presented to the intruder  this girl bred on the family estate had a brother in captain crawleys troop and if the truth were known i daresay it would come out that she was aware of certain arrangements which have a great deal to do with this history at any rate she purchased a yellow shawl a pair of green boots and a light blue hat with a red feather with three guineas which rebecca gave her and as little sharp was by no means too liberal with her money no doubt it was for services rendered that betty martin was so bribed  on the second day after sir pitt crawleys offer to miss sharp the sun rose as usual and at the usual hour betty martin the upstairs maid knocked at the door of the governesss bedchamber  no answer was returned and she knocked again  silence was still uninterrupted and betty with the hot water opened the door and entered the chamber  the little white dimity bed was as smooth and trim as on the day previous when bettys own hands had helped to make it  two little trunks were corded in one end of the room and on the table before the windowon the pincushion the great fat pincushion lined with pink inside and twilled like a ladys nightcaplay a letter  it had been reposing there probably all night  betty advanced towards it on tiptoe as if she were afraid to awake itlooked at it and round the room with an air of great wonder and satisfaction took up the letter and grinned intensely as she turned it round and over and finally carried it into miss briggss room below  how could betty tell that the letter was for miss briggs i should like to know  all the schooling betty had had was at mrs bute crawleys sunday school and she could no more read writing than hebrew  la miss briggs the girl exclaimed o miss something must have happenedtheres nobody in miss sharps room the bed aint been slep in and sheve run away and left this letter for you miss  what cries briggs dropping her comb the thin wisp of faded hair falling over her shoulders an elopement miss sharp a fugitive what what is this and she eagerly broke the neat seal and as they say devoured the contents of the letter addressed to her  dear miss briggs the refugee wrote the kindest heart in the world as yours is will pity and sympathise with me and excuse me with tears and prayers and blessings i leave the home where the poor orphan has ever met with kindness and affection  claims even superior to those of my benefactress call me hence  i go to my dutyto my husband  yes i am married  my husband commands me to seek the humble home which we call ours  dearest miss briggs break the news as your delicate sympathy will know how to do itto my dear my beloved friend and benefactress  tell her ere i went i shed tears on her dear pillowthat pillow that i have so often soothed in sicknessthat i long again to watchoh with what joy shall i return to dear park lane how i tremble for the answer which is to seal my fate when sir pitt deigned to offer me his hand an honour of which my beloved miss crawley said i was deserving my blessings go with her for judging the poor orphan worthy to be her sister i told sir pitt that i was already a wife  even he forgave me  but my courage failed me when i should have told him allthat i could not be his wife for i was his daughter  i am wedded to the best and most generous of menmiss crawleys rawdon is my rawdon at his command i open my lips and follow him to our humble home as i would through the world  o my excellent and kind friend intercede with my rawdons beloved aunt for him and the poor girl to whom all his noble race have shown such unparalleled affection  ask miss crawley to receive her children  i can say no more but blessings blessings on all in the dear house i leave prays  your affectionate and grateful rebecca crawley midnight  just as briggs had finished reading this affecting and interesting document which reinstated her in her position as first confidante of miss crawley mrs firkin entered the room  heres mrs bute crawley just arrived by the mail from hampshire and wants some tea will you come down and make breakfast miss  and to the surprise of firkin clasping her dressinggown around her the wisp of hair floating dishevelled behind her the little curlpapers still sticking in bunches round her forehead briggs sailed down to mrs bute with the letter in her hand containing the wonderful news  oh mrs firkin gasped betty sech a business  miss sharp have a gone and run away with the capting and theyre off to gretney green we would devote a chapter to describe the emotions of mrs firkin did not the passions of her mistresses occupy our genteeler muse  when mrs bute crawley numbed with midnight travelling and warming herself at the newly crackling parlour fire heard from miss briggs the intelligence of the clandestine marriage she declared it was quite providential that she should have arrived at such a time to assist poor dear miss crawley in supporting the shockthat rebecca was an artful little hussy of whom she had always had her suspicions and that as for rawdon crawley she never could account for his aunts infatuation regarding him and had long considered him a profligate lost and abandoned being  and this awful conduct mrs bute said will have at least this good effect it will open poor dear miss crawleys eyes to the real character of this wicked man  then mrs bute had a comfortable hot toast and tea and as there was a vacant room in the house now there was no need for her to remain at the gloster coffee house where the portsmouth mail had set her down and whence she ordered mr bowlss aidedecamp the footman to bring away her trunks  miss crawley be it known did not leave her room until near noontaking chocolate in bed in the morning while becky sharp read the morning post to her or otherwise amusing herself or dawdling  the conspirators below agreed that they would spare the dear ladys feelings until she appeared in her drawingroom meanwhile it was announced to her that mrs bute crawley had come up from hampshire by the mail was staying at the gloster sent her love to miss crawley and asked for breakfast with miss briggs  the arrival of mrs bute which would not have caused any extreme delight at another period was hailed with pleasure now miss crawley being pleased at the notion of a gossip with her sisterinlaw regarding the late lady crawley the funeral arrangements pending and sir pitts abrupt proposal to rebecca  it was not until the old lady was fairly ensconced in her usual armchair in the drawingroom and the preliminary embraces and inquiries had taken place between the ladies that the conspirators thought it advisable to submit her to the operation  who has not admired the artifices and delicate approaches with which women prepare their friends for bad news  miss crawleys two friends made such an apparatus of mystery before they broke the intelligence to her that they worked her up to the necessary degree of doubt and alarm  and she refused sir pitt my dear dear miss crawley prepare yourself for it mrs bute said becausebecause she couldnt help herself  of course there was a reason miss crawley answered she liked somebody else  i told briggs so yesterday  likes somebody else briggs gasped  o my dear friend she is married already  married already mrs bute chimed in and both sate with clasped hands looking from each other at their victim  send her to me the instant she comes in  the little sly wretch how dared she not tell me cried out miss crawley  she wont come in soon  prepare yourself dear friendshes gone out for a long timeshesshes gone altogether  gracious goodness and whos to make my chocolate send for her and have her back i desire that she come back the old lady said  she decamped last night maam cried mrs bute  she left a letter for me briggs exclaimed  shes married to  prepare her for heavens sake  dont torture her my dear miss briggs  shes married to whom cries the spinster in a nervous fury  toto a relation of  she refused sir pitt cried the victim  speak at once dont drive me mad  o maamprepare her miss briggsshes married to rawdon crawley  rawdon married

lady screamed in hysteric sentences  i maam ask a member of this family to marry a drawingmasters daughter  her mother was a montmorency cried out the old lady pulling at the bell with all her might  her mother was an opera girl and she has been on the stage or worse herself said mrs bute  miss crawley gave a final scream and fell back in a faint  they were forced to take her back to the room which she had just quitted one fit of hysterics succeeded another  the doctor was sent forthe apothecary arrived mrs bute took up the post of nurse by her bedside her relations ought to be round about her that amiable woman said  she had scarcely been carried up to her room when a new person arrived to whom it was also necessary to break the news  this was sir pitt wheres becky he said coming in  wheres her traps shes coming with me to queens crawley  have you not heard the astonishing intelligence regarding her surreptitious union briggs asked  whats that to me sir pitt asked  i know shes married  that makes no odds  tell her to come down at once and not keep me  are you not aware sir miss briggs asked that she has left our roof to the dismay of miss crawley who is nearly killed by the intelligence of captain rawdons union with her  when sir pitt crawley heard that rebecca was married to his son he broke out into a fury of language which it would do no good to repeat in this place as indeed it sent poor briggs shuddering out of the room and with her we will shut the door upon the figure of the frenzied old man wild with hatred and insane with baffled desire  one day after he went to queens crawley he burst like a madman into the room she had used when theredashed open her boxes with his foot and flung about her papers clothes and other relics miss horrocks the butlers daughter took some of them  the children dressed themselves and acted plays in the others  it was but a few days after the poor mother had gone to her lonely buryingplace and was laid unwept and disregarded in a vault full of strangers  suppose the old lady doesnt come to rawdon said to his little wife as they sate together in the snug little brompton lodgings she had been trying the new piano all the morning  the new gloves fitted her to a nicety the new shawls became her wonderfully the new rings glittered on her little hands and the new watch ticked at her waist suppose she dont come round eh becky  ill make your fortune she said and delilah patted samsons cheek  you can do anything he said kissing the little hand by jove you can and well drive down to the star and garter and dine by jove    chapter xvii  how captain dobbin bought a piano  if there is any exhibition in all vanity fair which satire and sentiment can visit arm in arm together where you light on the strangest contrasts laughable and tearful where you may be gentle and pathetic or savage and cynical with perfect propriety it is at one of those public assemblies a crowd of which are advertised every day in the last page of the times newspaper and over which the late mr george robins used to preside with so much dignity there are very few london people as i fancy who have not attended at these meetings and all with a taste for moralizing must have thought with a sensation and interest not a little startling and queer of the day when their turn shall come too and mr hammerdown will sell by the orders of diogenes assignees or will be instructed by the executors to offer to public competition the library furniture plate wardrobe and choice cellar of wines of epicurus deceased  even with the most selfish disposition the vanity fairian as he witnesses this sordid part of the obsequies of a departed friend cant but feel some sympathies and regret my lord divess remains are in the family vault the statuaries are cutting an inscription veraciously commemorating his virtues and the sorrows of his heir who is disposing of his goods  what guest at divess table can pass the familiar house without a sighthe familiar house of which the lights used to shine so cheerfully at seven oclock of which the halldoors opened so readily of which the obsequious servants as you passed up the comfortable stair sounded your name from landing to landing until it reached the apartment where jolly old dives welcomed his friends what a number of them he had and what a noble way of entertaining them  how witty people used to be here who were morose when they got out of the door and how courteous and friendly men who slandered and hated each other everywhere else  he was pompous but with such a cook what would one not swallow he was rather dull perhaps but would not such wine make any conversation pleasant  we must get some of his burgundy at any price the mourners cry at his club  i got

changed the house is though  the front is patched over with bills setting forth the particulars of the furniture in staring capitals  they have hung a shred of carpet out of an upstairs windowa half dozen of porters are lounging on the dirty stepsthe hall swarms with dingy guests of oriental countenance who thrust printed cards into your hand and offer to bid  old women and amateurs have invaded the upper apartments pinching the bedcurtains poking into the feathers shampooing the mattresses and clapping the wardrobe drawers to and fro enterprising young housekeepers are measuring the lookingglasses and hangings to see if they will suit the new menage snob will brag for years that he has purchased this or that at divess sale and mr hammerdown is sitting on the great mahogany diningtables in the diningroom below waving the ivory hammer and employing all the artifices of eloquence enthusiasm entreaty reason despair shouting to his people satirizing mr davids for his sluggishness inspiriting mr moss into action imploring commanding bellowing until down comes the hammer like fate and we pass to the next lot  o dives who would ever have thought as we sat round the broad table sparkling with plate and spotless linen to have seen such a dish at the head of it as that roaring auctioneer  it was rather late in the sale  the excellent drawingroom furniture by the best makers the rare and famous wines selected regardless of cost and with the wellknown taste of the purchaser the rich and complete set of family plate had been sold on the previous days certain of the best wines which all had a great character among amateurs in the neighbourhood had been purchased for his master who knew them very well by the butler of our friend john osborne esquire of russell square  a small portion of the most useful articles of the plate had been bought by some young stockbrokers from the city  and now the public being invited to the purchase of minor objects it happened that the orator on the table was expatiating on the merits of a picture which he sought to recommend to his audience it was by no means so select or numerous a company as had attended the previous days of the auction  no 369 roared mr hammerdown  portrait of a gentleman on an elephant  wholl bid for the gentleman on the elephant  lift up the picture blowman and let the company examine this lot a long pale militarylooking gentleman seated demurely at the mahogany table could not help grinning as this valuable lot was shown by mr blowman turn the elephant to the captain blowman  what shall we say sir for the elephant but the captain blushing in a very hurried and discomfited manner turned away his head  shall we say twenty guineas for this work of artfifteen five name your own price  the gentleman without the elephant is worth five pound  i wonder it aint come down with him said a professional wag hes anyhow a precious big one at which for the elephantrider was represented as of a very stout figure there was a general giggle in the room  dont be trying to deprecate the value of the lot mr moss mr hammerdown said let the company examine it as a work of artthe attitude of the gallant animal quite according to natur the gentleman in a nankeen jacket his gun in his hand is going to the chase in the distance a banyhann tree and a pagody most likely resemblances of some interesting spot in our famous eastern possessions  how much for this lot come gentlemen dont keep me here all day  some one bid five shillings at which the military gentleman looked towards the quarter from which this splendid offer had come and there saw another officer with a young lady on his arm who both appeared to be highly amused with the scene and to whom finally this lot was knocked down for half a guinea  he at the table looked more surprised and discomposed than ever when he spied this pair and his head sank into his military collar and he turned his back upon them so as to avoid them altogether  of all the other articles which mr hammerdown had the honour to offer for public competition that day it is not our purpose to make mention save of one only a little square piano which came down from the upper regions of the house the state grand piano having been disposed of previously this the young lady tried with a rapid and skilful hand making the officer blush and start again and for it when its turn came her agent began to bid  but there was an opposition here  the hebrew aidedecamp in the service of the officer at the table bid against the hebrew gentleman employed by the elephant purchasers and a brisk battle ensued over this little piano the combatants being greatly encouraged by mr hammerdown  at last when the competition had been prolonged for some time the elephant captain and lady desisted from the race and the hammer coming down the auctioneer saidmr lewis twentyfive and mr lewiss chief thus became the proprietor of the little square piano having effected the purchase he sate up as if he was greatly relieved and the unsuccessful competitors catching a glimpse of him at this moment the lady said to her friend  why rawdon its captain dobbin  i suppose becky was discontented with the new piano her husband had hired for her or perhaps the proprietors of that instrument had fetched it away declining farther credit or perhaps she had a particular attachment for the one which she had just tried to purchase recollecting it in old days when she used to play upon it in the little sittingroom of our dear amelia sedley  the sale was at the old house in russell square where we passed some evenings together at the beginning of this story  good old john sedley was a ruined man  his name had been proclaimed as a defaulter on the stock exchange and his bankruptcy and commercial extermination had followed  mr osbornes butler came to buy some of the famous port wine to transfer to the cellars over the way as for one dozen wellmanufactured silver spoons and forks at per oz and one dozen dessert ditto ditto there were three young stockbrokers messrs dale spiggot and dale of threadneedle street indeed who having had dealings with the old man and kindnesses from him in days when he was kind to everybody with whom he dealt sent this little spar out of the wreck with their love to good mrs sedley and with respect to the piano as it had been amelias and as she might miss it and want one now and as captain william dobbin could no more play upon it than he could dance on the tight rope it is probable that he did not purchase the instrument for his own use  in a word it arrived that evening at a wonderful small cottage in a street leading from the fulham roadone of those streets which have the finest romantic namesthis was called st adelaide villas annamaria road west where the houses look like babyhouses where the people looking out of the firstfloor windows must infallibly as you think sit with their feet in the parlours where the shrubs in the little gardens in front bloom with a perennial display of little childrens pinafores little red socks caps c polyandria polygynia whence you hear the sound of jingling spinets and women singing where little porter pots hang on the railings sunning themselves whither of evenings you see city clerks padding wearily here it was that mr clapp the clerk of mr sedley had his domicile and in this asylum the good old gentleman hid his head with his wife and daughter when the crash came  jos sedley had acted as a man of his disposition would when the announcement of the family misfortune reached him  he did not come to london but he wrote to his mother to draw upon his agents for whatever money was wanted so that his kind brokenspirited old parents had no present poverty to fear  this done jos went on at the boardinghouse at cheltenham pretty much as before  he drove his curricle he drank his claret he played his rubber he told his indian stories and the irish widow consoled and flattered him as usual his present of money needful as it was made little impression on his parents and i have heard amelia say that the first day on which she saw her father lift up his head after the failure was on the receipt of the packet of forks and spoons with the young stockbrokers love over which he burst out crying like a child being greatly more affected than even his wife to whom the present was addressed  edward dale the junior of the house who purchased the spoons for the firm was in fact very sweet upon amelia and offered for her in spite of all he married miss louisa cutts daughter of higham and cutts the eminent cornfactors with a handsome fortune in 1820 and is now living in splendour and with a numerous family at his elegant villa muswell hill  but we must not let the recollections of this good fellow cause us to diverge from the principal history  i hope the reader has much too good an opinion of captain and mrs crawley to suppose that they ever would have dreamed of paying a visit to so remote a district as bloomsbury if they thought the family whom they proposed to honour with a visit were not merely out of fashion but out of money and could be serviceable to them in no possible manner  rebecca was entirely surprised at the sight of the comfortable old house where she had met with no small kindness ransacked by brokers and bargainers and its quiet family treasures given up to public desecration and plunder  a month after her flight she had bethought her of amelia and rawdon with a horselaugh had expressed a perfect willingness to see young george osborne again  hes a very agreeable acquaintance beck the wag added  id like to sell him another horse beck  id like to play a few more games at billiards with him  hed be what i call useful just now mrs cha ha by which sort of speech it is not to be supposed that rawdon crawley had a deliberate desire to cheat mr osborne at play but only wished to take that fair advantage of him which almost every sporting gentleman in vanity fair considers to be his due from his neighbour  the old aunt was long in comingto a month had elapsed  rawdon was denied the door by mr bowls his servants could not get a lodgment in the house at park lane his letters were sent back unopened  miss crawley never stirred outshe was unwelland mrs bute remained still and never left her  crawley and his wife both of them augured evil from the continued presence of mrs bute  gad i begin to perceive now why she was always bringing us together at queens crawley rawdon said  what an artful little woman ejaculated rebecca  well i dont regret it if you dont the captain cried still in an amorous rapture with his wife who rewarded him with a kiss by way of reply and was indeed not a little gratified by the generous confidence of her husband  if he had but a little more brains she thought to herself i might make something of him but she never let him perceive the opinion she had of him listened with indefatigable complacency to his stories of the stable and the mess laughed at all his jokes felt the greatest interest in jack spatterdash whose cabhorse had come down and bob martingale who had been taken up in a gamblinghouse and tom cinqbars who was going to ride the steeplechase when he came home she was alert and happy when he went out she pressed him to go when he stayed at home she played and sang for him made him good drinks superintended his dinner warmed his slippers and steeped his soul in comfort  the best of women i have heard my grandmother say are hypocrites  we dont know how much they hide from us how watchful they are when they seem most artless and confidential how often those frank smiles which they wear so easily are traps to cajole or elude or disarmi dont mean in your mere coquettes but your domestic models and paragons of female virtue who has not seen a woman hide the dulness of a stupid husband or coax the fury of a savage one  we accept this amiable slavishness and praise a woman for it we call this pretty treachery truth  a good housewife is of necessity a humbug and cornelias husband was hoodwinked as potiphar wasonly in a different way  by these attentions that veteran rake rawdon crawley found himself converted into a very happy and submissive married man  his former haunts knew him not they asked about him once or twice at his clubs but did not miss him much in those booths of vanity fair people seldom do miss each other  his secluded wife ever smiling and cheerful his little comfortable lodgings snug meals and homely evenings had all the charms of novelty and secrecy  the marriage was not yet declared to the world or published in the morning post  all his creditors would have come rushing on him in a body had they known that he was united to a woman without fortune my relations wont cry fie upon me becky said with rather a bitter laugh and she was quite contented to wait until the old aunt should be reconciled before she claimed her place in society  so she lived at brompton and meanwhile saw no one or only those few of her husbands male companions who were admitted into her little diningroom  these were all charmed with her the little dinners the laughing and chatting the music afterwards delighted all who participated in these enjoyments  major martingale never thought about asking to see the marriage licence captain cinqbars was perfectly enchanted with her skill in making punch  and young lieutenant spatterdash who was fond of piquet and whom crawley would often invite was evidently and quickly smitten by mrs crawley but her own circumspection and modesty never forsook her for a moment and crawleys reputation as a fireeating and jealous warrior was a further and complete defence to his little wife  there are gentlemen of very good blood and fashion in this city who never have entered a ladys drawingroom so that though rawdon crawleys marriage might be talked about in his county where of course mrs bute had spread the news in london it was doubted or not heeded or not talked about at all  he lived comfortably on credit he had a large capital of debts which laid out judiciously will carry a man along for many years and on which certain men about town contrive to live a hundred times better than even men with ready money can do  indeed who is there that walks london streets but can point out a halfdozen of men riding by him splendidly while he is on foot courted by fashion bowed into their carriages by tradesmen denying themselves nothing and living on who knows what  we see jack thriftless prancing in the park or darting in his brougham down pall mall we eat his dinners served on his miraculous plate  how did this begin we say or where will it end my dear fellow i heard jack once say i owe money in every capital in europe  the end must come some day but in the meantime jack thrives as much as ever people are glad enough to shake him by the hand ignore the little dark stories that are whispered every now and then against him and pronounce him a goodnatured jovial reckless fellow  truth obliges us to confess that rebecca had married a gentleman of this order  everything was plentiful in his house but ready money of which their menage pretty early felt the want and reading the gazette one day and coming upon the announcement of lieutenant g osborne to be captain by purchase vice smith who exchanges rawdon uttered that sentiment regarding amelias lover which ended in the visit to russell square  when rawdon and his wife wished to communicate with captain dobbin at the sale and to know particulars of the catastrophe which had befallen rebeccas old acquaintances the captain had vanished and such information as they got was from a stray porter or broker at the auction  look at them with their hooked beaks becky said getting into the buggy her picture under her arm in great glee  theyre like vultures after a battle  dont know  never was in action my dear  ask martingale he was in spain aidedecamp to general blazes  he was a very kind old man mr sedley rebecca said im really sorry hes gone wrong  o stockbrokersbankruptsused to it you know rawdon replied cutting a fly off the horses ear  i wish we could have afforded some of the plate rawdon the wife continued sentimentally  fiveandtwenty guineas was monstrously dear for that little piano we chose it at broadwoods for amelia when she came from school  it only cost fiveandthirty then  whatdyecallemosborne will cry off now i suppose since the family is smashed  how cut up your pretty little friend will be hey becky  i daresay shell recover it becky said with a smileand they drove on and talked about something else    chapter xviii  who played on the piano captain dobbin bought  our surprised story now finds itself for a moment among very famous events and personages and hanging on to the skirts of history when the eagles of napoleon bonaparte the corsican upstart were flying from provence where they had perched after a brief sojourn in elba and from steeple to steeple until they reached the towers of notre dame i wonder whether the imperial birds had any eye for a little corner of the parish of bloomsbury london which you might have thought so quiet that even the whirring and flapping of those mighty wings would pass unobserved there  napoleon has landed at cannes  such news might create a panic at vienna and cause russia to drop his cards and take prussia into a corner and talleyrand and metternich to wag their heads together while prince hardenberg and even the present marquis of londonderry were puzzled but how was this intelligence to affect a young lady in russell square before whose door the watchman sang the hours when she was asleep who if she strolled in the square was guarded there by the railings and the beadle  who if she walked ever so short a distance to buy a ribbon in southampton row was followed by black sambo with an enormous cane  who was always cared for dressed put to bed and watched over by ever so many guardian angels with and without wages  bon dieu i say is it not hard that the fateful rush of the great imperial struggle cant take place without affecting a poor little harmless girl of eighteen who is occupied in billing and cooing or working muslin collars in russell square  you too kindly homely floweris the great roaring war tempest coming to sweep you down here although cowering under the shelter of holborn  yes napoleon is flinging his last stake and poor little emmy sedleys happiness forms somehow part of it  in the first place her fathers fortune was swept down with that fatal news  all his speculations had of late gone wrong with the luckless old gentleman  ventures had failed merchants had broken funds had risen when he calculated they would fall  what need to particularize if success is rare and slow everybody knows how quick and easy ruin is  old sedley had kept his own sad counsel everything seemed to go on as usual in the quiet opulent house the goodnatured mistress pursuing quite unsuspiciously her bustling idleness and daily easy avocations the daughter absorbed still in one selfish tender thought and quite regardless of all the world besides when that final crash came under which the worthy family fell  one night mrs sedley was writing cards for a party the osbornes had given one and she must not be behindhand john sedley who had come home very late from the city sate silent at the chimney side while his wife was prattling to him emmy had gone up to her room ailing and lowspirited  shes not happy the mother went on george osborne neglects her  ive no patience with the airs of those people  the girls have not been in the house these three weeks and george has been twice in town without coming  edward dale saw him at the opera edward would marry her im sure and theres captain dobbin who i think wouldonly i hate all army men  such a dandy as george has become  with his military airs indeed  we must show some folks that were as good as they  only give edward dale any encouragement and youll see  we must have a party mr s  why dont you speak john shall i say tuesday fortnight why dont you answer good god john what has happened  john sedley sprang up out of his chair to meet his wife who ran to him  he seized her in his arms and said with a hasty voice were ruined mary  weve got the world to begin over again dear  its best that you should know all and at once  as he spoke he trembled in every limb and almost fell  he thought the news would have overpowered his wifehis wife to whom he had never said a hard word but it was he that was the most moved sudden as the shock was to her when he sank back into his seat it was the wife that took the office of consoler  she took his trembling hand and kissed it and put it round her neck she called him her johnher dear johnher old manher kind old man she poured out a hundred words of incoherent love and tenderness her faithful voice and simple caresses wrought this sad heart up to an inexpressible delight and anguish and cheered and solaced his overburdened soul  only once in the course of the long night as they sate together and poor sedley opened his pentup soul and told the story of his losses and embarrassmentsthe treason of some of his oldest friends the manly kindness of some from whom he never could have expected itin a general confessiononly once did the faithful wife give way to emotion  my god my god it will break emmys heart she said  the father had forgotten the poor girl  she was lying awake and unhappy overhead  in the midst of friends home and kind parents she was alone  to how many people can any one tell all  who will be open where there is no sympathy or has call to speak to those who never can understand  our gentle amelia was thus solitary  she had no confidante so to speak ever since she had anything to confide  she could not tell the old mother her doubts and cares the wouldbe sisters seemed every day more strange to her  and she had misgivings and fears which she dared not acknowledge to herself though she was always secretly brooding over them  her heart tried to persist in asserting that george osborne was worthy and faithful to her though she knew otherwise  how many a thing had she said and got no echo from him  how many suspicions of selfishness and indifference had she to encounter and obstinately overcome  to whom could the poor little martyr tell these daily struggles and tortures  her hero himself only half understood her she did not dare to own that the man she loved was her inferior or to feel that she had given her heart away too soon  given once the pure bashful maiden was too modest too tender too trustful too weak too much woman to recall it  we are turks with the affections of our women and have made them subscribe to our doctrine too  we let their bodies go abroad liberally enough with smiles and ringlets and pink bonnets to disguise them instead of veils and yakmaks  but their souls must be seen by only one man and they obey not unwillingly and consent to remain at home as our slavesministering to us and doing drudgery for us  so imprisoned and tortured was this gentle little heart when in the month of march anno domini 1815 napoleon landed at cannes and louis xviii fled and all europe was in alarm and the funds fell and old john sedley was ruined  we are not going to follow the worthy old stockbroker through those last pangs and agonies of ruin through which he passed before his commercial demise befell they declared him at the stock exchange he was absent from his house of business his bills were protested his act of bankruptcy formal  the house and furniture of russell square were seized and sold up and he and his family were thrust away as we have seen to hide their heads where they might  john sedley had not the heart to review the domestic establishment who have appeared now and anon in our pages and of whom he was now forced by poverty to take leave  the wages of those worthy people were discharged with that punctuality which men frequently show who only owe in great sumsthey were sorry to leave good placesbut they did not break their hearts at parting from their adored master and mistress amelias maid was profuse in condolences but went off quite resigned to better herself in a genteeler quarter of the town  black sambo with the infatuation of his profession determined on setting up a publichouse  honest old mrs blenkinsop indeed who had seen the birth of jos and amelia and the wooing of john sedley and his wife was for staying by them without wages having amassed a considerable sum in their service and she accompanied the fallen people into their new and humble place of refuge where she tended them and grumbled against them for a while  of all sedleys opponents in his debates with his creditors which now ensued and harassed the feelings of the humiliated old gentleman so severely that in six weeks he oldened more than he had done for fifteen years beforethe most determined and obstinate seemed to be john osborne his old friend and neighbourjohn osborne whom he had set up in lifewho was under a hundred obligations to himand whose son was to marry sedleys daughter any one of these circumstances would account for the bitterness of osbornes opposition  when one man has been under very remarkable obligations to another with whom he subsequently quarrels a common sense of decency as it were makes of the former a much severer enemy than a mere stranger would be  to account for your own hardheartedness and ingratitude in such a case you are bound to prove the other partys crime  it is not that you are selfish brutal and angry at the failure of a speculationno noit is that your partner has led you into it by the basest treachery and with the most sinister motives  from a mere sense of consistency a persecutor is bound to show that the fallen man is a villainotherwise he the persecutor is a wretch himself  and as a general rule which may make all creditors who are inclined to be severe pretty comfortable in their minds no men embarrassed are altogether honest very likely  they conceal something they exaggerate chances of good luck hide away the real state of affairs say that things are flourishing when they are hopeless keep a smiling face a dreary smile it is upon the verge of bankruptcyare ready to lay hold of any pretext for delay or of any money so as to stave off the inevitable ruin a few days longer down with such dishonesty says the creditor in triumph and reviles his sinking enemy  you fool why do you catch at a straw calm good sense says to the man that is drowning  you villain why do you shrink from plunging into the irretrievable gazette says prosperity to the poor devil battling in that black gulf  who has not remarked the readiness with which the closest of friends and honestest of men suspect and accuse each other of cheating when they fall out on money matters everybody does it everybody is right i suppose and the world is a rogue  then osborne had the intolerable sense of former benefits to goad and irritate him these are always a cause of hostility aggravated finally he had to break off the match between sedleys daughter and his son and as it had gone very far indeed and as the poor girls happiness and perhaps character were compromised it was necessary to show the strongest reasons for the rupture and for john osborne to prove john sedley to be a very bad character indeed  at the meetings of creditors then he comported himself with a savageness and scorn towards sedley which almost succeeded in breaking the heart of that ruined bankrupt man  on georges intercourse with amelia he put an instant vetomenacing the youth with maledictions if he broke his commands and vilipending the poor innocent girl as the basest and most artful of vixens one of the great conditions of anger and hatred is that you must tell and believe lies against the hated object in order as we said to be consistent  when the great crash camethe announcement of ruin and the departure from russell square and the declaration that all was over between her and georgeall over between her and love her and happiness her and faith in the worlda brutal letter from john osborne told her in a few curt lines that her fathers conduct had been of such a nature that all engagements between the families were at an endwhen the final award came it did not shock her so much as her parents as her mother rather expected for john sedley himself was entirely prostrate in the ruins of his own affairs and shattered honour  amelia took the news very palely and calmly it was only the confirmation of the dark presages which had long gone before  it was the mere reading of the sentenceof the crime she had long ago been guiltythe crime of loving wrongly too violently against reason she told no more of her thoughts now than she had before  she seemed scarcely more unhappy now when convinced all hope was over than before when she felt but dared not confess that it was gone  so she changed from the large house to the small one without any mark or difference remained in her little room for the most part pined silently and died away day by day  i do not mean to say that all females are so  my dear miss bullock i do not think your heart would break in this way  you are a strongminded young woman with proper principles i do not venture to say that mine would it has suffered and it must be confessed survived but there are some souls thus gently constituted thus frail and delicate and tender  whenever old john sedley thought of the affair between george and amelia or alluded to it it was with bitterness almost as great as mr osborne himself had shown  he cursed osborne and his family as heartless wicked and ungrateful  no power on earth he swore would induce him to marry his daughter to the son of such a villain and he ordered emmy to banish george from her mind and to return all the presents and letters which she had ever had from him  she promised acquiescence and tried to obey  she put up the two or three trinkets and as for the letters she drew them out of the place where she kept them and read them overas if she did not know them by heart already but she could not part with them  that effort was too much for her she placed them back in her bosom againas you have seen a woman nurse a child that is dead  young amelia felt that she would die or lose her senses outright if torn away from this last consolation how she used to blush and lighten up when those letters came  how she used to trip away with a beating heart so that she might read unseen  if they were cold yet how perversely this fond little soul interpreted them into warmth  if they were short or selfish what excuses she found for the writer  it was over these few worthless papers that she brooded and brooded she lived in her past lifeevery letter seemed to recall some circumstance of it  how well she remembered them all  his looks and tones his dress what he said and howthese relics and remembrances of dead affection were all that were left her in the world and the business of her life wasto watch the corpse of love  to death she looked with inexpressible longing  then she thought i shall always be able to follow him  i am not praising her conduct or setting her up as a model for miss bullock to imitate  miss b knows how to regulate her feelings better than this poor little creature miss b would never have committed herself as that imprudent amelia had done pledged her love irretrievably confessed her heart away and got back nothingonly a brittle promise which was snapt and worthless in a moment  a long engagement is a partnership which one party is free to keep or to break but which involves all the capital of the other  be cautious then young ladies be wary how you engage  be shy of loving frankly never tell all you feel or a better way still feel very little  see the consequences of being prematurely honest and confiding and mistrust yourselves and everybody  get yourselves married as they do in france where the lawyers are the bridesmaids and confidantes  at any rate never have any feelings which may make you uncomfortable or make any promises which you cannot at any required moment command and withdraw  that is the way to get on and be respected and have a virtuous character in vanity fair  if amelia could have heard the comments regarding her which were made in the circle from which her fathers ruin had just driven her she would have seen what her own crimes were and how entirely her character was jeopardised  such criminal imprudence mrs smith never knew of such horrid familiarities mrs brown had always condemned and the end might be a warning to her daughters captain osborne of course could not marry a bankrupts daughter the misses dobbin said it was quite enough to have been swindled by the father  as for that little amelia her folly had really passed all  all what captain dobbin roared out  havent they been engaged ever since they were children  wasnt it as good as a marriage dare any soul on earth breathe a word against the sweetest the purest the tenderest the most angelical of young women  la william dont be so hightytighty with us  were not men  we cant fight you miss jane said  weve said nothing against miss sedley but that her conduct throughout was most imprudent not to call it by any worse name and that her parents are people who certainly merit their misfortunes  hadnt you better now that miss sedley is free propose for her yourself william miss ann asked sarcastically  it would be a most eligible family connection  he  he  i marry her dobbin said blushing very much and talking quick if you are so ready young ladies to chop and change do you suppose that she is  laugh and sneer at that angel  she cant hear it and shes miserable and unfortunate and deserves to be laughed at  go on joking ann  youre the wit of the family and the others like to hear it  i must tell you again were not in a barrack william miss ann remarked  in a barrack by jovei wish anybody in a barrack would say what you do cried out this uproused british lion  i should like to hear a man breathe a word against her by jupiter  but men dont talk in this way ann its only women who get together and hiss and shriek and cackle  there get awaydont begin to cry  i only said you were a couple of geese will dobbin said perceiving miss anns pink eyes were beginning to moisten as usual  well youre not geese youre swansanything you like only do do leave miss sedley alone  anything like williams infatuation about that silly little flirting ogling thing was never known the mamma and sisters agreed together in thinking and they trembled lest her engagement being off with osborne she should take up immediately her other admirer and captain in which forebodings these worthy young women no doubt judged according to the best of their experience or rather for as yet they had had no opportunities of marrying or of jilting according to their own notions of right and wrong  it is a mercy mamma that the regiment is ordered abroad the girls said  this danger at any rate is spared our brother  such indeed was the fact and so it is that the french emperor comes in to perform a part in this domestic comedy of vanity fair which we are now playing and which would never have been enacted without the intervention of this august mute personage  it was he that ruined the bourbons and mr john sedley  it was he whose arrival in his capital called up all france in arms to defend him there and all europe to oust him while the french nation and army were swearing fidelity round the eagles in the champ de mars four mighty european hosts were getting in motion for the great chasse a laigle and one of these was a british army of which two heroes of ours captain dobbin and captain osborne formed a portion  the news of napoleons escape and landing was received by the gallant th with a fiery delight and enthusiasm which everybody can understand who knows that famous corps  from the colonel to the smallest drummer in the regiment all were filled with hope and ambition and patriotic fury and thanked the french emperor as for a personal kindness in coming to disturb the peace of europe  now was the time the th had so long panted for to show their comrades in arms that they could fight as well as the peninsular veterans and that all the pluck and valour of the th had not been killed by the west indies and the yellow fever  stubble and spooney looked to get their companies without purchase before the end of the campaign which she resolved to share mrs major odowd hoped to write herself mrs colonel odowd cb  our two friends dobbin and osborne were quite as much excited as the rest and each in his waymr dobbin very quietly mr osborne very loudly and energeticallywas bent upon doing his duty and gaining his share of honour and distinction  the agitation thrilling through the country and army in consequence of this news was so great that private matters were little heeded and hence probably george osborne just gazetted to his company busy with preparations for the march which must come inevitably and panting for further promotionwas not so much affected by other incidents which would have interested him at a more quiet period he was not it must be confessed very much cast down by good old mr sedleys catastrophe he tried his new uniform which became him very handsomely on the day when the first meeting of the creditors of the unfortunate gentleman took place his father told him of the wicked rascally shameful conduct of the bankrupt reminded him of what he had said about amelia and that their connection was broken off for ever and gave him that evening a good sum of money to pay for the new clothes and epaulets in which he looked so well  money was always useful to this freehanded young fellow and he took it without many words the bills were up in the sedley house where he had passed so many many happy hours  he could see them as he walked from home that night to the old slaughters where he put up when in town shining white in the moon that comfortable home was shut then upon amelia and her parents where had they taken refuge the thought of their ruin affected him not a little  he was very melancholy that night in the coffeeroom at the slaughters and drank a good deal as his comrades remarked there  dobbin came in presently cautioned him about the drink which he only took he said because he was deuced low but when his friend began to put to him clumsy inquiries and asked him for news in a significant manner osborne declined entering into conversation with him avowing however that he was devilish disturbed and unhappy  three days afterwards dobbin found osborne in his room at the barrackshis head on the table a number of papers about the young captain evidently in a state of great despondency  sheshes sent me back some things i gave hersome damned trinkets  look here there was a little packet directed in the wellknown hand to captain george osborne and some things lying abouta ring a silver knife he had bought as a boy for her at a fair a gold chain and a locket with hair in it  its all over said he with a groan of sickening remorse look will you may read it if you like  there was a little letter of a few lines to which he pointed which said  my papa has ordered me to return to you these presents which you made in happier days to me and i am to write to you for the last time  i think i know you feel as much as i do the blow which has come upon us it is i that absolve you from an engagement which is impossible in our present misery  i am sure you had no share in it or in the cruel suspicions of mr osborne which are the hardest of all our griefs to bear  farewell farewell  i pray god to strengthen me to bear this and other calamities and to bless you always     a  i shall often play upon the pianoyour piano  it was like you to send it  dobbin was very softhearted  the sight of women and children in pain always used to melt him  the idea of amelia brokenhearted and lonely tore that goodnatured soul with anguish  and he broke out into an emotion which anybody who likes may consider unmanly he swore that amelia was an angel to which osborne said aye with all his heart  he too had been reviewing the history of their livesand had seen her from her childhood to her present age so sweet so innocent so charmingly simple and artlessly fond and tender  what a pang it was to lose all that to have had it and not prized it a thousand homely scenes and recollections crowded on himin which he always saw her good and beautiful  and for himself he blushed with remorse and shame as the remembrance of his own selfishness and indifference contrasted with that perfect purity for a while glory war everything was forgotten and the pair of friends talked about her only  where are they osborne asked after a long talk and a long pauseand in truth with no little shame at thinking that he had taken no steps to follow her  where are they theres no address to the note  dobbin knew  he had not merely sent the piano but had written a note to mrs sedley and asked permission to come and see herand he had seen her and amelia too yesterday before he came down to chatham and what is more he had brought that farewell letter and packet which had so moved them  the goodnatured fellow had found mrs sedley only too willing to receive him and greatly agitated by the arrival of the piano which as she conjectured must have come from george and was a signal of amity on his part  captain dobbin did not correct this error of the worthy lady but listened to all her story of complaints and misfortunes with great sympathycondoled with her losses and privations and agreed in reprehending the cruel conduct of mr osborne towards his first benefactor when she had eased her overflowing bosom somewhat and poured forth many of her sorrows he had the courage to ask actually to see amelia who was above in her room as usual and whom her mother led trembling downstairs  her appearance was so ghastly and her look of despair so pathetic that honest william dobbin was frightened as he beheld it and read the most fatal forebodings in that pale fixed face  after sitting in his company a minute or two she put the packet into his hand and said take this to captain osborne if you please andand i hope hes quite welland it was very kind of you to come and see usand we like our new house very much and ii think ill go upstairs mamma for im not very strong and with this and a curtsey and a smile the poor child went her way  the mother as she led her up cast back looks of anguish towards dobbin  the good fellow wanted no such appeal  he loved her himself too fondly for that  inexpressible grief and pity and terror pursued him and he came away as if he was a criminal after seeing her  when osborne heard that his friend had found her he made hot and anxious inquiries regarding the poor child  how was she  how did she look  what did she say  his comrade took his hand and looked him in the face  george shes dying william dobbin saidand could speak no more  there was a buxom irish servantgirl who performed all the duties of the little house where the sedley family had found refuge and this girl had in vain on many previous days striven to give amelia aid or consolation emmy was much too sad to answer or even to be aware of the attempts the other was making in her favour  four hours after the talk between dobbin and osborne this servantmaid came into amelias room where she sate as usual brooding silently over her lettersher little treasures  the girl smiling and looking arch and happy made many trials to attract poor emmys attention who however took no heed of her  miss emmy said the girl  im coming emmy said not looking round  theres a message the maid went on  theres somethingsomebodysure heres a new letter for youdont be reading them old ones any more and she gave her a letter which emmy took and read  i must see you the letter said  dearest emmydearest lovedearest wife come to me  george and her mother were outside waiting until she had read the letter    chapter xix  miss crawley at nurse  we have seen how mrs firkin the ladys maid as soon as any event of importance to the crawley family came to her knowledge felt bound to communicate it to mrs bute crawley at the rectory and have before mentioned how particularly kind and attentive that goodnatured lady was to miss crawleys confidential servant she had been a gracious friend to miss briggs the companion also and had secured the latters goodwill by a number of those attentions and promises which cost so little in the making and are yet so valuable and agreeable to the recipient  indeed every good economist and manager of a household must know how cheap and yet how amiable these professions are and what a flavour they give to the most homely dish in life  who was the blundering idiot who said that fine words butter no parsnips  half the parsnips of society are served and rendered palatable with no other sauce  as the immortal alexis soyer can make more delicious soup for a halfpenny than an ignorant cook can concoct with pounds of vegetables and meat so a skilful artist will make a few simple and pleasing phrases go farther than ever so much substantial benefitstock in the hands of a mere bungler nay we know that substantial benefits often sicken some stomachs whereas most will digest any amount of fine words and be always eager for more of the same food mrs bute had told briggs and firkin so often of the depth of her affection for them and what she would do if she had miss crawleys fortune for friends so excellent and attached that the ladies in question had the deepest regard for her and felt as much gratitude and confidence as if mrs bute had loaded them with the most expensive favours  rawdon crawley on the other hand like a selfish heavy dragoon as he was never took the least trouble to conciliate his aunts aidesdecamp showed his contempt for the pair with entire franknessmade firkin pull off his boots on one occasionsent her out in the rain on ignominious messagesand if he gave her a guinea flung it to her as if it were a box on the ear  as his aunt too made a butt of briggs the captain followed the example and levelled his jokes at herjokes about as delicate as a kick from his charger whereas mrs bute consulted her in matters of taste or difficulty admired her poetry and by a thousand acts of kindness and politeness showed her appreciation of briggs and if she made firkin a twopennyhalfpenny present accompanied it with so many compliments that the twopencehalfpenny was transmuted into gold in the heart of the grateful waitingmaid who besides was looking forwards quite contentedly to some prodigious benefit which must happen to her on the day when mrs bute came into her fortune  the different conduct of these two people is pointed out respectfully to the attention of persons commencing the world praise everybody i say to such never be squeamish but speak out your compliment both pointblank in a mans face and behind his back when you know there is a reasonable chance of his hearing it again  never lose a chance of saying a kind word  as collingwood never saw a vacant place in his estate but he took an acorn out of his pocket and popped it in so deal with your compliments through life  an acorn costs nothing but it may sprout into a prodigious bit of timber  in a word during rawdon crawleys prosperity he was only obeyed with sulky acquiescence when his disgrace came there was nobody to help or pity him  whereas when mrs bute took the command at miss crawleys house the garrison there were charmed to act under such a leader expecting all sorts of promotion from her promises her generosity and her kind words  that he would consider himself beaten after one defeat and make no attempt to regain the position he had lost mrs bute crawley never allowed herself to suppose she knew rebecca to be too clever and spirited and desperate a woman to submit without a struggle and felt that she must prepare for that combat and be incessantly watchful against assault or mine or surprise  in the first place though she held the town was she sure of the principal inhabitant  would miss crawley herself hold out and had she not a secret longing to welcome back the ousted adversary  the old lady liked rawdon and rebecca who amused her  mrs bute could not disguise from herself the fact that none of her party could so contribute to the pleasures of the townbred lady  my girls singing after that little odious governesss i know is unbearable the candid rectors wife owned to herself  she always used to go to sleep when martha and louisa played their duets jims stiff college manners and poor dear butes talk about his dogs and horses always annoyed her  if i took her to the rectory she would grow angry with us all and fly i know she would and might fall into that horrid rawdons clutches again and be the victim of that little viper of a sharp  meanwhile it is clear to me that she is exceedingly unwell and cannot move for some weeks at any rate during which we must think of some plan to protect her from the arts of those unprincipled people  in the very bestof moments if anybody told miss crawley that she was or looked ill the trembling old lady sent off for her doctor and i daresay she was very unwell after the sudden family event which might serve to shake stronger nerves than hers  at least mrs bute thought it was her duty to inform the physician and the apothecary and the damedecompagnie and the domestics that miss crawley was in a most critical state and that they were to act accordingly  she had the street laid kneedeep with straw and the knocker put by with mr bowlss plate  she insisted that the doctor should call twice a day and deluged her patient with draughts every two hours  when anybody entered the room she uttered a shshshsh so sibilant and ominous that it frightened the poor old lady in her bed from which she could not look without seeing mrs butes beady eyes eagerly fixed on her as the latter sate steadfast in the armchair by the bedside  they seemed to lighten in the dark for she kept the curtains closed as she moved about the room on velvet paws like a cat  there miss crawley lay for daysever so many daysmr bute reading books of devotion to her for nights long nights during which she had to hear the watchman sing the nightlight sputter visited at midnight the last thing by the stealthy apothecary and then left to look at mrs butes twinkling eyes or the flicks of yellow that the rushlight threw on the dreary darkened ceiling  hygeia herself would have fallen sick under such a regimen and how much more this poor old nervous victim  it has been said that when she was in health and good spirits this venerable inhabitant of vanity fair had as free notions about religion and morals as monsieur de voltaire himself could desire but when illness overtook her it was aggravated by the most dreadful terrors of death and an utter cowardice took possession of the prostrate old sinner  sickbed homilies and pious reflections are to be sure out of place in mere storybooks and we are not going after the fashion of some novelists of the present day to cajole the public into a sermon when it is only a comedy that the reader pays his money to witness  but without preaching the truth may surely be borne in mind that the bustle and triumph and laughter and gaiety which vanity fair exhibits in public do not always pursue the performer into private life and that the most dreary depression of spirits and dismal repentances sometimes overcome him  recollection of the best ordained banquets will scarcely cheer sick epicures reminiscences of the most becoming dresses and brilliant ball triumphs will go very little way to console faded beauties  perhaps statesmen at a particular period of existence are not much gratified at thinking over the most triumphant divisions and the success or the pleasure of yesterday becomes of very small account when a certain albeit uncertain morrow is in view about which all of us must some day or other be speculating  o brother wearers of motley  are there not moments when one grows sick of grinning and tumbling and the jingling of cap and bells  this dear friends and companions is my amiable objectto walk with you through the fair to examine the shops and the shows there and that we should all come home after the flare and the noise and the gaiety and be perfectly miserable in private  if that poor man of mine had a head on his shoulders mrs bute crawley thought to herself how useful he might be under present circumstances to this unhappy old lady  he might make her repent of her shocking freethinking ways he might urge her to do her duty and cast off that odious reprobate who has disgraced himself and his family and he might induce her to do justice to my dear girls and the two boys who require and deserve i am sure every assistance which their relatives can give them  and as the hatred of vice is always a progress towards virtue mrs bute crawley endeavoured to instil her sisterinlaw a proper abhorrence for all rawdon crawleys manifold sins of which his uncles wife brought forward such a catalogue as indeed would have served to condemn a whole regiment of young officers  if a man has committed wrong in life i dont know any moralist more anxious to point his errors out to the world than his own relations so mrs bute showed a perfect family interest and knowledge of rawdons history  she had all the particulars of that ugly quarrel with captain marker in which rawdon wrong from the beginning ended in shooting the captain  she knew how the unhappy lord dovedale whose mamma had taken a house at oxford so that he might be educated there and who had never touched a card in his life till he came to london was perverted by rawdon at the cocoatree made helplessly tipsy by this abominable seducer and perverter of youth and fleeced of four thousand pounds  she described with the most vivid minuteness the agonies of the country families whom he had ruinedthe sons whom he had plunged into dishonour and povertythe daughters whom he had inveigled into perdition  she knew the poor tradesmen who were bankrupt by his extravagancethe mean shifts and rogueries with which he had ministered to itthe astounding falsehoods by which he had imposed upon the most generous of aunts and the ingratitude and ridicule by which he had repaid her sacrifices she imparted these stories gradually to miss crawley gave her the whole benefit of them felt it to be her bounden duty as a christian woman and mother of a family to do so had not the smallest remorse or compunction for the victim whom her tongue was immolating nay very likely thought her act was quite meritorious and plumed herself upon her resolute manner of performing it  yes if a mans character is to be abused say what you will theres nobody like a relation to do the business  and one is bound to own regarding this unfortunate wretch of a rawdon crawley that the mere truth was enough to condemn him and that all inventions of scandal were quite superfluous pains on his friends parts  rebecca too being now a relative came in for the fullest share of mrs butes kind inquiries  this indefatigable pursuer of truth having given strict orders that the door was to be denied to all emissaries or letters from rawdon took miss crawleys carriage and drove to her old friend miss pinkerton at minerva house chiswick mall to whom she announced the dreadful intelligence of captain rawdons seduction by miss sharp and from whom she got sundry strange particulars regarding the exgovernesss birth and early history  the friend of the lexicographer had plenty of information to give  miss jemima was made to fetch the drawingmasters receipts and letters this one was from a spunginghouse that entreated an advance another was full of gratitude for rebeccas reception by the ladies of chiswick and the last document from the unlucky artists pen was that in which from his dying bed he recommended his orphan child to miss pinkertons protection there were juvenile letters and petitions from rebecca too in the collection imploring aid for her father or declaring her own gratitude  perhaps in vanity fair there are no better satires than letters  take a bundle of your dear friends of ten years backyour dear friend whom you hate now  look at a file of your sisters how you clung to each other till you quarrelled about the twentypound legacy  get down the roundhand scrawls of your son who has half broken your heart with selfish undutifulness since or a parcel of your own breathing endless ardour and love eternal which were sent back by your mistress when she married the nabobyour mistress for whom you now care no more than for queen elizabeth vows love promises confidences gratitude how queerly they read after a while  there ought to be a law in vanity fair ordering the destruction of every written document except receipted tradesmens bills after a certain brief and proper interval  those quacks and misanthropes who advertise indelible japan ink should be made to perish along with their wicked discoveries  the best ink for vanity fair use would be one that faded utterly in a couple of days and left the paper clean and blank so that you might write on it to somebody else  from miss pinkertons the indefatigable mrs bute followed the track of sharp and his daughter back to the lodgings in greek street which the defunct painter had occupied and where portraits of the landlady in white satin and of the husband in brass buttons done by sharp in lieu of a quarters rent still decorated the parlour walls  mrs stokes was a communicative person and quickly told all she knew about mr sharp how dissolute and poor he was how goodnatured and amusing how he was always hunted by bailiffs and duns how to the landladys horror though she never could abide the woman he did not marry his wife till a short time before her death and what a queer little wild vixen his daughter was how she kept them all laughing with her fun and mimicry how she used to fetch the gin from the publichouse and was known in all the studios in the quarterin brief mrs bute got such a full account of her new nieces parentage education and behaviour as would scarcely have pleased rebecca had the latter known that such inquiries were being made concerning her  of all these industrious researches miss crawley had the full benefit mrs rawdon crawley was the daughter of an operagirl she had danced herself  she had been a model to the painters  she was brought up as became her mothers daughter  she drank gin with her father c c it was a lost woman who was married to a lost man and the moral to be inferred from mrs butes tale was that the knavery of the pair was irremediable and that no properly conducted person should ever notice them again  these were the materials which prudent mrs bute gathered together in park lane the provisions and ammunition as it were with which she fortified the house against the siege which she knew that rawdon and his wife would lay to miss crawley  but if a fault may be found with her arrangements it is this that she was too eager she managed rather too well undoubtedly she made miss crawley more ill than was necessary and though the old invalid succumbed to her authority it was so harassing and severe that the victim would be inclined to escape at the very first chance which fell in her way  managing women the ornaments of their sexwomen who order everything for everybody and know so much better than any person concerned what is good for their neighbours dont sometimes speculate upon the possibility of a domestic revolt or upon other extreme consequences resulting from their overstrained authority  thus for instance mrs bute with the best intentions no doubt in the world and wearing herself to death as she did by foregoing sleep dinner fresh air for the sake of her invalid sisterinlaw carried her conviction of the old ladys illness so far that she almost managed her into her coffin  she pointed out her sacrifices and their results one day to the constant apothecary mr clump  i am sure my dear mr clump she said no efforts of mine have been wanting to restore our dear invalid whom the ingratitude of her nephew has laid on the bed of sickness  i never shrink from personal discomfort i never refuse to sacrifice myself  your devotion it must be confessed is admirable mr clump says with a low bow but  i have scarcely closed my eyes since my arrival i give up sleep health every comfort to my sense of duty when my poor james was in the smallpox did i allow any hireling to nurse him  no  you did what became an excellent mother my dear madamthe best of mothers but  as the mother of a family and the wife of an english clergyman i humbly trust that my principles are good mrs bute said with a happy solemnity of conviction and as long as nature supports me never never mr clump will i desert the post of duty  others may bring that grey head with sorrow to the bed of sickness here mrs bute waving her hand pointed to one of old miss crawleys coffeecoloured fronts which was perched on a stand in the dressingroom but i will never quit it ah mr clump  i fear i know that the couch needs spiritual as well as medical consolation  what i was going to observe my dear madamhere the resolute clump once more interposed with a bland airwhat i was going to observe when you gave utterance to sentiments which do you so much honour was that i think you alarm yourself needlessly about our kind friend and sacrifice your own health too prodigally in her favour  i would lay down my life for my duty or for any member of my husbands family mrs bute interposed  yes madam if need were but we dont want mrs bute crawley to be a martyr clump said gallantly  dr squills and myself have both considered miss crawleys case with every anxiety and care as you may suppose  we see her lowspirited and nervous family events have agitated her  her nephew will come to perdition mrs crawley cried  have agitated her and you arrived like a guardian angel my dear madam a positive guardian angel i assure you to soothe her under the pressure of calamity but dr squills and i were thinking that our amiable friend is not in such a state as renders confinement to her bed necessary  she is depressed but this confinement perhaps adds to her depression  she should have change fresh air gaiety the most delightful remedies in the pharmacopoeia mr clump said grinning and showing his handsome teeth  persuade her to rise dear madam drag her from her couch and her low spirits insist upon her taking little drives  they will restore the roses too to your cheeks if i may so speak to mrs bute crawley  the sight of her horrid nephew casually in the park where i am told the wretch drives with the brazen partner of his crimes mrs bute said letting the cat of selfishness out of the bag of secrecy would cause her such a shock that we should have to bring her back to bed again  she must not go out mr clump  she shall not go out as long as i remain to watch over her and as for my health what matters it i give it cheerfully sir  i sacrifice it at the altar of my duty  upon my word madam mr clump now said bluntly i wont answer for her life if she remains locked up in that dark room  she is so nervous that we may lose her any day and if you wish captain crawley to be her heir i warn you frankly madam that you are doing your very best to serve him  gracious mercy is her life in danger mrs bute cried  why why mr clump did you not inform me sooner  the night before mr clump and dr squills had had a consultation over a bottle of wine at the house of sir lapin warren whose lady was about to present him with a thirteenth blessing regarding miss crawley and her case  what a little harpy that woman from hampshire is clump squills remarked that has seized upon old tilly crawley  devilish good madeira  what a fool rawdon crawley has been clump replied to go and marry a governess  there was something about the girl too  green eyes fair skin pretty figure famous frontal development squills remarked  there is something about her and crawley was a fool squills  a d foolalways was the apothecary replied  of course the old girl will fling him over said the physician and after a pause added shell cut up well i suppose  cut up says clump with a grin i wouldnt have her cut up for two hundred a year  that hampshire woman will kill her in two months clump my boy if she stops about her dr squills said old woman full feeder nervous subject palpitation of the heart pressure on the brain apoplexy off she goes get her up clump get her out or i wouldnt give many weeks purchase for your two hundred a year and it was acting upon this hint that the worthy apothecary spoke with so much candour to mrs bute crawley  having the old lady under her hand in bed with nobody near mrs bute had made more than one assault upon her to induce her to alter her will  but miss crawleys usual terrors regarding death increased greatly when such dismal propositions were made to her and mrs bute saw that she must get her patient into cheerful spirits and health before she could hope to attain the pious object which she had in view whither to take her was the next puzzle the only place where she is not likely to meet those odious rawdons is at church and that wont amuse her mrs bute justly felt  we must go and visit our beautiful suburbs of london she then thought  i hear they are the most picturesque in the world and so she had a sudden interest for hampstead and hornsey and found that dulwich had great charms for her and getting her victim into her carriage drove her to those rustic spots beguiling the little journeys with conversations about rawdon and his wife and telling every story to the old lady which could add to her indignation against this pair of reprobates  perhaps mrs bute pulled the string unnecessarily tight for though she worked up miss crawley to a proper dislike of her disobedient nephew the invalid had a great hatred and secret terror of her victimizer and panted to escape from her  after a brief space she rebelled against highgate and hornsey utterly  she would go into the park  mrs bute knew they would meet the abominable rawdon there and she was right one day in the ring rawdons stanhope came in sight rebecca was seated by him  in the enemys equipage miss crawley occupied her usual place with mrs bute on her left the poodle and miss briggs on the back seat  it was a nervous moment and rebeccas heart beat quick as she recognized the carriage and as the two vehicles crossed each other in a line she clasped her hands and looked towards the spinster with a face of agonized attachment and devotion rawdon himself trembled and his face grew purple behind his dyed mustachios  only old briggs was moved in the other carriage and cast her great eyes nervously towards her old friends  miss crawleys bonnet was resolutely turned towards the serpentine  mrs bute happened to be in ecstasies with the poodle and was calling him a little darling and a sweet little zoggy and a pretty pet  the carriages moved on each in his line  done by jove rawdon said to his wife  try once more rawdon rebecca answered  could not you lock your wheels into theirs dearest  rawdon had not the heart for that manoeuvre  when the carriages met again he stood up in his stanhope he raised his hand ready to doff his hat he looked with all his eyes  but this time miss crawleys face was not turned away she and mrs bute looked him full in the face and cut their nephew pitilessly  he sank back in his seat with an oath and striking out of the ring dashed away desperately homewards  it was a gallant and decided triumph for mrs bute but she felt the danger of many such meetings as she saw the evident nervousness of miss crawley and she determined that it was most necessary for her dear friends health that they should leave town for a while and recommended brighton very strongly    chapter xx  in which captain dobbin acts as the messenger of hymen  without knowing how captain william dobbin found himself the great promoter arranger and manager of the match between george osborne and amelia  but for him it never would have taken place  he could not but confess as much to himself and smiled rather bitterly as he thought that he of all men in the world should be the person upon whom the care of this marriage had fallen but though indeed the conducting of this negotiation was about as painful a task as could be set to him yet when he had a duty to perform captain dobbin was accustomed to go through it without many words or much hesitation and having made up his mind completely that if miss sedley was balked of her husband she would die of the disappointment he was determined to use all his best endeavours to keep her alive  i forbear to enter into minute particulars of the interview between george and amelia when the former was brought back to the feet or should we venture to say the arms of his young mistress by the intervention of his friend honest william  a much harder heart than georges would have melted at the sight of that sweet face so sadly ravaged by grief and despair and at the simple tender accents in which she told her little brokenhearted story but as she did not faint when her mother trembling brought osborne to her and as she only gave relief to her overcharged grief by laying her head on her lovers shoulder and there weeping for a while the most tender copious and refreshing tearsold mrs sedley too greatly relieved thought it was best to leave the young persons to themselves and so quitted emmy crying over georges hand and kissing it humbly as if he were her supreme chief and master and as if she were quite a guilty and unworthy person needing every favour and grace from him  this prostration and sweet unrepining obedience exquisitely touched and flattered george osborne  he saw a slave before him in that simple yielding faithful creature and his soul within him thrilled secretly somehow at the knowledge of his power  he would be generousminded sultan as he was and raise up this kneeling esther and make a queen of her  besides her sadness and beauty touched him as much as her submission and so he cheered her and raised her up and forgave her so to speak  all her hopes and feelings which were dying and withering this her sun having been removed from her bloomed again and at once its light being restored you would scarcely have recognised the beaming little face upon amelias pillow that night as the one that was laid there the night before so wan so lifeless so careless of all round about  the honest irish maidservant delighted with the change asked leave to kiss the face that had grown all of a sudden so rosy  amelia put her arms round the girls neck and kissed her with all her heart like a child  she was little more  she had that night a sweet refreshing sleep like oneand what a spring of inexpressible happiness as she woke in the morning sunshine  he will be here again today amelia thought  he is the greatest and best of men  and the fact is that george thought he was one of the generousest creatures alive and that he was making a tremendous sacrifice in marrying this young creature  while she and osborne were having their delightful teteatete above stairs old mrs sedley and captain dobbin were conversing below upon the state of the affairs and the chances and future arrangements of the young people  mrs sedley having brought the two lovers together and left them embracing each other with all their might like a true woman was of opinion that no power on earth would induce mr sedley to consent to the match between his daughter and the son of a man who had so shamefully wickedly and monstrously treated him  and she told a long story about happier days and their earlier splendours when osborne lived in a very humble way in the new road and his wife was too glad to receive some of joss little baby things with which mrs sedley accommodated her at the birth of one of osbornes own children the fiendish ingratitude of that man she was sure had broken mr ss heart and as for a marriage he would never never never never consent  they must run away together maam dobbin said laughing and follow the example of captain rawdon crawley and miss emmys friend the little governess was it possible well she never  mrs sedley was all excitement about this news  she wished that blenkinsop were here to hear it  blenkinsop always mistrusted that miss sharp what an escape jos had had and she described the already wellknown lovepassages between rebecca and the collector of boggley wollah  it was not however mr sedleys wrath which dobbin feared so much as that of the other parent concerned and he owned that he had a very considerable doubt and anxiety respecting the behaviour of the blackbrowed old tyrant of a russia merchant in russell square  he has forbidden the match peremptorily dobbin thought he knew what a savage determined man osborne was and how he stuck by his word the only chance george has of reconcilement argued his friend is by distinguishing himself in the coming campaign  if he dies they both go together  if he fails in distinctionwhat then  he has some money from his mother i have heard enough to purchase his majorityor he must sell out and go and dig in canada or rough it in a cottage in the country with such a partner dobbin thought he would not mind siberiaand strange to say this absurd and utterly imprudent young fellow never for a moment considered that the want of means to keep a nice carriage and horses and of an income which should enable its possessors to entertain their friends genteelly ought to operate as bars to the union of george and miss sedley  it was these weighty considerations which made him think too that the marriage should take place as quickly as possible  was he anxious himself i wonder to have it overas people when death has occurred like to press forward the funeral or when a parting is resolved upon hasten it  it is certain that mr dobbin having taken the matter in hand was most extraordinarily eager in the conduct of it  he urged on george the necessity of immediate action  he showed the chances of reconciliation with his father which a favourable mention of his name in the gazette must bring about  if need were he would go himself and brave both the fathers in the business  at all events he besought george to go through with it before the orders came which everybody expected for the departure of the regiment from england on foreign service  bent upon these hymeneal projects and with the applause and consent of mrs sedley who did not care to break the matter personally to her husband mr dobbin went to seek john sedley at his house of call in the city the tapioca coffeehouse where since his own offices were shut up and fate had overtaken him the poor brokendown old gentleman used to betake himself daily and write letters and receive them and tie them up into mysterious bundles several of which he carried in the flaps of his coat  i dont know anything more dismal than that business and bustle and mystery of a ruined man  those letters from the wealthy which he shows you  those worn greasy documents promising support and offering condolence which he places wistfully before you and on which he builds his hopes of restoration and future fortune my beloved reader has no doubt in the course of his experience been waylaid by many such a luckless companion  he takes you into the corner he has his bundle of papers out of his gaping coat pocket and the tape off and the string in his mouth and the favourite letters selected and laid before you and who does not know the sad eager halfcrazy look which he fixes on you with his hopeless eyes  changed into a man of this sort dobbin found the once florid jovial and prosperous john sedley  his coat that used to be so glossy and trim was white at the seams and the buttons showed the copper  his face had fallen in and was unshorn his frill and neckcloth hung limp under his bagging waistcoat  when he used to treat the boys in old days at a coffeehouse he would shout and laugh louder than anybody there and have all the waiters skipping round him it was quite painful to see how humble and civil he was to john of the tapioca a bleareyed old attendant in dingy stockings and cracked pumps whose business it was to serve glasses of wafers and bumpers of ink in pewter and slices of paper to the frequenters of this dreary house of entertainment where nothing else seemed to be consumed  as for william dobbin whom he had tipped repeatedly in his youth and who had been the old gentlemans butt on a thousand occasions old sedley gave his hand to him in a very hesitating humble manner now and called him sir a feeling of shame and remorse took possession of william dobbin as the broken old man so received and addressed him as if he himself had been somehow guilty of the misfortunes which had brought sedley so low  i am very glad to see you captain dobbin sir says he after a skulking look or two at his visitor whose lanky figure and military appearance caused some excitement likewise to twinkle in the blear eyes of the waiter in the cracked dancing pumps and awakened the old lady in black who dozed among the mouldy old coffeecups in the bar  how is the worthy alderman and my lady your excellent mother sir  he looked round at the waiter as he said my lady as much as to say hark ye john i have friends still and persons of rank and reputation too  are you come to do anything in my way sir  my young friends dale and spiggot do all my business for me now until my new offices are ready for im only here temporarily you know captain  what can we do for you sir  will you like to take anything  dobbin with a great deal of hesitation and stuttering protested that he was not in the least hungry or thirsty that he had no business to transact that he only came to ask if mr sedley was well and to shake hands with an old friend and he added with a desperate perversion of truth my mother is very wellthat is shes been very unwell and is only waiting for the first fine day to go out and call upon mrs sedley  how is mrs sedley sir  i hope shes quite well  and here he paused reflecting on his own consummate hypocrisy for the day was as fine and the sunshine as bright as it ever is in coffin court where the tapioca coffeehouse is situated and mr dobbin remembered that he had seen mrs sedley himself only an hour before having driven osborne down to fulham in his gig and left him there teteatete with miss amelia  my wife will be very happy to see her ladyship sedley replied pulling out his papers  ive a very kind letter here from your father sir and beg my respectful compliments to him  lady d will find us in rather a smaller house than we were accustomed to receive our friends in but its snug and the change of air does good to my daughter who was suffering in town ratheryou remember little emmy siryes suffering a good deal the old gentlemans eyes were wandering as he spoke and he was thinking of something else as he sate thrumming on his papers and fumbling at the worn red tape  youre a military man he went on i ask you bill dobbin could any man ever have speculated upon the return of that corsican scoundrel from elba  when the allied sovereigns were here last year and we gave em that dinner in the city sir and we saw the temple of concord and the fireworks and the chinese bridge in st jamess park could any sensible man suppose that peace wasnt really concluded after wed actually sung te deum for it sir  i ask you william could i suppose that the emperor of austria was a damned traitora traitor and nothing more  i dont mince wordsa doublefaced infernal traitor and schemer who meant to have his soninlaw back all along  and i say that the escape of boney from elba was a damned imposition and plot sir in which half the powers of europe were concerned to bring the funds down and to ruin this country  thats why im here william thats why my names in the gazette  why sirbecause i trusted the emperor of russia and the prince regent  look here  look at my papers  look what the funds were on the 1st of marchwhat the french fives were when i bought for the count  and what theyre at now there was collusion sir or that villain never would have escaped where was the english commissioner who allowed him to get away  he ought to be shot sirbrought to a courtmartial and shot by jove  were going to hunt boney out sir dobbin said rather alarmed at the fury of the old man the veins of whose forehead began to swell and who sate drumming his papers with his clenched fist  we are going to hunt him out sirthe dukes in belgium already and we expect marching orders every day  give him no quarter  bring back the villains head sir shoot the coward down sir sedley roared  id enlist myself by but im a broken old manruined by that damned scoundreland by a parcel of swindling thieves in this country whom i made sir and who are rolling in their carriages now he added with a break in his voice  dobbin was not a little affected by the sight of this once kind old friend crazed almost with misfortune and raving with senile anger pity the fallen gentleman you to whom money and fair repute are the chiefest good and so surely are they in vanity fair  yes he continued there are some vipers that you warm and they sting you afterwards  there are some beggars that you put on horseback and theyre the first to ride you down  you know whom i mean william dobbin my boy  i mean a purseproud villain in russell square whom i knew without a shilling and whom i pray and hope to see a beggar as he was when i befriended him  i have heard something of this sir from my friend george dobbin said anxious to come to his point  the quarrel between you and his father has cut him up a great deal sir  indeed im the bearer of a message from him  o thats your errand is it cried the old man jumping up what perhaps he condoles with me does he very kind of him the stiffbacked prig with his dandified airs and west end swagger hes hankering about my house is he still  if my son had the courage of a man hed shoot him  hes as big a villain as his father  i wont have his name mentioned in my house  i curse the day that ever i let him into it and id rather see my daughter dead at my feet than married to him  his fathers harshness is not georges fault sir  your daughters love for him is as much your doing as his  who are you that you are to play with two young peoples affections and break their hearts at your will  recollect its not his father that breaks the match off old sedley cried out  its i that forbid it  that family and mine are separated for ever  im fallen low but not so low as that no no and so you may tell the whole raceson and father and sisters and all  its my belief sir that you have not the power or the right to separate those two dobbin answered in a low voice and that if you dont give your daughter your consent it will be her duty to marry without it  theres no reason she should die or live miserably because you are wrongheaded  to my thinking shes just as much married as if the banns had been read in all the churches in london  and what better answer can there be to osbornes charges against you as charges there are than that his son claims to enter your family and marry your daughter  a light of something like satisfaction seemed to break over old sedley as this point was put to him but he still persisted that with his consent the marriage between amelia and george should never take place  we must do it without dobbin said smiling and told mr sedley as he had told mrs sedley in the day before the story of rebeccas elopement with captain crawley  it evidently amused the old gentleman youre terrible fellows you captains said he tying up his papers and his face wore something like a smile upon it to the astonishment of the bleareyed waiter who now entered and had never seen such an expression upon sedleys countenance since he had used the dismal coffeehouse  the idea of hitting his enemy osborne such a blow soothed perhaps the old gentleman and their colloquy presently ending he and dobbin parted pretty good friends  my sisters say she has diamonds as big as pigeons eggs george said laughing  how they must set off her complexion  a perfect illumination it must be when her jewels are on her neck  her jetblack hair is as curly as sambos  i dare say she wore a nose ring when she went to court and with a plume of feathers in her topknot she would look a perfect belle sauvage  george in conversation with amelia was rallying the appearance of a young lady of whom his father and sisters had lately made the acquaintance and who was an object of vast respect to the russell square family  she was reported to have i dont know how many plantations in the west indies a deal of money in the funds and three stars to her name in the east india stockholders list  she had a mansion in surrey and a house in portland place the name of the rich west india heiress had been mentioned with applause in the morning post  mrs haggistoun colonel haggistouns widow her relative chaperoned her and kept her house  she was just from school where she had completed her education and george and his sisters had met her at an evening party at old hulkers house devonshire place hulker bullock and co were long the correspondents of her house in the west indies and the girls had made the most cordial advances to her which the heiress had received with great good humour an orphan in her positionwith her moneyso interesting the misses osborne said they were full of their new friend when they returned from the hulker ball to miss wirt their companion they had made arrangements for continually meeting and had the carriage and drove to see her the very next day  mrs haggistoun colonel haggistouns widow a relation of lord binkie and always talking of him struck the dear unsophisticated girls as rather haughty and too much inclined to talk about her great relations but rhoda was everything they could wishthe frankest kindest most agreeable creaturewanting a little polish but so goodnatured  the girls christiannamed each other at once  you should have seen her dress for court emmy osborne cried laughing  she came to my sisters to show it off before she was presented in state by my lady binkie the haggistouns kinswoman shes related to every one that haggistoun  her diamonds blazed out like vauxhall on the night we were there  do you remember vauxhall emmy and jos singing to his dearest diddle diddle darling  diamonds and mahogany my dear think what an advantageous contrastand the white feathers in her hairi mean in her wool  she had earrings like chandeliers you might have lighted em up by joveand a yellow satin train that streeled after her like the tail of a cornet  how old is she asked emmy to whom george was rattling away regarding this dark paragon on the morning of their reunionrattling away as no other man in the world surely could  why the black princess though she has only just left school must be two or three and twenty  and you should see the hand she writes mrs colonel haggistoun usually writes her letters but in a moment of confidence she put pen to paper for my sisters she spelt satin satting and saint jamess saint jams  why surely it must be miss swartz the parlour boarder emmy said remembering that goodnatured young mulatto girl who had been so hysterically affected when amelia left miss pinkertons academy  the very name george said  her father was a german jewa slaveowner they sayconnected with the cannibal islands in some way or other  he died last year and miss pinkerton has finished her education  she can play two pieces on the piano she knows three songs she can write when mrs haggistoun is by to spell for her and jane and maria already have got to love her as a sister  i wish they would have loved me said emmy wistfully they were always very cold to me  my dear child they would have loved you if you had had two hundred thousand pounds george replied  that is the way in which they have been brought up  ours is a readymoney society  we live among bankers and city bigwigs and be hanged to them and every man as he talks to you is jingling his guineas in his pocket  there is that jackass fred bullock is going to marry mariatheres goldmore the east india director theres dipley in the tallow tradeour trade george said with an uneasy laugh and a blush  curse the whole pack of moneygrubbing vulgarians  i fall asleep at their great heavy dinners i feel ashamed in my fathers great stupid parties  ive been accustomed to live with gentlemen and men of the world and fashion emmy not with a parcel of turtlefed tradesmen  dear little woman you are the only person of our set who ever looked or thought or spoke like a lady and you do it because youre an angel and cant help it  dont remonstrate  you are the only lady didnt miss crawley remark it who has lived in the best company in europe  and as for crawley of the life guards hang it hes a fine fellow and i like him for marrying the girl he had chosen  amelia admired mr crawley very much too for this and trusted rebecca would be happy with him and hoped with a laugh jos would be consoled  and so the pair went on prattling as in quite early days amelias confidence being perfectly restored to her though she expressed a great deal of pretty jealousy about miss swartz and professed to be dreadfully frightenedlike a hypocrite as she waslest george should forget her for the heiress and her money and her estates in saint kitts  but the fact is she was a great deal too happy to have fears or doubts or misgivings of any sort and having george at her side again was not afraid of any heiress or beauty or indeed of any sort of danger  when captain dobbin came back in the afternoon to these peoplewhich he did with a great deal of sympathy for themit did his heart good to see how amelia had grown young againhow she laughed and chirped and sang familiar old songs at the piano which were only interrupted by the bell from without proclaiming mr sedleys return from the city before whom george received a signal to retreat  beyond the first smile of recognitionand even that was an hypocrisy for she thought his arrival rather provokingmiss sedley did not once notice dobbin during his visit  but he was content so that he saw her happy and thankful to have been the means of making her so    chapter xxi  a quarrel about an heiress  love may be felt for any young lady endowed with such qualities as miss swartz possessed and a great dream of ambition entered into old mr osbornes soul which she was to realize  he encouraged with the utmost enthusiasm and friendliness his daughters amiable attachment to the young heiress and protested that it gave him the sincerest pleasure as a father to see the love of his girls so well disposed  you wont find he would say to miss rhoda that splendour and rank to which you are accustomed at the west end my dear miss at our humble mansion in russell square  my daughters are plain disinterested girls but their hearts are in the right place and theyve conceived an attachment for you which does them honouri say which does them honour  im a plain simple humble british merchantan honest one as my respected friends hulker and bullock will vouch who were the correspondents of your late lamented father youll find us a united simple happy and i think i may say respected familya plain table a plain people but a warm welcome my dear miss rhodarhoda let me say for my heart warms to you it does really  im a frank man and i like you  a glass of champagne hicks champagne to miss swartz  there is little doubt that old osborne believed all he said and that the girls were quite earnest in their protestations of affection for miss swartz  people in vanity fair fasten on to rich folks quite naturally  if the simplest people are disposed to look not a little kindly on great prosperity for i defy any member of the british public to say that the notion of wealth has not something awful and pleasing to him and you if you are told that the man next you at dinner has got half a million not to look at him with a certain interestif the simple look benevolently on money how much more do your old worldlings regard it  their affections rush out to meet and welcome money  their kind sentiments awaken spontaneously towards the interesting possessors of it  i know some respectable people who dont consider themselves at liberty to indulge in friendship for any individual who has not a certain competency or place in society  they give a loose to their feelings on proper occasions  and the proof is that the major part of the osborne family who had not in fifteen years been able to get up a hearty regard for amelia sedley became as fond of miss swartz in the course of a single evening as the most romantic advocate of friendship at first sight could desire  what a match for george shed be the sisters and miss wirt agreed and how much better than that insignificant little amelia  such a dashing young fellow as he is with his good looks rank and accomplishments would be the very husband for her  visions of balls in portland place presentations at court and introductions to half the peerage filled the minds of the young ladies who talked of nothing but george and his grand acquaintances to their beloved new friend  old osborne thought she would be a great match too for his son he should leave the army he should go into parliament he should cut a figure in the fashion and in the state  his blood boiled with honest british exultation as he saw the name of osborne ennobled in the person of his son and thought that he might be the progenitor of a glorious line of baronets  he worked in the city and on change until he knew everything relating to the fortune of the heiress how her money was placed and where her estates lay  young fred bullock one of his chief informants would have liked to make a bid for her himself it was so the young banker expressed it only he was booked to maria osborne  but not being able to secure her as a wife the disinterested fred quite approved of her as a sisterinlaw  let george cut in directly and win her was his advice  strike while the irons hot you knowwhile shes fresh to the town in a few weeks some d fellow from the west end will come in with a title and a rotten rentroll and cut all us city men out as lord fitzrufus did last year with miss grogram who was actually engaged to podder of podder  browns  the sooner it is done the better mr osborne thems my sentiments the wag said though when osborne had left the bank parlour mr bullock remembered amelia and what a pretty girl she was and how attached to george osborne and he gave up at least ten seconds of his valuable time to regretting the misfortune which had befallen that unlucky young woman  while thus george osbornes good feelings and his good friend and genius dobbin were carrying back the truant to amelias feet georges parent and sisters were arranging this splendid match for him which they never dreamed he would resist  when the elder osborne gave what he called a hint there was no possibility for the most obtuse to mistake his meaning  he called kicking a footman downstairs a hint to the latter to leave his service with his usual frankness and delicacy he told mrs haggistoun that he would give her a cheque for five thousand pounds on the day his son was married to her ward and called that proposal a hint and considered it a very dexterous piece of diplomacy  he gave george finally such another hint regarding the heiress and ordered him to marry her out of hand as he would have ordered his butler to draw a cork or his clerk to write a letter  this imperative hint disturbed george a good deal  he was in the very first enthusiasm and delight of his second courtship of amelia which was inexpressibly sweet to him  the contrast of her manners and appearance with those of the heiress made the idea of a union with the latter appear doubly ludicrous and odious  carriages and operaboxes thought he fancy being seen in them by the side of such a mahogany charmer as that  add to all that the junior osborne was quite as obstinate as the senior when he wanted a thing quite as firm in his resolution to get it and quite as violent when angered as his father in his most stern moments  on the first day when his father formally gave him the hint that he was to place his affections at miss swartzs feet george temporised with the old gentleman  you should have thought of the matter sooner sir he said it cant be done now when were expecting every day to go on foreign service  wait till my return if i do return and then he represented that the time when the regiment was daily expecting to quit england was exceedingly illchosen that the few days or weeks during which they were still to remain at home must be devoted to business and not to lovemaking time enough for that when he came home with his majority for i promise you said he with a satisfied air that one way or other you shall read the name of george osborne in the gazette  the fathers reply to this was founded upon the information which he had got in the city that the west end chaps would infallibly catch hold of the heiress if any delay took place that if he didnt marry miss s he might at least have an engagement in writing to come into effect when he returned to england and that a man who could get ten thousand a year by staying at home was a fool to risk his life abroad  so that you would have me shown up as a coward sir and our name dishonoured for the sake of miss swartzs money george interposed  this remark staggered the old gentleman but as he had to reply to it and as his mind was nevertheless made up he said you will dine here tomorrow sir and every day miss swartz comes you will be here to pay your respects to her  if you want for money call upon mr chopper thus a new obstacle was in georges way to interfere with his plans regarding amelia and about which he and dobbin had more than one confidential consultation  his friends opinion respecting the line of conduct which he ought to pursue we know already  and as for osborne when he was once bent on a thing a fresh obstacle or two only rendered him the more resolute  the dark object of the conspiracy into which the chiefs of the osborne family had entered was quite ignorant of all their plans regarding her which strange to say her friend and chaperon did not divulge and taking all the young ladies flattery for genuine sentiment and being as we have before had occasion to show of a very warm and impetuous nature responded to their affection with quite a tropical ardour  and if the truth may be told i dare say that she too had some selfish attraction in the russell square house and in a word thought george osborne a very nice young man his whiskers had made an impression upon her on the very first night she beheld them at the ball at messrs hulkers and as we know she was not the first woman who had been charmed by them george had an air at once swaggering and melancholy languid and fierce  he looked like a man who had passions secrets and private harrowing griefs and adventures  his voice was rich and deep  he would say it was a warm evening or ask his partner to take an ice with a tone as sad and confidential as if he were breaking her mothers death to her or preluding a declaration of love  he trampled over all the young bucks of his fathers circle and was the hero among those thirdrate men  some few sneered at him and hated him some like dobbin fanatically admired him  and his whiskers had begun to do their work and to curl themselves round the affections of miss swartz  whenever there was a chance of meeting him in russell square that simple and goodnatured young woman was quite in a flurry to see her dear misses osborne  she went to great expenses in new gowns and bracelets and bonnets and in prodigious feathers  she adorned her person with her utmost skill to please the conqueror and exhibited all her simple accomplishments to win his favour  the girls would ask her with the greatest gravity for a little music and she would sing her three songs and play her two little pieces as often as ever they asked and with an always increasing pleasure to herself  during these delectable entertainments miss wirt and the chaperon sate by and conned over the peerage and talked about the nobility  the day after george had his hint from his father and a short time before the hour of dinner he was lolling upon a sofa in the drawingroom in a very becoming and perfectly natural attitude of melancholy  he had been at his fathers request to mr chopper in the city the oldgentleman though he gave great sums to his son would never specify any fixed allowance for him and rewarded him only as he was in the humour  he had then been to pass three hours with amelia his dear little amelia at fulham and he came home to find his sisters spread in starched muslin in the drawingroom the dowagers cackling in the background and honest swartz in her favourite ambercoloured satin with turquoise bracelets countless rings flowers feathers and all sorts of tags and gimcracks about as elegantly decorated as a she chimneysweep on mayday  the girls after vain attempts to engage him in conversation talked about fashions and the last drawingroom until he was perfectly sick of their chatter  he contrasted their behaviour with little emmystheir shrill voices with her tender ringing tones their attitudes and their elbows and their starch with her humble soft movements and modest graces  poor swartz was seated in a place where emmy had been accustomed to sit her bejewelled hands lay sprawling in her amber satin lap  her tags and earrings twinkled and her big eyes rolled about  she was doing nothing with perfect contentment and thinking herself charming  anything so becoming as the satin the sisters had never seen  dammy george said to a confidential friend she looked like a china doll which has nothing to do all day but to grin and wag its head  by jove will it was all i i could do to prevent myself from throwing the sofacushion at her he restrained that exhibition of sentiment however  the sisters began to play the battle of prague  stop that d thing george howled out in a fury from the sofa  it makes me mad you play us something miss swartz do  sing something anything but the battle of prague  shall i sing blue eyed mary or the air from the cabinet miss swartz asked  that sweet thing from the cabinet the sisters said  weve had that replied the misanthrope on the sofa  i can sing fluvy du tajy swartz said in a meek voice if i had the words it was the last of the worthy young womans collection  o fleuve du tage miss maria cried we have the song and went off to fetch the book in which it was  now it happened that this song then in the height of the fashion had been given to the young ladies by a young friend of theirs whose name was on the title and miss swartz having concluded the ditty with georges applause for he remembered that it was a favourite of amelias was hoping for an encore perhaps and fiddling with the leaves of the music when her eye fell upon the title and she saw amelia sedley written in the comer  lor cried miss swartz spinning swiftly round on the musicstool is it my amelia  amelia that was at miss ps at hammersmith  i know it is  its her and  tell me about herwhere is she  dont mention her miss maria osborne said hastily  her family has disgraced itself  her father cheated papa and as for her she is never to be mentioned here this was miss marias return for georges rudeness about the battle of prague  are you a friend of amelias george said bouncing up  god bless you for it miss swartz  dont believe what the girls say shes not to blame at any rate shes the best  you know youre not to speak about her george cried jane  papa forbids it  whos to prevent me george cried out  i will speak of her  i say shes the best the kindest the gentlest the sweetest girl in england and that bankrupt or no my sisters are not fit to hold candles to her  if you like her go and see her miss swartz she wants friends now and i say god bless everybody who befriends her anybody who speaks kindly of her is my friend anybody who speaks against her is my enemy  thank you miss swartz and he went up and wrung her hand  george george one of the sisters cried imploringly  i say george said fiercely i thank everybody who loves amelia sed he stopped  old osborne was in the room with a face livid with rage and eyes like hot coals  though george had stopped in his sentence yet his blood being up he was not to be cowed by all the generations of osborne rallying instantly he replied to the bullying look of his father with another so indicative of resolution and defiance that the elder man quailed in his turn and looked away  he felt that the tussle was coming  mrs haggistoun let me take you down to dinner he said give your arm to miss swartz george and they marched  miss swartz i love amelia and weve been engaged almost all our lives osborne said to his partner and during all the dinner george rattled on with a volubility which surprised himself and made his father doubly nervous for the fight which was to take place as soon as the ladies were gone  the difference between the pair was that while the father was violent and a bully the son had thrice the nerve and courage of the parent and could not merely make an attack but resist it and finding that the moment was now come when the contest between him and his father was to be decided he took his dinner with perfect coolness and appetite before the engagement began  old osborne on the contrary was nervous and drank much  he floundered in his conversation with the ladies his neighbours georges coolness only rendering him more angry  it made him half mad to see the calm way in which george flapping his napkin and with a swaggering bow opened the door for the ladies to leave the room and filling himself a glass of wine smacked it and looked his father full in the face as if to say gentlemen of the guard fire first the old man also took a supply of ammunition but his decanter clinked against the glass as he tried to fill it  after giving a great heave and with a purple choking face he then began  how dare you sir mention that persons name before miss swartz today in my drawingroom i ask you sir how dare you do it  stop sir says george dont say dare sir  dare isnt a word to be used to a captain in the british army  i shall say what i like to my son sir  i can cut him off with a shilling if i like  i can make him a beggar if i like i will say what i like the elder said  im a gentleman though i am your son sir george answered haughtily any communications which you have to make to me or any orders which you may please to give i beg may be couched in that kind of language which i am accustomed to hear  whenever the lad assumed his haughty manner it always created either great awe or great irritation in the parent  old osborne stood in secret terror of his son as a better gentleman than himself and perhaps my readers may have remarked in their experience of this vanity fair of ours that there is no character which a lowminded man so much mistrusts as that of a gentleman  my father didnt give me the education you have had nor the advantages you have had nor the money you have had  if i had kept the company some folks have had through my means perhaps my son wouldnt have any reason to brag sir of his superiority and west end airs these words were uttered in the elder osbornes most sarcastic tones but it wasnt considered the part of a gentleman in my time for a man to insult his father if id done any such thing mine would have kicked me downstairs sir  i never insulted you sir  i said i begged you to remember your son was a gentleman as well as yourself i know very well that you give me plenty of money said george fingering a bundle of notes which he had got in the morning from mr chopper  you tell it me often enough sir  theres no fear of my forgetting it  i wish youd remember other things as well sir the sire answered i wish youd remember that in this houseso long as you choose to honour it with your company captainim the master and that name and that thatthat youthat i say  that what sir george asked with scarcely a sneer filling another glass of claret   burst out his father with a screaming oaththat the name of those sedleys never be mentioned here sirnot one of the whole damned lot of em sir  it wasnt i sir that introduced miss sedleys name  it was my sisters who spoke ill of her to miss swartz and by jove ill defend her wherever i go  nobody shall speak lightly of that name in my presence  our family has done her quite enough injury already i think and may leave off reviling her now shes down  ill shoot any man but you who says a word against her  go on sir go on the old gentleman said his eyes starting out of his head  go on about what sir about the way in which weve treated that angel of a girl  who told me to love her  it was your doing  i might have chosen elsewhere and looked higher perhaps than your society but i obeyed you  and now that her hearts mine you give me orders to fling it away and punish her kill her perhapsfor the faults of other people  its a shame by heavens said george working himself up into passion and enthusiasm as he proceeded to play at fast and loose with a young girls affectionsand with such an angel as thatone so superior to the people amongst whom she lived that she might have excited envy only she was so good and gentle that its a wonder anybody dared to hate her if i desert her sir do you suppose she forgets me  i aint going to have any of this dam sentimental nonsense and humbug here sir the father cried out  there shall be no beggarmarriages in my family  if you choose to fling away eight thousand a year which you may have for the asking you may do it but by jove you take your pack and walk out of this house sir  will you do as i tell you once for all sir or will you not  marry that mulatto woman george said pulling up his shirtcollars i dont like the colour sir  ask the black that sweeps opposite fleet market sir  im not going to marry a hottentot venus  mr osborne pulled frantically at the cord by which he was accustomed to summon the butler when he wanted wineand almost black in the face ordered that functionary to call a coach for captain osborne  ive done it said george coming into the slaughters an hour afterwards looking very pale  what my boy says dobbin  george told what had passed between his father and himself  ill marry her tomorrow he said with an oath  i love her more every day dobbin    chapter xxii  a marriage and part of a honeymoon  enemies the most obstinate and courageous cant hold out against starvation so the elder osborne felt himself pretty easy about his adversary in the encounter we have just described and as soon as georges supplies fell short confidently expected his unconditional submission it was unlucky to be sure that the lad should have secured a stock of provisions on the very day when the first encounter took place but this relief was only temporary old osborne thought and would but delay georges surrender  no communication passed between father and son for some days  the former was sulky at this silence but not disquieted for as he said he knew where he could put the screw upon george and only waited the result of that operation  he told the sisters the upshot of the dispute between them but ordered them to take no notice of the matter and welcome george on his return as if nothing had happened  his cover was laid as usual every day and perhaps the old gentleman rather anxiously expected him but he never came some one inquired at the slaughters regarding him where it was said that he and his friend captain dobbin had left town  one gusty raw day at the end of aprilthe rain whipping the pavement of that ancient street where the old slaughters coffeehouse was once situatedgeorge osborne came into the coffeeroom looking very haggard and pale although dressed rather smartly in a blue coat and brass buttons and a neat buff waistcoat of the fashion of those days here was his friend captain dobbin in blue and brass too having abandoned the military frock and frenchgrey trousers which were the usual coverings of his lanky person  dobbin had been in the coffeeroom for an hour or more  he had tried all the papers but could not read them  he had looked at the clock many scores of times and at the street where the rain was pattering down and the people as they clinked by in pattens left long reflections on the shining stone he tattooed at the table he bit his nails most completely and nearly to the quick he was accustomed to ornament his great big hands in this way he balanced the teaspoon dexterously on the milk jug upset it c c and in fact showed those signs of disquietude and practised those desperate attempts at amusement which men are accustomed to employ when very anxious and expectant and perturbed in mind  some of his comrades gentlemen who used the room joked him about the splendour of his costume and his agitation of manner  one asked him if he was going to be married  dobbin laughed and said he would send his acquaintance major wagstaff of the engineers a piece of cake when that event took place  at length captain osborne made his appearance very smartly dressed but very pale and agitated as we have said  he wiped his pale face with a large yellow bandanna pockethandkerchief that was prodigiously scented he shook hands with dobbin looked at the clock and told john the waiter to bring him some curacao  of this cordial he swallowed off a couple of glasses with nervous eagerness his friend asked with some interest about his health  couldnt get a wink of sleep till daylight dob said he infernal headache and fever  got up at nine and went down to the hummums for a bath  i say dob i feel just as i did on the morning i went out with rocket at quebec  so do i william responded  i was a deuced deal more nervous than you were that morning  you made a famous breakfast i remember  eat something now  youre a good old fellow will  ill drink your health old boy and farewell to  no no two glasses are enough dobbin interrupted him  here take away the liqueurs john  have some cayennepepper with your fowl make haste though for it is time we were there  it was about half an hour from twelve when this brief meeting and colloquy took place between the two captains  a coach into which captain osbornes servant put his masters desk and dressingcase had been in waiting for some time and into this the two gentlemen hurried under an umbrella and the valet mounted on the box cursing the rain and the dampness of the coachman who was steaming beside him  we shall find a better trap than this at the churchdoor says he thats a comfort and the carriage drove on taking the road down piccadilly where apsley house and st georges hospital wore red jackets still where there were oillamps where achilles was not yet born nor the pimlico arch raised nor the hideous equestrian monster which pervades it and the neighbourhood and so they drove down by brompton to a certain chapel near the fulham road there  a chariot was in waiting with four horses likewise a coach of the kind called glass coaches  only a very few idlers were collected on account of the dismal rain  hang it said george i said only a pair  my master would have four said mr joseph sedleys servant who was in waiting and he and mr osbornes man agreed as they followed george and william into the church that it was a reglar shabby turn hout and with scarce so much as a breakfast or a wedding faviour  here you are said our old friend jos sedley coming forward youre five minutes late george my boy what a day eh demmy its like the commencement of the rainy season in bengal  but youll find my carriage is watertight  come along my mother and emmy are in the vestry  jos sedley was splendid  he was fatter than ever  his shirt collars were higher his face was redder his shirtfrill flaunted gorgeously out of his variegated waistcoat varnished boots were not invented as yet but the hessians on his beautiful legs shone so that they must have been the identical pair in which the gentleman in the old picture used to shave himself and on his light green coat there bloomed a fine wedding favour like a great white spreading magnolia  in a word george had thrown the great cast  he was going to be married  hence his pallor and nervousnesshis sleepless night and agitation in the morning  i have heard people who have gone through the same thing own to the same emotion  after three or four ceremonies you get accustomed to it no doubt but the first dip everybody allows is awful  the bride was dressed in a brown silk pelisse as captain dobbin has since informed me and wore a straw bonnet with a pink ribbon over the bonnet she had a veil of white chantilly lace a gift from mr joseph sedley her brother  captain dobbin himself had asked leave to present her with a gold chain and watch which she sported on this occasion and her mother gave her her diamond broochalmost the only trinket which was left to the old lady  as the service went on mrs sedley sat and whimpered a great deal in a pew consoled by the irish maidservant and mrs clapp from the lodgings old sedley would not be present  jos acted for his father giving away the bride whilst captain dobbin stepped up as groomsman to his friend george  there was nobody in the church besides the officiating persons and the small marriage party and their attendants the two valets sat aloof superciliously  the rain came rattling down on the windows in the intervals of the service you heard it and the sobbing of old mrs sedley in the pew  the parsons tones echoed sadly through the empty walls  osbornes i will was sounded in very deep bass emmys response came fluttering up to her lips from her heart but was scarcely heard by anybody except captain dobbin  when the service was completed jos sedley came forward and kissed his sister the bride for the first time for many monthsgeorges look of gloom had gone and he seemed quite proud and radiant its your turn william says he putting his hand fondly upon dobbins shoulder and dobbin went up and touched amelia on the cheek  then they went into the vestry and signed the register god bless you old dobbin george said grasping him by the hand with something very like moisture glistening in his eyes  william replied only by nodding his head his heart was too full to say much  write directly and come down as soon as you can you know osborne said  after mrs sedley had taken an hysterical adieu of her daughter the pair went off to the carriage  get out of the way you little devils george cried to a small crowd of damp urchins that were hanging about the chapeldoor  the rain drove into the bride and bridegrooms faces as they passed to the chariot the postilions favours draggled on their dripping jackets the few children made a dismal cheer as the carriage splashing mud drove away  william dobbin stood in the churchporch looking at it a queer figure  the small crew of spectators jeered him he was not thinking about them or their laughter  come home and have some tiffin dobbin a voice cried behind him as a pudgy hand was laid on his shoulder and the honest fellows reverie was interrupted  but the captain had no heart to go afeasting with jos sedley he put the weeping old lady and her attendants into the carriage along with jos and left them without any farther words passing  this carriage too drove away and the urchins gave another sarcastical cheer  here you little beggars dobbin said giving some sixpences amongst them and then went off by himself through the rain  it was all over they were married and happy he prayed god  never since he was a boy had he felt so miserable and so lonely  he longed with a heartsick yearning for the first few days to be over that he might see her again  some ten days after the above ceremony three young men of our acquaintance were enjoying that beautiful prospect of bow windows on the one side and blue sea on the other which brighton affords to the traveller sometimes it is towards the oceansmiling with countless dimples speckled with white sails with a hundred bathingmachines kissing the skirt of his blue garmentthat the londoner looks enraptured sometimes on the contrary a lover of human nature rather than of prospects of any kind it is towards the bow windows that he turns and that swarm of human life which they exhibit  from one issue the notes of a piano which a young lady in ringlets practises six hours daily to the delight of the fellowlodgers at another lovely polly the nursemaid may be seen dandling master omnium in her arms whilst jacob his papa is beheld eating prawns and devouring the times for breakfast at the window below yonder are the misses leery who are looking out for the young officers of the heavies who are pretty sure to be pacing the cliff or again it is a city man with a nautical turn and a telescope the size of a sixpounder who has his instrument pointed seawards so as to command every pleasureboat herringboat or bathingmachine that comes to or quits the shore c c  but have we any leisure for a description of brightonfor brighton a clean naples with genteel lazzaronifor brighton that always looks brisk gay and gaudy like a harlequins jacketfor brighton which used to be seven hours distant from london at the time of our story which is now only a hundred minutes off and which may approach who knows how much nearer unless joinville comes and untimely bombards it  what a monstrous fine girl that is in the lodgings over the milliners one of these three promenaders remarked to the other gad crawley did you see what a wink she gave me as i passed  dont break her heart jos you rascal said another dont trifle with her affections you don juan  get away said jos sedley quite pleased and leering up at the maidservant in question with a most killing ogle  jos was even more splendid at brighton than he had been at his sisters marriage he had brilliant underwaistcoats any one of which would have set up a moderate buck he sported a military frockcoat ornamented with frogs knobs black buttons and meandering embroidery he had affected a military appearance and habits of late and he walked with his two friends who were of that profession clinking his bootspurs swaggering prodigiously and shooting deathglances at all the servant girls who were worthy to be slain  what shall we do boys till the ladies return the buck asked the ladies were out to rottingdean in his carriage on a drive  lets have a game at billiards one of his friends saidthe tall one with lacquered mustachios  no dammy no captain jos replied rather alarmed  no billiards today crawley my boy yesterday was enough  you play very well said crawley laughing  dont he osborne how well he made thatfive stroke eh  famous osborne said  jos is a devil of a fellow at billiards and at everything else too  i wish there were any tigerhunting about here we might go and kill a few before dinner  there goes a fine girl what an ankle eh jos tell us that story about the tigerhunt and the way you did for him in the jungleits a wonderful story that crawley here george osborne gave a yawn its rather slow work said he down here what shall we do  shall we go and look at some horses that snafflers just brought from lewes fair crawley said  suppose we go and have some jellies at duttons and the rogue jos willing to kill two birds with one stone  devilish fine gal at duttons  suppose we go and see the lightning come in its just about time george said  this advice prevailing over the stables and the jelly they turned towards the coachoffice to witness the lightnings arrival  as they passed they met the carriagejos sedleys open carriage with its magnificent armorial bearingsthat splendid conveyance in which he used to drive about at cheltonham majestic and solitary with his arms folded and his hat cocked or more happy with ladies by his side  two were in the carriage now one a little person with light hair and dressed in the height of the fashion the other in a brown silk pelisse and a straw bonnet with pink ribbons with a rosy round happy face that did you good to behold  she checked the carriage as it neared the three gentlemen after which exercise of authority she looked rather nervous and then began to blush most absurdly we have had a delightful drive george she said andand were so glad to come back and joseph dont let him be late  dont be leading our husbands into mischief mr sedley you wicked wicked man you rebecca said shaking at jos a pretty little finger covered with the neatest french kid glove  no billiards no smoking no naughtiness  my dear mrs crawleyah now upon my honour was all jos could ejaculate by way of reply but he managed to fall into a tolerable attitude with his head lying on his shoulder grinning upwards at his victim with one hand at his back which he supported on his cane and the other hand the one with the diamond ring fumbling in his shirtfrill and among his underwaistcoats  as the carriage drove off he kissed the diamond hand to the fair ladies within  he wished all cheltenham all chowringhee all calcutta could see him in that position waving his hand to such a beauty and in company with such a famous buck as rawdon crawley of the guards  our young bride and bridegroom had chosen brighton as the place where they would pass the first few days after their marriage and having engaged apartments at the ship inn enjoyed themselves there in great comfort and quietude until jos presently joined them  nor was he the only companion they found there  as they were coming into the hotel from a seaside walk one afternoon on whom should they light but rebecca and her husband  the recognition was immediate  rebecca flew into the arms of her dearest friend crawley and osborne shook hands together cordially enough and becky in the course of a very few hours found means to make the latter forget that little unpleasant passage of words which had happened between them  do you remember the last time we met at miss crawleys when i was so rude to you dear captain osborne i thought you seemed careless about dear amelia  it was that made me angry and so pert and so unkind and so ungrateful do forgive me rebecca said and she held out her hand with so frank and winning a grace that osborne could not but take it  by humbly and frankly acknowledging yourself to be in the wrong there is no knowing my son what good you may do  i knew once a gentleman and very worthy practitioner in vanity fair who used to do little wrongs to his neighbours on purpose and in order to apologise for them in an open and manly way afterwardsand what ensued  my friend crocky doyle was liked everywhere and deemed to be rather impetuousbut the honestest fellow  beckys humility passed for sincerity with george osborne  these two young couples had plenty of tales to relate to each other the marriages of either were discussed and their prospects in life canvassed with the greatest frankness and interest on both sides georges marriage was to be made known to his father by his friend captain dobbin and young osborne trembled rather for the result of that communication  miss crawley on whom all rawdons hopes depended still held out  unable to make an entry into her house in park lane her affectionate nephew and niece had followed her to brighton where they had emissaries continually planted at her door  i wish you could see some of rawdons friends who are always about our door rebecca said laughing  did you ever see a dun my dear or a bailiff and his man two of the abominable wretches watched all last week at the greengrocers opposite and we could not get away until sunday  if aunty does not relent what shall we do  rawdon with roars of laughter related a dozen amusing anecdotes of his duns and rebeccas adroit treatment of them  he vowed with a great oath that there was no woman in europe who could talk a creditor over as she could  almost immediately after their marriage her practice had begun and her husband found the immense value of such a wife  they had credit in plenty but they had bills also in abundance and laboured under a scarcity of ready money did these debtdifficulties affect rawdons good spirits  no everybody in vanity fair must have remarked how well those live who are comfortably and thoroughly in debt how they deny themselves nothing how jolly and easy they are in their minds  rawdon and his wife had the very best apartments at the inn at brighton the landlord as he brought in the first dish bowed before them as to his greatest customers and rawdon abused the dinners and wine with an audacity which no grandee in the land could surpass  long custom a manly appearance faultless boots and clothes and a happy fierceness of manner will often help a man as much as a great balance at the bankers  the two wedding parties met constantly in each others apartments after two or three nights the gentlemen of an evening had a little piquet as their wives sate and chatted apart  this pastime and the arrival of jos sedley who made his appearance in his grand open carriage and who played a few games at billiards with captain crawley replenished rawdons purse somewhat and gave him the benefit of that ready money for which the greatest spirits are sometimes at a standstill  so the three gentlemen walked down to see the lightning coach come in punctual to the minute the coach crowded inside and out the guard blowing his accustomed tune on the hornthe lightning came tearing down the street and pulled up at the coachoffice  hullo theres old dobbin george cried quite delighted to see his old friend perched on the roof and whose promised visit to brighton had been delayed until now  how are you old fellow glad youre come down emmyll be delighted to see you osborne said shaking his comrade warmly by the hand as soon as his descent from the vehicle was effectedand then he added in a lower and agitated voice whats the news  have you been in russell square what does the governor say tell me everything  dobbin looked very pale and grave  ive seen your father said he hows ameliamrs george  ill tell you all the news presently but ive brought the great news of all and that is  out with it old fellow george said  were ordered to belgium  all the army goesguards and all heavytops got the gout and is mad at not being able to move odowd goes in command and we embark from chatham next week this news of war could not but come with a shock upon our lovers and caused all these gentlemen to look very serious    chapter xxiii  captain dobbin proceeds on his canvass  what is the secret mesmerism which friendship possesses and under the operation of which a person ordinarily sluggish or cold or timid becomes wise active and resolute in anothers behalf  as alexis after a few passes from dr elliotson despises pain reads with the back of his head sees miles off looks into next week and performs other wonders of which in his own private normal condition he is quite incapable so you see in the affairs of the world and under the magnetism of friendships the modest man becomes bold the shy confident the lazy active or the impetuous prudent and peaceful what is it on the other hand that makes the lawyer eschew his own cause and call in his learned brother as an adviser and what causes the doctor when ailing to send for his rival and not sit down and examine his own tongue in the chimney bass or write his own prescription at his studytable  i throw out these queries for intelligent readers to answer who know at once how credulous we are and how sceptical how soft and how obstinate how firm for others and how diffident about ourselves  meanwhile it is certain that our friend william dobbin who was personally of so complying a disposition that if his parents had pressed him much it is probable he would have stepped down into the kitchen and married the cook and who to further his own interests would have found the most insuperable difficulty in walking across the street found himself as busy and eager in the conduct of george osbornes affairs as the most selfish tactician could be in the pursuit of his own  whilst our friend george and his young wife were enjoying the first blushing days of the honeymoon at brighton honest william was left as georges plenipotentiary in london to transact all the business part of the marriage his duty it was to call upon old sedley and his wife and to keep the former in good humour  to draw jos and his brotherinlaw nearer together so that joss position and dignity as collector of boggley wollah might compensate for his fathers loss of station and tend to reconcile old osborne to the alliance  and finally to communicate it to the latter in such a way as should least irritate the old gentleman  now before he faced the head of the osborne house with the news which it was his duty to tell dobbin bethought him that it would be politic to make friends of the rest of the family and if possible have the ladies on his side they cant be angry in their hearts thought he no woman ever was really angry at a romantic marriage a little crying out and they must come round to their brother when the three of us will lay siege to old mr osborne  so this machiavellian captain of infantry cast about him for some happy means or stratagem by which he could gently and gradually bring the misses osborne to a knowledge of their brothers secret  by a little inquiry regarding his mothers engagements he was pretty soon able to find out by whom of her ladyships friends parties were given at that season where he would be likely to meet osbornes sisters and though he had that abhorrence of routs and evening parties which many sensible men alas entertain he soon found one where the misses osborne were to be present making his appearance at the ball where he danced a couple of sets with both of them and was prodigiously polite he actually had the courage to ask miss osborne for a few minutes conversation at an early hour the next day when he had he said to communicate to her news of the very greatest interest  what was it that made her start back and gaze upon him for a moment and then on the ground at her feet and make as if she would faint on his arm had he not by opportunely treading on her toes brought the young lady back to selfcontrol  why was she so violently agitated at dobbins request  this can never be known but when he came the next day maria was not in the drawingroom with her sister and miss wirt went off for the purpose of fetching the latter and the captain and miss osborne were left together they were both so silent that the ticktock of the sacrifice of iphigenia clock on the mantelpiece became quite rudely audible  what a nice party it was last night miss osborne at length began encouragingly andand how youre improved in your dancing captain dobbin  surely somebody has taught you she added with amiable archness  you should see me dance a reel with mrs major odowd of ours and a jigdid you ever see a jig  but i think anybody could dance with you miss osborne who dance so well  is the majors lady young and beautiful captain the fair questioner continued  ah what a terrible thing it must be to be a soldiers wife  i wonder they have any spirits to dance and in these dreadful times of war too o captain dobbin i tremble sometimes when i think of our dearest george and the dangers of the poor soldier are there many married officers of the th captain dobbin  upon my word shes playing her hand rather too openly miss wirt thought but this observation is merely parenthetic and was not heard through the crevice of the door at which the governess uttered it  one of our young men is just married dobbin said now coming to the point  it was a very old attachment and the young couple are as poor as church mice o how delightful o how romantic miss osborne cried as the captain said old attachment and poor her sympathy encouraged him  the finest young fellow in the regiment he continued not a braver or handsomer officer in the army and such a charming wife how you would like her  how you will like her when you know her miss osborne  the young lady thought the actual moment had arrived and that dobbins nervousness which now came on and was visible in many twitchings of his face in his manner of beating the ground with his great feet in the rapid buttoning and unbuttoning of his frockcoat cmiss osborne i say thought that when he had given himself a little air he would unbosom himself entirely and prepared eagerly to listen  and the clock in the altar on which iphigenia was situated beginning after a preparatory convulsion to toll twelve the mere tolling seemed as if it would last until oneso prolonged was the knell to the anxious spinster  but its not about marriage that i came to speakthat is that marriagethat isno i meanmy dear miss osborne its about our dear friend george dobbin said  about george she said in a tone so discomfited that maria and miss wirt laughed at the other side of the door and even that abandoned wretch of a dobbin felt inclined to smile himself for he was not altogether unconscious of the state of affairs  george having often bantered him gracefully and said hang it will why dont you take old jane  shell have you if you ask her ill bet you five to two she will  yes about george then he continued  there has been a difference between him and mr osborne  and i regard him so muchfor you know we have been like brothersthat i hope and pray the quarrel may be settled  we must go abroad miss osborne  we may be ordered off at a days warning  who knows what may happen in the campaign  dont be agitated dear miss osborne and those two at least should part friends  there has been no quarrel captain dobbin except a little usual scene with papa the lady said  we are expecting george back daily  what papa wanted was only for his good  he has but to come back and im sure all will be well and dear rhoda who went away from here in sad sad anger i know will forgive him  woman forgives but too readily captain  such an angel as you i am sure would mr dobbin said with atrocious astuteness  and no man can pardon himself for giving a woman pain what would you feel if a man were faithless to you  i should perishi should throw myself out of windowi should take poisoni should pine and die  i know i should miss cried who had nevertheless gone through one or two affairs of the heart without any idea of suicide  and there are others dobbin continued as true and as kindhearted as yourself  im not speaking about the west indian heiress miss osborne but about a poor girl whom george once loved and who was bred from her childhood to think of nobody but him ive seen her in her poverty uncomplaining brokenhearted without a fault  it is of miss sedley i speak  dear miss osborne can your generous heart quarrel with your brother for being faithful to her could his own conscience ever forgive him if he deserted her  be her friendshe always loved youandand i am come here charged by george to tell you that he holds his engagement to her as the most sacred duty he has and to entreat you at least to be on his side  when any strong emotion took possession of mr dobbin and after the first word or two of hesitation he could speak with perfect fluency and it was evident that his eloquence on this occasion made some impression upon the lady whom he addressed  well said she this ismost surprisingmost painfulmost extraordinarywhat will papa saythat george should fling away such a superb establishment as was offered to him but at any rate he has found a very brave champion in you captain dobbin  it is of no use however she continued after a pause i feel for poor miss sedley most certainlymost sincerely you know we never thought the match a good one though we were always very kind to her herevery  but papa will never consent i am sure  and a well brought up young woman you knowwith a wellregulated mind mustgeorge must give her up dear captain dobbin indeed he must  ought a man to give up the woman he loved just when misfortune befell her dobbin said holding out his hand  dear miss osborne is this the counsel i hear from you  my dear young lady you must befriend her he cant give her up  he must not give her up  would a man think you give you up if you were poor  this adroit question touched the heart of miss jane osborne not a little  i dont know whether we poor girls ought to believe what you men say captain she said there is that in womans tenderness which induces her to believe too easily  im afraid you are cruel cruel deceiversand dobbin certainly thought he felt a pressure of the hand which miss osborne had extended to him  he dropped it in some alarm  deceivers said he no dear miss osborne all men are not your brother is not george has loved amelia sedley ever since they were children no wealth would make him marry any but her  ought he to forsake her  would you counsel him to do so  what could miss jane say to such a question and with her own peculiar views  she could not answer it so she parried it by saying well if you are not a deceiver at least you are very romantic and captain william let this observation pass without challenge  at length when by the help of farther polite speeches he deemed that miss osborne was sufficiently prepared to receive the whole news he poured it into her ear george could not give up ameliageorge was married to herand then he related the circumstances of the marriage as we know them already  how the poor girl would have died had not her lover kept his faith  how old sedley had refused all consent to the match and a licence had been got and jos sedley had come from cheltenham to give away the bride how they had gone to brighton in joss chariotandfour to pass the honeymoon and how george counted on his dear kind sisters to befriend him with their father as womenso true and tender as they wereassuredly would do  and so asking permission readily granted to see her again and rightly conjecturing that the news he had brought would be told in the next five minutes to the other ladies captain dobbin made his bow and took his leave  he was scarcely out of the house when miss maria and miss wirt rushed in to miss osborne and the whole wonderful secret was imparted to them by that lady  to do them justice neither of the sisters was very much displeased  there is something about a runaway match with which few ladies can be seriously angry and amelia rather rose in their estimation from the spirit which she had displayed in consenting to the union  as they debated the story and prattled about it and wondered what papa would do and say came a loud knock as of an avenging thunderclap at the door which made these conspirators start  it must be papa they thought but it was not he  it was only mr frederick bullock who had come from the city according to appointment to conduct the ladies to a flowershow  this gentleman as may be imagined was not kept long in ignorance of the secret  but his face when he heard it showed an amazement which was very different to that look of sentimental wonder which the countenances of the sisters wore  mr bullock was a man of the world and a junior partner of a wealthy firm  he knew what money was and the value of it and a delightful throb of expectation lighted up his little eyes and caused him to smile on his maria as he thought that by this piece of folly of mr georges she might be worth thirty thousand pounds more than he had ever hoped to get with her  gad  jane said he surveying even the elder sister with some interest eels will be sorry he cried off  you may be a fifty thousand pounder yet  the sisters had never thought of the money question up to that moment but fred bullock bantered them with graceful gaiety about it during their forenoons excursion and they had risen not a little in their own esteem by the time when the morning amusement over they drove back to dinner  and do not let my respected reader exclaim against this selfishness as unnatural  it was but this present morning as he rode on the omnibus from richmond while it changed horses this present chronicler being on the roof marked three little children playing in a puddle below very dirty and friendly and happy  to these three presently came another little one polly says she your sisters got a penny  at which the children got up from the puddle instantly and ran off to pay their court to peggy  and as the omnibus drove off i saw peggy with the infantine procession at her tail marching with great dignity towards the stall of a neighbouring lollipopwoman    chapter xxiv  in which mr osborne takes down the family bible  so having prepared the sisters dobbin hastened away to the city to perform the rest and more difficult part of the task which he had undertaken  the idea of facing old osborne rendered him not a little nervous and more than once he thought of leaving the young ladies to communicate the secret which as he was aware they could not long retain  but he had promised to report to george upon the manner in which the elder osborne bore the intelligence so going into the city to the paternal countinghouse in thames street he despatched thence a note to mr osborne begging for a halfhours conversation relative to the affairs of his son george  dobbins messenger returned from mr osbornes house of business with the compliments of the latter who would be very happy to see the captain immediately and away accordingly dobbin went to confront him  the captain with a halfguilty secret to confess and with the prospect of a painful and stormy interview before him entered mr osbornes offices with a most dismal countenance and abashed gait and passing through the outer room where mr chopper presided was greeted by that functionary from his desk with a waggish air which farther discomfited him  mr chopper winked and nodded and pointed his pen towards his patrons door and said youll find the governor all right with the most provoking good humour  osborne rose too and shook him heartily by the hand and said how do my dear boy with a cordiality that made poor georges ambassador feel doubly guilty  his hand lay as if dead in the old gentlemans grasp  he felt that he dobbin was more or less the cause of all that had happened  it was he had brought back george to amelia it was he had applauded encouraged transacted almost the marriage which he was come to reveal to georges father  and the latter was receiving him with smiles of welcome patting him on the shoulder and calling him dobbin my dear boy the envoy had indeed good reason to hang his head  osborne fully believed that dobbin had come to announce his sons surrender  mr chopper and his principal were talking over the matter between george and his father at the very moment when dobbins messenger arrived  both agreed that george was sending in his submission  both had been expecting it for some daysand lord chopper what a marriage well have mr osborne said to his clerk snapping his big fingers and jingling all the guineas and shillings in his great pockets as he eyed his subordinate with a look of triumph  with similar operations conducted in both pockets and a knowing jolly air osborne from his chair regarded dobbin seated blank and silent opposite to him  what a bumpkin he is for a captain in the army old osborne thought  i wonder george hasnt taught him better manners  at last dobbin summoned courage to begin  sir said he ive brought you some very grave news  i have been at the horse guards this morning and theres no doubt that our regiment will be ordered abroad and on its way to belgium before the week is over  and you know sir that we shant be home again before a tussle which may be fatal to many of us   osborne looked grave  my s the regiment will do its duty sir i daresay he said  the french are very strong sir dobbin went on the russians and austrians will be a long time before they can bring their troops down we shall have the first of the fight sir and depend on it boney will take care that it shall be a hard one  what are you driving at dobbin his interlocutor said uneasy and with a scowl  i suppose no britons afraid of any d frenchman hey  i only mean that before we go and considering the great and certain risk that hangs over every one of usif there are any differences between you and georgeit would be as well sir thatthat you should shake hands wouldnt it  should anything happen to him i think you would never forgive yourself if you hadnt parted in charity  as he said this poor william dobbin blushed crimson and felt and owned that he himself was a traitor  but for him perhaps this severance need never have taken place  why had not georges marriage been delayed what call was there to press it on so eagerly  he felt that george would have parted from amelia at any rate without a mortal pang  amelia too might have recovered the shock of losing him  it was his counsel had brought about this marriage and all that was to ensue from it and why was it because he loved her so much that he could not bear to see her unhappy  or because his own sufferings of suspense were so unendurable that he was glad to crush them at onceas we hasten a funeral after a death or when a separation from those we love is imminent cannot rest until the parting be over  you are a good fellow william said mr osborne in a softened voice and me and george shouldnt part in anger that is true look here ive done for him as much as any father ever did  hes had three times as much money from me as i warrant your father ever gave you  but i dont brag about that  how ive toiled for him and worked and employed my talents and energy i wont say  ask chopper  ask himself  ask the city of london  well i propose to him such a marriage as any nobleman in the land might be proud ofthe only thing in life i ever asked himand he refuses me  am i wrong is the quarrel of my making  what do i seek but his good for which ive been toiling like a convict ever since he was born nobody can say theres anything selfish in me  let him come back i say heres my hand  i say forget and forgive  as for marrying now its out of the question  let him and miss s make it up and make out the marriage afterwards when he comes back a colonel for he shall be a colonel by g he shall if money can do it  im glad youve brought him round i know its you dobbin  youve took him out of many a scrape before let him come  i shant be hard  come along and dine in russell square today both of you  the old shop the old hour  youll find a neck of venison and no questions asked  this praise and confidence smote dobbins heart very keenly  every moment the colloquy continued in this tone he felt more and more guilty  sir said he i fear you deceive yourself  i am sure you do  george is much too highminded a man ever to marry for money  a threat on your part that you would disinherit him in case of disobedience would only be followed by resistance on his  why hang it man you dont call offering him eight or ten thousand a year threatening him mr osborne said with still provoking good humour  gad if miss s will have me im her man i aint particular about a shade or so of tawny and the old gentleman gave his knowing grin and coarse laugh  you forget sir previous engagements into which captain osborne had entered the ambassador said gravely  what engagements what the devil do you mean you dont mean mr osborne continued gathering wrath and astonishment as the thought now first came upon him you dont mean that hes such a d fool as to be still hankering after that swindling old bankrupts daughter youve not come here for to make me suppose that he wants to marry her  marry her that is a good one  my son and heir marry a beggars girl out of a gutter  d him if he does let him buy a broom and sweep a crossing  she was always dangling and ogling after him i recollect now and ive no doubt she was put on by her old sharper of a father  mr sedley was your very good friend sir dobbin interposed almost pleased at finding himself growing angry  time was you called him better names than rogue and swindler  the match was of your making george had no right to play fast and loose  fast and loose howled out old osborne  fast and loose  why hang me those are the very words my gentleman used himself when he gave himself airs last thursday was a fortnight and talked about the british army to his father who made him  what its you who have been a setting of him upis it and my service to you captain  its you who want to introduce beggars into my family thank you for nothing captain  marry her indeedhe he why should he  i warrant you shed go to him fast enough without  sir said dobbin starting up in undisguised anger no man shall abuse that lady in my hearing and you least of all  o youre agoing to call me out are you  stop let me ring the bell for pistols for two  mr george sent you here to insult his father did he osborne said pulling at the bellcord  mr osborne said dobbin with a faltering voice its you who are insulting the best creature in the world you had best spare her sir for shes your sons wife  and with this feeling that he could say no more dobbin went away osborne sinking back in his chair and looking wildly after him  a clerk came in obedient to the bell and the captain was scarcely out of the court where mr osbornes offices were when mr chopper the chief clerk came rushing hatless after him  for gods sake what is it mr chopper said catching the captain by the skirt  the governors in a fit what has mr george been doing  he married miss sedley five days ago dobbin replied i was his groomsman mr chopper and you must stand his friend  the old clerk shook his head  if thats your news captain its bad the governor will never forgive him  dobbin begged chopper to report progress to him at the hotel where he was stopping and walked off moodily westwards greatly perturbed as to the past and the future  when the russell square family came to dinner that evening they found the father of the house seated in his usual place but with that air of gloom on his face which whenever it appeared there kept the whole circle silent the ladies and mr bullock who dined with them felt that the news had been communicated to mr osborne his dark looks affected mr bullock so far as to render him still and quiet but he was unusually bland and attentive to miss maria by whom he sat and to her sister presiding at the head of the table  miss wirt by consequence was alone on her side of the board a gap being left between her and miss jane osborne  now this was georges place when he dined at home and his cover as we said was laid for him in expectation of that truants return  nothing occurred during dinnertime except smiling mr fredericks flagging confidential whispers and the clinking of plate and china to interrupt the silence of the repast  the servants went about stealthily doing their duty mutes at funerals could not look more glum than the domestics of mr osborne the neck of venison of which he had invited dobbin to partake was carved by him in perfect silence but his own share went away almost untasted though he drank much and the butler assiduously filled his glass  at last just at the end of the dinner his eyes which had been staring at everybody in turn fixed themselves for a while upon the plate laid for george  he pointed to it presently with his left hand his daughters looked at him and did not comprehend or choose to comprehend the signal nor did the servants at first understand it  take that plate away at last he said getting up with an oathand with this pushing his chair back he walked into his own room  behind mr osbornes diningroom was the usual apartment which went in his house by the name of the study and was sacred to the master of the house  hither mr osborne would retire of a sunday forenoon when not minded to go to church and here pass the morning in his crimson leather chair reading the paper  a couple of glazed bookcases were here containing standard works in stout gilt bindings the annual register the gentlemans magazine blairs sermons and hume and smollett from years end to years end he never took one of these volumes from the shelf but there was no member of the family that would dare for his life to touch one of the books except upon those rare sunday evenings when there was no dinnerparty and when the great scarlet bible and prayerbook were taken out from the corner where they stood beside his copy of the peerage and the servants being rung up to the dining parlour osborne read the evening service to his family in a loud grating pompous voice  no member of the household child or domestic ever entered that room without a certain terror  here he checked the housekeepers accounts and overhauled the butlers cellarbook hence he could command across the clean gravel courtyard the back entrance of the stables with which one of his bells communicated and into this yard the coachman issued from his premises as into a dock and osborne swore at him from the study window  four times a year miss wirt entered this apartment to get her salary and his daughters to receive their quarterly allowance  george as a boy had been horsewhipped in this room many times his mother sitting sick on the stair listening to the cuts of the whip  the boy was scarcely ever known to cry under the punishment the poor woman used to fondle and kiss him secretly and give him money to soothe him when he came out  there was a picture of the family over the mantelpiece removed thither from the front room after mrs osbornes deathgeorge was on a pony the elder sister holding him up a bunch of flowers the younger led by her mothers hand all with red cheeks and large red mouths simpering on each other in the approved familyportrait manner  the mother lay underground now long since forgottenthe sisters and brother had a hundred different interests of their own and familiar still were utterly estranged from each other  some few score of years afterwards when all the parties represented are grown old what bitter satire there is in those flaunting childish familyportraits with their farce of sentiment and smiling lies and innocence so selfconscious and selfsatisfied  osbornes own state portrait with that of his great silver inkstand and armchair had taken the place of honour in the diningroom vacated by the familypiece  to this study old osborne retired then greatly to the relief of the small party whom he left  when the servants had withdrawn they began to talk for a while volubly but very low then they went upstairs quietly mr bullock accompanying them stealthily on his creaking shoes  he had no heart to sit alone drinking wine and so close to the terrible old gentleman in the study hard at hand  an hour at least after dark the butler not having received any summons ventured to tap at his door and take him in wax candles and tea  the master of the house sate in his chair pretending to read the paper and when the servant placing the lights and refreshment on the table by him retired mr osborne got up and locked the door after him  this time there was no mistaking the matter all the household knew that some great catastrophe was going to happen which was likely direly to affect master george  in the large shining mahogany escritoire mr osborne had a drawer especially devoted to his sons affairs and papers  here he kept all the documents relating to him ever since he had been a boy here were his prize copybooks and drawingbooks all bearing georges hand and that of the master  here were his first letters in large roundhand sending his love to papa and mamma and conveying his petitions for a cake  his dear godpapa sedley was more than once mentioned in them curses quivered on old osbornes livid lips and horrid hatred and disappointment writhed in his heart as looking through some of these papers he came on that name they were all marked and docketed and tied with red tape it wasfrom georgy requesting 5s april 23 18 answered april 25or georgy about a pony october 13and so forth in another packet were dr ss accountsgs tailors bills and outfits drafts on me by g osborne jun chis letters from the west indieshis agents letters and the newspapers containing his commissions here was a whip he had when a boy and in a paper a locket containing his hair which his mother used to wear  turning one over after another and musing over these memorials the unhappy man passed many hours  his dearest vanities ambitious hopes had all been here  what pride he had in his boy  he was the handsomest child ever seen  everybody said he was like a noblemans son  a royal princess had remarked him and kissed him and asked his name in kew gardens  what city man could show such another could a prince have been better cared for  anything that money could buy had been his sons  he used to go down on speechdays with four horses and new liveries and scatter new shillings among the boys at the school where george was  when he went with george to the depot of his regiment before the boy embarked for canada he gave the officers such a dinner as the duke of york might have sat down to  had he ever refused a bill when george drew one there they werepaid without a word  many a general in the army couldnt ride the horses he had  he had the child before his eyes on a hundred different days when he remembered george after dinner when he used to come in as bold as a lord and drink off his glass by his fathers side at the head of the tableon the pony at brighton when he cleared the hedge and kept up with the huntsmanon the day when he was presented to the prince regent at the levee when all saint jamess couldnt produce a finer young fellow  and this this was the end of allto marry a bankrupt and fly in the face of duty and fortune  what humiliation and fury what pangs of sickening rage balked ambition and love what wounds of outraged vanity tenderness even had this old worldling now to suffer under  having examined these papers and pondered over this one and the other in that bitterest of all helpless woe with which miserable men think of happy past timesgeorges father took the whole of the documents out of the drawer in which he had kept them so long and locked them into a writingbox which he tied and sealed with his seal  then he opened the bookcase and took down the great red bible we have spoken of a pompous book seldom looked at and shining all over with gold there was a frontispiece to the volume representing abraham sacrificing isaac  here according to custom osborne had recorded on the flyleaf and in his large clerklike hand the dates of his marriage and his wifes death and the births and christian names of his children jane came first then george sedley osborne then maria frances and the days of the christening of each  taking a pen he carefully obliterated georges names from the page and when the leaf was quite dry restored the volume to the place from which he had moved it  then he took a document out of another drawer where his own private papers were kept and having read it crumpled it up and lighted it at one of the candles and saw it burn entirely away in the grate  it was his will which being burned he sate down and wrote off a letter and rang for his servant whom he charged to deliver it in the morning  it was morning already as he went up to bed the whole house was alight with the sunshine and the birds were singing among the fresh green leaves in russell square  anxious to keep all mr osbornes family and dependants in good humour and to make as many friends as possible for george in his hour of adversity william dobbin who knew the effect which good dinners and good wines have upon the soul of man wrote off immediately on his return to his inn the most hospitable of invitations to thomas chopper esquire begging that gentleman to dine with him at the slaughters next day  the note reached mr chopper before he left the city and the instant reply was that mr chopper presents his respectful compliments and will have the honour and pleasure of waiting on captain d  the invitation and the rough draft of the answer were shown to mrs chopper and her daughters on his return to somers town that evening and they talked about military gents and west end men with great exultation as the family sate and partook of tea  when the girls had gone to rest mr and mrs c discoursed upon the strange events which were occurring in the governors family  never had the clerk seen his principal so moved  when he went in to mr osborne after captain dobbins departure mr chopper found his chief black in the face and all but in a fit some dreadful quarrel he was certain had occurred between mr o and the young captain  chopper had been instructed to make out an account of all sums paid to captain osborne within the last three years  and a precious lot of money he has had too the chief clerk said and respected his old and young master the more for the liberal way in which the guineas had been flung about the dispute was something about miss sedley  mrs chopper vowed and declared she pitied that poor young lady to lose such a handsome young fellow as the capting as the daughter of an unlucky speculator who had paid a very shabby dividend mr chopper had no great regard for miss sedley  he respected the house of osborne before all others in the city of london and his hope and wish was that captain george should marry a noblemans daughter the clerk slept a great deal sounder than his principal that night and cuddling his children after breakfast of which he partook with a very hearty appetite though his modest cup of life was only sweetened with brown sugar he set off in his best sunday suit and frilled shirt for business promising his admiring wife not to punish captain ds port too severely that evening  mr osbornes countenance when he arrived in the city at his usual time struck those dependants who were accustomed for good reasons to watch its expression as peculiarly ghastly and worn  at twelve oclock mr higgs of the firm of higgs  blatherwick solicitors bedford row called by appointment and was ushered into the governors private room and closeted there for more than an hour at about one mr chopper received a note brought by captain dobbins man and containing an inclosure for mr osborne which the clerk went in and delivered  a short time afterwards mr chopper and mr birch the next clerk were summoned and requested to witness a paper  ive been making a new will mr osborne said to which these gentlemen appended their names accordingly  no conversation passed  mr higgs looked exceedingly grave as he came into the outer rooms and very hard in mr choppers face but there were not any explanations  it was remarked that mr osborne was particularly quiet and gentle all day to the surprise of those who had augured ill from his darkling demeanour  he called no man names that day and was not heard to swear once  he left business early and before going away summoned his chief clerk once more and having given him general instructions asked him after some seeming hesitation and reluctance to speak if he knew whether captain dobbin was in town  chopper said he believed he was  indeed both of them knew the fact perfectly  osborne took a letter directed to that officer and giving it to the clerk requested the latter to deliver it into dobbins own hands immediately  and now chopper says he taking his hat and with a strange look my mind will be easy  exactly as the clock struck two there was no doubt an appointment between the pair mr frederick bullock called and he and mr osborne walked away together  the colonel of the th regiment in which messieurs dobbin and osborne had companies was an old general who had made his first campaign under wolfe at quebec and was long since quite too old and feeble for command but he took some interest in the regiment of which he was the nominal head and made certain of his young officers welcome at his table a kind of hospitality which i believe is not now common amongst his brethren  captain dobbin was an especial favourite of this old general  dobbin was versed in the literature of his profession and could talk about the great frederick and the empress queen and their wars almost as well as the general himself who was indifferent to the triumphs of the present day and whose heart was with the tacticians of fifty years back  this officer sent a summons to dobbin to come and breakfast with him on the morning when mr osborne altered his will and mr chopper put on his best shirt frill and then informed his young favourite a couple of days in advance of that which they were all expectinga marching order to go to belgium the order for the regiment to hold itself in readiness would leave the horse guards in a day or two and as transports were in plenty they would get their route before the week was over  recruits had come in during the stay of the regiment at chatham and the old general hoped that the regiment which had helped to beat montcalm in canada and to rout mr washington on long island would prove itself worthy of its historical reputation on the ofttrodden battlegrounds of the low countries  and so my good friend if you have any affaire la said the old general taking a pinch of snuff with his trembling white old hand and then pointing to the spot of his robe de chambre under which his heart was still feebly beating if you have any phillis to console or to bid farewell to papa and mamma or any will to make i recommend you to set about your business without delay with which the general gave his young friend a finger to shake and a goodnatured nod of his powdered and pigtailed head and the door being closed upon dobbin sate down to pen a poulet he was exceedingly vain of his french to mademoiselle amenaide of his majestys theatre  this news made dobbin grave and he thought of our friends at brighton and then he was ashamed of himself that amelia was always the first thing in his thoughts always before anybodybefore father and mother sisters and dutyalways at waking and sleeping indeed and all day long and returning to his hotel he sent off a brief note to mr osborne acquainting him with the information which he had received and which might tend farther he hoped to bring about a reconciliation with george  this note despatched by the same messenger who had carried the invitation to chopper on the previous day alarmed the worthy clerk not a little  it was inclosed to him and as he opened the letter he trembled lest the dinner should be put off on which he was calculating his mind was inexpressibly relieved when he found that the envelope was only a reminder for himself  i shall expect you at halfpast five captain dobbin wrote he was very much interested about his employers family but que voulezvous a grand dinner was of more concern to him than the affairs of any other mortal  dobbin was quite justified in repeating the generals information to any officers of the regiment whom he should see in the course of his peregrinations accordingly he imparted it to ensign stubble whom he met at the agents and whosuch was his military ardourwent off instantly to purchase a new sword at the accoutrementmakers here this young fellow who though only seventeen years of age and about sixtyfive inches high with a constitution naturally rickety and much impaired by premature brandy and water had an undoubted courage and a lions heart poised tried bent and balanced a weapon such as he thought would do execution amongst frenchmen shouting ha ha and stamping his little feet with tremendous energy he delivered the point twice or thrice at captain dobbin who parried the thrust laughingly with his bamboo walkingstick  mr stubble as may be supposed from his size and slenderness was of the light bobs  ensign spooney on the contrary was a tall youth and belonged to captain dobbins the grenadier company and he tried on a new bearskin cap under which he looked savage beyond his years  then these two lads went off to the slaughters and having ordered a famous dinner sate down and wrote off letters to the kind anxious parents at homeletters full of love and heartiness and pluck and bad spelling ah there were many anxious hearts beating through england at that time and mothers prayers and tears flowing in many homesteads  seeing young stubble engaged in composition at one of the coffeeroom tables at the slaughters and the tears trickling down his nose on to the paper for the youngster was thinking of his mamma and that he might never see her again dobbin who was going to write off a letter to george osborne relented and locked up his desk  why should i said he  let her have this night happy ill go and see my parents early in the morning and go down to brighton myself tomorrow  so he went up and laid his big hand on young stubbles shoulder and backed up that young champion and told him if he would leave off brandy and water he would be a good soldier as he always was a gentlemanly goodhearted fellow  young stubbles eyes brightened up at this for dobbin was greatly respected in the regiment as the best officer and the cleverest man in it  thank you dobbin he said rubbing his eyes with his knuckles i was justjust telling her i would  and o sir shes so dam kind to me the water pumps were at work again and i am not sure that the softhearted captains eyes did not also twinkle  the two ensigns the captain and mr chopper dined together in the same box  chopper brought the letter from mr osborne in which the latter briefly presented his compliments to captain dobbin and requested him to forward the inclosed to captain george osborne chopper knew nothing further he described mr osbornes appearance it is true and his interview with his lawyer wondered how the governor had sworn at nobody andespecially as the wine circled roundabounded in speculations and conjectures  but these grew more vague with every glass and at length became perfectly unintelligible at a late hour captain dobbin put his guest into a hackney coach in a hiccupping state and swearing that he would be the kickthe kickcaptains friend for ever and ever  when captain dobbin took leave of miss osborne we have said that he asked leave to come and pay her another visit and the spinster expected him for some hours the next day when perhaps had he come and had he asked her that question which she was prepared to answer she would have declared herself as her brothers friend and a reconciliation might have been effected between george and his angry father  but though she waited at home the captain never came he had his own affairs to pursue his own parents to visit and console and at an early hour of the day to take his place on the lightning coach and go down to his friends at brighton  in the course of the day miss osborne heard her father give orders that that meddling scoundrel captain dobbin should never be admitted within his doors again and any hopes in which she may have indulged privately were thus abruptly brought to an end  mr frederick bullock came and was particularly affectionate to maria and attentive to the brokenspirited old gentleman  for though he said his mind would be easy the means which he had taken to secure quiet did not seem to have succeeded as yet and the events of the past two days had visibly shattered him    chapter xxv  in which all the principal personages think fit to leave brighton  conducted to the ladies at the ship inn dobbin assumed a jovial and rattling manner which proved that this young officer was becoming a more consummate hypocrite every day of his life  he was trying to hide his own private feelings first upon seeing mrs george osborne in her new condition and secondly to mask the apprehensions he entertained as to the effect which the dismal news brought down by him would certainly have upon her  it is my opinion george he said that the french emperor will be upon us horse and foot before three weeks are over and will give the duke such a dance as shall make the peninsula appear mere childs play but you need not say that to mrs osborne you know there maynt be any fighting on our side after all and our business in belgium may turn out to be a mere military occupation  many persons think so and brussels is full of fine people and ladies of fashion so it was agreed to represent the duty of the british army in belgium in this harmless light to amelia  this plot being arranged the hypocritical dobbin saluted mrs george osborne quite gaily tried to pay her one or two compliments relative to her new position as a bride which compliments it must be confessed were exceedingly clumsy and hung fire woefully and then fell to talking about brighton and the seaair and the gaieties of the place and the beauties of the road and the merits of the lightning coach and horsesall in a manner quite incomprehensible to amelia and very amusing to rebecca who was watching the captain as indeed she watched every one near whom she came  little amelia it must be owned had rather a mean opinion of her husbands friend captain dobbin  he lispedhe was very plain and homelylooking and exceedingly awkward and ungainly  she liked him for his attachment to her husband to be sure there was very little merit in that and she thought george was most generous and kind in extending his friendship to his brother officer george had mimicked dobbins lisp and queer manners many times to her though to do him justice he always spoke most highly of his friends good qualities in her little day of triumph and not knowing him intimately as yet she made light of honest williamand he knew her opinions of him quite well and acquiesced in them very humbly  a time came when she knew him better and changed her notions regarding him but that was distant as yet  as for rebecca captain dobbin had not been two hours in the ladies company before she understood his secret perfectly  she did not like him and feared him privately nor was he very much prepossessed in her favour  he was so honest that her arts and cajoleries did not affect him and he shrank from her with instinctive repulsion and as she was by no means so far superior to her sex as to be above jealousy she disliked him the more for his adoration of amelia  nevertheless she was very respectful and cordial in her manner towards him  a friend to the osbornes a friend to her dearest benefactors  she vowed she should always love him sincerely she remembered him quite well on the vauxhall night as she told amelia archly and she made a little fun of him when the two ladies went to dress for dinner  rawdon crawley paid scarcely any attention to dobbin looking upon him as a goodnatured nincompoop and underbred city man  jos patronised him with much dignity  when george and dobbin were alone in the latters room to which george had followed him dobbin took from his desk the letter which he had been charged by mr osborne to deliver to his son  its not in my fathers handwriting said george looking rather alarmed nor was it the letter was from mr osbornes lawyer and to the following effect                                      bedford row may 7 1815  sir  i am commissioned by mr osborne to inform you that he abides by the determination which he before expressed to you and that in consequence of the marriage which you have been pleased to contract he ceases to consider you henceforth as a member of his family this determination is final and irrevocable  although the monies expended upon you in your minority and the bills which you have drawn upon him so unsparingly of late years far exceed in amount the sum to which you are entitled in your own right being the third part of the fortune of your mother the late mrs osborne and which reverted to you at her decease and to miss jane osborne and miss maria frances osborne yet i am instructed by mr osborne to say that he waives all claim upon your estate and that the sum of 2000 pounds 4 per cent annuities at the value of the day being your onethird share of the sum of 6000 pounds shall be paid over to yourself or your agents upon your receipt for the same by                            your obedient servt                                            s higgs  psmr osborne desires me to say once for all that he declines to receive any messages letters or communications from you on this or any other subject  a pretty way you have managed the affair said george looking savagely at william dobbin  look there dobbin and he flung over to the latter his parents letter a beggar by jove and all in consequence of my dd sentimentality  why couldnt we have waited a ball might have done for me in the course of the war and may still and how will emmy be bettered by being left a beggars widow it was all your doing  you were never easy until you had got me married and ruined  what the deuce am i to do with two thousand pounds  such a sum wont last two years  ive lost a hundred and forty to crawley at cards and billiards since ive been down here a pretty manager of a mans matters you are forsooth  theres no denying that the position is a hard one dobbin replied after reading over the letter with a blank countenance and as you say it is partly of my making there are some men who wouldnt mind changing with you he added with a bitter smile how many captains in the regiment have two thousand pounds to the fore think you  you must live on your pay till your father relents and if you die you leave your wife a hundred a year  do you suppose a man of my habits call live on his pay and a hundred a year george cried out in great anger  you must be a fool to talk so dobbin  how the deuce am i to keep up my position in the world upon such a pitiful pittance  i cant change my habits  i must have my comforts  i wasnt brought up on porridge like macwhirter or on potatoes like old odowd  do you expect my wife to take in soldiers washing or ride after the regiment in a baggage waggon  well well said dobbin still goodnaturedly well get her a better conveyance  but try and remember that you are only a dethroned prince now george my boy and be quiet whilst the tempest lasts  it wont be for long  let your name be mentioned in the gazette and ill engage the old father relents towards you  mentioned in the gazette george answered  and in what part of it among the killed and wounded returns and at the top of the list very likely  psha  it will be time enough to cry out when we are hurt dobbin said  and if anything happens you know george i have got a little and i am not a marrying man and i shall not forget my godson in my will he added with a smile  whereupon the dispute endedas many scores of  such conversations between osborne and his friend had concluded previouslyby the former declaring there was no possibility of being angry with dobbin long and forgiving him very generously after abusing him without cause  i say becky cried rawdon crawley out of his dressingroom to his lady who was attiring herself for dinner in her own chamber  what said beckys shrill voice  she was looking over her shoulder in the glass  she had put on the neatest and freshest white frock imaginable and with bare shoulders and a little necklace and a light blue sash she looked the image of youthful innocence and girlish happiness  i say whatll mrs o do when o goes out with the regiment crawley said coming into the room performing a duet on his head with two huge hairbrushes and looking out from under his hair with admiration on his pretty little wife  i suppose shell cry her eyes out becky answered she has been whimpering half a dozen times at the very notion of it already to me  you dont care i suppose rawdon said half angry at his wifes want of feeling  you wretch dont you know that i intend to go with you becky replied  besides youre different  you go as general tuftos aidedecamp  we dont belong to the line mrs crawley said throwing up her head with an air that so enchanted her husband that he stooped down and kissed it  rawdon deardont you thinkyoud better get thatmoney from cupid before he goes becky continued fixing on a killing bow she called george osborne cupid  she had flattered him about his good looks a score of times already  she watched over him kindly at ecarte of a night when he would drop in to rawdons quarters for a halfhour before bedtime  she had often called him a horrid dissipated wretch and threatened to tell emmy of his wicked ways and naughty extravagant habits  she brought his cigar and lighted it for him she knew the effect of that manoeuvre having practised it in former days upon rawdon crawley he thought her gay brisk arch distinguee delightful in their little drives and dinners becky of course quite outshone poor emmy who remained very mute and timid while mrs crawley and her husband rattled away together and captain crawley and jos after he joined the young married people gobbled in silence  emmys mind somehow misgave her about her friend rebeccas wit spirits and accomplishments troubled her with a rueful disquiet they were only a week married and here was george already suffering ennui and eager for others society  she trembled for the future how shall i be a companion for him she thoughtso clever and so brilliant and i such a humble foolish creature how noble it was of him to marry meto give up everything and stoop down to me  i ought to have refused him only i had not the heart  i ought to have stopped at home and taken care of poor papa  and her neglect of her parents and indeed there was some foundation for this charge which the poor childs uneasy conscience brought against her was now remembered for the first time and caused her to blush with humiliation  oh thought she i have been very wicked and selfishselfish in forgetting them in their sorrowsselfish in forcing george to marry me  i know im not worthy of himi know he would have been happy without meand yeti tried i tried to give him up  it is hard when before seven days of marriage are over such thoughts and confessions as these force themselves on a little brides mind but so it was and the night before dobbin came to join these young peopleon a fine brilliant moonlight night of mayso warm and balmy that the windows were flung open to the balcony from which george and mrs crawley were gazing upon the calm ocean spread shining before them while rawdon and jos were engaged at backgammon withinamelia couched in a great chair quite neglected and watching both these parties felt a despair and remorse such as were bitter companions for that tender lonely soul  scarce a week was past and it was come to this the future had she regarded it offered a dismal prospect but emmy was too shy so to speak to look to that and embark alone on that wide sea and unfit to navigate it without a guide and protector i know miss smith has a mean opinion of her  but how many my dear madam are endowed with your prodigious strength of mind  gad what a fine night and how bright the moon is george said with a puff of his cigar which went soaring up skywards  how delicious they smell in the open air  i adore them  whod think the moon was two hundred and thirtysix thousand eight hundred and fortyseven miles off becky added gazing at that orb with a smile isnt it clever of me to remember that  pooh  we learned it all at miss pinkertons  how calm the sea is and how clear everything  i declare i can almost see the coast of france and her bright green eyes streamed out and shot into the night as if they could see through it  do you know what i intend to do one morning she said i find i can swim beautifully and some day when my aunt crawleys companionold briggs you knowyou remember herthat hooknosed woman with the long wisps of hairwhen briggs goes out to bathe i intend to dive under her awning and insist on a reconciliation in the water  isnt that a stratagem  george burst out laughing at the idea of this aquatic meeting whats the row there you two rawdon shouted out rattling the box  amelia was making a fool of herself in an absurd hysterical manner and retired to her own room to whimper in private  our history is destined in this chapter to go backwards and forwards in a very irresolute manner seemingly and having conducted our story to tomorrow presently we shall immediately again have occasion to step back to yesterday so that the whole of the tale may get a hearing as you behold at her majestys drawingroom the ambassadors and high dignitaries carriages whisk off from a private door while captain joness ladies are waiting for their fly as you see in the secretary of the treasurys antechamber a halfdozen of petitioners waiting patiently for their audience and called out one by one when suddenly an irish member or some eminent personage enters the apartment and instantly walks into mr undersecretary over the heads of all the people present so in the conduct of a tale the romancer is obliged to exercise this most partial sort of justice  although all the little incidents must be heard yet they must be put off when the great events make their appearance and surely such a circumstance as that which brought dobbin to brighton viz the ordering out of the guards and the line to belgium and the mustering of the allied armies in that country under the command of his grace the duke of wellingtonsuch a dignified circumstance as that i say was entitled to the pas over all minor occurrences whereof this history is composed mainly and hence a little trifling disarrangement and disorder was excusable and becoming we have only now advanced in time so far beyond chapter xxii as to have got our various characters up into their dressingrooms before the dinner which took place as usual on the day of dobbins arrival  george was too humane or too much occupied with the tie of his neckcloth to convey at once all the news to amelia which his comrade had brought with him from london  he came into her room however holding the attorneys letter in his hand and with so solemn and important an air that his wife always ingeniously on the watch for calamity thought the worst was about to befall and running up to her husband besought her dearest george to tell her everythinghe was ordered abroad there would be a battle next weekshe knew there would  dearest george parried the question about foreign service and with a melancholy shake of the head said no emmy it isnt that  its not myself i care about its you  i have had bad news from my father  he refuses any communication with me he has flung us off and leaves us to poverty  i can rough it well enough but you my dear how will you bear it read here and he handed her over the letter  amelia with a look of tender alarm in her eyes listened to her noble hero as he uttered the above generous sentiments and sitting down on the bed read the letter which george gave her with such a pompous martyrlike air  her face cleared up as she read the document however the idea of sharing poverty and privation in company with the beloved object is as we have before said far from being disagreeable to a warmhearted woman the notion was actually pleasant to little amelia  then as usual she was ashamed of herself for feeling happy at such an indecorous moment and checked her pleasure saying demurely o george how your poor heart must bleed at the idea of being separated from your papa  it does said george with an agonised countenance  but he cant be angry with you long she continued nobody could im sure  he must forgive you my dearest kindest husband  o i shall never forgive myself if he does not  what vexes me my poor emmy is not my misfortune but yours george said  i dont care for a little poverty and i think without vanity ive talents enough to make my own way  that you have interposed his wife who thought that war should cease and her husband should be made a general instantly  yes i shall make my way as well as another osborne went on but you my dear girl how can i bear your being deprived of the comforts and station in society which my wife had a right to expect my dearest girl in barracks the wife of a soldier in a marching regiment subject to all sorts of annoyance and privation it makes me miserable  emmy quite at ease as this was her husbands only cause of disquiet took his hand and with a radiant face and smile began to warble that stanza from the favourite song of wapping old stairs in which the heroine after rebuking her tom for inattention promises his trousers to mend and his grog too to make if he will be constant and kind and not forsake her  besides she said after a pause during which she looked as pretty and happy as any young woman need isnt two thousand pounds an immense deal of money george  george laughed at her naivete and finally they went down to dinner amelia clinging to georges arm still warbling the tune of wapping old stairs and more pleased and light of mind than she had been for some days past  thus the repast which at length came off instead of being dismal was an exceedingly brisk and merry one the excitement of the campaign counteracted in georges mind the depression occasioned by the disinheriting letter dobbin still kept up his character of rattle  he amused the company with accounts of the army in belgium where nothing but fetes and gaiety and fashion were going on  then having a particular end in view this dexterous captain proceeded to describe mrs major odowd packing her own and her majors wardrobe and how his best epaulets had been stowed into a tea canister whilst her own famous yellow turban with the bird of paradise wrapped in brown paper was locked up in the majors tin cockedhat case and wondered what effect it would have at the french kings court at ghent or the great military balls at brussels  ghent brussels cried out amelia with a sudden shock and start is the regiment ordered away georgeis it ordered away a look of terror came over the sweet smiling face and she clung to george as by an instinct  dont be afraid dear he said goodnaturedly it is but a twelve hours passage  it wont hurt you  you shall go too emmy  i intend to go said becky  im on the staff  general tufto is a great flirt of mine  isnt he rawdon rawdon laughed out with his usual roar  william dobbin flushed up quite red  she cant go he said think of theof the danger he was going to add but had not all his conversation during dinnertime tended to prove there was none he became very confused and silent  i must and will go amelia cried with the greatest spirit and george applauding her resolution patted her under the chin and asked all the persons present if they ever saw such a termagant of a wife and agreed that the lady should bear him company  well have mrs odowd to chaperon you he said  what cared she so long as her husband was near her  thus somehow the bitterness of a parting was juggled away  though war and danger were in store war and danger might not befall for months to come  there was a respite at any rate which made the timid little amelia almost as happy as a full reprieve would have done and which even dobbin owned in his heart was very welcome  for to be permitted to see her was now the greatest privilege and hope of his life and he thought with himself secretly how he would watch and protect her  i wouldnt have let her go if i had been married to her he thought  but george was the master and his friend did not think fit to remonstrate  putting her arm round her friends waist rebecca at length carried amelia off from the dinnertable where so much business of importance had been discussed and left the gentlemen in a highly exhilarated state drinking and talking very gaily  in the course of the evening rawdon got a little familynote from his wife which although he crumpled it up and burnt it instantly in the candle we had the good luck to read over rebeccas shoulder great news she wrote  mrs bute is gone  get the money from cupid tonight as hell be off tomorrow most likely  mind thisr so when the little company was about adjourning to coffee in the womens apartment rawdon touched osborne on the elbow and said gracefully i say osborne my boy if quite convenient ill trouble you for that ere small trifle it was not quite convenient but nevertheless george gave him a considerable present instalment in banknotes from his pocketbook and a bill on his agents at a weeks date for the remaining sum  this matter arranged george and jos and dobbin held a council of war over their cigars and agreed that a general move should be made for london in joss open carriage the next day  jos i think would have preferred staying until rawdon crawley quitted brighton but dobbin and george overruled him and he agreed to carry the party to town and ordered four horses as became his dignity  with these they set off in state after breakfast the next day  amelia had risen very early in the morning and packed her little trunks with the greatest alacrity while osborne lay in bed deploring that she had not a maid to help her  she was only too glad however to perform this office for herself  a dim uneasy sentiment about rebecca filled her mind already and although they kissed each other most tenderly at parting yet we know what jealousy is and mrs amelia possessed that among other virtues of her sex  besides these characters who are coming and going away we must remember that there were some other old friends of ours at brighton miss crawley namely and the suite in attendance upon her  now although rebecca and her husband were but at a few stones throw of the lodgings which the invalid miss crawley occupied the old ladys door remained as pitilessly closed to them as it had been heretofore in london  as long as she remained by the side of her sisterinlaw mrs bute crawley took care that her beloved matilda should not be agitated by a meeting with her nephew  when the spinster took her drive the faithful mrs bute sate beside her in the carriage when miss crawley took the air in a chair mrs bute marched on one side of the vehicle whilst honest briggs occupied the other wing and if they met rawdon and his wife by chancealthough the former constantly and obsequiously took off his hat the misscrawley party passed him by with such a frigid and killing indifference that rawdon began to despair  we might as well be in london as here captain rawdon often said with a downcast air  a comfortable inn in brighton is better than a spunginghouse in chancery lane his wife answered who was of a more cheerful temperament  think of those two aidesdecamp of mr moses the sheriffsofficer who watched our lodging for a week  our friends here are very stupid but mr jos and captain cupid are better companions than mr mosess men rawdon my love  i wonder the writs havent followed me down here rawdon continued still desponding  when they do well find means to give them the slip said dauntless little becky and further pointed out to her husband the great comfort and advantage of meeting jos and osborne whose acquaintance had brought to rawdon crawley a most timely little supply of ready money  it will hardly be enough to pay the inn bill grumbled the guardsman  why need we pay it said the lady who had an answer for everything  through rawdons valet who still kept up a trifling acquaintance with the male inhabitants of miss crawleys servants hall and was instructed to treat the coachman to drink whenever they met old miss crawleys movements were pretty well known by our young couple and rebecca luckily bethought herself of being unwell and of calling in the same apothecary who was in attendance upon the spinster so that their information was on the whole tolerably complete  nor was miss briggs although forced to adopt a hostile attitude secretly inimical to rawdon and his wife  she was naturally of a kindly and forgiving disposition  now that the cause of jealousy was removed her dislike for rebecca disappeared also and she remembered the latters invariable good words and good humour  and indeed she and mrs firkin the ladysmaid and the whole of miss crawleys household groaned under the tyranny of the triumphant mrs bute  as often will be the case that good but imperious woman pushed her advantages too far and her successes quite unmercifully  she had in the course of a few weeks brought the invalid to such a state of helpless docility that the poor soul yielded herself entirely to her sisters orders and did not even dare to complain of her slavery to briggs or firkin  mrs bute measured out the glasses of wine which miss crawley was daily allowed to take with irresistible accuracy greatly to the annoyance of firkin and the butler who found themselves deprived of control over even the sherrybottle she apportioned the sweetbreads jellies chickens their quantity and order night and noon and morning she brought the abominable drinks ordained by the doctor and made her patient swallow them with so affecting an obedience that firkin said my poor missus du take her physic like a lamb she prescribed the drive in the carriage or the ride in the chair and in a word ground down the old lady in her convalescence in such a way as only belongs to your propermanaging motherly moral woman  if ever the patient faintly resisted and pleaded for a little bit more dinner or a little drop less medicine the nurse threatened her with instantaneous death when miss crawley instantly gave in shes no spirit left in her firkin remarked to briggs she aint ave called me a fool these three weeks finally mrs bute had made up her mind to dismiss the aforesaid honest ladysmaid mr bowls the large confidential man and briggs herself and to send for her daughters from the rectory previous to removing the dear invalid bodily to queens crawley when an odious accident happened which called her away from duties so pleasing  the reverend bute crawley her husband riding home one night fell with his horse and broke his collarbone  fever and inflammatory symptoms set in and mrs bute was forced to leave sussex for hampshire  as soon as ever bute was restored she promised to return to her dearest friend and departed leaving the strongest injunctions with the household regarding their behaviour to their mistress and as soon as she got into the southampton coach there was such a jubilee and sense of relief in all miss crawleys house as the company of persons assembled there had not experienced for many a week before  that very day miss crawley left off her afternoon dose of medicine  that afternoon bowls opened an independent bottle of sherry for himself and mrs firkin  that night miss crawley and miss briggs indulged in a game of piquet instead of one of porteuss sermons  it was as in the old nurserystory when the stick forgot to beat the dog and the whole course of events underwent a peaceful and happy revolution  at a very early hour in the morning twice or thrice a week miss briggs used to betake herself to a bathingmachine and disport in the water in a flannel gown and an oilskin cap  rebecca as we have seen was aware of this circumstance and though she did not attempt to storm briggs as she had threatened and actually dive into that ladys presence and surprise her under the sacredness of the awning mrs rawdon determined to attack briggs as she came away from her bath refreshed and invigorated by her dip and likely to be in good humour  so getting up very early the next morning becky brought the telescope in their sittingroom which faced the sea to bear upon the bathingmachines on the beach saw briggs arrive enter her box and put out to sea and was on the shore just as the nymph of whom she came in quest stepped out of the little caravan on to the shingles  it was a pretty picture  the beach the bathingwomens faces the long line of rocks and building were blushing and bright in the sunshine rebecca wore a kind tender smile on her face and was holding out her pretty white hand as briggs emerged from the box  what could briggs do but accept the salutation  miss shmrs crawley she said  mrs crawley seized her hand pressed it to her heart and with a sudden impulse flinging her arms round briggs kissed her affectionately  dear dear friend she said with a touch of such natural feeling that miss briggs of course at once began to melt and even the bathingwoman was mollified  rebecca found no difficulty in engaging briggs in a long intimate and delightful conversation  everything that had passed since the morning of beckys sudden departure from miss crawleys house in park lane up to the present day and mrs butes happy retreat was discussed and described by briggs  all miss crawleys symptoms and the particulars of her illness and medical treatment were narrated by the confidante with that fulness and accuracy which women delight in  about their complaints and their doctors do ladies ever tire of talking to each other  briggs did not on this occasion nor did rebecca weary of listening  she was thankful truly thankful that the dear kind briggs that the faithful the invaluable firkin had been permitted to remain with their benefactress through her illness  heaven bless her though she rebecca had seemed to act undutifully towards miss crawley yet was not her fault a natural and excusable one could she help giving her hand to the man who had won her heart  briggs the sentimental could only turn up her eyes to heaven at this appeal and heave a sympathetic sigh and think that she too had given away her affections long years ago and own that rebecca was no very great criminal  can i ever forget her who so befriended the friendless orphan  no though she has cast me off the latter said i shall never cease to love her and i would devote my life to her service  as my own benefactress as my beloved rawdons adored relative i love and admire miss crawley dear miss briggs beyond any woman in the world and next to her i love all those who are faithful to her  i would never have treated miss crawleys faithful friends as that odious designing mrs bute has done  rawdon who was all heart rebecca continued although his outward manners might seem rough and careless had said a hundred times with tears in his eyes that he blessed heaven for sending his dearest aunty two such admirable nurses as her attached firkin and her admirable miss briggs  should the machinations of the horrible mrs bute end as she too much feared they would in banishing everybody that miss crawley loved from her side and leaving that poor lady a victim to those harpies at the rectory rebecca besought her miss briggs to remember that her own home humble as it was was always open to receive briggs dear friend she exclaimed in a transport of enthusiasm some hearts can never forget benefits all women are not bute crawleys though why should i complain of her rebecca added though i have been her tool and the victim to her arts do i not owe my dearest rawdon to her  and rebecca unfolded to briggs all mrs butes conduct at queens crawley which though unintelligible to her then was clearly enough explained by the events nownow that the attachment had sprung up which mrs bute had encouraged by a thousand artificesnow that two innocent people had fallen into the snares which she had laid for them and loved and married and been ruined through her schemes  it was all very true  briggs saw the stratagems as clearly as possible  mrs bute had made the match between rawdon and rebecca yet though the latter was a perfectly innocent victim miss briggs could not disguise from her friend her fear that miss crawleys affections were hopelessly estranged from rebecca and that the old lady would never forgive her nephew for making so imprudent a marriage  on this point rebecca had her own opinion and still kept up a good heart  if miss crawley did not forgive them at present she might at least relent on a future day  even now there was only that puling sickly pitt crawley between rawdon and a baronetcy and should anything happen to the former all would be well  at all events to have mrs butes designs exposed and herself well abused was a satisfaction and might be advantageous to rawdons interest and rebecca after an hours chat with her recovered friend left her with the most tender demonstrations of regard and quite assured that the conversation they had had together would be reported to miss crawley before many hours were over  this interview ended it became full time for rebecca to return to her inn where all the party of the previous day were assembled at a farewell breakfast  rebecca took such a tender leave of amelia as became two women who loved each other as sisters and having used her handkerchief plentifully and hung on her friends neck as if they were parting for ever and waved the handkerchief which was quite dry by the way out of window as the carriage drove off she came back to the breakfast table and ate some prawns with a good deal of appetite considering her emotion and while she was munching these delicacies explained to rawdon what had occurred in her morning walk between herself and briggs  her hopes were very high  she made her husband share them  she generally succeeded in making her husband share all her opinions whether melancholy or cheerful  you will now if you please my dear sit down at the writingtable and pen me a pretty little letter to miss crawley in which youll say that you are a good boy and that sort of thing  so rawdon sate down and wrote off brighton thursday and my dear aunt with great rapidity but there the gallant officers imagination failed him  he mumbled the end of his pen and looked up in his wifes face  she could not help laughing at his rueful countenance and marching up and down the room with her hands behind her the little woman began to dictate a letter which he took down  before quitting the country and commencing a campaign which very possibly may be fatal  what said rawdon rather surprised but took the humour of the phrase and presently wrote it down with a grin  which very possibly may be fatal i have come hither  why not say come here becky  come heres grammar the dragoon interposed  i have come hither rebecca insisted with a stamp of her foot to say farewell to my dearest and earliest friend  i beseech you before i go not perhaps to return once more to let me press the hand from which i have received nothing but kindnesses all my life  kindnesses all my life echoed rawdon scratching down the words and quite amazed at his own facility of composition  i ask nothing from you but that we should part not in anger  i have the pride of my family on some points though not on all  i married a painters daughter and am not ashamed of the union  no run me through the body if i am rawdon ejaculated  you old booby rebecca said pinching his ear and looking over to see that he made no mistakes in spellingbeseech is not spelt with an a and earliest is  so he altered these words bowing to the superior knowledge of his little missis  i thought that you were aware of the progress of my attachment rebecca continued  i knew that mrs bute crawley confirmed and encouraged it  but i make no reproaches  i married a poor woman and am content to abide by what i have done  leave your property dear aunt as you will  i shall never complain of the way in which you dispose of it  i would have you believe that i love you for yourself and not for moneys sake  i want to be reconciled to you ere i leave england  let me let me see you before i go  a few weeks or months hence it may be too late and i cannot bear the notion of quitting the country without a kind word of farewell from you  she wont recognise my style in that said becky  i made the sentences short and brisk on purpose and this authentic missive was despatched under cover to miss briggs  old miss crawley laughed when briggs with great mystery handed her over this candid and simple statement  we may read it now mrs bute is away she said  read it to me briggs  when briggs had read the epistle out her patroness laughed more dont you see you goose she said to briggs who professed to be much touched by the honest affection which pervaded the composition dont you see that rawdon never wrote a word of it  he never wrote to me without asking for money in his life and all his letters are full of bad spelling and dashes and bad grammar  it is that little serpent of a governess who rules him they are all alike miss crawley thought in her heart  they all want me dead and are hankering for my money  i dont mind seeing rawdon she added after a pause and in a tone of perfect indifference  i had just as soon shake hands with him as not  provided there is no scene why shouldnt we meet  i dont mind but human patience has its limits and mind my dear i respectfully decline to receive mrs rawdoni cant support that quiteand miss briggs was fain to be content with this halfmessage of conciliation and thought that the best method of bringing the old lady and her nephew together was to warn rawdon to be in waiting on the cliff when miss crawley went out for her air in her chair  there they met  i dont know whether miss crawley had any private feeling of regard or emotion upon seeing her old favourite but she held out a couple of fingers to him with as smiling and goodhumoured an air as if they had met only the day before  and as for rawdon he turned as red as scarlet and wrung off briggss hand so great was his rapture and his confusion at the meeting perhaps it was interest that moved him  or perhaps affection  perhaps he was touched by the change which the illness of the last weeks had wrought in his aunt  the old girl has always acted like a trump to me he said to his wife as he narrated the interview and i felt you know rather queer and that sort of thing  i walked by the side of the whatdyecallem you know and to her own door where bowls came to help her in  and i wanted to go in very much only  you didnt go in rawdon screamed his wife  no my dear im hanged if i wasnt afraid when it came to the point  you fool you ought to have gone in and never come out again rebecca said  dont call me names said the big guardsman sulkily perhaps i was a fool becky but you shouldnt say so and he gave his wife a look such as his countenance could wear when angered and such as was not pleasant to face  well dearest tomorrow you must be on the lookout and go and see her mind whether she asks you or no rebecca said trying to soothe her angry yokemate  on which he replied that he would do exactly as he liked and would just thank her to keep a civil tongue in her headand the wounded husband went away and passed the forenoon at the billiardroom sulky silent and suspicious  but before the night was over he was compelled to give in and own as usual to his wifes superior prudence and foresight by the most melancholy confirmation of the presentiments which she had regarding the consequences of the mistake which he had made  miss crawley must have had some emotion upon seeing him and shaking hands with him after so long a rupture  she mused upon the meeting a considerable time rawdon is getting very fat and old briggs she said to her companion  his nose has become red and he is exceedingly coarse in appearance  his marriage to that woman has hopelessly vulgarised him mrs bute always said they drank together and i have no doubt they do yes  he smelt of gin abominably  i remarked it  didnt you  in vain briggs interposed that mrs bute spoke ill of everybody and as far as a person in her humble position could judge was an  an artful designing woman  yes so she is and she does speak ill of every onebut i am certain that woman has made rawdon drink all those low people do  he was very much affected at seeing you maam the companion said and i am sure when you remember that he is going to the field of danger  how much money has he promised you briggs the old spinster cried out working herself into a nervous ragethere now of course you begin to cry  i hate scenes  why am i always to be worried  go and cry up in your own room and send firkin to meno stop sit down and blow your nose and leave off crying and write a letter to captain crawley poor briggs went and placed herself obediently at the writingbook  its leaves were blotted all over with relics of the firm strong rapid handwriting of the spinsters late amanuensis mrs bute crawley  begin my dear sir or dear sir that will be better and say you are desired by miss crawleyno by miss crawleys medical man by mr creamer to state that my health is such that all strong emotions would be dangerous in my present delicate conditionand that i must decline any family discussions or interviews whatever and thank him for coming to brighton and so forth and beg him not to stay any longer on my account  and miss briggs you may add that i wish him a bon voyage and that if he will take the trouble to call upon my lawyers in grays inn square he will find there a communication for him  yes that will do and that will make him leave brighton the benevolent briggs penned this sentence with the utmost satisfaction  to seize upon me the very day after mrs bute was gone the old lady prattled on it was too indecent briggs my dear write to mrs crawley and say she neednt come back  noshe needntand she shantand i wont be a slave in my own houseand i wont be starved and choked with poison  they all want to kill meallalland with this the lonely old woman burst into a scream of hysterical tears  the last scene of her dismal vanity fair comedy was fast approaching the tawdry lamps were going out one by one and the dark curtain was almost ready to descend  that final paragraph which referred rawdon to miss crawleys solicitor in london and which briggs had written so goodnaturedly consoled the dragoon and his wife somewhat after their first blank disappointment on reading the spinsters refusal of a reconciliation  and it effected the purpose for which the old lady had caused it to be written by making rawdon very eager to get to london  out of joss losings and george osbornes banknotes he paid his bill at the inn the landlord whereof does not probably know to this day how doubtfully his account once stood  for as a general sends his baggage to the rear before an action rebecca had wisely packed up all their chief valuables and sent them off under care of georges servant who went in charge of the trunks on the coach back to london  rawdon and his wife returned by the same conveyance next day  i should have liked to see the old girl before we went rawdon said she looks so cut up and altered that im sure she cant last long  i wonder what sort of a cheque i shall have at waxys  two hundredit cant be less than two hundredhey becky  in consequence of the repeated visits of the aidesdecamp of the sheriff of middlesex rawdon and his wife did not go back to their lodgings at brompton but put up at an inn  early the next morning rebecca had an opportunity of seeing them as she skirted that suburb on her road to old mrs sedleys house at fulham whither she went to look for her dear amelia and her brighton friends  they were all off to chatham thence to harwich to take shipping for belgium with the regimentkind old mrs sedley very much depressed and tearful solitary  returning from this visit rebecca found her husband who had been off to grays inn and learnt his fate  he came back furious  by jove becky says he shes only given me twenty pound  though it told against themselves the joke was too good and becky burst out laughing at rawdons discomfiture    chapter xxvi  between london and chatham  on quitting brighton our friend george as became a person of rank and fashion travelling in a barouche with four horses drove in state to a fine hotel in cavendish square where a suite of splendid rooms and a table magnificently furnished with plate and surrounded by a halfdozen of black and silent waiters was ready to receive the young gentleman and his bride  george did the honours of the place with a princely air to jos and dobbin and amelia for the first time and with exceeding shyness and timidity presided at what george called her own table  george poohpoohed the wine and bullied the waiters royally and jos gobbled the turtle with immense satisfaction dobbin helped him to it for the lady of the house before whom the tureen was placed was so ignorant of the contents that she was going to help mr sedley without bestowing upon him either calipash or calipee  the splendour of the entertainment and the apartments in which it was given alarmed mr dobbin who remonstrated after dinner when jos was asleep in the great chair  but in vain he cried out against the enormity of turtle and champagne that was fit for an archbishop ive always been accustomed to travel like a gentleman george said and damme my wife shall travel like a lady  as long as theres a shot in the locker she shall want for nothing said the generous fellow quite pleased with himself for his magnificence of spirit  nor did dobbin try and convince him that amelias happiness was not centred in turtlesoup  a while after dinner amelia timidly expressed a wish to go and see her mamma at fulham which permission george granted her with some grumbling  and she tripped away to her enormous bedroom in the centre of which stood the enormous funereal bed that the emperor halixanders sister slep in when the allied sufferings was here and put on her little bonnet and shawl with the utmost eagerness and pleasure  george was still drinking claret when she returned to the diningroom and made no signs of moving  arnt you coming with me dearest she asked him  no the dearest had business that night his man should get her a coach and go with her  and the coach being at the door of the hotel amelia made george a little disappointed curtsey after looking vainly into his face once or twice and went sadly down the great staircase captain dobbin after who handed her into the vehicle and saw it drive away to its destination the very valet was ashamed of mentioning the address to the hackneycoachman before the hotel waiters and promised to instruct him when they got further on  dobbin walked home to his old quarters and the slaughters thinking very likely that it would be delightful to be in that hackneycoach along with mrs osborne george was evidently of quite a different taste for when he had taken wine enough he went off to halfprice at the play to see mr kean perform in shylock  captain osborne was a great lover of the drama and had himself performed highcomedy characters with great distinction in several garrison theatrical entertainments  jos slept on until long after dark when he woke up with a start at the motions of his servant who was removing and emptying the decanters on the table and the hackneycoach stand was again put into requisition for a carriage to convey this stout hero to his lodgings and bed  mrs sedley you may be sure clasped her daughter to her heart with all maternal eagerness and affection running out of the door as the carriage drew up before the little gardengate to welcome the weeping trembling young bride  old mr clapp who was in his shirtsleeves trimming the gardenplot shrank back alarmed  the irish servantlass rushed up from the kitchen and smiled a god bless you  amelia could hardly walk along the flags and up the steps into the parlour  how the floodgates were opened and mother and daughter wept when they were together embracing each other in this sanctuary may readily be imagined by every reader who possesses the least sentimental turn when dont ladies weep  at what occasion of joy sorrow or other business of life and after such an event as a marriage mother and daughter were surely at liberty to give way to a sensibility which is as tender as it is refreshing about a question of marriage i have seen women who hate each other kiss and cry together quite fondly how much more do they feel when they love  good mothers are married over again at their daughters weddings and as for subsequent events who does not know how ultramaternal grandmothers arein fact a woman until she is a grandmother does not often really know what to be a mother is  let us respect amelia and her mamma whispering and whimpering and laughing and crying in the parlour and the twilight  old mr sedley did  he had not divined who was in the carriage when it drove up he had not flown out to meet his daughter though he kissed her very warmly when she entered the room where he was occupied as usual with his papers and tapes and statements of accounts and after sitting with the mother and daughter for a short time he very wisely left the little apartment in their possession  georges valet was looking on in a very supercilious manner at mr clapp in his shirtsleeves watering his rosebushes  he took off his hat however with much condescension to mr sedley who asked news about his soninlaw and about joss carriage and whether his horses had been down to brighton and about that infernal traitor bonaparty and the war until the irish maidservant came with a plate and a bottle of wine from which the old gentleman insisted upon helping the valet  he gave him a halfguinea too which the servant pocketed with a mixture of wonder and contempt  to the health of your master and mistress trotter mr sedley said and heres something to drink your health when you get home trotter  there were but nine days past since amelia had left that little cottage and homeand yet how far off the time seemed since she had bidden it farewell  what a gulf lay between her and that past life she could look back to it from her present standingplace and contemplate almost as another being the young unmarried girl absorbed in her love having no eyes but for one special object receiving parental affection if not ungratefully at least indifferently and as if it were her dueher whole heart and thoughts bent on the accomplishment of one desire  the review of those days so lately gone yet so far away touched her with shame and the aspect of the kind parents filled her with tender remorse was the prize gainedthe heaven of lifeand the winner still doubtful and unsatisfied  as his hero and heroine pass the matrimonial barrier the novelist generally drops the curtain as if the drama were over then  the doubts and struggles of life ended as if once landed in the marriage country all were green and pleasant there  and wife and husband had nothing to do but to link each others arms together and wander gently downwards towards old age in happy and perfect fruition  but our little amelia was just on the bank of her new country and was already looking anxiously back towards the sad friendly figures waving farewell to her across the stream from the other distant shore  in honour of the young brides arrival her mother thought it necessary to prepare i dont know what festive entertainment and after the first ebullition of talk took leave of mrs george osborne for a while and dived down to the lower regions of the house to a sort of kitchenparlour occupied by mr and mrs clapp and in the evening when her dishes were washed and her curlpapers removed by miss flannigan the irish servant there to take measures for the preparing of a magnificent ornamented tea  all people have their ways of expressing kindness and it seemed to mrs sedley that a muffin and a quantity of orange marmalade spread out in a little cutglass saucer would be peculiarly agreeable refreshments to amelia in her most interesting situation  while these delicacies were being transacted below amelia leaving the drawingroom walked upstairs and found herself she scarce knew how in the little room which she had occupied before her marriage and in that very chair in which she had passed so many bitter hours she sank back in its arms as if it were an old friend and fell to thinking over the past week and the life beyond it  already to be looking sadly and vaguely back always to be pining for something which when obtained brought doubt and sadness rather than pleasure here was the lot of our poor little creature and harmless lost wanderer in the great struggling crowds of vanity fair  here she sate and recalled to herself fondly that image of george to which she had knelt before marriage  did she own to herself how different the real man was from that superb young hero whom she had worshipped  it requires many many yearsand a man must be very bad indeedbefore a womans pride and vanity will let her own to such a confession  then rebeccas twinkling green eyes and baleful smile lighted upon her and filled her with dismay  and so she sate for awhile indulging in her usual mood of selfish brooding in that very listless melancholy attitude in which the honest maidservant had found her on the day when she brought up the letter in which george renewed his offer of marriage  she looked at the little white bed which had been hers a few days before and thought she would like to sleep in it that night and wake as formerly with her mother smiling over her in the morning then she thought with terror of the great funereal damask pavilion in the vast and dingy state bedroom which was awaiting her at the grand hotel in cavendish square  dear little white bed how many a long night had she wept on its pillow how she had despaired and hoped to die there and now were not all her wishes accomplished and the lover of whom she had despaired her own for ever  kind mother how patiently and tenderly she had watched round that bed she went and knelt down by the bedside and there this wounded and timorous but gentle and loving soul sought for consolation where as yet it must be owned our little girl had but seldom looked for it  love had been her faith hitherto and the sad bleeding disappointed heart began to feel the want of another consoler  have we a right to repeat or to overhear her prayers these brother are secrets and out of the domain of vanity fair in which our story lies  but this may be said that when the tea was finally announced our young lady came downstairs a great deal more cheerful that she did not despond or deplore her fate or think about georges coldness or rebeccas eyes as she had been wont to do of late  she went downstairs and kissed her father and mother and talked to the old gentleman and made him more merry than he had been for many a day she sate down at the piano which dobbin had bought for her and sang over all her fathers favourite old songs  she pronounced the tea to be excellent and praised the exquisite taste in which the marmalade was arranged in the saucers  and in determining to make everybody else happy she found herself so and was sound asleep in the great funereal pavilion and only woke up with a smile when george arrived from the theatre  for the next day george had more important business to transact than that which took him to see mr kean in shylock  immediately on his arrival in london he had written off to his fathers solicitors signifying his royal pleasure that an interview should take place between them on the morrow  his hotel bill losses at billiards and cards to captain crawley had almost drained the young mans purse which wanted replenishing before he set out on his travels and he had no resource but to infringe upon the two thousand pounds which the attorneys were commissioned to pay over to him  he had a perfect belief in his own mind that his father would relent before very long how could any parent be obdurate for a length of time against such a paragon as he was  if his mere past and personal merits did not succeed in mollifying his father george determined that he would distinguish himself so prodigiously in the ensuing campaign that the old gentleman must give in to him  and if not bah the world was before him  his luck might change at cards and there was a deal of spending in two thousand pounds  so he sent off amelia once more in a carriage to her mamma with strict orders and carte blanche to the two ladies to purchase everything requisite for a lady of mrs george osbornes fashion who was going on a foreign tour  they had but one day to complete the outfit and it may be imagined that their business therefore occupied them pretty fully  in a carriage once more bustling about from milliner to linendraper escorted back to the carriage by obsequious shopmen or polite owners mrs sedley was herself again almost and sincerely happy for the first time since their misfortunes  nor was mrs amelia at all above the pleasure of shopping and bargaining and seeing and buying pretty things would any man the most philosophic give twopence for a woman who was  she gave herself a little treat obedient to her husbands orders and purchased a quantity of ladys gear showing a great deal of taste and elegant discernment as all the shopfolks said  and about the war that was ensuing mrs osborne was not much alarmed bonaparty was to be crushed almost without a struggle margate packets were sailing every day filled with men of fashion and ladies of note on their way to brussels and ghent  people were going not so much to a war as to a fashionable tour  the newspapers laughed the wretched upstart and swindler to scorn  such a corsican wretch as that withstand the armies of europe and the genius of the immortal wellington  amelia held him in utter contempt for it needs not to be said that this soft and gentle creature took her opinions from those people who surrounded her such fidelity being much too humbleminded to think for itself well in a word she and her mother performed a great days shopping and she acquitted herself with considerable liveliness and credit on this her first appearance in the genteel world of london  george meanwhile with his hat on one side his elbows squared and his swaggering martial air made for bedford row and stalked into the attorneys offices as if he was lord of every palefaced clerk who was scribbling there  he ordered somebody to inform mr higgs that captain osborne was waiting in a fierce and patronizing way as if the pekin of an attorney who had thrice his brains fifty times his money and a thousand times his experience was a wretched underling who should instantly leave all his business in life to attend on the captains pleasure  he did not see the sneer of contempt which passed all round the room from the first clerk to the articled gents from the articled gents to the ragged writers and whitefaced runners in clothes too tight for them as he sate there tapping his boot with his cane and thinking what a parcel of miserable poor devils these were  the miserable poor devils knew all about his affairs  they talked about them over their pints of beer at their publichouse clubs to other clerks of a night ye gods what do not attorneys and attorneys clerks know in london nothing is hidden from their inquisition and their families mutely rule our city  perhaps george expected when he entered mr higgss apartment to find that gentleman commissioned to give him some message of compromise or conciliation from his father perhaps his haughty and cold demeanour was adopted as a sign of his spirit and resolution but if so his fierceness was met by a chilling coolness and indifference on the attorneys part that rendered swaggering absurd  he pretended to be writing at a paper when the captain entered  pray sit down sir said he and i will attend to your little affair in a moment  mr poe get the release papers if you please and then he fell to writing again  poe having produced those papers his chief calculated the amount of two thousand pounds stock at the rate of the day and asked captain osborne whether he would take the sum in a cheque upon the bankers or whether he should direct the latter to purchase stock to that amount one of the late mrs osbornes trustees is out of town he said indifferently but my client wishes to meet your wishes and have done with the business as quick as possible  give me a cheque sir said the captain very surlily damn the shillings and halfpence sir he added as the lawyer was making out the amount of the draft and flattering himself that by this stroke of magnanimity he had put the old quiz to the blush he stalked out of the office with the paper in his pocket  that chap will be in gaol in two years mr higgs said to mr poe  wont o come round sir dont you think  wont the monument come round mr higgs replied  hes going it pretty fast said the clerk  hes only married a week and i saw him and some other military chaps handing mrs highflyer to her carriage after the play and then another case was called and mr george osborne thenceforth dismissed from these worthy gentlemens memory  the draft was upon our friends hulker and bullock of lombard street to whose house still thinking he was doing business george bent his way and from whom he received his money  frederick bullock esq whose yellow face was over a ledger at which sate a demure clerk happened to be in the bankingroom when george entered his yellow face turned to a more deadly colour when he saw the captain and he slunk back guiltily into the inmost parlour  george was too busy gloating over the money for he had never had such a sum before to mark the countenance or flight of the cadaverous suitor of his sister  fred bullock told old osborne of his sons appearance and conduct he came in as bold as brass said frederick  he has drawn out every shilling  how long will a few hundred pounds last such a chap as that osborne swore with a great oath that he little cared when or how soon he spent it  fred dined every day in russell square now  but altogether george was highly pleased with his days business  all his own baggage and outfit was put into a state of speedy preparation and he paid amelias purchases with cheques on his agents and with the splendour of a lord    chapter xxvii  in which amelia joins her regiment  when joss fine carriage drove up to the inn door at chatham the first face which amelia recognized was the friendly countenance of captain dobbin who had been pacing the street for an hour past in expectation of his friends arrival  the captain with shells on his frockcoat and a crimson sash and sabre presented a military appearance which made jos quite proud to be able to claim such an acquaintance and the stout civilian hailed him with a cordiality very different from the reception which jos vouchsafed to his friend in brighton and bond street  along with the captain was ensign stubble who as the barouche neared the inn burst out with an exclamation of by jove what a pretty girl highly applauding osbornes choice  indeed amelia dressed in her weddingpelisse and pink ribbons with a flush in her face occasioned by rapid travel through the open air looked so fresh and pretty as fully to justify the ensigns compliment dobbin liked him for making it  as he stepped forward to help the lady out of the carriage stubble saw what a pretty little hand she gave him and what a sweet pretty little foot came tripping down the step  he blushed profusely and made the very best bow of which he was capable to which amelia seeing the number of the the regiment embroidered on the ensigns cap replied with a blushing smile and a curtsey on her part which finished the young ensign on the spot dobbin took most kindly to mr stubble from that day and encouraged him to talk about amelia in their private walks and at each others quarters  it became the fashion indeed among all the honest young fellows of the th to adore and admire mrs osborne  her simple artless behaviour and modest kindness of demeanour won all their unsophisticated hearts all which simplicity and sweetness are quite impossible to describe in print  but who has not beheld these among women and recognised the presence of all sorts of qualities in them even though they say no more to you than that they are engaged to dance the next quadrille or that it is very hot weather george always the champion of his regiment rose immensely in the opinion of the youth of the corps by his gallantry in marrying this portionless young creature and by his choice of such a pretty kind partner  in the sittingroom which was awaiting the travellers amelia to her surprise found a letter addressed to mrs captain osborne  it was a triangular billet on pink paper and sealed with a dove and an olive branch and a profusion of light blue sealing wax and it was written in a very large though undecided female hand  its peggy odowds fist said george laughing  i know it by the kisses on the seal and in fact it was a note from mrs major odowd requesting the pleasure of mrs osbornes company that very evening to a small friendly party  you must go george said you will make acquaintance with the regiment there  odowd goes in command of the regiment and peggy goes in command  but they had not been for many minutes in the enjoyment of mrs odowds letter when the door was flung open and a stout jolly lady in a ridinghabit followed by a couple of officers of ours entered the room  sure i couldnt stop till taytime  present me garge my dear fellow to your lady  madam im deloighted to see ye and to present to you me husband meejor odowd and with this the jolly lady in the ridinghabit grasped amelias hand very warmly and the latter knew at once that the lady was before her whom her husband had so often laughed at  youve often heard of me from that husband of yours said the lady with great vivacity  youve often heard of her echoed her husband the major  amelia answered smiling that she had  and small good hes told you of me mrs odowd replied adding that george was a wicked divvle  that ill go bail for said the major trying to look knowing at which george laughed and mrs odowd with a tap of her whip told the major to be quiet and then requested to be presented in form to mrs captain osborne  this my dear said george with great gravity is my very good kind and excellent friend auralia margaretta otherwise called peggy  faith youre right interposed the major  otherwise called peggy lady of major michael odowd of our regiment and daughter of fitzjurld bersford de burgo malony of glenmalony county kildare  and muryan squeer doblin said the lady with calm superiority  and muryan square sure enough the major whispered  twas there ye coorted me meejor dear the lady said and the major assented to this as to every other proposition which was made generally in company  major odowd who had served his sovereign in every quarter of the world and had paid for every step in his profession by some more than equivalent act of daring and gallantry was the most modest silent sheepfaced and meek of little men and as obedient to his wife as if he had been her tayboy  at the messtable he sat silently and drank a great deal  when full of liquor he reeled silently home  when he spoke it was to agree with everybody on every conceivable point and he passed through life in perfect ease and goodhumour  the hottest suns of india never heated his temper and the walcheren ague never shook it  he walked up to a battery with just as much indifference as to a dinnertable had dined on horseflesh and turtle with equal relish and appetite and had an old mother mrs odowd of odowdstown indeed whom he had never disobeyed but when he ran away and enlisted and when he persisted in marrying that odious peggy malony  peggy was one of five sisters and eleven children of the noble house of glenmalony but her husband though her own cousin was of the mothers side and so had not the inestimable advantage of being allied to the malonys whom she believed to be the most famous family in the world  having tried nine seasons at dublin and two at bath and cheltenham and not finding a partner for life miss malony ordered her cousin mick to marry her when she was about thirtythree years of age and the honest fellow obeying carried her off to the west indies to preside over the ladies of the th regiment into which he had just exchanged  before mrs odowd was half an hour in amelias or indeed in anybody elses company this amiable lady told all her birth and pedigree to her new friend  my dear said she goodnaturedly it was my intention that garge should be a brother of my own and my sister glorvina would have suited him entirely  but as bygones are bygones and he was engaged to yourself why im determined to take you as a sister instead and to look upon you as such and to love you as one of the family  faith youve got such a nice goodnatured face and way widg you that im sure well agree and that youll be an addition to our family anyway  deed and she will said odowd with an approving air and amelia felt herself not a little amused and grateful to be thus suddenly introduced to so large a party of relations  were all good fellows here the majors lady continued theres not a regiment in the service where youll find a more united society nor a more agreeable messroom  theres no quarrelling bickering slandthering nor small talk amongst us  we all love each other  especially mrs magenis said george laughing  mrs captain magenis and me has made up though her treatment of me would bring me gray hairs with sorrow to the grave  and you with such a beautiful front of black peggy my dear the major cried  hould your tongue mick you booby  them husbands are always in the way mrs osborne my dear and as for my mick i often tell him he should never open his mouth but to give the word of command or to put meat and drink into it  ill tell you about the regiment and warn you when were alone  introduce me to your brother now sure hes a mighty fine man and reminds me of me cousin dan malony malony of ballymalony my dear you know who maried ophalia scully of oystherstown own cousin to lord

evening  its the 150th gives us a farewell dinner my love interposed the major but well easy get a card for mr sedley  run simple ensign simple of ours my dear amelia i forgot to introjuice him to ye  run in a hurry with mrs major odowds compliments to colonel tavish and captain osborne has brought his brothernlaw down and will bring him to the 150th mess at five oclock sharpwhen you and i my dear will take a snack here if you like before mrs odowds speech was concluded the young ensign was trotting downstairs on his commission  obedience is the soul of the army  we will go to our duty while mrs odowd will stay and enlighten you emmy captain osborne said and the two gentlemen taking each a wing of the major walked out with that officer grinning at each other over his head  and now having her new friend to herself the impetuous mrs odowd proceeded to pour out such a quantity of information as no poor little womans memory could ever tax itself to bear  she told amelia a thousand particulars relative to the very numerous family of which the amazed young lady found herself a member  mrs heavytop the colonels wife died in jamaica of the yellow faver and a broken heart comboined for the horrud old colonel with a head as bald as a cannonball was making sheeps eyes at a halfcaste girl there  mrs magenis though without education was a good woman but she had the divvles tongue and would cheat her own mother at whist  mrs captain kirk must turn up her lobster eyes forsooth at the idea of an honest round game wherein me fawther as pious a man as ever went to church me uncle dane malony and our cousin the bishop took a hand at loo or whist every night of their lives  nayther of ems goin with the regiment this time mrs odowd added  fanny magenis stops with her mother who sells small coal and potatoes most likely in islingtontown hard by london though shes always bragging of her fathers ships and pointing them out to us as they go up the river and mrs kirk and her children will stop here in bethesda place to be nigh to her favourite preacher dr ramshorn  mrs bunnys in an interesting situationfaith and she always is thenand has given the lieutenant seven already  and ensign poskys wife who joined two months before you my dear has quarld with tom posky a score of times till you can hearm all over the barck they say theyre come to broken pleets and tom never accounted for his black oi and shell go back to her mother who keeps a ladies siminary at richmondbad luck to her for running away from it  where did ye get your finishing my dear  i had moin and no expince spared at madame flanahans at ilyssus grove booterstown near dublin wid a marchioness to teach us the true parisian pronunciation and a retired mejorgeneral of the french service to put us through the exercise  of this incongruous family our astonished amelia found herself all of a sudden a member  with mrs odowd as an elder sister  she was presented to her other female relations at teatime on whom as she was quiet goodnatured and not too handsome she made rather an agreeable impression until the arrival of the gentlemen from the mess of the 150th who all admired her so that her sisters began of course to find fault with her  i hope osborne has sown his wild oats said mrs magenis to mrs bunny  if a reformed rake makes a good husband sure its she will have the fine chance with garge mrs odowd remarked to posky who had lost her position as bride in the regiment and was quite angry with the usurper  and as for mrs kirk  that disciple of dr ramshorn put one or two leading professional questions to amelia to see whether she was awakened whether she was a professing christian and so forth and finding from the simplicity of mrs osbornes replies that she was yet in utter darkness put into her hands three little penny books with pictures viz the howling wilderness the washerwoman of wandsworth common and the british soldiers best bayonet which bent upon awakening her before she slept mrs kirk begged amelia to read that night ere she went to bed  but all the men like good fellows as they were rallied round their comrades pretty wife and paid her their court with soldierly gallantry  she had a little triumph which flushed her spirits and made her eyes sparkle george was proud of her popularity and pleased with the manner which was very gay and graceful though naive and a little timid with which she received the gentlemens attentions and answered their compliments  and he in his uniformhow much handsomer he was than any man in the room  she felt that he was affectionately watching her and glowed with pleasure at his kindness  i will make all his friends welcome she resolved in her heart  i will love all as i love him  i will always try and be gay and goodhumoured and make his home happy  the regiment indeed adopted her with acclamation the captains approved the lieutenants applauded the ensigns admired  old cutler the doctor made one or two jokes which being professional need not be repeated and cackle the assistant md of edinburgh condescended to examine her upon leeterature and tried her with his three best french quotations  young stubble went about from man to man whispering jove isnt she a pretty gal and never took his eyes off her except when the negus came in  as for captain dobbin he never so much as spoke to her during the whole evening  but he and captain porter of the 150th took home jos to the hotel who was in a very maudlin state and had told his tigerhunt story with great effect both at the messtable and at the soiree to mrs odowd in her turban and bird of paradise having put the collector into the hands of his servant dobbin loitered about smoking his cigar before the inn door george had meanwhile very carefully shawled his wife and brought her away from mrs odowds after a general handshaking from the young officers who accompanied her to the fly and cheered that vehicle as it drove off  so amelia gave dobbin her little hand as she got out of the carriage and rebuked him smilingly for not having taken any notice of her all night  the captain continued that deleterious amusement of smoking long after the inn and the street were gone to bed  he watched the lights vanish from georges sittingroom windows and shine out in the bedroom close at hand  it was almost morning when he returned to his own quarters he could hear the cheering from the ships in the river where the transports were already taking in their cargoes preparatory to dropping down the thames    chapter xxviii  in which amelia invades the low countries  the regiment with its officers was to be transported in ships provided by his majestys government for the occasion  and in two days after the festive assembly at mrs odowds apartments in the midst of cheering from all the east india ships in the river and the military on shore the band playing god save the king the officers waving their hats and the crews hurrahing gallantly the transports went down the river and proceeded under convoy to ostend meanwhile the gallant jos had agreed to escort his sister and the majors wife the bulk of whose goods and chattels including the famous bird of paradise and turban were with the regimental baggage so that our two heroines drove pretty much unencumbered to ramsgate where there were plenty of packets plying in one of which they had a speedy passage to ostend  that period of joss life which now ensued was so full of incident that it served him for conversation for many years after and even the tigerhunt story was put aside for more stirring narratives which he had to tell about the great campaign of waterloo  as soon as he had agreed to escort his sister abroad it was remarked that he ceased shaving his upper lip  at chatham he followed the parades and drills with great assiduity  he listened with the utmost attention to the conversation of his brother officers as he called them in after days sometimes and learned as many military names as he could in these studies the excellent mrs odowd was of great assistance to him and on the day finally when they embarked on board the lovely rose which was to carry them to their destination he made his appearance in a braided frockcoat and duck trousers with a foraging cap ornamented with a smart gold band  having his carriage with him and informing everybody on board confidentially that he was going to join the duke of wellingtons army folks mistook him for a great personage a commissarygeneral or a government courier at the very least  he suffered hugely on the voyage during which the ladies were likewise prostrate but amelia was brought to life again as the packet made ostend by the sight of the transports conveying her regiment which entered the harbour almost at the same time with the lovely rose jos went in a collapsed state to an inn while captain dobbin escorted the ladies and then busied himself in freeing joss carriage and luggage from the ship and the customhouse for mr jos was at present without a servant osbornes man and his own pampered menial having conspired together at chatham and refused pointblank to cross the water  this revolt which came very suddenly and on the last day so alarmed mr sedley junior that he was on the point of giving up the expedition but captain dobbin who made himself immensely officious in the business jos said rated him and laughed at him soundly  the mustachios were grown in advance and jos finally was persuaded to embark  in place of the wellbred and wellfed london domestics who could only speak english dobbin procured for joss party a swarthy little belgian servant who could speak no language at all but who by his bustling behaviour and by invariably addressing mr sedley as my lord speedily acquired that gentlemans favour  times are altered at ostend now of the britons who go thither very few look like lords or act like those members of our hereditary aristocracy  they seem for the most part shabby in attire dingy of linen lovers of billiards and brandy and cigars and greasy ordinaries  but it may be said as a rule that every englishman in the duke of wellingtons army paid his way  the remembrance of such a fact surely becomes a nation of shopkeepers  it was a blessing for a commerceloving country to be overrun by such an army of customers and to have such creditable warriors to feed  and the country which they came to protect is not military  for a long period of history they have let other people fight there  when the present writer went to survey with eagle glance the field of waterloo we asked the conductor of the diligence a portly warlikelooking veteran whether he had been at the battle  pas si betesuch an answer and sentiment as no frenchman would own towas his reply  but on the other hand the postilion who drove us was a viscount a son of some bankrupt imperial general who accepted a pennyworth of beer on the road  the moral is surely a good one  this flat flourishing easy country never could have looked more rich and prosperous than in that opening summer of 1815 when its green fields and quiet cities were enlivened by multiplied redcoats when its wide chaussees swarmed with brilliant english equipages when its great canalboats gliding by rich pastures and pleasant quaint old villages by old chateaux lying amongst old trees were all crowded with welltodo english travellers when the soldier who drank at the village inn not only drank but paid his score and donald the highlander billeted in the flemish farmhouse rocked the babys cradle while jean and jeannette were out getting in the hay  as our painters are bent on military subjects just now i throw out this as a good subject for the pencil to illustrate the principle of an honest english war  all looked as brilliant and harmless as a hyde park review  meanwhile napoleon screened behind his curtain of frontierfortresses was preparing for the outbreak which was to drive all these orderly people into fury and blood and lay so many of them low  everybody had such a perfect feeling of confidence in the leader for the resolute faith which the duke of wellington had inspired in the whole english nation was as intense as that more frantic enthusiasm with which at one time the french regarded napoleon the country seemed in so perfect a state of orderly defence and the help at hand in case of need so near and overwhelming that alarm was unknown and our travellers among whom two were naturally of a very timid sort were like all the other multiplied english tourists entirely at ease the famous regiment with so many of whose officers we have made acquaintance was drafted in canal boats to bruges and ghent thence to march to brussels jos accompanied the ladies in the public boats the which all old travellers in flanders must remember for the luxury and accommodation they afforded  so prodigiously good was the eating and drinking on board these sluggish but most comfortable vessels that there are legends extant of an english traveller who coming to belgium for a week and travelling in one of these boats was so delighted with the fare there that he went backwards and forwards from ghent to bruges perpetually until the railroads were invented when he drowned himself on the last trip of the passageboat  joss death was not to be of this sort but his comfort was exceeding and mrs odowd insisted that he only wanted her sister glorvina to make his happiness complete  he sate on the roof of the cabin all day drinking flemish beer shouting for isidor his servant and talking gallantly to the ladies  his courage was prodigious  boney attack us he cried  my dear creature my poor emmy dont be frightened  theres no danger the allies will be in paris in two months i tell you when ill take you to dine in the palais royal by jove  there are three hundred thousand rooshians i tell you now entering france by mayence and the rhinethree hundred thousand under wittgenstein and barclay de tolly my poor love  you dont know military affairs my dear  i do and i tell you theres no infantry in france can stand against rooshian infantry and no general of boneys thats fit to hold a candle to wittgenstein  then there are the austrians they are five hundred thousand if a man and they are within ten marches of the frontier by this time under schwartzenberg and prince charles  then there are the prooshians under the gallant prince marshal  show me a cavalry chief like him now that murat is gone hey mrs odowd  do you think our little girl here need be afraid is there any cause for fear isidor hey sir  get some more beer  mrs odowd said that her glorvina was not afraid of any man alive let alone a frenchman and tossed off a glass of beer with a wink which expressed her liking for the beverage  having frequently been in presence of the enemy or in other words faced the ladies at cheltenham and bath our friend the collector had lost a great deal of his pristine timidity and was now especially when fortified with liquor as talkative as might be  he was rather a favourite with the regiment treating the young officers with sumptuosity and amusing them by his military airs and as there is one wellknown regiment of the army which travels with a goat heading the column whilst another is led by a deer george said with respect to his brotherinlaw that his regiment marched with an elephant  since amelias introduction to the regiment george began to be rather ashamed of some of the company to which he had been forced to present her and determined as he told dobbin with what satisfaction to the latter it need not be said to exchange into some better regiment soon and to get his wife away from those damned vulgar women  but this vulgarity of being ashamed of ones society is much more common among men than women except very great ladies of fashion who to be sure indulge in it and mrs amelia a natural and unaffected person had none of that artificial shamefacedness which her husband mistook for delicacy on his own part  thus mrs odowd had a cocks plume in her hat and a very large repayther on her stomach which she used to ring on all occasions narrating how it had been presented to her by her fawther as she stipt into the carge after her marge and these ornaments with other outward peculiarities of the majors wife gave excruciating agonies to captain osborne when his wife and the majors came in contact whereas amelia was only amused by the honest ladys eccentricities and not in the least ashamed of her company  as they made that wellknown journey which almost every englishman of middle rank has travelled since there might have been more instructive but few more entertaining companions than mrs major odowd  talk about kenal boats my dear  ye should see the kenal boats between dublin and ballinasloe  its there the rapid travelling is and the beautiful cattle  sure me fawther got a goold medal and his excellency himself eat a slice of it and said never was finer mate in his loif for a fouryearold heifer the like of which ye never saw in this country any day and jos owned with a sigh that for good streaky beef really mingled with fat and lean there was no country like england  except ireland where all your best mate comes from said the majors lady proceeding as is not unusual with patriots of her nation to make comparisons greatly in favour of her own country the idea of comparing the market at bruges with those of dublin although she had suggested it herself caused immense scorn and derision on her part ill thank ye tell me what they mean by that old gazabo on the top of the marketplace said she in a burst of ridicule fit to have brought the old tower down  the place was full of english soldiery as they passed  english bugles woke them in the morning at nightfall they went to bed to the note of the british fife and drum  all the country and europe was in arms and the greatest event of history pending  and honest peggy odowd whom it concerned as well as another went on prattling about ballinafad and the horses in the stables at glenmalony and the clart drunk there and jos sedley interposed about curry and rice at dumdum and amelia thought about her husband and how best she should show her love for him as if these were the great topics of the world  those who like to lay down the historybook and to speculate upon what might have happened in the world but for the fatal occurrence of what actually did take place a most puzzling amusing ingenious and profitable kind of meditation have no doubt often thought to themselves what a specially bad time napoleon took to come back from elba and to let loose his eagle from gulf san juan to notre dame  the historians on our side tell us that the armies of the allied powers were all providentially on a warfooting and ready to bear down at a moments notice upon the elban emperor the august jobbers assembled at vienna and carving out the kingdoms of europe according to their wisdom had such causes of quarrel among themselves as might have set the armies which had overcome napoleon to fight against each other but for the return of the object of unanimous hatred and fear  this monarch had an army in full force because he had jobbed to himself poland and was determined to keep it  another had robbed half saxony and was bent upon maintaining his acquisition italy was the object of a thirds solicitude  each was protesting against the rapacity of the other and could the corsican but have waited in prison until all these parties were by the ears he might have returned and reigned unmolested  but what would have become of our story and all our friends then  if all the drops in it were dried up what would become of the sea  in the meanwhile the business of life and living and the pursuits of pleasure especially went on as if no end were to be expected to them and no enemy in front when our travellers arrived at brussels in which their regiment was quartered a great piece of good fortune as all said they found themselves in one of the gayest and most brilliant little capitals in europe and where all the vanity fair booths were laid out with the most tempting liveliness and splendour  gambling was here in profusion and dancing in plenty  feasting was there to fill with delight that great gourmand of a jos  there was a theatre where a miraculous catalani was delighting all hearers  beautiful rides all enlivened with martial splendour a rare old city with strange costumes and wonderful architecture to delight the eyes of little amelia who had never before seen a foreign country and fill her with charming surprises so that now and for a few weeks space in a fine handsome lodging whereof the expenses were borne by jos and osborne who was flush of money and full of kind attentions to his wifefor about a fortnight i say during which her honeymoon ended mrs amelia was as pleased and happy as any little bride out of england  every day during this happy time there was novelty and amusement for all parties  there was a church to see or a picturegallerythere was a ride or an opera the bands of the regiments were making music at all hours  the greatest folks of england walked in the parkthere was a perpetual military festival  george taking out his wife to a new jaunt or junket every night was quite pleased with himself as usual and swore he was becoming quite a domestic character  and a jaunt or a junket with him  was it not enough to set this little heart beating with joy  her letters home to her mother were filled with delight and gratitude at this season  her husband bade her buy laces millinery jewels and gimcracks of all sorts  oh he was the kindest best and most generous of men  the sight of the very great company of lords and ladies and fashionable persons who thronged the town and appeared in every public place filled georges truly british soul with intense delight  they flung off that happy frigidity and insolence of demeanour which occasionally characterises the great at home and appearing in numberless public places condescended to mingle with the rest of the company whom they met there  one night at a party given by the general of the division to which georges regiment belonged he had the honour of dancing with lady blanche thistlewood lord bareacres daughter he bustled for ices and refreshments for the two noble ladies he pushed and squeezed for lady bareacres carriage he bragged about the countess when he got home in a way which his own father could not have surpassed  he called upon the ladies the next day he rode by their side in the park he asked their party to a great dinner at a restaurateurs and was quite wild with exultation when they agreed to come  old bareacres who had not much pride and a large appetite would go for a dinner anywhere  i hope there will be no women besides our own party lady bareacres said after reflecting upon the invitation which had been made and accepted with too much precipitancy  gracious heaven mammayou dont suppose the man would bring his wife shrieked lady blanche who had been languishing in georges arms in the newly imported waltz for hours the night before  the men are bearable but their women  wife just married devlish pretty woman i hear the old earl said  well my dear blanche said the mother i suppose as papa wants to go we must go but we neednt know them in england you know and so determined to cut their new acquaintance in bond street these great folks went to eat his dinner at brussels and condescending to make him pay for their pleasure showed their dignity by making his wife uncomfortable and carefully excluding her from the conversation  this is a species of dignity in which the highbred british female reigns supreme  to watch the behaviour of a fine lady to other and humbler women is a very good sport for a philosophical frequenter of vanity fair  this festival on which honest george spent a great deal of money was the very dismallest of all the entertainments which amelia had in her honeymoon  she wrote the most piteous accounts of the feast home to her mamma  how the countess of bareacres would not answer when spoken to how lady blanche stared at her with her eyeglass and what a rage captain dobbin was in at their behaviour and how my lord as they came away from the feast asked to see the bill and pronounced it a d bad dinner and d dear  but though amelia told all these stories and wrote home regarding her guests rudeness and her own discomfiture old mrs sedley was mightily pleased nevertheless and talked about emmys friend the countess of bareacres with such assiduity that the news how his son was entertaining peers and peeresses actually came to osbornes ears in the city  those who know the present lieutenantgeneral sir george tufto kcb and have seen him as they may on most days in the season padded and in stays strutting down pall mall with a rickety swagger on his highheeled lacquered boots leering under the bonnets of passersby or riding a showy chestnut and ogling broughams in the parksthose who know the present sir george tufto would hardly recognise the daring peninsular and waterloo officer  he has thick curling brown hair and black eyebrows now and his whiskers are of the deepest purple  he was lighthaired and bald in 1815 and stouter in the person and in the limbs which especially have shrunk very much of late  when he was about seventy years of age he is now nearly eighty his hair which was very scarce and quite white suddenly grew thick and brown and curly and his whiskers and eyebrows took their present colour illnatured people say that his chest is all wool and that his hair because it never grows is a wig  tom tufto with whose father he quarrelled ever so many years ago declares that mademoiselle de jaisey of the french theatre pulled his grandpapas hair off in the greenroom but tom is notoriously spiteful and jealous and the generals wig has nothing to do with our story  one day as some of our friends of the th were sauntering in the flowermarket of brussels having been to see the hotel de ville which mrs major odowd declared was not near so large or handsome as her fawthers mansion of glenmalony an officer of rank with an orderly behind him rode up to the market and descending from his horse came amongst the flowers and selected the very finest bouquet which money could buy the beautiful bundle being tied up in a paper the officer remounted giving the nosegay into the charge of his military groom who carried it with a grin following his chief who rode away in great state and selfsatisfaction  you should see the flowers at glenmalony mrs odowd was remarking me fawther has three scotch garners with nine helpers we have an acre of hothouses and pines as common as pays in the sayson  our greeps weighs six pounds every bunch of em and upon me honour and conscience i think our magnolias is as big as taykettles  dobbin who never used to draw out mrs odowd as that wicked osborne delighted in doing much to amelias terror who implored him to spare her fell back in the crowd crowing and sputtering until he reached a safe distance when he exploded amongst the astonished marketpeople with shrieks of yelling laughter  hwhats that gawky guggling about said mrs odowd  is it his nose bleedn  he always used to say twas his nose bleedn till he must have pomped all the blood out of um  ant the magnolias at glenmalony as big as taykettles odowd  deed then they are and bigger peggy the major said  when the conversation was interrupted in the manner stated by the arrival of the officer who purchased the bouquet  devlish fine horsewho is it george asked  you should see me brother molloy malonys horse molasses that won the cop at the curragh the majors wife was exclaiming and was continuing the family history when her husband interrupted her by saying  its general tufto who commands the  cavalry division adding quietly he and i were both shot in the same leg at talavera  where you got your step said george with a laugh general tufto then my dear the crawleys are come  amelias heart fellshe knew not why  the sun did not seem to shine so bright  the tall old roofs and gables looked less picturesque all of a sudden though it was a brilliant sunset and one of the brightest and most beautiful days at the end of may    chapter xxix  brussels  mr jos had hired a pair of horses for his open carriage with which cattle and the smart london vehicle he made a very tolerable figure in the drives about brussels george purchased a horse for his private riding and he and captain dobbin would often accompany the carriage in which jos and his sister took daily excursions of pleasure  they went out that day in the park for their accustomed diversion and there sure enough georges remark with regard to the arrival of rawdon crawley and his wife proved to be correct  in the midst of a little troop of horsemen consisting of some of the very greatest persons in brussels rebecca was seen in the prettiest and tightest of ridinghabits mounted on a beautiful little arab which she rode to perfection having acquired the art at queens crawley where the baronet mr pitt and rawdon himself had given her many lessons and by the side of the gallant general tufto  sure its the juke himself cried mrs major odowd to jos who began to blush violently and thats lord uxbridge on the bay  how elegant he looks  me brother molloy malony is as like him as two pays  rebecca did not make for the carriage but as soon as she perceived her old acquaintance amelia seated in it acknowledged her presence by a gracious nod and smile and by kissing and shaking her fingers playfully in the direction of the vehicle  then she resumed her conversation with general tufto who asked who the fat officer was in the goldlaced cap on which becky replied that he was an officer in the east indian service but rawdon crawley rode out of the ranks of his company and came up and shook hands heartily with amelia and said to jos well old boy how are you and stared in mrs odowds face and at the black cocks feathers until she began to think she had made a conquest of him  george who had been delayed behind rode up almost immediately with dobbin and they touched their caps to the august personages among whom osborne at once perceived mrs crawley  he was delighted to see rawdon leaning over his carriage familiarly and talking to amelia and met the aidedecamps cordial greeting with more than corresponding warmth  the nods between rawdon and dobbin were of the very faintest specimens of politeness  crawley told george where they were stopping with general tufto at the hotel du parc and george made his friend promise to come speedily to osbornes own residence  sorry i hadnt seen you three days ago george said  had a dinner at the restaurateursrather a nice thing lord bareacres and the countess and lady blanche were good enough to dine with uswish wed had you having thus let his friend know his claims to be a man of fashion osborne parted from rawdon who followed the august squadron down an alley into which they cantered while george and dobbin resumed their places one on each side of amelias carriage  how well the juke looked mrs odowd remarked the wellesleys and malonys are related but of course poor i would never dream of introjuicing myself unless his grace thought proper to remember our familytie  hes a great soldier jos said much more at ease now the great man was gone  was there ever a battle won like salamanca  hey dobbin but where was it he learnt his art  in india my boy  the jungles the school for a general mark me that  i knew him myself too mrs odowd  we both of us danced the same evening with miss cutler daughter of cutler of the artillery and a devilish fine girl at dumdum  the apparition of the great personages held them all in talk during the drive and at dinner and until the hour came when they were all to go to the opera  it was almost like old england  the house was filled with familiar british faces and those toilettes for which the british female has long been celebrated  mrs odowds was not the least splendid amongst these and she had a curl on her forehead and a set of irish diamonds and cairngorms which outshone all the decorations in the house in her notion  her presence used to excruciate osborne but go she would upon all parties of pleasure on which she heard her young friends were bent it never entered into her thought but that they must be charmed with her company  shes been useful to you my dear george said to his wife whom he could leave alone with less scruple when she had this society but what a comfort it is that rebeccas come  you will have her for a friend and we may get rid now of this damnd irishwoman  to this amelia did not answer yes or no  and how do we know what her thoughts were  the coup doeil of the brussels operahouse did not strike mrs odowd as being so fine as the theatre in fishamble street dublin nor was french music at all equal in her opinion to the melodies of her native country she favoured her friends with these and other opinions in a very loud tone of voice and tossed about a great clattering fan she sported with the most splendid complacency  who is that wonderful woman with amelia rawdon love said a lady in an opposite box who almost always civil to her husband in private was more fond than ever of him in company  dont you see that creature with a yellow thing in her turban and a red satin gown and a great watch  near the pretty little woman in white asked a middleaged gentleman seated by the querists side with orders in his button and several underwaistcoats and a great choky white stock  that pretty woman in white is amelia general  you are remarking all the pretty women you naughty man  only one begad in the world said the general delighted and the lady gave him a tap with a large bouquet which she had  bedad its him said mrs odowd and thats the very bokay he bought in the marshy aux flures and when rebecca having caught her friends eye performed the little handkissing operation once more mrs major od taking the compliment to herself returned the salute with a gracious smile which sent that unfortunate dobbin shrieking out of the box again  at the end of the act george was out of the box in a moment and he was even going to pay his respects to rebecca in her loge  he met crawley in the lobby however where they exchanged a few sentences upon the occurrences of the last fortnight  you found my cheque all right at the agents george said with a knowing air  all right my boy rawdon answered  happy to give you your revenge governor come round  not yet said george but he will and you know ive some private fortune through my mother  has aunty relented  sent me twenty pound damned old screw  when shall we have a meet the general dines out on tuesday cant you come tuesday  i say make sedley cut off his moustache  what the devil does a civilian mean with a moustache and those infernal frogs to his coat  bybye try and come on tuesday and rawdon was goingoff with two brilliant young gentlemen of fashion who were like himself on the staff of a general officer  george was only half pleased to be asked to dinner on that particular day when the general was not to dine  i will go in and pay my respects to your wife said he at which rawdon said hm as you please looking very glum and at which the two young officers exchanged knowing glances  george parted from them and strutted down the lobby to the generals box the number of which he had carefully counted  entrez said a clear little voice and our friend found himself in rebeccas presence who jumped up clapped her hands together and held out both of them to george so charmed was she to see him  the general with the orders in his button stared at the newcomer with a sulky scowl as much as to say who the devil are you  my dear captain george cried little rebecca in an ecstasy  how good of you to come  the general and i were moping together teteatete general this is my captain george of whom you heard me talk  indeed said the general with a very small bow of what regiment is captain george  george mentioned the th  how he wished he could have said it was a crack cavalry corps  come home lately from the west indies i believe not seen much service in the late war  quartered here captain georgethe general went on with killing haughtiness  not captain george you stupid man captain osborne rebecca said the general all the while was looking savagely from one to the other  captain osborne indeed any relation to the l osbornes  we bear the same arms george said as indeed was the fact mr osborne having consulted with a herald in long acre and picked the l arms out of the peerage when he set up his carriage fifteen years before  the general made no reply to this announcement but took up his operaglassthe doublebarrelled lorgnon was not invented in those daysand pretended to examine the house but rebecca saw that his disengaged eye was working round in her direction and shooting out bloodshot glances at her and george  she redoubled in cordiality  how is dearest amelia but i neednt ask how pretty she looks  and who is that nice goodnatured looking creature with hera flame of yours  o you wicked men and there is mr sedley eating ice i declare how he seems to enjoy it  general why have we not had any ices  shall i go and fetch you some said the general bursting with wrath  let me go i entreat you george said  no i will go to amelias box  dear sweet girl  give me your arm captain george and so saying and with a nod to the general she tripped into the lobby  she gave george the queerest knowingest look when they were together a look which might have been interpreted dont you see the state of affairs and what a fool im making of him  but he did not perceive it  he was thinking of his own plans and lost in pompous admiration of his own irresistible powers of pleasing  the curses to which the general gave a low utterance as soon as rebecca and her conqueror had quitted him were so deep that i am sure no compositor would venture to print them were they written down  they came from the generals heart and a wonderful thing it is to think that the human heart is capable of generating such produce and can throw out as occasion demands such a supply of lust and fury rage and hatred  amelias gentle eyes too had been fixed anxiously on the pair whose conduct had so chafed the jealous general but when rebecca entered her box she flew to her friend with an affectionate rapture which showed itself in spite of the publicity of the place for she embraced her dearest friend in the presence of the whole house at least in full view of the generals glass now brought to bear upon the osborne party  mrs rawdon saluted jos too with the kindliest greeting she admired mrs odowds large cairngorm brooch and superb irish diamonds and wouldnt believe that they were not from golconda direct she bustled she chattered she turned and twisted and smiled upon one and smirked on another all in full view of the jealous operaglass opposite  and when the time for the ballet came in which there was no dancer that went through her grimaces or performed her comedy of action better she skipped back to her own box leaning on captain dobbins arm this time  no she would not have georges he must stay and talk to his dearest best little amelia  what a humbug that woman is honest old dobbin mumbled to george when he came back from rebeccas box whither he had conducted her in perfect silence and with a countenance as glum as an undertakers she writhes and twists about like a snake  all the time she was here didnt you see george how she was acting at the general over the way  humbugacting  hang it shes the nicest little woman in england george replied showing his white teeth and giving his ambrosial whiskers a twirl  you aint a man of the world dobbin dammy look at her now shes talked over tufto in no time  look how hes laughing  gad what a shoulder she has  emmy why didnt you have a bouquet  everybody has a bouquet  faith then why didnt you boy one mrs odowd said and both amelia and william dobbin thanked her for this timely observation but beyond this neither of the ladies rallied  amelia was overpowered by the flash and the dazzle and the fashionable talk of her worldly rival even the odowd was silent and subdued after beckys brilliant apparition and scarcely said a word more about glenmalony all the evening  when do you intend to give up play george as you have promised me any time these hundred years dobbin said to his friend a few days after the night at the opera  when do you intend to give up sermonising was the others reply  what the deuce man are you alarmed about  we play low i won last night  you dont suppose crawley cheats  with fair play it comes to pretty much the same thing at the years end  but i dont think he could pay if he lost dobbin said and his advice met with the success which advice usually commands  osborne and crawley were repeatedly together now  general tufto dined abroad almost constantly george was always welcome in the apartments very close indeed to those of the general which the aidedecamp and his wife occupied in the hotel  amelias manners were such when she and george visited crawley and his wife at these quarters that they had very nearly come to their first quarrel that is george scolded his wife violently for her evident unwillingness to go and the high and mighty manner in which she comported herself towards mrs crawley her old friend and amelia did not say one single word in reply but with her husbands eye upon her and rebecca scanning her as she felt was if possible more bashful and awkward on the second visit which she paid to mrs rawdon than on her first call  rebecca was doubly affectionate of course and would not take notice in the least of her friends coolness  i think emmy has become prouder since her fathers name was in thesince mr sedleys misfortunes rebecca said softening the phrase charitably for georges ear  upon my word i thought when we were at brighton she was doing me the honour to be jealous of me and now i suppose she is scandalised because rawdon and i and the general live together  why my dear creature how could we with our means live at all but for a friend to share expenses  and do you suppose that rawdon is not big enough to take care of my honour  but im very much obliged to emmy very mrs rawdon said  pooh jealousy answered george all women are jealous  and all men too  werent you jealous of general tufto and the general of you on the night of the opera why he was ready to eat me for going with you to visit that foolish little wife of yours as if i care a pin for either of you crawleys wife said with a pert toss of her head  will you dine here  the dragon dines with the commanderinchief  great news is stirring  they say the french have crossed the frontier  we shall have a quiet dinner  george accepted the invitation although his wife was a little ailing they were now not quite six weeks married another woman was laughing or sneering at her expense and he not angry  he was not even angry with himself this goodnatured fellow  it is a shame he owned to himself but hang it if a pretty woman will throw herself in your way why what can a fellow do you know  i am rather free about women he had often said smiling and nodding knowingly to stubble and spooney and other comrades of the messtable and they rather respected him than otherwise for this prowess  next to conquering in war conquering in love has been a source of pride time out of mind amongst men in vanity fair or how should schoolboys brag of their amours or don juan be popular  so mr osborne having a firm conviction in his own mind that he was a womankiller and destined to conquer did not run counter to his fate but yielded himself up to it quite complacently  and as emmy did not say much or plague him with her jealousy but merely became unhappy and pined over it miserably in secret he chose to fancy that she was not suspicious of what all his acquaintance were perfectly awarenamely that he was carrying on a desperate flirtation with mrs crawley  he rode with her whenever she was free  he pretended regimental business to amelia by which falsehood she was not in the least deceived and consigning his wife to solitude or her brothers society passed his evenings in the crawleys company losing money to the husband and flattering himself that the wife was dying of love for him it is very likely that this worthy couple never absolutely conspired and agreed together in so many words  the one to cajole the young gentleman whilst the other won his money at cards but they understood each other perfectly well and rawdon let osborne come and go with entire good humour  george was so occupied with his new acquaintances that he and william dobbin were by no means so much together as formerly george avoided him in public and in the regiment and as we see did not like those sermons which his senior was disposed to inflict upon him if some parts of his conduct made captain dobbin exceedingly grave and cool of what use was it to tell george that though his whiskers were large and his own opinion of his knowingness great he was as green as a schoolboy that rawdon was making a victim of him as he had done of many before and as soon as he had used him would fling him off with scorn  he would not listen  and so as dobbin upon those days when he visited the osborne house seldom had the advantage of meeting his old friend much painful and unavailing talk between them was spared our friend george was in the full career of the pleasures of vanity fair  there never was since the days of darius such a brilliant train of campfollowers as hung round the duke of wellingtons army in the low countries in 1815 and led it dancing and feasting as it were up to the very brink of battle  a certain ball which a noble duchess gave at brussels on the 15th of june in the abovenamed year is historical all brussels had been in a state of excitement about it and i have heard from ladies who were in that town at the period that the talk and interest of persons of their own sex regarding the ball was much greater even than in respect of the enemy in their front the struggles intrigues and prayers to get tickets were such as only english ladies will employ in order to gain admission to the society of the great of their own nation  jos and mrs odowd who were panting to be asked strove in vain to procure tickets but others of our friends were more lucky  for instance through the interest of my lord bareacres and as a setoff for the dinner at the restaurateurs george got a card for captain and mrs osborne which circumstance greatly elated him dobbin who was a friend of the general commanding the division in which their regiment was came laughing one day to mrs osborne and displayed a similar invitation which made jos envious and george wonder how the deuce he should be getting into society  mr and mrs rawdon finally were of course invited as became the friends of a general commanding a cavalry brigade  on the appointed night george having commanded new dresses and ornaments of all sorts for amelia drove to the famous ball where his wife did not know a single soul  after looking about for lady bareacres who cut him thinking the card was quite enoughand after placing amelia on a bench he left her to her own cogitations there thinking on his own part that he had behaved very handsomely in getting her new clothes and bringing her to the ball where she was free to amuse herself as she liked  her thoughts were not of the pleasantest and nobody except honest dobbin came to disturb them  whilst her appearance was an utter failure as her husband felt with a sort of rage mrs rawdon crawleys debut was on the contrary very brilliant  she arrived very late  her face was radiant her dress perfection  in the midst of the great persons assembled and the eyeglasses directed to her rebecca seemed to be as cool and collected as when she used to marshal miss pinkertons little girls to church numbers of the men she knew already and the dandies thronged round her  as for the ladies it was whispered among them that rawdon had run away with her from out of a convent and that she was a relation of the montmorency family  she spoke french so perfectly that there might be some truth in this report and it was agreed that her manners were fine and her air distingue  fifty wouldbe partners thronged round her at once and pressed to have the honour to dance with her  but she said she was engaged and only going to dance very little and made her way at once to the place where emmy sate quite unnoticed and dismally unhappy  and so to finish the poor child at once mrs rawdon ran and greeted affectionately her dearest amelia and began forthwith to patronise her she found fault with her friends dress and her hairdresser and wondered how she could be so chaussee and vowed that she must send her corsetiere the next morning  she vowed that it was a delightful ball that there was everybody that every one knew and only a very few nobodies in the whole room  it is a fact that in a fortnight and after three dinners in general society this young woman had got up the genteel jargon so well that a native could not speak it better and it was only from her french being so good that you could know she was not a born woman of fashion  george who had left emmy on her bench on entering the ballroom very soon found his way back when rebecca was by her dear friends side becky was just lecturing mrs osborne upon the follies which her husband was committing  for gods sake stop him from gambling my dear she said or he will ruin himself he and rawdon are playing at cards every night and you know he is very poor and rawdon will win every shilling from him if he does not take care  why dont you prevent him you little careless creature why dont you come to us of an evening instead of moping at home with that captain dobbin  i dare say he is tres aimable but how could one love a man with feet of such size your husbands feet are darlingshere he comes  where have you been wretch  here is emmy crying her eyes out for you  are you coming to fetch me for the quadrille and she left her bouquet and shawl by amelias side and tripped off with george to dance  women only know how to wound so there is a poison on the tips of their little shafts which stings a thousand times more than a mans blunter weapon  our poor emmy who had never hated never sneered all her life was powerless in the hands of her remorseless little enemy  george danced with rebecca twice or thricehow many times amelia scarcely knew  she sat quite unnoticed in her corner except when rawdon came up with some words of clumsy conversation  and later in the evening when captain dobbin made so bold as to bring her refreshments and sit beside her  he did not like to ask her why she was so sad but as a pretext for the tears which were filling in her eyes she told him that mrs crawley had alarmed her by telling her that george would go on playing  it is curious when a man is bent upon play by what clumsy rogues he will allow himself to be cheated dobbin said and emmy said indeed she was thinking of something else  it was not the loss of the money that grieved her  at last george came back for rebeccas shawl and flowers  she was going away  she did not even condescend to come back and say goodbye to amelia  the poor girl let her husband come and go without saying a word and her head fell on her breast  dobbin had been called away and was whispering deep in conversation with the general of the division his friend and had not seen this last parting  george went away then with the bouquet but when he gave it to the owner there lay a note coiled like a snake among the flowers  rebeccas eye caught it at once  she had been used to deal with notes in early life  she put out her hand and took the nosegay  he saw by her eyes as they met that she was aware what she should find there  her husband hurried her away still too intent upon his own thoughts seemingly to take note of any marks of recognition which might pass between his friend and his wife these were however but trifling  rebecca gave george her hand with one of her usual quick knowing glances and made a curtsey and walked away  george bowed over the hand said nothing in reply to a remark of crawleys did not hear it even his brain was so throbbing with triumph and excitement and allowed them to go away without a word  his wife saw the one part at least of the bouquetscene it was quite natural that george should come at rebeccas request to get her her scarf and flowers  it was no more than he had done twenty times before in the course of the last few days but now it was too much for her william she said suddenly clinging to dobbin who was near her youve always been very kind to meimim not well  take me home she did not know she called him by his christian name as george was accustomed to do  he went away with her quickly  her lodgings were hard by and they threaded through the crowd without where everything seemed to be more astir than even in the ballroom within  george had been angry twice or thrice at finding his wife up on his return from the parties which he frequented  so she went straight to bed now but although she did not sleep and although the din and clatter and the galloping of horsemen were incessant she never heard any of these noises having quite other disturbances to keep her awake  osborne meanwhile wild with elation went off to a playtable and began to bet frantically  he won repeatedly everything succeeds with me tonight he said but his luck at play even did not cure him of his restlessness and he started up after awhile pocketing his winnings and went to a buffet where he drank off many bumpers of wine  here as he was rattling away to the people around laughing loudly and wild with spirits dobbin found him he had been to the cardtables to look there for his friend  dobbin looked as pale and grave as his comrade was flushed and jovial  hullo dob  come and drink old dob  the dukes wine is famous give me some more you sir and he held out a trembling glass for the liquor  come out george said dobbin still gravely dont drink  drink  theres nothing like it  drink yourself and light up your lantern jaws old boy  heres to you  dobbin went up and whispered something to him at which george giving a start and a wild hurray tossed off his glass clapped it on the table and walked away speedily on his friends arm  the enemy has passed the sambre william said and our left is already engaged come away  we are to march in three hours  away went george his nerves quivering with excitement at the news so long looked for so sudden when it came  what were love and intrigue now  he thought about a thousand things but these in his rapid walk to his quartershis past life and future chancesthe fate which might be before himthe wife the child perhaps from whom unseen he might be about to part  oh how he wished that nights work undone  and that with a clear conscience at least he might say farewell to the tender and guileless being by whose love he had set such little store  he thought over his brief married life  in those few weeks he had frightfully dissipated his little capital  how wild and reckless he had been  should any mischance befall him  what was then left for her  how unworthy he was of her  why had he married her  he was not fit for marriage  why had he disobeyed his father who had been always so generous to him  hope remorse ambition tenderness and selfish regret filled his heart  he sate down and wrote to his father remembering what he had said once before when he was engaged to fight a duel dawn faintly streaked the sky as he closed this farewell letter  he sealed it and kissed the superscription he thought how he had deserted that generous father and of the thousand kindnesses which the stern old man had done him  he had looked into amelias bedroom when he entered she lay quiet and her eyes seemed closed and he was glad that she was asleep  on arriving at his quarters from the ball he had found his regimental servant already making preparations for his departure  the man had understood his signal to be still and these arrangements were very quickly and silently made  should he go in and wake amelia he thought or leave a note for her brother to break the news of departure to her  he went in to look at her once again  she had been awake when he first entered her room but had kept her eyes closed so that even her wakefulness should not seem to reproach him  but when he had returned so soon after herself too this timid little heart had felt more at ease and turning towards him as he stept softly out of the room she had fallen into a light sleep  george came in and looked at her again entering still more softly  by the pale nightlamp he could see her sweet pale facethe purple eyelids were fringed and closed and one round arm smooth and white lay outside of the coverlet  good god  how pure she was how gentle how tender and how friendless  and he how selfish brutal and black with crime heartstained and shamestricken he stood at the beds foot and looked at the sleeping girl  how dared hewho was he to pray for one so spotless  god bless her  god bless her  he came to the bedside and looked at the hand the little soft hand lying asleep and he bent over the pillow noiselessly towards the gentle pale face  two fair arms closed tenderly round his neck as he stooped down  i am awake george the poor child said with a sob fit to break the little heart that nestled so closely by his own  she was awake poor soul and to what  at that moment a bugle from the place of arms began sounding clearly and was taken up through the town and amidst the drums of the infantry and the shrill pipes of the scotch the whole city awoke    chapter xxx  the girl i left behind me  we do not claim to rank among the military novelists our place is with the noncombatants  when the decks are cleared for action we go below and wait meekly  we should only be in the way of the manoeuvres that the gallant fellows are performing overhead  we shall go no farther with the th than to the city gate  and leaving major odowd to his duty come back to the majors wife and the ladies and the baggage  now the major and his lady who had not been invited to the ball at which in our last chapter other of our friends figured had much more time to take their wholesome natural rest in bed than was accorded to people who wished to enjoy pleasure as well as to do duty  its my belief peggy my dear said he as he placidly pulled his nightcap over his ears that there will be such a ball danced in a day or two as some of em has never heard the chune of and he was much more happy to retire to rest after partaking of a quiet tumbler than to figure at any other sort of amusement peggy for her part would have liked to have shown her turban and bird of paradise at the ball but for the information which her husband had given her and which made her very grave  id like ye wake me about half an hour before the assembly beats the major said to his lady  call me at halfpast one peggy dear and see me things is ready  may be ill not come back to breakfast mrs od with which words which signified his opinion that the regiment would march the next morning the major ceased talking and fell asleep  mrs odowd the good housewife arrayed in curl papers and a camisole felt that her duty was to act and not to sleep at this juncture time enough for that she said when micks gone and so she packed his travelling valise ready for the march brushed his cloak his cap and other warlike habiliments set them out in order for him and stowed away in the cloak pockets a light package of portable refreshments and a wickercovered flask or pocketpistol containing near a pint of a remarkably sound cognac brandy of which she and the major approved very much and as soon as the hands of the repayther pointed to halfpast one and its interior arrangements it had a tone quite equal to a cathaydral its fair owner considered knelled forth that fatal hour mrs odowd woke up her major and had as comfortable a cup of coffee prepared for him as any made that morning in brussels and who is there will deny that this worthy ladys preparations betokened affection as much as the fits of tears and hysterics by which more sensitive females exhibited their love and that their partaking of this coffee which they drank together while the bugles were sounding the turnout and the drums beating in the various quarters of the town was not more useful and to the purpose than the outpouring of any mere sentiment could be  the consequence was that the major appeared on parade quite trim fresh and alert his wellshaved rosy countenance as he sate on horseback giving cheerfulness and confidence to the whole corps  all the officers saluted her when the regiment marched by the balcony on which this brave woman stood and waved them a cheer as they passed and i daresay it was not from want of courage but from a sense of female delicacy and propriety that she refrained from leading the gallantth personally into action  on sundays and at periods of a solemn nature mrs odowd used to read with great gravity out of a large volume of her uncle the deans sermons  it had been of great comfort to her on board the transport as they were coming home and were very nearly wrecked on their return from the west indies  after the regiments departure she betook herself to this volume for meditation perhaps she did not understand much of what she was reading and her thoughts were elsewhere  but the sleep project with poor micks nightcap there on the pillow was quite a vain one  so it is in the world  jack or donald marches away to glory with his knapsack on his shoulder stepping out briskly to the tune of the girl i left behind me it is she who remains and suffersand has the leisure to think and brood and remember  knowing how useless regrets are and how the indulgence of sentiment only serves to make people more miserable mrs rebecca wisely determined to give way to no vain feelings of sorrow and bore the parting from her husband with quite a spartan equanimity  indeed captain rawdon himself was much more affected at the leavetaking than the resolute little woman to whom he bade farewell  she had mastered this rude coarse nature and he loved and worshipped her with all his faculties of regard and admiration  in all his life he had never been so happy as during the past few months his wife had made him  all former delights of turf mess huntingfield and gamblingtable all previous loves and courtships of milliners operadancers and the like easy triumphs of the clumsy military adonis were quite insipid when compared to the lawful matrimonial pleasures which of late he had enjoyed  she had known perpetually how to divert him and he had found his house and her society a thousand times more pleasant than any place or company which he had ever frequented from his childhood until now and he cursed his past follies and extravagances and bemoaned his vast outlying debts above all which must remain for ever as obstacles to prevent his wifes advancement in the world  he had often groaned over these in midnight conversations with rebecca although as a bachelor they had never given him any disquiet  he himself was struck with this phenomenon  hang it he would say or perhaps use a still stronger expression out of his simple vocabulary before i was married i didnt care what bills i put my name to and so long as moses would wait or levy would renew for three months i kept on never minding but since im married except renewing of course i give you my honour ive not touched a bit of stamped paper  rebecca always knew how to conjure away these moods of melancholy why my stupid love she would say we have not done with your aunt yet  if she fails us isnt there what you call the gazette or stop when your uncle butes life drops i have another scheme the living has always belonged to the younger brother and why shouldnt you sell out and go into the church  the idea of this conversion set rawdon into roars of laughter you might have heard the explosion through the hotel at midnight and the hawhaws of the great dragoons voice general tufto heard him from his quarters on the first floor above them and rebecca acted the scene with great spirit and preached rawdons first sermon to the immense delight of the general at breakfast  but these were mere bygone days and talk  when the final news arrived that the campaign was opened and the troops were to march rawdons gravity became such that becky rallied him about it in a manner which rather hurt the feelings of the guardsman  you dont suppose im afraid becky i should think he said with a tremor in his voice but im a pretty good mark for a shot and you see if it brings me down why i leave one and perhaps two behind me whom i should wish to provide for as i brought em into the scrape  it is no laughing matter that mrs c anyways  rebecca by a hundred caresses and kind words tried to soothe the feelings of the wounded lover  it was only when her vivacity and sense of humour got the better of this sprightly creature as they would do under most circumstances of life indeed that she would break out with her satire but she could soon put on a demure face dearest love she said do you suppose i feel nothing and hastily dashing something from her eyes she looked up in her husbands face with a smile  look here said he  if i drop let us see what there is for you i have had a pretty good run of luck here and heres two hundred and thirty pounds  i have got ten napoleons in my pocket  that is as much as i shall want for the general pays everything like a prince and if im hit why you know i cost nothing  dont cry little woman i may live to vex you yet  well i shant take either of my horses but shall ride the generals grey charger  its cheaper and i told him mine was lame  if im done those two ought to fetch you something grigg offered ninety for the mare yesterday before this confounded news came and like a fool i wouldnt let her go under the two os bullfinch will fetch his price any day only youd better sell him in this country because the dealers have so many bills of mine and so id rather he shouldnt go back to england  your little mare the general gave you will fetch something and theres no dd livery stable bills here as there are in london rawdon added with a laugh theres that dressingcase cost me two hundredthat is i owe two for it and the gold tops and bottles must be worth thirty or forty please to put that up the spout maam with my pins and rings and watch and chain and things  they cost a precious lot of money  miss crawley i know paid a hundred down for the chain and ticker  gold tops and bottles indeed  dammy im sorry i didnt take more now edwards pressed on me a silvergilt bootjack and i might have had a dressingcase fitted up with a silver warmingpan and a service of plate  but we must make the best of what weve got becky you know  and so making his last dispositions captain crawley who had seldom thought about anything but himself until the last few months of his life when love had obtained the mastery over the dragoon went through the various items of his little catalogue of effects striving to see how they might be turned into money for his wifes benefit in case any accident should befall him  he pleased himself by noting down with a pencil in his big schoolboy handwriting the various items of his portable property which might be sold for his widows advantage as for example my doublebarril by manton say 40 guineas my driving cloak lined with sable fur 50 pounds my duelling pistols in rosewood case same which i shot captain marker 20 pounds my regulation saddleholsters and housings my laurie ditto and so forth over all of which articles he made rebecca the mistress  faithful to his plan of economy the captain dressed himself in his oldest and shabbiest uniform and epaulets leaving the newest behind under his wifes or it might be his widows guardianship and this famous dandy of windsor and hyde park went off on his campaign with a kit as modest as that of a sergeant and with something like a prayer on his lips for the woman he was leaving he took her up from the ground and held her in his arms for a minute tight pressed against his strongbeating heart  his face was purple and his eyes dim as he put her down and left her  he rode by his generals side and smoked his cigar in silence as they hastened after the troops of the generals brigade which preceded them and it was not until they were some miles on their way that he left off twirling his moustache and broke silence  and rebecca as we have said wisely determined not to give way to unavailing sentimentality on her husbands departure  she waved him an adieu from the window and stood there for a moment looking out after he was gone the cathedral towers and the full gables of the quaint old houses were just beginning to blush in the sunrise there had been no rest for her that night  she was still in her pretty balldress her fair hair hanging somewhat out of curl on her neck and the circles round her eyes dark with watching  what a fright i seem she said examining herself in the glass and how pale this pink makes one look  so she divested herself of this pink raiment in doing which a note fell out from her corsage which she picked up with a smile and locked into her dressingbox and then she put her bouquet of the ball into a glass of water and went to bed and slept very comfortably  the town was quite quiet when she woke up at ten oclock and partook of coffee very requisite and comforting after the exhaustion and grief of the mornings occurrences  this meal over she resumed honest rawdons calculations of the night previous and surveyed her position should the worst befall all things considered she was pretty well to do  there were her own trinkets and trousseau in addition to those which her husband had left behind rawdons generosity when they were first married has already been described and lauded  besides these and the little mare the general her slave and worshipper had made her many very handsome presents in the shape of cashmere shawls bought at the auction of a bankrupt french generals lady and numerous tributes from the jewellers shops all of which betokened her admirers taste and wealth  as for tickers as poor rawdon called watches her apartments were alive with their clicking for happening to mention one night that hers which rawdon had given to her was of english workmanship and went ill on the very next morning there came to her a little bijou marked leroy with a chain and cover charmingly set with turquoises and another signed brequet which was covered with pearls and yet scarcely bigger than a halfcrown  general tufto had bought one and captain osborne had gallantly presented the other  mrs osborne had no watch though to do george justice she might have had one for the asking and the honourable mrs tufto in england had an old instrument of her mothers that might have served for the platewarming pan which rawdon talked about  if messrs howell and james were to publish a list of the purchasers of all the trinkets which they sell how surprised would some families be and if all these ornaments went to gentlemens lawful wives and daughters what a profusion of jewellery there would be exhibited in the genteelest homes of vanity fair  every calculation made of these valuables mrs rebecca found not without a pungent feeling of triumph and selfsatisfaction that should circumstances occur she might reckon on six or seven hundred pounds at the very least to begin the world with and she passed the morning disposing ordering looking out and locking up her properties in the most agreeable manner  among the notes in rawdons pocketbook was a draft for twenty pounds on osbornes banker  this made her think about mrs osborne  i will go and get the draft cashed she said and pay a visit afterwards to poor little emmy if this is a novel without a hero at least let us lay claim to a heroine  no man in the british army which has marched away not the great duke himself could be more cool or collected in the presence of doubts and difficulties than the indomitable little aidedecamps wife  and there was another of our acquaintances who was also to be left behind a noncombatant and whose emotions and behaviour we have therefore a right to know this was our friend the excollector of boggley wollah whose rest was broken like other peoples by the sounding of the bugles in the early morning  being a great sleeper and fond of his bed it is possible he would have snoozed on until his usual hour of rising in the forenoon in spite of all the drums bugles and bagpipes in the british army but for an interruption which did not come from george osborne who shared joss quarters with him and was as usual occupied too much with his own affairs or with grief at parting with his wife to think of taking leave of his slumbering brotherinlawit was not george we say who interposed between jos sedley and sleep but captain dobbin who came and roused him up insisting on shaking hands with him before his departure  very kind of you said jos yawning and wishing the captain at the deuce  ii didnt like to go off without saying goodbye you know dobbin said in a very incoherent manner because you know some of us maynt come back again and i like to see you all well andand that sort of thing you know  what do you mean jos asked rubbing his eyes  the captain did not in the least hear him or look at the stout gentleman in the nightcap about whom he professed to have such a tender interest the hypocrite was looking and listening with all his might in the direction of georges apartments striding about the room upsetting the chairs beating the tattoo biting his nails and showing other signs of great inward emotion  jos had always had rather a mean opinion of the captain and now began to think his courage was somewhat equivocal  what is it i can do for you dobbin he said in a sarcastic tone  i tell you what you can do the captain replied coming up to the bed we march in a quarter of an hour sedley and neither george nor i may ever come back mind you you are not to stir from this town until you ascertain how things go  you are to stay here and watch over your sister and comfort her and see that no harm comes to her  if anything happens to george remember she has no one but you in the world to look to  if it goes wrong with the army youll see her safe back to england and you will promise me on your word that you will never desert her  i know you wont  as far as money goes you were always free enough with that  do you want any i mean have you enough gold to take you back to england in case of a misfortune  sir said jos majestically when i want money i know where to ask for it  and as for my sister you neednt tell me how i ought to behave to her  you speak like a man of spirit jos the other answered goodnaturedly and i am glad that george can leave her in such good hands so i may give him your word of honour may i that in case of extremity you will stand by her  of course of course answered mr jos whose generosity in money matters dobbin estimated quite correctly  and youll see her safe out of brussels in the event of a defeat  a defeat d it sir its impossible  dont try and frighten me the hero cried from his bed and dobbins mind was thus perfectly set at ease now that jos had spoken out so resolutely respecting his conduct to his sister  at least thought the captain there will be a retreat secured for her in case the worst should ensue  if captain dobbin expected to get any personal comfort and satisfaction from having one more view of amelia before the regiment marched away his selfishness was punished just as such odious egotism deserved to be  the door of joss bedroom opened into the sittingroom which was common to the family party and opposite this door was that of amelias chamber  the bugles had wakened everybody  there was no use in concealment now  georges servant was packing in this room  osborne coming in and out of the contiguous bedroom flinging to the man such articles as he thought fit to carry on the campaign and presently dobbin had the opportunity which his heart coveted and he got sight of amelias face once more  but what a face it was  so white so wild and despairstricken that the remembrance of it haunted him afterwards like a crime and the sight smote him with inexpressible pangs of longing and pity  she was wrapped in a white morning dress her hair falling on her shoulders and her large eyes fixed and without light  by way of helping on the preparations for the departure and showing that she too could be useful at a moment so critical this poor soul had taken up a sash of georges from the drawers whereon it lay and followed him to and fro with the sash in her hand looking on mutely as his packing proceeded  she came out and stood leaning at the wall holding this sash against her bosom from which the heavy net of crimson dropped like a large stain of blood  our gentlehearted captain felt a guilty shock as he looked at her  good god thought he and is it grief like this i dared to pry into and there was no help  no means to soothe and comfort this helpless speechless misery  he stood for a moment and looked at her powerless and torn with pity as a parent regards an infant in pain  at last george took emmys hand and led her back into the bedroom from whence he came out alone  the parting had taken place in that moment and he was gone  thank heaven that is over george thought bounding down the stair his sword under his arm as he ran swiftly to the alarm ground where the regiment was mustered and whither trooped men and officers hurrying from their billets his pulse was throbbing and his cheeks flushed  the great game of war was going to be played and he one of the players  what a fierce excitement of doubt hope and pleasure what tremendous hazards of loss or gain  what were all the games of chance he had ever played compared to this one into all contests requiring athletic skill and courage the young man from his boyhood upwards had flung himself with all his might the champion of his school and his regiment the bravos of his companions had followed him everywhere from the boys cricketmatch to the garrisonraces he had won a hundred of triumphs and wherever he went women and men had admired and envied him  what qualities are there for which a man gets so speedy a return of applause as those of bodily superiority activity and valour time out of mind strength and courage have been the theme of bards and romances and from the story of troy down to today poetry has always chosen a soldier for a hero  i wonder is it because men are cowards in heart that they admire bravery so much and place military valour so far beyond every other quality for reward and worship  so at the sound of that stirring call to battle george jumped away from the gentle arms in which he had been dallying not without a feeling of shame although his wifes hold on him had been but feeble that he should have been detained there so long  the same feeling of eagerness and excitement was amongst all those friends of his of whom we have had occasional glimpses from the stout senior major who led the regiment into action to little stubble the ensign who was to bear its colours on that day  the sun was just rising as the march beganit was a gallant sightthe band led the column playing the regimental marchthen came the major in command riding upon pyramus his stout chargerthen marched the grenadiers their captain at their head in the centre were the colours borne by the senior and junior ensignsthen george came marching at the head of his company he looked up and smiled at amelia and passed on and even the sound of the music died away    chapter xxxi  in which jos sedley takes care of his sister  thus all the superior officers being summoned on duty elsewhere jos sedley was left in command of the little colony at brussels with amelia invalided isidor his belgian servant and the bonne who was maidofallwork for the establishment as a garrison under him though he was disturbed in spirit and his rest destroyed by dobbins interruption and the occurrences of the morning jos nevertheless remained for many hours in bed wakeful and rolling about there until his usual hour of rising had arrived  the sun was high in the heavens and our gallant friends of the th miles on their march before the civilian appeared in his flowered dressinggown at breakfast  about georges absence his brotherinlaw was very easy in mind perhaps jos was rather pleased in his heart that osborne was gone for during georges presence the other had played but a very secondary part in the household and osborne did not scruple to show his contempt for the stout civilian  but emmy had always been good and attentive to him  it was she who ministered to his comforts who superintended the dishes that he liked who walked or rode with him as she had many too many opportunities of doing for where was george and who interposed her sweet face between his anger and her husbands scorn  many timid remonstrances had she uttered to george in behalf of her brother but the former in his trenchant way cut these entreaties short im an honest man he said and if i have a feeling i show it as an honest man will  how the deuce my dear would you have me behave respectfully to such a fool as your brother  so jos was pleased with georges absence  his plain hat and gloves on a sideboard and the idea that the owner was away caused jos i dont know what secret thrill of pleasure  he wont be troubling me this morning jos thought with his dandified airs and his impudence  put the captains hat into the anteroom he said to isidor the servant  perhaps he wont want it again replied the lackey looking knowingly at his master  he hated george too whose insolence towards him was quite of the english sort  and ask if madame is coming to breakfast mr sedley said with great majesty ashamed to enter with a servant upon the subject of his dislike for george  the truth is he had abused his brother to the valet a score of times before  alas  madame could not come to breakfast and cut the tartines that mr jos liked  madame was a great deal too ill and had been in a frightful state ever since her husbands departure so her bonne said jos showed his sympathy by pouring her out a large cup of tea it was his way of exhibiting kindness  and he improved on this he not only sent her breakfast but he bethought him what delicacies she would most like for dinner  isidor the valet had looked on very sulkily while osbornes servant was disposing of his masters baggage previous to the captains departure  for in the first place he hated mr osborne whose conduct to him and to all inferiors was generally overbearing nor does the continental domestic like to be treated with insolence as our own bettertempered servants do and secondly he was angry that so many valuables should be removed from under his hands to fall into other peoples possession when the english discomfiture should arrive  of this defeat he and a vast number of other persons in brussels and belgium did not make the slightest doubt  the almost universal belief was that the emperor would divide the prussian and english armies annihilate one after the other and march into brussels before three days were over when all the movables of his present masters who would be killed or fugitives or prisoners would lawfully become the property of monsieur isidor  as he helped jos through his toilsome and complicated daily toilette this faithful servant would calculate what he should do with the very articles with which he was decorating his masters person  he would make a present of the silver essencebottles and toilet knicknacks to a young lady of whom he was fond and keep the english cutlery and the large ruby pin for himself  it would look very smart upon one of the fine frilled shirts which with the goldlaced cap and the frogged frock coat that might easily be cut down to suit his shape and the captains goldheaded cane and the great double ring with the rubies which he would have made into a pair of beautiful earrings he calculated would make a perfect adonis of himself and render mademoiselle reine an easy prey  how those sleevebuttons will suit me thought he as he fixed a pair on the fat pudgy wrists of mr sedley  i long for sleevebuttons and the captains boots with brass spurs in the next room corbleu what an effect they will make in the allee verte so while monsieur isidor with bodily fingers was holding on to his masters nose and shaving the lower part of joss face his imagination was rambling along the green avenue dressed out in a frogged coat and lace and in company with mademoiselle reine he was loitering in spirit on the banks and examining the barges sailing slowly under the cool shadows of the trees by the canal or refreshing himself with a mug of faro at the bench of a beerhouse on the road to laeken  but mr joseph sedley luckily for his own peace no more knew what was passing in his domestics mind than the respected reader and i suspect what john or mary whose wages we pay think of ourselves what our servants think of usdid we know what our intimates and dear relations thought of us we should live in a world that we should be glad to quit and in a frame of mind and a constant terror that would be perfectly unbearable so joss man was marking his victim down as you see one of mr paynters assistants in leadenhall street ornament an unconscious turtle with a placard on which is written soup tomorrow  amelias attendant was much less selfishly disposed few dependents could come near that kind and gentle creature without paying their usual tribute of loyalty and affection to her sweet and affectionate nature  and it is a fact that pauline the cook consoled her mistress more than anybody whom she saw on this wretched morning for when she found how amelia remained for hours silent motionless and haggard by the windows in which she had placed herself to watch the last bayonets of the column as it marched away the honest girl took the ladys hand and said tenez madame estce quil nest pas aussi a larmee mon homme a moi  with which she burst into tears and amelia falling into her arms did likewise and so each pitied and soothed the other  several times during the forenoon mr joss isidor went from his lodgings into the town and to the gates of the hotels and lodginghouses round about the parc where the english were congregated and there mingled with other valets couriers and lackeys gathered such news as was abroad and brought back bulletins for his masters information  almost all these gentlemen were in heart partisans of the emperor and had their opinions about the speedy end of the campaign the emperors proclamation from avesnes had been distributed everywhere plentifully in brussels  soldiers  it said this is the anniversary of marengo and friedland by which the destinies of europe were twice decided  then as after austerlitz as after wagram we were too generous  we believed in the oaths and promises of princes whom we suffered to remain upon their thrones  let us march once more to meet them  we and they are we not still the same men  soldiers these same prussians who are so arrogant today were three to one against you at jena and six to one at montmirail  those among you who were prisoners in england can tell their comrades what frightful torments they suffered on board the english hulks  madmen  a moment of prosperity has blinded them and if they enter into france it will be to find a grave there  but the partisans of the french prophesied a more speedy extermination of the emperors enemies than this and it was agreed on all hands that prussians and british would never return except as prisoners in the rear of the conquering army  these opinions in the course of the day were brought to operate upon mr sedley  he was told that the duke of wellington had gone to try and rally his army the advance of which had been utterly crushed the night before  crushed psha said jos whose heart was pretty stout at breakfasttime  the duke has gone to beat the emperor as he has beaten all his generals before  his papers are burned his effects are removed and his quarters are being got ready for the duke of dalmatia joss informant replied  i had it from his own maitre dhotel  milor duc de richemonts people are packing up everything  his grace has fled already and the duchess is only waiting to see the plate packed to join the king of france at ostend  the king of france is at ghent fellow replied jos affecting incredulity  he fled last night to bruges and embarks today from ostend  the duc de berri is taken prisoner  those who wish to be safe had better go soon for the dykes will be opened tomorrow and who can fly when the whole country is under water  nonsense sir we are three to one sir against any force boney can bring into the field mr sedley objected the austrians and the russians are on their march  he must he shall be crushed jos said slapping his hand on the table  the prussians were three to one at jena and he took their army and kingdom in a week  they were six to one at montmirail and he scattered them like sheep the austrian army is coming but with the empress and the king of rome at its head and the russians bah the russians will withdraw  no quarter is to be given to the english on account of their cruelty to our braves on board the infamous pontoons look here here it is in black and white  heres the proclamation of his majesty the emperor and king said the now declared partisan of napoleon and taking the document from his pocket isidor sternly thrust it into his masters face and already looked upon the frogged coat and valuables as his own spoil  jos was if not seriously alarmed as yet at least considerably disturbed in mind  give me my coat and cap sir said he and follow me  i will go myself and learn the truth of these reports isidor was furious as jos put on the braided frock  milor had better not wear that military coat said he the frenchmen have sworn not to give quarter to a single british soldier  silence sirrah said jos with a resolute countenance still and thrust his arm into the sleeve with indomitable resolution in the performance of which heroic act he was found by mrs rawdon crawley who at this juncture came up to visit amelia and entered without ringing at the antechamber door  rebecca was dressed very neatly and smartly as usual her quiet sleep after rawdons departure had refreshed her and her pink smiling cheeks were quite pleasant to look at in a town and on a day when everybody elses countenance wore the appearance of the deepest anxiety and gloom  she laughed at the attitude in which jos was discovered and the struggles and convulsions with which the stout gentleman thrust himself into the braided coat  are you preparing to join the army mr joseph she said  is there to be nobody left in brussels to protect us poor women  jos succeeded in plunging into the coat and came forward blushing and stuttering out excuses to his fair visitor  how was she after the events of the morningafter the fatigues of the ball the night before  monsieur isidor disappeared into his masters adjacent bedroom bearing off the flowered dressinggown  how good of you to ask said she pressing one of his hands in both her own  how cool and collected you look when everybody else is frightened  how is our dear little emmy  it must have been an awful awful parting  tremendous jos said  you men can bear anything replied the lady  parting or danger are nothing to you  own now that you were going to join the army and leave us to our fate i know you weresomething tells me you were  i was so frightened when the thought came into my head for i do sometimes think of you when i am alone mr joseph that i ran off immediately to beg and entreat you not to fly from us  this speech might be interpreted my dear sir should an accident befall the army and a retreat be necessary you have a very comfortable carriage in which i propose to take a seat i dont know whether jos understood the words in this sense  but he was profoundly mortified by the ladys inattention to him during their stay at brussels  he had never been presented to any of rawdon crawleys great acquaintances  he had scarcely been invited to rebeccas parties for he was too timid to play much and his presence bored george and rawdon equally who neither of them perhaps liked to have a witness of the amusements in which the pair chose to indulge  ah thought jos now she wants me she comes to me  when there is nobody else in the way she can think about old joseph sedley  but besides these doubts he felt flattered at the idea rebecca expressed of his courage  he blushed a good deal and put on an air of importance i should like to see the action he said  every man of any spirit would you know ive seen a little service in india but nothing on this grand scale  you men would sacrifice anything for a pleasure rebecca answered captain crawley left me this morning as gay as if he were going to a hunting party  what does he care  what do any of you care for the agonies and tortures of a poor forsaken woman  i wonder whether he could really have been going to the troops this great lazy gourmand oh  dear mr sedley i have come to you for comfortfor consolation i have been on my knees all the morning i tremble at the frightful danger into which our husbands our friends our brave troops and allies are rushing  and i come here for shelter and find another of my friendsthe last remaining to mebent upon plunging into the dreadful scene  my dear madam jos replied now beginning to be quite soothed dont be alarmed  i only said i should like to gowhat briton would not but my duty keeps me here  i cant leave that poor creature in the next room and he pointed with his finger to the door of the chamber in which amelia was  good noble brother rebecca said putting her handkerchief to her eyes and smelling the eaudecologne with which it was scented  i have done you injustice you have got a heart  i thought you had not  o upon my honour jos said making a motion as if he would lay his hand upon the spot in question  you do me injustice indeed you domy dear mrs crawley  i do now your heart is true to your sister  but i remember two years agowhen it was false to me rebecca said fixing her eyes upon him for an instant and then turning away into the window  jos blushed violently  that organ which he was accused by rebecca of not possessing began to thump tumultuously  he recalled the days when he had fled from her and the passion which had once inflamed himthe days when he had driven her in his curricle  when she had knit the green purse for him  when he had sate enraptured gazing at her white arms and bright eyes  i know you think me ungrateful rebecca continued coming out of the window and once more looking at him and addressing him in a low tremulous voice  your coldness your averted looks your manner when we have met of latewhen i came in just now all proved it to me  but were there no reasons why i should avoid you let your own heart answer that question  do you think my husband was too much inclined to welcome you the only unkind words i have ever had from him i will do captain crawley that justice have been about youand most cruel cruel words they were  good gracious what have i done asked jos in a flurry of pleasure and perplexity what have i donetoto  is jealousy nothing said rebecca  he makes me miserable about you and whatever it might have been oncemy heart is all his  i am innocent now  am i not mr sedley  all joss blood tingled with delight as he surveyed this victim to his attractions  a few adroit words one or two knowing tender glances of the eyes and his heart was inflamed again and his doubts and suspicions forgotten  from solomon downwards have not wiser men than he been cajoled and befooled by women  if the worst comes to the worst becky thought my retreat is secure and i have a righthand seat in the barouche  there is no knowing into what declarations of love and ardour the tumultuous passions of mr joseph might have led him if isidor the valet had not made his reappearance at this minute and begun to busy himself about the domestic affairs  jos who was just going to gasp out an avowal choked almost with the emotion that he was obliged to restrain  rebecca too bethought her that it was time she should go in and comfort her dearest amelia  au revoir she said kissing her hand to mr joseph and tapped gently at the door of his sisters apartment  as she entered and closed the door on herself he sank down in a chair and gazed and sighed and puffed portentously  that coat is very tight for milor isidor said still having his eye on the frogs but his master heard him not his thoughts were elsewhere  now glowing maddening upon the contemplation of the enchanting rebecca anon shrinking guiltily before the vision of the jealous rawdon crawley with his curling fierce mustachios and his terrible duelling pistols loaded and cocked  rebeccas appearance struck amelia with terror and made her shrink back  it recalled her to the world and the remembrance of yesterday in the overpowering fears about tomorrow she had forgotten rebeccajealousyeverything except that her husband was gone and was in danger  until this dauntless worldling came in and broke the spell and lifted the latch we too have forborne to enter into that sad chamber  how long had that poor girl been on her knees  what hours of speechless prayer and bitter prostration had she passed there  the warchroniclers who write brilliant stories of fight and triumph scarcely tell us of these  these are too mean parts of the pageant and you dont hear widows cries or mothers sobs in the midst of the shouts and jubilation in the great chorus of victory  and yet when was the time that such have not cried out heartbroken humble protestants unheard in the uproar of the triumph  after the first movement of terror in amelias mindwhen rebeccas green eyes lighted upon her and rustling in her fresh silks and brilliant ornaments the latter tripped up with extended arms to embrace hera feeling of anger succeeded and from being deadly pale before her face flushed up red and she returned rebeccas look after a moment with a steadiness which surprised and somewhat abashed her rival  dearest amelia you are very unwell the visitor said putting forth her hand to take amelias  what is it i could not rest until i knew how you were  amelia drew back her handnever since her life began had that gentle soul refused to believe or to answer any demonstration of goodwill or affection  but she drew back her hand and trembled all over  why are you here rebecca she said still looking at her solemnly with her large eyes  these glances troubled her visitor  she must have seen him give me the letter at the ball rebecca thought  dont be agitated dear amelia she said looking down i came but to see if i couldif you were well  are you well said amelia  i dare say you are you dont love your husband  you would not be here if you did  tell me rebecca did i ever do you anything but kindness  indeed amelia no the other said still hanging down her head  when you were quite poor who was it that befriended you  was i not a sister to you  you saw us all in happier days before he married me  i was all in all then to him or would he have given up his fortune his family as he nobly did to make me happy  why did you come between my love and me  who sent you to separate those whom god joined and take my darlings heart from memy own husband do you think you could i love him as i did  his love was everything to me you knew it and wanted to rob me of it  for shame rebecca bad and wicked womanfalse friend and false wife  amelia i protest before god i have done my husband no wrong rebecca said turning from her  have you done me no wrong rebecca  you did not succeed but you tried  ask your heart if you did not  she knows nothing rebecca thought  he came back to me  i knew he would  i knew that no falsehood no flattery could keep him from me long i knew he would come  i prayed so that he should  the poor girl spoke these words with a spirit and volubility which rebecca had never before seen in her and before which the latter was quite dumb  but what have i done to you she continued in a more pitiful tone that you should try and take him from me  i had him but for six weeks  you might have spared me those rebecca and yet from the very first day of our wedding you came and blighted it  now he is gone are you come to see how unhappy i am she continued  you made me wretched enough for the past fortnight you might have spared me today  ii never came here interposed rebecca with unlucky truth  no  you didnt come  you took him away  are you come to fetch him from me she continued in a wilder tone  he was here but he is gone now  there on that very sofa he sate  dont touch it  we sate and talked there  i was on his knee and my arms were round his neck and we said our father yes he was here  and they came and took him away but he promised me to come back  he will come back my dear said rebecca touched in spite of herself  look said amelia this is his sashisnt it a pretty colour and she took up the fringe and kissed it  she had tied it round her waist at some part of the day  she had forgotten her anger her jealousy the very presence of her rival seemingly  for she walked silently and almost with a smile on her face towards the bed and began to smooth down georges pillow  rebecca walked too silently away  how is amelia asked jos who still held his position in the chair  there should be somebody with her said rebecca i think she is very unwell  and she went away with a very grave face refusing mr sedleys entreaties that she would stay and partake of the early dinner which he had ordered  rebecca was of a goodnatured and obliging disposition and she liked amelia rather than otherwise  even her hard words reproachful as they were were complimentarythe groans of a person stinging under defeat meeting mrs odowd whom the deans sermons had by no means comforted and who was walking very disconsolately in the parc rebecca accosted the latter rather to the surprise of the majors wife who was not accustomed to such marks of politeness from mrs rawdon crawley and informing her that poor little mrs osborne was in a desperate condition and almost mad with grief sent off the goodnatured irishwoman straight to see if she could console her young favourite  ive cares of my own enough mrs odowd said gravely and i thought poor amelia would be little wanting for company this day but if shes so bad as you say and you cant attend to her who used to be so fond of her faith ill see if i can be of service and so good marning to ye madam with which speech and a toss of her head the lady of the repayther took a farewell of mrs crawley whose company she by no means courted  becky watched her marching off with a smile on her lip  she had the keenest sense of humour and the parthian look which the retreating mrs odowd flung over her shoulder almost upset mrs crawleys gravity my service to ye me fine madam and im glad to see ye so cheerful thought peggy  its not you that will cry your eyes out with grief anyway and with this she passed on and speedily found her way to mrs osbornes lodgings  the poor soul was still at the bedside where rebecca had left her and stood almost crazy with grief  the majors wife a strongerminded woman endeavoured her best to comfort her young friend you must bear up amelia dear she said kindly for he mustnt find you ill when he sends for you after the victory  its not you are the only woman that are in the hands of god this day  i know that  i am very wicked very weak amelia said  she knew her own weakness well enough  the presence of the more resolute friend checked it however and she was the better of this control and company  they went on till two oclock their hearts were with the column as it marched farther and farther away  dreadful doubt and anguishprayers and fears and griefs unspeakablefollowed the regiment  it was the womens tribute to the war  it taxes both alike and takes the blood of the men and the tears of the women  at halfpast two an event occurred of daily importance to mr joseph the dinnerhour arrived  warriors may fight and perish but he must dine  he came into amelias room to see if he could coax her to share that meal  try said he the soup is very good  do try emmy and he kissed her hand  except when she was married he had not done so much for years before  you are very good and kind joseph she said everybody is but if you please i will stay in my room today  the savour of the soup however was agreeable to mrs odowds nostrils and she thought she would bear mr jos company  so the two sate down to their meal god bless the meat said the majors wife solemnly she was thinking of her honest mick riding at the head of his regiment  tis but a bad dinner those poor boys will get today she said with a sigh and then like a philosopher fell to  joss spirits rose with his meal  he would drink the regiments health or indeed take any other excuse to indulge in a glass of champagne  well drink to odowd and the brave th said he bowing gallantly to his guest  hey mrs odowd  fill mrs odowds glass isidor  but all of a sudden isidor started and the majors wife laid down her knife and fork  the windows of the room were open and looked southward and a dull distant sound came over the sunlighted roofs from that direction  what is it said jos  why dont you pour you rascal  cest le feu said isidor running to the balcony  god defend us its cannon mrs odowd cried starting up and followed too to the window  a thousand pale and anxious faces might have been seen looking from other casements  and presently it seemed as if the whole population of the city rushed into the streets    chapter xxxii  in which jos takes flight and the war is brought to a close  we of peaceful london city have never beheldand please god never shall witnesssuch a scene of hurry and alarm as that which brussels presented  crowds rushed to the namur gate from which direction the noise proceeded and many rode along the level chaussee to be in advance of any intelligence from the army  each man asked his neighbour for news and even great english lords and ladies condescended to speak to persons whom they did not know  the friends of the french went abroad wild with excitement and prophesying the triumph of their emperor  the merchants closed their shops and came out to swell the general chorus of alarm and clamour  women rushed to the churches and crowded the chapels and knelt and prayed on the flags and steps  the dull sound of the cannon went on rolling rolling  presently carriages with travellers began to leave the town galloping away by the ghent barrier  the prophecies of the french partisans began to pass for facts  he has cut the armies in two it was said  he is marching straight on brussels  he will overpower the english and be here tonight he will overpower the english shrieked isidor to his master and will be here tonight the man bounded in and out from the lodgings to the street always returning with some fresh particulars of disaster  joss face grew paler and paler alarm began to take entire possession of the stout civilian all the champagne he drank brought no courage to him  before sunset he was worked up to such a pitch of nervousness as gratified his friend isidor to behold who now counted surely upon the spoils of the owner of the laced coat  the women were away all this time  after hearing the firing for a moment the stout majors wife bethought her of her friend in the next chamber and ran in to watch and if possible to console amelia  the idea that she had that helpless and gentle creature to protect gave additional strength to the natural courage of the honest irishwoman she passed five hours by her friends side sometimes in remonstrance sometimes talking cheerfully oftener in silence and terrified mental supplication  i never let go her hand once said the stout lady afterwards until after sunset when the firing was over pauline the bonne was on her knees at church hard by praying for son homme a elle  when the noise of the cannonading was over mrs odowd issued out of amelias room into the parlour adjoining where jos sate with two emptied flasks and courage entirely gone  once or twice he had ventured into his sisters bedroom looking very much alarmed and as if he would say something  but the majors wife kept her place and he went away without disburthening himself of his speech  he was ashamed to tell her that he wanted to fly  but when she made her appearance in the diningroom where he sate in the twilight in the cheerless company of his empty champagne bottles he began to open his mind to her  mrs odowd he said hadnt you better get amelia ready  are you going to take her out for a walk said the majors lady sure shes too weak to stir  iive ordered the carriage he said andand posthorses isidor is gone for them jos continued  what do you want with driving tonight answered the lady  isnt she better on her bed  ive just got her to lie down  get her up said jos she must get up i say  and he stamped his foot energetically  i say the horses are orderedyes the horses are ordered  its all over and  and what asked mrs odowd  im off for ghent jos answered  everybody is going theres a place for you  we shall start in halfanhour  the majors wife looked at him with infinite scorn  i dont move till odowd gives me the route said she you may go if you like mr sedley but faith amelia and i stop here  she shall go said jos with another stamp of his foot  mrs odowd put herself with arms akimbo before the bedroom door  is it her mother youre going to take her to she said or do you want to go to mamma yourself mr sedley  good marninga pleasant journey to ye sir bon voyage as they say and take my counsel and shave off them mustachios or theyll bring you into mischief  dn yelled out jos wild with fear rage and mortification and isidor came in at this juncture swearing in his turn  pas de chevaux sacre bleu hissed out the furious domestic  all the horses were gone  jos was not the only man in brussels seized with panic that day  but joss fears great and cruel as they were already were destined to increase to an almost frantic pitch before the night was over it has been mentioned how pauline the bonne had son homme a elle also in the ranks of the army that had gone out to meet the emperor napoleon  this lover was a native of brussels and a belgian hussar  the troops of his nation signalised themselves in this war for anything but courage and young van cutsum paulines admirer was too good a soldier to disobey his colonels orders to run away whilst in garrison at brussels young regulus he had been born in the revolutionary times found his great comfort and passed almost all his leisure moments in paulines kitchen and it was with pockets and holsters crammed full of good things from her larder that he had take leave of his weeping sweetheart to proceed upon the campaign a few days before  as far as his regiment was concerned this campaign was over now they had formed a part of the division under the command of his sovereign apparent the prince of orange and as respected length of swords and mustachios and the richness of uniform and equipments regulus and his comrades looked to be as gallant a body of men as ever trumpet sounded for  when ney dashed upon the advance of the allied troops carrying one position after the other until the arrival of the great body of the british army from brussels changed the aspect of the combat of quatre bras the squadrons among which regulus rode showed the greatest activity in retreating before the french and were dislodged from one post and another which they occupied with perfect alacrity on their part  their movements were only checked by the advance of the british in their rear  thus forced to halt the enemys cavalry whose bloodthirsty obstinacy cannot be too severely reprehended had at length an opportunity of coming to close quarters with the brave belgians before them who preferred to encounter the british rather than the french and at once turning tail rode through the english regiments that were behind them and scattered in all directions  the regiment in fact did not exist any more  it was nowhere  it had no headquarters  regulus found himself galloping many miles from the field of action entirely alone and whither should he fly for refuge so naturally as to that kitchen and those faithful arms in which pauline had so often welcomed him  at some ten oclock the clinking of a sabre might have been heard up the stair of the house where the osbornes occupied a story in the continental fashion  a knock might have been heard at the kitchen door and poor pauline come back from church fainted almost with terror as she opened it and saw before her her haggard hussar  he looked as pale as the midnight dragoon who came to disturb leonora pauline would have screamed but that her cry would have called her masters and discovered her friend  she stifled her scream then and leading her hero into the kitchen gave him beer and the choice bits from the dinner which jos had not had the heart to taste  the hussar showed he was no ghost by the prodigious quantity of flesh and beer which he devouredand during the mouthfuls he told his tale of disaster  his regiment had performed prodigies of courage and had withstood for a while the onset of the whole french army  but they were overwhelmed at last as was the whole british army by this time ney destroyed each regiment as it came up  the belgians in vain interposed to prevent the butchery of the english  the brunswickers were routed and had fledtheir duke was killed  it was a general debacle  he sought to drown his sorrow for the defeat in floods of beer  isidor who had come into the kitchen heard the conversation and rushed out to inform his master  it is all over he shrieked to jos milor duke is a prisoner the duke of brunswick is killed the british army is in full flight there is only one man escaped and he is in the kitchen nowcome and hear him so jos tottered into that apartment where regulus still sate on the kitchen table and clung fast to his flagon of beer  in the best french which he could muster and which was in sooth of a very ungrammatical sort jos besought the hussar to tell his tale  the disasters deepened as regulus spoke  he was the only man of his regiment not slain on the field he had seen the duke of brunswick fall the black hussars fly the ecossais pounded down by the cannon and the th gasped jos  cut in pieces said the hussarupon which pauline cried out o my mistress ma bonne petite dame went off fairly into hysterics and filled the house with her screams  wild with terror mr sedley knew not how or where to seek for safety he rushed from the kitchen back to the sittingroom and cast an appealing look at amelias door which mrs odowd had closed and locked in his face but he remembered how scornfully the latter had received him and after pausing and listening for a brief space at the door he left it and resolved to go into the street for the first time that day  so seizing a candle he looked about for his goldlaced cap and found it lying in its usual place on a consoletable in the anteroom placed before a mirror at which jos used to coquet always giving his sidelocks a twirl and his cap the proper cock over his eye before he went forth to make appearance in public  such is the force of habit that even in the midst of his terror he began mechanically to twiddle with his hair and arrange the cock of his hat  then he looked amazed at the pale face in the glass before him and especially at his mustachios which had attained a rich growth in the course of near seven weeks since they had come into the world  they will mistake me for a military man thought he remembering isidors warning as to the massacre with which all the defeated british army was threatened and staggering back to his bedchamber he began wildly pulling the bell which summoned his valet  isidor answered that summons  jos had sunk in a chairhe had torn off his neckcloths and turned down his collars and was sitting with both his hands lifted to his throat  coupezmoi isidor shouted he vite  coupezmoi  isidor thought for a moment he had gone mad and that he wished his valet to cut his throat  les moustaches gasped joe les moustachescoupy rasy vitehis french was of this sortvoluble as we have said but not remarkable for grammar  isidor swept off the mustachios in no time with the razor and heard with inexpressible delight his masters orders that he should fetch a hat and a plain coat  ne porty ploohabit militairbonnbonny a voo prenny dehorswere joss wordsthe coat and cap were at last his property  this gift being made jos selected a plain black coat and waistcoat from his stock and put on a large white neckcloth and a plain beaver if he could have got a shovel hat he would have worn it as it was you would have fancied he was a flourishing large parson of the church of england  venny maintenong he continued sweevyallypartydong la roo and so having said he plunged swiftly down the stairs of the house and passed into the street  although regulus had vowed that he was the only man of his regiment or of the allied army almost who had escaped being cut to pieces by ney it appeared that his statement was incorrect and that a good number more of the supposed victims had survived the massacre many scores of reguluss comrades had found their way back to brussels and all agreeing that they had run awayfilled the whole town with an idea of the defeat of the allies  the arrival of the french was expected hourly the panic continued and preparations for flight went on everywhere  no horses  thought jos in terror he made isidor inquire of scores of persons whether they had any to lend or sell and his heart sank within him at the negative answers returned everywhere should he take the journey on foot  even fear could not render that ponderous body so active  almost all the hotels occupied by the english in brussels face the parc and jos wandered irresolutely about in this quarter with crowds of other people oppressed as he was by fear and curiosity some families he saw more happy than himself having discovered a team of horses and rattling through the streets in retreat others again there were whose case was like his own and who could not for any bribes or entreaties procure the necessary means of flight amongst these wouldbe fugitives jos remarked the lady bareacres and her daughter who sate in their carriage in the portecochere of their hotel all their imperials packed and the only drawback to whose flight was the same want of motive power which kept jos stationary  rebecca crawley occupied apartments in this hotel and had before this period had sundry hostile meetings with the ladies of the bareacres family  my lady bareacres cut mrs crawley on the stairs when they met by chance and in all places where the latters name was mentioned spoke perseveringly ill of her neighbour  the countess was shocked at the familiarity of general tufto with the aidedecamps wife  the lady blanche avoided her as if she had been an infectious disease only the earl himself kept up a sly occasional acquaintance with her when out of the jurisdiction of his ladies  rebecca had her revenge now upon these insolent enemies  if became known in the hotel that captain crawleys horses had been left behind and when the panic began lady bareacres condescended to send her maid to the captains wife with her ladyships compliments and a desire to know the price of mrs crawleys horses  mrs crawley returned a note with her compliments and an intimation that it was not her custom to transact bargains with ladies maids  this curt reply brought the earl in person to beckys apartment but he could get no more success than the first ambassador  send a ladys maid to me mrs crawley cried in great anger why didnt my lady bareacres tell me to go and saddle the horses  is it her ladyship that wants to escape or her ladyships femme de chambre and this was all the answer that the earl bore back to his countess  what will not necessity do  the countess herself actually came to wait upon mrs crawley on the failure of her second envoy  she entreated her to name her own price she even offered to invite becky to bareacres house if the latter would but give her the means of returning to that residence  mrs crawley sneered at her  i dont want to be waited on by bailiffs in livery she said you will never get back though most probablyat least not you and your diamonds together  the french will have those they will be here in two hours and i shall be half way to ghent by that time  i would not sell you my horses no not for the two largest diamonds that your ladyship wore at the ball  lady bareacres trembled with rage and terror  the diamonds were sewed into her habit and secreted in my lords padding and boots woman the diamonds are at the bankers and i will have the horses she said  rebecca laughed in her face the infuriate countess went below and sate in her carriage her maid her courier and her husband were sent once more through the town each to look for cattle and woe betide those who came last  her ladyship was resolved on departing the very instant the horses arrived from any quarterwith her husband or without him  rebecca had the pleasure of seeing her ladyship in the horseless carriage and keeping her eyes fixed upon her and bewailing in the loudest tone of voice the countesss perplexities  not to be able to get horses she said and to have all those diamonds sewed into the carriage cushions  what a prize it will be for the french when they comethe carriage and the diamonds i mean not the lady she gave this information to the landlord to the servants to the guests and the innumerable stragglers about the courtyard  lady bareacres could have shot her from the carriage window  it was while enjoying the humiliation of her enemy that rebecca caught sight of jos who made towards her directly he perceived her  that altered frightened fat face told his secret well enough  he too wanted to fly and was on the lookout for the means of escape he shall buy my horses thought rebecca and ill ride the mare  jos walked up to his friend and put the question for the hundredth time during the past hour did she know where horses were to be had  what you fly said rebecca with a laugh  i thought you were the champion of all the ladies mr sedley  iim not a military man gasped he  and ameliawho is to protect that poor little sister of yours asked rebecca  you surely would not desert her  what good can i do her supposesuppose the enemy arrive jos answered  theyll spare the women but my man tells me that they have taken an oath to give no quarter to the menthe dastardly cowards  horrid cried rebecca enjoying his perplexity  besides i dont want to desert her cried the brother she shant be deserted  there is a seat for her in my carriage and one for you dear mrs crawley if you will come and if we can get horses sighed he  i have two to sell the lady said  jos could have flung himself into her arms at the news  get the carriage isidor he cried weve found themwe have found them  my horses never were in harness added the lady bullfinch would kick the carriage to pieces if you put him in the traces  but he is quiet to ride asked the civilian  as quiet as a lamb and as fast as a hare answered rebecca  do you think he is up to my weight jos said  he was already on his back in imagination without ever so much as a thought for poor amelia  what person who loved a horsespeculation could resist such a temptation  in reply rebecca asked him to come into her room whither he followed her quite breathless to conclude the bargain  jos seldom spent a halfhour in his life which cost him so much money rebecca measuring the value of the goods which she had for sale by joss eagerness to purchase as well as by the scarcity of the article put upon her horses a price so prodigious as to make even the civilian draw back she would sell both or neither she said resolutely  rawdon had ordered her not to part with them for a price less than that which she specified lord bareacres below would give her the same moneyand with all her love and regard for the sedley family her dear mr joseph must conceive that poor people must livenobody in a word could be more affectionate but more firm about the matter of business  jos ended by agreeing as might be supposed of him the sum he had to give her was so large that he was obliged to ask for time so large as to be a little fortune to rebecca who rapidly calculated that with this sum and the sale of the residue of rawdons effects and her pension as a widow should he fall she would now be absolutely independent of the world and might look her weeds steadily in the face  once or twice in the day she certainly had herself thought about flying  but her reason gave her better counsel  suppose the french do come thought becky what can they do to a poor officers widow bah  the times of sacks and sieges are over  we shall be let to go home quietly or i may live pleasantly abroad with a snug little income  meanwhile jos and isidor went off to the stables to inspect the newly purchased cattle  jos bade his man saddle the horses at once he would ride away that very night that very hour  and he left the valet busy in getting the horses ready and went homewards himself to prepare for his departure  it must be secret  he would go to his chamber by the back entrance  he did not care to face mrs odowd and amelia and own to them that he was about to run  by the time joss bargain with rebecca was completed and his horses had been visited and examined it was almost morning once more  but though midnight was long passed there was no rest for the city the people were up the lights in the houses flamed crowds were still about the doors and the streets were busy  rumours of various natures went still from mouth to mouth  one report averred that the prussians had been utterly defeated another that it was the english who had been attacked and conquered  a third that the latter had held their ground this last rumour gradually got strength  no frenchmen had made their appearance  stragglers had come in from the army bringing reports more and more favourable  at last an aidedecamp actually reached brussels with despatches for the commandant of the place who placarded presently through the town an official announcement of the success of the allies at quatre bras and the entire repulse of the french under ney after a six hours battle  the aidedecamp must have arrived sometime while jos and rebecca were making their bargain together or the latter was inspecting his purchase  when he reached his own hotel he found a score of its numerous inhabitants on the threshold discoursing of the news there was no doubt as to its truth  and he went up to communicate it to the ladies under his charge he did not think it was necessary to tell them how he had intended to take leave of them how he had bought horses and what a price he had paid for them  but success or defeat was a minor matter to them who had only thought for the safety of those they loved amelia at the news of the victory became still more agitated even than before  she was for going that moment to the army  she besought her brother with tears to conduct her thither  her doubts and terrors reached their paroxysm and the poor girl who for many hours had been plunged into stupor raved and ran hither and thither in hysteric insanitya piteous sight  no man writhing in pain on the hardfought field fifteen miles off where lay after their struggles so many of the braveno man suffered more keenly than this poor harmless victim of the war  jos could not bear the sight of her pain  he left his sister in the charge of her stouter female companion and descended once more to the threshold of the hotel where everybody still lingered and talked and waited for more news  it grew to be broad daylight as they stood here and fresh news began to arrive from the war brought by men who had been actors in the scene  wagons and long country carts laden with wounded came rolling into the town ghastly groans came from within them and haggard faces looked up sadly from out of the straw  jos sedley was looking at one of these carriages with a painful curiositythe moans of the people within were frightfulthe wearied horses could hardly pull the cart stop  stop a feeble voice cried from the straw and the carriage stopped opposite mr sedleys hotel  it is george i know it is cried amelia rushing in a moment to the balcony with a pallid face and loose flowing hair  it was not george however but it was the next best thing  it was news of him  it was poor tom stubble who had marched out of brussels so gallantly twentyfour hours before bearing the colours of the regiment which he had defended very gallantly upon the field  a french lancer had speared the young ensign in the leg who fell still bravely holding to his flag  at the conclusion of the engagement a place had been found for the poor boy in a cart and he had been brought back to brussels  mr sedley mr sedley cried the boy faintly and jos came up almost frightened at the appeal  he had not at first distinguished who it was that called him  little tom stubble held out his hot and feeble hand im to be taken in here he said  osborneandand dobbin said i was and you are to give the man two napoleons my mother will pay you this young fellows thoughts during the long feverish hours passed in the cart had been wandering to his fathers parsonage which he had quitted only a few months before and he had sometimes forgotten his pain in that delirium  the hotel was large and the people kind and all the inmates of the cart were taken in and placed on various couches  the young ensign was conveyed upstairs to osbornes quarters  amelia and the majors wife had rushed down to him when the latter had recognised him from the balcony  you may fancy the feelings of these women when they were told that the day was over and both their husbands were safe in what mute rapture amelia fell on her good friends neck and embraced her in what a grateful passion of prayer she fell on her knees and thanked the power which had saved her husband  our young lady in her fevered and nervous condition could have had no more salutary medicine prescribed for her by any physician than that which chance put in her way  she and mrs odowd watched incessantly by the wounded lad whose pains were very severe and in the duty thus forced upon her amelia had not time to brood over her personal anxieties or to give herself up to her own fears and forebodings after her wont  the young patient told in his simple fashion the events of the day and the actions of our friends of the gallant th  they had suffered severely  they had lost very many officers and men  the majors horse had been shot under him as the regiment charged and they all thought that odowd was gone and that dobbin had got his majority until on their return from the charge to their old ground the major was discovered seated on pyramuss carcase refreshing himself from a casebottle  it was captain osborne that cut down the french lancer who had speared the ensign amelia turned so pale at the notion that mrs odowd stopped the young ensign in this story  and it was captain dobbin who at the end of the day though wounded himself took up the lad in his arms and carried him to the surgeon and thence to the cart which was to bring him back to brussels  and it was he who promised the driver two louis if he would make his way to mr sedleys hotel in the city and tell mrs captain osborne that the action was over and that her husband was unhurt and well  indeed but he has a good heart that william dobbin mrs odowd said though he is always laughing at me  young stubble vowed there was not such another officer in the army and never ceased his praises of the senior captain his modesty his kindness and his admirable coolness in the field  to these parts of the conversation amelia lent a very distracted attention  it was only when george was spoken of that she listened and when he was not mentioned she thought about him  in tending her patient and in thinking of the wonderful escapes of the day before her second day passed away not too slowly with amelia there was only one man in the army for her  and as long as he was well it must be owned that its movements interested her little all the reports which jos brought from the streets fell very vaguely on her ears though they were sufficient to give that timorous gentleman and many other people then in brussels every disquiet  the french had been repulsed certainly but it was after a severe and doubtful struggle and with only a division of the french army the emperor with the main body was away at ligny where he had utterly annihilated the prussians and was now free to bring his whole force to bear upon the allies the duke of wellington was retreating upon the capital and a great battle must be fought under its walls probably of which the chances were more than doubtful the duke of wellington had but twenty thousand british troops on whom he could rely for the germans were raw militia the belgians disaffected and with this handful his grace had to resist a hundred and fifty thousand men that had broken into belgium under napoleon  under napoleon  what warrior was there however famous and skilful that could fight at odds with him  jos thought of all these things and trembled  so did all the rest of brusselswhere people felt that the fight of the day before was but the prelude to the greater combat which was imminent  one of the armies opposed to the emperor was scattered to the winds already  the few english that could be brought to resist him would perish at their posts and the conqueror would pass over their bodies into the city woe be to those whom he found there addresses were prepared public functionaries assembled and debated secretly apartments were got ready and tricoloured banners and triumphal emblems manufactured to welcome the arrival of his majesty the emperor and king  the emigration still continued and wherever families could find means of departure they fled  when jos on the afternoon of the 17th of june went to rebeccas hotel he found that the great bareacres carriage had at length rolled away from the portecochere  the earl had procured a pair of horses somehow in spite of mrs crawley and was rolling on the road to ghent  louis the desired was getting ready his portmanteau in that city too  it seemed as if misfortune was never tired of worrying into motion that unwieldy exile  jos felt that the delay of yesterday had been only a respite and that his dearly bought horses must of a surety be put into requisition  his agonies were very severe all this day  as long as there was an english army between brussels and napoleon there was no need of immediate flight but he had his horses brought from their distant stables to the stables in the courtyard of the hotel where he lived so that they might be under his own eyes and beyond the risk of violent abduction isidor watched the stabledoor constantly and had the horses saddled to be ready for the start he longed intensely for that event  after the reception of the previous day rebecca did not care to come near her dear amelia  she clipped the bouquet which george had brought her and gave fresh water to the flowers and read over the letter which he had sent her  poor wretch she said twirling round the little bit of paper in her fingers how i could crush her with thisand it is for a thing like this that she must break her heart forsoothfor a man who is stupida coxcomband who does not care for her  my poor good rawdon is worth ten of this creature and then she fell to thinking what she should do ifif anything happened to poor good rawdon and what a great piece of luck it was that he had left his horses behind  in the course of this day too mrs crawley who saw not without anger the bareacres party drive off bethought her of the precaution which the countess had taken and did a little needlework for her own advantage she stitched away the major part of her trinkets bills and banknotes about her person and so prepared was ready for any eventto fly if she thought fit or to stay and welcome the conqueror were he englishman or frenchman  and i am not sure that she did not dream that night of becoming a duchess and madame la marechale while rawdon wrapped in his cloak and making his bivouac under the rain at mount saint john was thinking with all the force of his heart about the little wife whom he had left behind him  the next day was a sunday  and mrs major odowd had the satisfaction of seeing both her patients refreshed in health and spirits by some rest which they had taken during the night  she herself had slept on a great chair in amelias room ready to wait upon her poor friend or the ensign should either need her nursing when morning came this robust woman went back to the house where she and her major had their billet and here performed an elaborate and splendid toilette befitting the day  and it is very possible that whilst alone in that chamber which her husband had inhabited and where his cap still lay on the pillow and his cane stood in the corner one prayer at least was sent up to heaven for the welfare of the brave soldier michael odowd  when she returned she brought her prayerbook with her and her uncle the deans famous book of sermons out of which she never failed to read every sabbath not understanding all haply not pronouncing many of the words aright which were long and abstrusefor the dean was a learned man and loved long latin wordsbut with great gravity vast emphasis and with tolerable correctness in the main  how often has my mick listened to these sermons she thought and me reading in the cabin of a calm  she proposed to resume this exercise on the present day with amelia and the wounded ensign for a congregation  the same service was read on that day in twenty thousand churches at the same hour and millions of british men and women on their knees implored protection of the father of all  they did not hear the noise which disturbed our little congregation at brussels  much louder than that which had interrupted them two days previously as mrs odowd was reading the service in her best voice the cannon of waterloo began to roar  when jos heard that dreadful sound he made up his mind that he would bear this perpetual recurrence of terrors no longer and would fly at once  he rushed into the sick mans room where our three friends had paused in their prayers and further interrupted them by a passionate appeal to amelia  i cant stand it any more emmy he said i wont stand it and you must come with me  i have bought a horse for younever mind at what priceand you must dress and come with me and ride behind isidor  god forgive me mr sedley but you are no better than a coward mrs odowd said laying down the book  i say come amelia the civilian went on never mind what she says why are we to stop here and be butchered by the frenchmen  you forget the th my boy said the little stubble the wounded hero from his bedand and you wont leave me will you mrs odowd  no my dear fellow said she going up and kissing the boy  no harm shall come to you while i stand by i dont budge till i get the word from mick  a pretty figure id be wouldnt i stuck behind that chap on a pillion  this image caused the young patient to burst out laughing in his bed and even made amelia smile  i dont ask her jos shouted outi dont ask thatthat irishwoman but you amelia once for all will you come  without my husband joseph amelia said with a look of wonder and gave her hand to the majors wife joss patience was exhausted  goodbye then he said shaking his fist in a rage and slamming the door by which he retreated  and this time he really gave his order for march  and mounted in the courtyard  mrs odowd heard the clattering hoofs of the horses as they issued from the gate and looking on made many scornful remarks on poor joseph as he rode down the street with isidor after him in the laced cap  the horses which had not been exercised for some days were lively and sprang about the street  jos a clumsy and timid horseman did not look to advantage in the saddle  look at him amelia dear driving into the parlour window  such a bull in a chinashop i never saw and presently the pair of riders disappeared at a canter down the street leading in the direction of the ghent road mrs odowd pursuing them with a fire of sarcasm so long as they were in sight  all that day from morning until past sunset the cannon never ceased to roar  it was dark when the cannonading stopped all of a sudden  all of us have read of what occurred during that interval  the tale is in every englishmans mouth and you and i who were children when the great battle was won and lost are never tired of hearing and recounting the history of that famous action  its remembrance rankles still in the bosoms of millions of the countrymen of those brave men who lost the day  they pant for an opportunity of revenging that humiliation and if a contest ending in a victory on their part should ensue elating them in their turn and leaving its cursed legacy of hatred and rage behind to us there is no end to the socalled glory and shame and to the alternations of successful and unsuccessful murder in which two highspirited nations might engage  centuries hence we frenchmen and englishmen might be boasting and killing each other still carrying out bravely the devils code of honour  all our friends took their share and fought like men in the great field  all day long whilst the women were praying ten miles away the lines of the dauntless english infantry were receiving and repelling the furious charges of the french horsemen  guns which were heard at brussels were ploughing up their ranks and comrades falling and the resolute survivors closing in  towards evening the attack of the french repeated and resisted so bravely slackened in its fury  they had other foes besides the british to engage or were preparing for a final onset  it came at last  the columns of the imperial guard marched up the hill of saint jean at length and at once to sweep the english from the height which they had maintained all day and spite of all  unscared by the thunder of the artillery which hurled death from the english linethe dark rolling column pressed on and up the hill it seemed almost to crest the eminence when it began to wave and falter  then it stopped still facing the shot  then at last the english troops rushed from the post from which no enemy had been able to dislodge them and the guard turned and fled  no more firing was heard at brusselsthe pursuit rolled miles away darkness came down on the field and city  and amelia was praying for george who was lying on his face dead with a bullet through his heart    chapter xxxiii  in which miss crawleys relations are very anxious about her  the kind reader must please to rememberwhile the army is marching from flanders and after its heroic actions there is advancing to take the fortifications on the frontiers of france previous to an occupation of that countrythat there are a number of persons living peaceably in england who have to do with the history at present in hand and must come in for their share of the chronicle during the time of these battles and dangers old miss crawley was living at brighton very moderately moved by the great events that were going on the great events rendered the newspapers rather interesting to be sure and briggs read out the gazette in which rawdon crawleys gallantry was mentioned with honour and his promotion was presently recorded  what a pity that young man has taken such an irretrievable step in the world his aunt said with his rank and distinction he might have married a brewers daughter with a quarter of a millionlike miss grains or have looked to ally himself with the best families in england he would have had my money some day or other or his children wouldfor im not in a hurry to go miss briggs although you may be in a hurry to be rid of me and instead of that he is a doomed pauper with a dancinggirl for a wife  will my dear miss crawley not cast an eye of compassion upon the heroic soldier whose name is inscribed in the annals of his countrys glory said miss briggs who was greatly excited by the waterloo proceedings and loved speaking romantically when there was an occasion  has not the captainor the colonel as i may now style himdone deeds which make the name of crawley illustrious  briggs you are a fool said miss crawley colonel crawley has dragged the name of crawley through the mud miss briggs  marry a drawingmasters daughter indeedmarry a dame de compagniefor she was no better briggs no she was just what you areonly younger and a great deal prettier and cleverer  were you an accomplice of that abandoned wretch i wonder of whose vile arts he became a victim and of whom you used to be such an admirer  yes i daresay you were an accomplice but you will find yourself disappointed in my will i can tell you  and you will have the goodness to write to mr waxy and say that i desire to see him immediately miss crawley was now in the habit of writing to mr waxy her solicitor almost every day in the week for her arrangements respecting her property were all revoked and her perplexity was great as to the future disposition of her money  the spinster had however rallied considerably as was proved by the increased vigour and frequency of her sarcasms upon miss briggs all which attacks the poor companion bore with meekness with cowardice with a resignation that was half generous and half hypocriticalwith the slavish submission in a word that women of her disposition and station are compelled to show  who has not seen how women bully women what tortures have men to endure comparable to those daily repeated shafts of scorn and cruelty with which poor women are riddled by the tyrants of their sex  poor victims  but we are starting from our proposition which is that miss crawley was always particularly annoying and savage when she was rallying from illnessas they say wounds tingle most when they are about to heal  while thus approaching as all hoped to convalescence miss briggs was the only victim admitted into the presence of the invalid yet miss crawleys relatives afar off did not forget their beloved kinswoman and by a number of tokens presents and kind affectionate messages strove to keep themselves alive in her recollection  in the first place let us mention her nephew rawdon crawley  a few weeks after the famous fight of waterloo and after the gazette had made known to her the promotion and gallantry of that distinguished officer the dieppe packet brought over to miss crawley at brighton a box containing presents and a dutiful letter from the colonel her nephew  in the box were a pair of french epaulets a cross of the legion of honour and the hilt of a swordrelics from the field of battle  and the letter described with a good deal of humour how the latter belonged to a commanding officer of the guard who having sworn that the guard died but never surrendered was taken prisoner the next minute by a private soldier who broke the frenchmans sword with the butt of his musket when rawdon made himself master of the shattered weapon  as for the cross and epaulets they came from a colonel of french cavalry who had fallen under the aidedecamps arm in the battle and rawdon crawley did not know what better to do with the spoils than to send them to his kindest and most affectionate old friend should he continue to write to her from paris whither the army was marching  he might be able to give her interesting news from that capital and of some of miss crawleys old friends of the emigration to whom she had shown so much kindness during their distress  the spinster caused briggs to write back to the colonel a gracious and complimentary letter encouraging him to continue his correspondence his first letter was so excessively lively and amusing that she should look with pleasure for its successorsof course i know she explained to miss briggs that rawdon could not write such a good letter any more than you could my poor briggs and that it is that clever little wretch of a rebecca who dictates every word to him but that is no reason why my nephew should not amuse me and so i wish to let him understand that i am in high good humour  i wonder whether she knew that it was not only becky who wrote the letters but that mrs rawdon actually took and sent home the trophies which she bought for a few francs from one of the innumerable pedlars who immediately began to deal in relics of the war  the novelist who knows everything knows this also  be this however as it may miss crawleys gracious reply greatly encouraged our young friends rawdon and his lady who hoped for the best from their aunts evidently pacified humour  and they took care to entertain her with many delightful letters from paris whither as rawdon said they had the good luck to go in the track of the conquering army  to the rectors lady who went off to tend her husbands broken collarbone at the rectory at queens crawley the spinsters communications were by no means so gracious  mrs bute that brisk managing lively imperious woman had committed the most fatal of all errors with regard to her sisterinlaw  she had not merely oppressed her and her householdshe had bored miss crawley and if poor miss briggs had been a woman of any spirit she might have been made happy by the commission which her principal gave her to write a letter to mrs bute crawley saying that miss crawleys health was greatly improved since mrs bute had left her and begging the latter on no account to put herself to trouble or quit her family for miss crawleys sake  this triumph over a lady who had been very haughty and cruel in her behaviour to miss briggs would have rejoiced most women but the truth is briggs was a woman of no spirit at all and the moment her enemy was discomfited she began to feel compassion in her favour  how silly i was mrs bute thought and with reason ever to hint that i was coming as i did in that foolish letter when we sent miss crawley the guineafowls i ought to have gone without a word to the poor dear doting old creature and taken her out of the hands of that ninny briggs and that harpy of a femme de chambre  oh bute bute why did you break your collarbone  why indeed  we have seen how mrs bute having the game in her hands had really played her cards too well she had ruled over miss crawleys household utterly and completely to be utterly and completely routed when a favourable opportunity for rebellion came she and her household however considered that she had been the victim of horrible selfishness and treason and that her sacrifices in miss crawleys behalf had met with the most savage ingratitude rawdons promotion and the honourable mention made of his name in the gazette filled this good christian lady also with alarm  would his aunt relent towards him now that he was a lieutenantcolonel and a cb and would that odious rebecca once more get into favour the rectors wife wrote a sermon for her husband about the vanity of military glory and the prosperity of the wicked which the worthy parson read in his best voice and without understanding one syllable of it  he had pitt crawley for one of his auditorspitt who had come with his two halfsisters to church which the old baronet could now by no means be brought to frequent  since the departure of becky sharp that old wretch had given himself up entirely to his bad courses to the great scandal of the county and the mute horror of his son  the ribbons in miss horrockss cap became more splendid than ever  the polite families fled the hall and its owner in terror  sir pitt went about tippling at his tenants houses and drank rumandwater with the farmers at mudbury and the neighbouring places on marketdays  he drove the family coachandfour to southampton with miss horrocks inside  and the county people expected every week as his son did in speechless agony that his marriage with her would be announced in the provincial paper  it was indeed a rude burthen for mr crawley to bear  his eloquence was palsied at the missionary meetings and other religious assemblies in the neighbourhood where he had been in the habit of presiding and of speaking for hours for he felt when he rose that the audience said that is the son of the old reprobate sir pitt who is very likely drinking at the public house at this very moment and once when he was speaking of the benighted condition of the king of timbuctoo and the number of his wives who were likewise in darkness some gipsy miscreant from the crowd asked how many is there at queens crawley young squaretoes to the surprise of the platform and the ruin of mr pitts speech and the two daughters of the house of queens crawley would have been allowed to run utterly wild for sir pitt swore that no governess should ever enter into his doors again had not mr crawley by threatening the old gentleman forced the latter to send them to school  meanwhile as we have said whatever individual differences there might be between them all miss crawleys dear nephews and nieces were unanimous in loving her and sending her tokens of affection thus mrs bute sent guineafowls and some remarkably fine cauliflowers and a pretty purse or pincushion worked by her darling girls who begged to keep a little place in the recollection of their dear aunt while mr pitt sent peaches and grapes and venison from the hall  the southampton coach used to carry these tokens of affection to miss crawley at brighton  it used sometimes to convey mr pitt thither too for his differences with sir pitt caused mr crawley to absent himself a good deal from home now  and besides he had an attraction at brighton in the person of the lady jane sheepshanks whose engagement to mr crawley has been formerly mentioned in this history her ladyship and her sisters lived at brighton with their mamma the countess southdown that strongminded woman so favourably known in the serious world  a few words ought to be said regarding her ladyship and her noble family who are bound by ties of present and future relationship to the house of crawley respecting the chief of the southdown family clement william fourth earl of southdown little need be told except that his lordship came into parliament as lord wolsey under the auspices of mr wilberforce and for a time was a credit to his political sponsor and decidedly a serious young man  but words cannot describe the feelings of his admirable mother when she learned very shortly after her noble husbands demise that her son was a member of several worldly clubs had lost largely at play at wattiers and the cocoa tree that he had raised money on postobits and encumbered the family estate that he drove fourinhand and patronised the ring and that he actually had an operabox where he entertained the most dangerous bachelor company  his name was only mentioned with groans in the dowagers circle  the lady emily was her brothers senior by many years and took considerable rank in the serious world as author of some of the delightful tracts before mentioned and of many hymns and spiritual pieces  a mature spinster and having but faint ideas of marriage her love for the blacks occupied almost all her feelings  it is to her i believe we owe that beautiful poem    lead us to some sunny isle   yonder in the western deep   where the skies for ever smile   and the blacks for ever weep c  she had correspondences with clerical gentlemen in most of our east and west india possessions and was secretly attached to the reverend silas hornblower who was tattooed in the south sea islands  as for the lady jane on whom as it has been said mr pitt crawleys affection had been placed she was gentle blushing silent and timid in spite of his falling away she wept for her brother and was quite ashamed of loving him still  even yet she used to send him little hurried smuggled notes and pop them into the post in private the one dreadful secret which weighed upon her life was that she and the old housekeeper had been to pay southdown a furtive visit at his chambers in the albany and found himo the naughty dear abandoned wretchsmoking a cigar with a bottle of curacao before him  she admired her sister she adored her mother she thought mr crawley the most delightful and accomplished of men after southdown that fallen angel  and her mamma and sister who were ladies of the most superior sort managed everything for her and regarded her with that amiable pity of which your really superior woman always has such a share to give away  her mamma ordered her dresses her books her bonnets and her ideas for her she was made to take ponyriding or pianoexercise or any other sort of bodily medicament according as my lady southdown saw meet and her ladyship would have kept her daughter in pinafores up to her present age of sixandtwenty but that they were thrown off when lady jane was presented to queen charlotte  when these ladies first came to their house at brighton it was to them alone that mr crawley paid his personal visits contenting himself by leaving a card at his aunts house and making a modest inquiry of mr bowls or his assistant footman with respect to the health of the invalid  when he met miss briggs coming home from the library with a cargo of novels under her arm mr crawley blushed in a manner quite unusual to him as he stepped forward and shook miss crawleys companion by the hand  he introduced miss briggs to the lady with whom he happened to be walking the lady jane sheepshanks saying lady jane permit me to introduce to you my aunts kindest friend and most affectionate companion miss briggs whom you know under another title as authoress of the delightful lyrics of the heart of which you are so fond  lady jane blushed too as she held out a kind little hand to miss briggs and said something very civil and incoherent about mamma and proposing to call on miss crawley and being glad to be made known to the friends and relatives of mr crawley and with soft dovelike eyes saluted miss briggs as they separated while pitt crawley treated her to a profound courtly bow such as he had used to hh the duchess of pumpernickel when he was attache at that court  the artful diplomatist and disciple of the machiavellian binkie  it was he who had given lady jane that copy of poor briggss early poems which he remembered to have seen at queens crawley with a dedication from the poetess to his fathers late wife and he brought the volume with him to brighton reading it in the southampton coach and marking it with his own pencil before he presented it to the gentle lady jane  it was he too who laid before lady southdown the great advantages which might occur from an intimacy between her family and miss crawleyadvantages both worldly and spiritual he said  for miss crawley was now quite alone the monstrous dissipation and alliance of his brother rawdon had estranged her affections from that reprobate young man the greedy tyranny and avarice of mrs bute crawley had caused the old lady to revolt against the exorbitant pretensions of that part of the family and though he himself had held off all his life from cultivating miss crawleys friendship with perhaps an improper pride he thought now that every becoming means should be taken both to save her soul from perdition and to secure her fortune to himself as the head of the house of crawley  the strongminded lady southdown quite agreed in both proposals of her soninlaw and was for converting miss crawley offhand  at her own home both at southdown and at trottermore castle this tall and awful missionary of the truth rode about the country in her barouche with outriders launched packets of tracts among the cottagers and tenants and would order gaffer jones to be converted as she would order goody hicks to take a jamess powder without appeal resistance or benefit of clergy  my lord southdown her late husband an epileptic and simpleminded nobleman was in the habit of approving of everything which his matilda did and thought so that whatever changes her own belief might undergo and it accommodated itself to a prodigious variety of opinion taken from all sorts of doctors among the dissenters she had not the least scruple in ordering all her tenants and inferiors to follow and believe after her  thus whether she received the reverend saunders mcnitre the scotch divine or the reverend luke waters the mild wesleyan or the reverend giles jowls the illuminated cobbler who dubbed himself reverend as napoleon crowned himself emperorthe household children tenantry of my lady southdown were expected to go down on their knees with her ladyship and say amen to the prayers of either doctor  during these exercises old southdown on account of his invalid condition was allowed to sit in his own room and have negus and the paper read to him  lady jane was the old earls favourite daughter and tended him and loved him sincerely  as for lady emily the authoress of the washerwoman of finchley common her denunciations of future punishment at this period for her opinions modified afterwards were so awful that they used to frighten the timid old gentleman her father and the physicians declared his fits always occurred after one of her ladyships sermons  i will certainly call said lady southdown then in reply to the exhortation of her daughters pretendu mr pitt crawleywho is miss crawleys medical man  mr crawley mentioned the name of mr creamer  a most dangerous and ignorant practitioner my dear pitt  i have providentially been the means of removing him from several houses though in one or two instances i did not arrive in time  i could not save poor dear general glanders who was dying under the hands of that ignorant mandying  he rallied a little under the podgers pills which i administered to him but alas  it was too late  his death was delightful however and his change was only for the better creamer my dear pitt must leave your aunt  pitt expressed his perfect acquiescence  he too had been carried along by the energy of his noble kinswoman and future motherinlaw he had been made to accept saunders mcnitre luke waters giles jowls podgers pills rodgers pills pokeys elixir every one of her ladyships remedies spiritual or temporal  he never left her house without carrying respectfully away with him piles of her quack theology and medicine  o my dear brethren and fellowsojourners in vanity fair which among you does not know and suffer under such benevolent despots  it is in vain you say to them dear madam i took podgers specific at your orders last year and believe in it  why why am i to recant and accept the rodgers articles now  there is no help for it the faithful proselytizer if she cannot convince by argument bursts into tears and the refusant finds himself at the end of the contest taking down the bolus and saying well well rodgers be it  and as for her spiritual state continued the lady that of course must be looked to immediately  with creamer about her she may go off any day  and in what a condition my dear pitt in what a dreadful condition i will send the reverend mr irons to her instantly  jane write a line to the reverend bartholomew irons in the third person and say that i desire the pleasure of his company this evening at tea at halfpast six  he is an awakening man he ought to see miss crawley before she rests this night  and emily my love get ready a packet of books for miss crawley  put up a voice from the flames a trumpetwarning to jericho and the fleshpots broken or the converted cannibal  and the washerwoman of finchley common mamma said lady emily it is as well to begin soothingly at first  stop my dear ladies said pitt the diplomatist with every deference to the opinion of my beloved and respected lady southdown i think it would be quite unadvisable to commence so early upon serious topics with miss crawley  remember her delicate condition and how little how very little accustomed she has hitherto been to considerations connected with her immortal welfare  can we then begin too early pitt said lady emily rising with six little books already in her hand  if you begin abruptly you will frighten her altogether i know my aunts worldly nature so well as to be sure that any abrupt attempt at conversion will be the very worst means that can be employed for the welfare of that unfortunate lady  you will only frighten and annoy her she will very likely fling the books away and refuse all acquaintance with the givers  you are as worldly as miss crawley pitt said lady emily tossing out of the room her books in her hand  and i need not tell you my dear lady southdown pitt continued in a low voice and without heeding the interruption how fatal a little want of gentleness and caution may be to any hopes which we may entertain with regard to the worldly possessions of my aunt remember she has seventy thousand pounds think of her age and her highly nervous and delicate condition i know that she has destroyed the will which was made in my brothers colonel crawleys favour it is by soothing that wounded spirit that we must lead it into the right path and not by frightening it and so i think you will agree with me thatthat  of course of course lady southdown remarked jane my love you need not send that note to mr irons if her health is such that discussions fatigue her we will wait her amendment  i will call upon miss crawley tomorrow  and if i might suggest my sweet lady pitt said in a bland tone it would be as well not to take our precious emily who is too enthusiastic but rather that you should be accompanied by our sweet and dear lady jane  most certainly emily would ruin everything lady southdown said and this time agreed to forego her usual practice which was as we have said before she bore down personally upon any individual whom she proposed to subjugate to fire in a quantity of tracts upon the menaced party as a charge of the french was always preceded by a furious cannonade  lady southdown we say for the sake of the invalids health or for the sake of her souls ultimate welfare or for the sake of her money agreed to temporise  the next day the great southdown female family carriage with the earls coronet and the lozenge upon which the three lambs trottant argent upon the field vert of the southdowns were quartered with sable on a bend or three snuffmulls gules the cognizance of the house of binkie drove up in state to miss crawleys door and the tall serious footman handed in to mr bowls her ladyships cards for miss crawley and one likewise for miss briggs  by way of compromise lady emily sent in a packet in the evening for the latter lady containing copies of the washerwoman and other mild and favourite tracts for miss bs own perusal and a few for the servants hall viz  crumbs from the pantry the frying pan and the fire and the livery of sin of a much stronger kind    chapter xxxiv  james crawleys pipe is put out  the amiable behaviour of mr crawley and lady janes kind reception of her highly flattered miss briggs who was enabled to speak a good word for the latter after the cards of the southdown family had been presented to miss crawley  a countesss card left personally too for her briggs was not a little pleasing to the poor friendless companion  what could lady southdown mean by leaving a card upon you i wonder miss briggs said the republican miss crawley upon which the companion meekly said that she hoped there could be no harm in a lady of rank taking notice of a poor gentlewoman and she put away this card in her workbox amongst her most cherished personal treasures  furthermore miss briggs explained how she had met mr crawley walking with his cousin and long affianced bride the day before  and she told how kind and gentlelooking the lady was and what a plain not to say common dress she had all the articles of which from the bonnet down to the boots she described and estimated with female accuracy  miss crawley allowed briggs to prattle on without interrupting her too much  as she got well she was pining for society  mr creamer her medical man would not hear of her returning to her old haunts and dissipation in london  the old spinster was too glad to find any companionship at brighton and not only were the cards acknowledged the very next day but pitt crawley was graciously invited to come and see his aunt  he came bringing with him lady southdown and her daughter the dowager did not say a word about the state of miss crawleys soul but talked with much discretion about the weather  about the war and the downfall of the monster bonaparte  and above all about doctors quacks and the particular merits of dr podgers whom she then patronised  during their interview pitt crawley made a great stroke and one which showed that had his diplomatic career not been blighted by early neglect he might have risen to a high rank in his profession when the countess dowager of southdown fell foul of the corsican upstart as the fashion was in those days and showed that he was a monster stained with every conceivable crime a coward and a tyrant not fit to live one whose fall was predicted c pitt crawley suddenly took up the cudgels in favour of the man of destiny  he described the first consul as he saw him at paris at the peace of amiens when he pitt crawley had the gratification of making the acquaintance of the great and good mr fox a statesman whom however much he might differ with him it was impossible not to admire ferventlya statesman who had always had the highest opinion of the emperor napoleon  and he spoke in terms of the strongest indignation of the faithless conduct of the allies towards this dethroned monarch who after giving himself generously up to their mercy was consigned to an ignoble and cruel banishment while a bigoted popish rabble was tyrannising over france in his stead  this orthodox horror of romish superstition saved pitt crawley in lady southdowns opinion whilst his admiration for fox and napoleon raised him immeasurably in miss crawleys eyes  her friendship with that defunct british statesman was mentioned when we first introduced her in this history  a true whig miss crawley had been in opposition all through the war and though to be sure the downfall of the emperor did not very much agitate the old lady or his illtreatment tend to shorten her life or natural rest yet pitt spoke to her heart when he lauded both her idols and by that single speech made immense progress in her favour  and what do you think my dear miss crawley said to the young lady for whom she had taken a liking at first sight as she always did for pretty and modest young people though it must be owned her affections cooled as rapidly as they rose  lady jane blushed very much and said that she did not understand politics which she left to wiser heads than hers but though mamma was no doubt correct mr crawley had spoken beautifully and when the ladies were retiring at the conclusion of their visit miss crawley hoped lady southdown would be so kind as to send her lady jane sometimes if she could be spared to come down and console a poor sick lonely old woman this promise was graciously accorded and they separated upon great terms of amity  dont let lady southdown come again pitt said the old lady she is stupid and pompous like all your mothers family whom i never could endure  but bring that nice goodnatured little jane as often as ever you please pitt promised that he would do so  he did not tell the countess of southdown what opinion his aunt had formed of her ladyship who on the contrary thought that she had made a most delightful and majestic impression on miss crawley  and so nothing loth to comfort a sick lady and perhaps not sorry in her heart to be freed now and again from the dreary spouting of the reverend bartholomew irons and the serious toadies who gathered round the footstool of the pompous countess her mamma lady jane became a pretty constant visitor to miss crawley accompanied her in her drives and solaced many of her evenings  she was so naturally good and soft that even firkin was not jealous of her and the gentle briggs thought her friend was less cruel to her when kind lady jane was by  towards her ladyship miss crawleys manners were charming  the old spinster told her a thousand anecdotes about her youth talking to her in a very different strain from that in which she had been accustomed to converse with the godless little rebecca for there was that in lady janes innocence which rendered light talking impertinence before her and miss crawley was too much of a gentlewoman to offend such purity  the young lady herself had never received kindness except from this old spinster and her brother and father  and she repaid miss crawleys engoument by artless sweetness and friendship  in the autumn evenings when rebecca was flaunting at paris the gayest among the gay conquerors there and our amelia our dear wounded amelia ah where was she lady jane would be sitting in miss crawleys drawingroom singing sweetly to her in the twilight her little simple songs and hymns while the sun was setting and the sea was roaring on the beach  the old spinster used to wake up when these ditties ceased and ask for more  as for briggs and the quantity of tears of happiness which she now shed as she pretended to knit and looked out at the splendid ocean darkling before the windows and the lamps of heaven beginning more brightly to shinewho i say can measure the happiness and sensibility of briggs  pitt meanwhile in the diningroom with a pamphlet on the corn laws or a missionary register by his side took that kind of recreation which suits romantic and unromantic men after dinner  he sipped madeira built castles in the air  thought himself a fine fellow felt himself much more in love with jane than he had been any time these seven years during which their liaison had lasted without the slightest impatience on pitts partand slept a good deal  when the time for coffee came mr bowls used to enter in a noisy manner and summon squire pitt who would be found in the dark very busy with his pamphlet  i wish my love i could get somebody to play piquet with me miss crawley said one night when this functionary made his appearance with the candles and the coffee poor briggs can no more play than an owl she is so stupid the spinster always took an opportunity of abusing briggs before the servants and i think i should sleep better if i had my game  at this lady jane blushed to the tips of her little ears and down to the ends of her pretty fingers and when mr bowls had quitted the room and the door was quite shut she said  miss crawley i can play a little  i used toto play a little with poor dear papa  come and kiss me  come and kiss me this instant you dear good little soul cried miss crawley in an ecstasy and in this picturesque and friendly occupation mr pitt found the old lady and the young one when he came upstairs with him pamphlet in his hand how she did blush all the evening that poor lady jane  it must not be imagined that mr pitt crawleys artifices escaped the attention of his dear relations at the rectory at queens crawley hampshire and sussex lie very close together and mrs bute had friends in the latter county who took care to inform her of all and a great deal more than all that passed at miss crawleys house at brighton pitt was there more and more  he did not come for months together to the hall where his abominable old father abandoned himself completely to rumandwater and the odious society of the horrocks family pitts success rendered the rectors family furious and mrs bute regretted more though she confessed less than ever her monstrous fault in so insulting miss briggs and in being so haughty and parsimonious to bowls and firkin that she had not a single person left in miss crawleys household to give her information of what took place there it was all butes collarbone she persisted in saying if that had not broke i never would have left her  i am a martyr to duty and to your odious unclerical habit of hunting bute  hunting nonsense  it was you that frightened her barbara the divine interposed  youre a clever woman but youve got a devil of a temper and youre a screw with your money barbara  youd have been screwed in gaol bute if i had not kept your money  i know i would my dear said the rector goodnaturedly you are a clever woman but you manage too well you know  and the pious man consoled himself with a big glass of port  what the deuce can she find in that spooney of a pitt crawley he continued  the fellow has not pluck enough to say bo to a goose i remember when rawdon who is a man and be hanged to him used to flog him round the stables as if he was a whippingtop  and pitt would go howling home to his maha ha  why either of my boys would whop him with one hand  jim says hes remembered at oxford as miss crawley stillthe spooney  i say barbara his reverence continued after a pause  what said barbara who was biting her nails and drumming the table  i say why not send jim over to brighton to see if he can do anything with the old lady  hes very near getting his degree you know  hes only been plucked twiceso was ibut hes had the advantages of oxford and a university education  he knows some of the best chaps there he pulls stroke in the boniface boat  hes a handsome feller d it maam lets put him on the old woman hey and tell him to thrash pitt if he says anything ha ha ha  jim might go down and see her certainly the housewife said adding with a sigh if we could but get one of the girls into the house but she could never endure them because they are not pretty  those unfortunate and welleducated women made themselves heard from the neighbouring drawingroom where they were thrumming away with hard fingers an elaborate musicpiece on the pianoforte as their mother spoke and indeed they were at music or at backboard or at geography or at history the whole day long  but what avail all these accomplishments in vanity fair to girls who are short poor plain and have a bad complexion  mrs bute could think of nobody but the curate to take one of them off her hands and jim coming in from the stable at this minute through the parlour window with a short pipe stuck in his oilskin cap he and his father fell to talking about odds on the st leger and the colloquy between the rector and his wife ended  mrs bute did not augur much good to the cause from the sending of her son james as an ambassador and saw him depart in rather a despairing mood  nor did the young fellow himself when told what his mission was to be expect much pleasure or benefit from it but he was consoled by the thought that possibly the old lady would give him some handsome remembrance of her which would pay a few of his most pressing bills at the commencement of the ensuing oxford term and so took his place by the coach from southampton and was safely landed at brighton on the same evening  with his portmanteau his favourite bulldog towzer and an immense basket of farm and garden produce from the dear rectory folks to the dear miss crawley considering it was too late to disturb the invalid lady on the first night of his arrival he put up at an inn and did not wait upon miss crawley until a late hour in the noon of next day  james crawley when his aunt had last beheld him was a gawky lad at that uncomfortable age when the voice varies between an unearthly treble and a preternatural bass when the face not uncommonly blooms out with appearances for which rowlands kalydor is said to act as a cure when boys are seen to shave furtively with their sisters scissors and the sight of other young women produces intolerable sensations of terror in them when the great hands and ankles protrude a long way from garments which have grown too tight for them when their presence after dinner is at once frightful to the ladies who are whispering in the twilight in the drawingroom and inexpressibly odious to the gentlemen over the mahogany who are restrained from freedom of intercourse and delightful interchange of wit by the presence of that gawky innocence when at the conclusion of the second glass papa says jack my boy go out and see if the evening holds up and the youth willing to be free yet hurt at not being yet a man quits the incomplete banquet  james then a hobbadehoy was now become a young man having had the benefits of a university education and acquired the inestimable polish which is gained by living in a fast set at a small college and contracting debts and being rusticated and being plucked  he was a handsome lad however when he came to present himself to his aunt at brighton and good looks were always a title to the fickle old ladys favour  nor did his blushes and awkwardness take away from it she was pleased with these healthy tokens of the young gentlemans ingenuousness  he said he had come down for a couple of days to see a man of his college andand to pay my respects to you maam and my fathers and mothers who hope you are well  pitt was in the room with miss crawley when the lad was announced and looked very blank when his name was mentioned  the old lady had plenty of humour and enjoyed her correct nephews perplexity  she asked after all the people at the rectory with great interest and said she was thinking of paying them a visit  she praised the lad to his face and said he was wellgrown and very much improved and that it was a pity his sisters had not some of his good looks and finding on inquiry that he had taken up his quarters at an hotel would not hear of his stopping there but bade mr bowls send for mr james crawleys things instantly and hark ye bowls she added with great graciousness you will have the goodness to pay mr jamess bill  she flung pitt a look of arch triumph which caused that diplomatist almost to choke with envy  much as he had ingratiated himself with his aunt she had never yet invited him to stay under her roof and here was a young whippersnapper who at first sight was made welcome there  i beg your pardon sir says bowls advancing with a profound bow what otel sir shall thomas fetch the luggage from  o dam said young james starting up as if in some alarm ill go  what said miss crawley  the tom cribbs arms said james blushing deeply  miss crawley burst out laughing at this title  mr bowls gave one abrupt guffaw as a confidential servant of the family but choked the rest of the volley the diplomatist only smiled  ii didnt know any better said james looking down ive never been here before it was the coachman told me the young storyteller the fact is that on the southampton coach the day previous james crawley had met the tutbury pet who was coming to brighton to make a match with the rottingdean fibber and enchanted by the pets conversation had passed the evening in company with that scientific man and his friends at the inn in question  iid best go and settle the score james continued couldnt think of asking you maam he added generously  this delicacy made his aunt laugh the more  go and settle the bill bowls she said with a wave of her hand and bring it to me  poor lady she did not know what she had done  theretheres a little dawg said james looking frightfully guilty  id best go for him  he bites footmens calves  all the party cried out with laughing at this description even briggs and lady jane who was sitting mute during the interview between miss crawley and her nephew  and bowls without a word quitted the room  still by way of punishing her elder nephew miss crawley persisted in being gracious to the young oxonian there were no limits to her kindness or her compliments when they once began  she told pitt he might come to dinner and insisted that james should accompany her in her drive and paraded him solemnly up and down the cliff on the back seat of the barouche  during all this excursion she condescended to say civil things to him she quoted italian and french poetry to the poor bewildered lad and persisted that he was a fine scholar and was perfectly sure he would gain a gold medal and be a senior wrangler  haw haw laughed james encouraged by these compliments senior wrangler indeed thats at the other shop  what is the other shop my dear child said the lady  senior wranglers at cambridge not oxford said the scholar with a knowing air and would probably have been more confidential but that suddenly there appeared on the cliff in a taxcart drawn by a bangup pony dressed in white flannel coats with motherofpearl buttons his friends the tutbury pet and the rottingdean fibber with three other gentlemen of their acquaintance who all saluted poor james there in the carriage as he sate  this incident damped the ingenuous youths spirits and no word of yea or nay could he be induced to utter during the rest of the drive  on his return he found his room prepared and his portmanteau ready and might have remarked that mr bowlss countenance when the latter conducted him to his apartments wore a look of gravity wonder and compassion  but the thought of mr bowls did not enter his head  he was deploring the dreadful predicament in which he found himself in a house full of old women jabbering french and italian and talking poetry to him reglarly up a tree by jingo exclaimed the modest boy who could not face the gentlest of her sexnot even briggswhen she began to talk to him whereas put him at iffley lock and he could outslang the boldest bargeman  at dinner james appeared choking in a white neckcloth and had the honour of handing my lady jane downstairs while briggs and mr crawley followed afterwards conducting the old lady with her apparatus of bundles and shawls and cushions  half of briggss time at dinner was spent in superintending the invalids comfort and in cutting up chicken for her fat spaniel  james did not talk much but he made a point of asking all the ladies to drink wine and accepted mr crawleys challenge and consumed the greater part of a bottle of champagne which mr bowls was ordered to produce in his honour  the ladies having withdrawn and the two cousins being left together pitt the exdiplomatist he came very communicative and friendly  he asked after jamess career at collegewhat his prospects in life werehoped heartily he would get on and in a word was frank and amiable jamess tongue unloosed with the port and he told his cousin his life his prospects his debts his troubles at the littlego and his rows with the proctors filling rapidly from the bottles before him and flying from port to madeira with joyous activity  the chief pleasure which my aunt has said mr crawley filling his glass is that people should do as they like in her house this is liberty hall james and you cant do miss crawley a greater kindness than to do as you please and ask for what you will  i know you have all sneered at me in the country for being a tory miss crawley is liberal enough to suit any fancy  she is a republican in principle and despises everything like rank or title  why are you going to marry an earls daughter said james  my dear friend remember it is not poor lady janes fault that she is well born pitt replied with a courtly air  she cannot help being a lady  besides i am a tory you know  oh as for that said jim theres nothing like old blood no dammy nothing like it  im none of your radicals  i know what it is to be a gentleman dammy see the chaps in a boatrace look at the fellers in a fight aye look at a dawg killing ratswhich is it wins the goodblooded ones  get some more port bowls old boy whilst i buzz this bottlehere  what was i asaying  i think you were speaking of dogs killing rats pitt remarked mildly handing his cousin the decanter to buzz  killing rats was i well pitt are you a sporting man do you want to see a dawg as can kill a rat if you do come down with me to tom corduroys in castle street mews and ill show you such a bullterrier aspooh gammon cried james bursting out laughing at his own absurdityyou dont care about a dawg or rat its all nonsense im blest if i think you know the difference between a dog and a duck  no by the way pitt continued with increased blandness it was about blood you were talking and the personal advantages which people derive from patrician birth  heres the fresh bottle  bloods the word said james gulping the ruby fluid down nothing like blood sir in hosses dawgs and men  why only last term just before i was rusticated that is i mean just before i had the measles ha hathere was me and ringwood of christchurch bob ringwood lord cinqbars son having our beer at the bell at blenheim when the banbury bargeman offered to fight either of us for a bowl of punch  i couldnt  my arm was in a sling couldnt even take the drag downa brute of a mare of mine had fell with me only two days before out with the abingdon and i thought my arm was broke well sir i couldnt finish him but bob had his coat off at oncehe stood up to the banbury man for three minutes and polished him off in four rounds easy  gad how he did drop sir and what was it blood sir all blood  you dont drink james the exattache continued in my time at oxford the men passed round the bottle a little quicker than you young fellows seem to do  come come said james putting his hand to his nose and winking at his cousin with a pair of vinous eyes no jokes old boy no trying it on on me  you want to trot me out but its no go  in vino veritas old boy  mars bacchus apollo virorum hey i wish my aunt would send down some of this to the governor its a precious good tap  you had better ask her machiavel continued or make the best of your time now  what says the bard nunc vino pellite curas cras ingens iterabimus aequor and the bacchanalian quoting the above with a house of commons air tossed off nearly a thimbleful of wine with an immense flourish of his glass  at the rectory when the bottle of port wine was opened after dinner the young ladies had each a glass from a bottle of currant wine  mrs bute took one glass of port honest james had a couple commonly but as his father grew very sulky if he made further inroads on the bottle the good lad generally refrained from trying for more and subsided either into the currant wine or to some private ginandwater in the stables which he enjoyed in the company of the coachman and his pipe at oxford the quantity of wine was unlimited but the quality was inferior  but when quantity and quality united as at his aunts house james showed that he could appreciate them indeed and hardly needed any of his cousins encouragement in draining off the second bottle supplied by mr bowls  when the time for coffee came however and for a return to the ladies of whom he stood in awe the young gentlemans agreeable frankness left him and he relapsed into his usual surly timidity contenting himself by saying yes and no by scowling at lady jane and by upsetting one cup of coffee during the evening  if he did not speak he yawned in a pitiable manner and his presence threw a damp upon the modest proceedings of the evening for miss crawley and lady jane at their piquet and miss briggs at her work felt that his eyes were wildly fixed on them and were uneasy under that maudlin look  he seems a very silent awkward bashful lad said miss crawley to mr pitt  he is more communicative in mens society than with ladies machiavel dryly replied  perhaps rather disappointed that the port wine had not made jim speak more  he had spent the early part of the next morning in writing home to his mother a most flourishing account of his reception by miss crawley but ah he little knew what evils the day was bringing for him and how short his reign of favour was destined to be  a circumstance which jim had forgottena trivial but fatal circumstancehad taken place at the cribbs arms on the night before he had come to his aunts house  it was no other than thisjim who was always of a generous disposition and when in his cups especially hospitable had in the course of the night treated the tutbury champion and the rottingdean man and their friends twice or thrice to the refreshment of ginandwaterso that no less than eighteen glasses of that fluid at eightpence per glass were charged in mr james crawleys bill  it was not the amount of eightpences but the quantity of gin which told fatally against poor jamess character when his aunts butler mr bowls went down at his mistresss request to pay the young gentlemans bill  the landlord fearing lest the account should be refused altogether swore solemnly that the young gent had consumed personally every farthings worth of the liquor  and bowls paid the bill finally and showed it on his return home to mrs firkin who was shocked at the frightful prodigality of gin and took the bill to miss briggs as accountantgeneral who thought it her duty to mention the circumstance to her principal miss crawley  had he drunk a dozen bottles of claret the old spinster could have pardoned him  mr fox and mr sheridan drank claret  gentlemen drank claret  but eighteen glasses of gin consumed among boxers in an ignoble pothouseit was an odious crime and not to be pardoned readily  everything went against the lad  he came home perfumed from the stables whither he had been to pay his dog towzer a visitand whence he was going to take his friend out for an airing when he met miss crawley and her wheezy blenheim spaniel which towzer would have eaten up had not the blenheim fled squealing to the protection of miss briggs while the atrocious master of the bulldog stood laughing at the horrible persecution  this day too the unlucky boys modesty had likewise forsaken him he was lively and facetious at dinner during the repast he levelled one or two jokes against pitt crawley  he drank as much wine as upon the previous day and going quite unsuspiciously to the drawingroom began to entertain the ladies there with some choice oxford stories  he described the different pugilistic qualities of molyneux and dutch sam offered playfully to give lady jane the odds upon the tutbury pet against the rottingdean man or take them as her ladyship chose and crowned the pleasantry by proposing to back himself against his cousin pitt crawley either with or without the gloves  and thats a fair offer my buck he said with a loud laugh slapping pitt on the shoulder and my father told me to make it too and hell go halves in the bet ha ha so saying the engaging youth nodded knowingly at poor miss briggs and pointed his thumb over his shoulder at pitt crawley in a jocular and exulting manner  pitt was not pleased altogether perhaps but still not unhappy in the main  poor jim had his laugh out  and staggered across the room with his aunts candle when the old lady moved to retire and offered to salute her with the blandest tipsy smile  and he took his own leave and went upstairs to his bedroom perfectly satisfied with himself and with a pleased notion that his aunts money would be left to him in preference to his father and all the rest of the family  once up in the bedroom one would have thought he could not make matters worse and yet this unlucky boy did  the moon was shining very pleasantly out on the sea and jim attracted to the window by the romantic appearance of the ocean and the heavens thought he would further enjoy them while smoking  nobody would smell the tobacco he thought if he cunningly opened the window and kept his head and pipe in the fresh air this he did  but being in an excited state poor jim had forgotten that his door was open all this time so that the breeze blowing inwards and a fine thorough draught being established the clouds of tobacco were carried downstairs and arrived with quite undiminished fragrance to miss crawley and miss briggs  the pipe of tobacco finished the business  and the butecrawleys never knew how many thousand pounds it cost them  firkin rushed downstairs to bowls who was reading out the fire and the frying pan to his aidedecamp in a loud and ghostly voice  the dreadful secret was told to him by firkin with so frightened a look that for the first moment mr bowls and his young man thought that robbers were in the house the legs of whom had probably been discovered by the woman under miss crawleys bed  when made aware of the fact howeverto rush upstairs at three steps at a time to enter the unconscious jamess apartment calling out mr james in a voice stifled with alarm and to cry for gawds sake sir stop that ere pipe was the work of a minute with mr bowls  o mr james what ave you done he said in a voice of the deepest pathos as he threw the implement out of the window what ave you done sir missis cant abide em  missis neednt smoke said james with a frantic misplaced laugh and thought the whole matter an excellent joke  but his feelings were very different in the morning when mr bowlss young man who operated upon mr jamess boots and brought him his hot water to shave that beard which he was so anxiously expecting handed a note in to mr james in bed in the handwriting of miss briggs  dear sir it said miss crawley has passed an exceedingly disturbed night owing to the shocking manner in which the house has been polluted by tobacco miss crawley bids me say she regrets that she is too unwell to see you before you goand above all that she ever induced you to remove from the alehouse where she is sure you will be much more comfortable during the rest of your stay at brighton  and herewith honest jamess career as a candidate for his aunts favour ended  he had in fact and without knowing it done what he menaced to do  he had fought his cousin pitt with the gloves  where meanwhile was he who had been once first favourite for this race for money becky and rawdon as we have seen were come together after waterloo and were passing the winter of 1815 at paris in great splendour and gaiety  rebecca was a good economist and the price poor jos sedley had paid for her two horses was in itself sufficient to keep their little establishment afloat for a year at the least there was no occasion to turn into money my pistols the same which i shot captain marker or the gold dressingcase or the cloak lined with sable  becky had it made into a pelisse for herself in which she rode in the bois de boulogne to the admiration of all  and you should have seen the scene between her and her delighted husband whom she rejoined after the army had entered cambray and when she unsewed herself and let out of her dress all those watches knickknacks banknotes cheques and valuables which she had secreted in the wadding previous to her meditated flight from brussels  tufto was charmed and rawdon roared with delighted laughter and swore that she was better than any play he ever saw by jove and the way in which she jockeyed jos and which she described with infinite fun carried up his delight to a pitch of quite insane enthusiasm  he believed in his wife as much as the french soldiers in napoleon  her success in paris was remarkable  all the french ladies voted her charming  she spoke their language admirably  she adopted at once their grace their liveliness their manner  her husband was stupid certainlyall english are stupidand besides a dull husband at paris is always a point in a ladys favour  he was the heir of the rich and spirituelle miss crawley whose house had been open to so many of the french noblesse during the emigration  they received the colonels wife in their own hotelswhy wrote a great lady to miss crawley who had bought her lace and trinkets at the duchesss own price and given her many a dinner during the pinching times after the revolutionwhy does not our dear miss come to her nephew and niece and her attached friends in paris all the world raffoles of the charming mistress and her espiegle beauty yes we see in her the grace the charm the wit of our dear friend miss crawley the king took notice of her yesterday at the tuileries and we are all jealous of the attention which monsieur pays her  if you could have seen the spite of a certain stupid miladi bareacres whose eaglebeak and toque and feathers may be seen peering over the heads of all assemblies when madame the duchess of angouleme the august daughter and companion of kings desired especially to be presented to mrs crawley as your dear daughter and protegee and thanked her in the name of france for all your benevolence towards our unfortunates during their exile she is of all the societies of all the ballsof the ballsyesof the dances no and yet how interesting and pretty this fair creature looks surrounded by the homage of the men and so soon to be a mother  to hear her speak of you her protectress her mother would bring tears to the eyes of ogres  how she loves you how we all love our admirable our respectable miss crawley  it is to be feared that this letter of the parisian great lady did not by any means advance mrs beckys interest with her admirable her respectable relative  on the contrary the fury of the old spinster was beyond bounds when she found what was rebeccas situation and how audaciously she had made use of miss crawleys name to get an entree into parisian society  too much shaken in mind and body to compose a letter in the french language in reply to that of her correspondent she dictated to briggs a furious answer in her own native tongue repudiating mrs rawdon crawley altogether and warning the public to beware of her as a most artful and dangerous person  but as madame the duchess of xhad only been twenty years in england she did not understand a single word of the language and contented herself by informing mrs rawdon crawley at their next meeting that she had received a charming letter from that chere mees and that it was full of benevolent things for mrs crawley who began seriously to have hopes that the spinster would relent  meanwhile she was the gayest and most admired of englishwomen  and had a little european congress on her receptionnight  prussians and cossacks spanish and englishall the world was at paris during this famous winter  to have seen the stars and cordons in rebeccas humble saloon would have made all baker street pale with envy famous warriors rode by her carriage in the bois or crowded her modest little box at the opera rawdon was in the highest spirits there were no duns in paris as yet  there were parties every day at verys or beauvilliers play was plentiful and his luck good tufto perhaps was sulky  mrs tufto had come over to paris at her own invitation and besides this contretemps there were a score of generals now round beckys chair and she might take her choice of a dozen bouquets when she went to the play  lady bareacres and the chiefs of the english society stupid and irreproachable females writhed with anguish at the success of the little upstart becky whose poisoned jokes quivered and rankled in their chaste breasts but she had all the men on her side  she fought the women with indomitable courage and they could not talk scandal in any tongue but their own  so in fetes pleasures and prosperity the winter of 181516 passed away with mrs rawdon crawley who accommodated herself to polite life as if her ancestors had been people of fashion for centuries pastand who from her wit talent and energy indeed merited a place of honour in vanity fair  in the early spring of 1816 galignanis journal contained the following announcement in an interesting corner of the paper  on the 26th of marchthe lady of lieutenantcolonel crawley of the life guards greenof a son and heir  this event was copied into the london papers out of which miss briggs read the statement to miss crawley at breakfast at brighton  the intelligence expected as it might have been caused a crisis in the affairs of the crawley family  the spinsters rage rose to its height and sending instantly for pitt her nephew and for the lady southdown from brunswick square she requested an immediate celebration of the marriage which had been so long pending between the two families  and she announced that it was her intention to allow the young couple a thousand a year during her lifetime at the expiration of which the bulk of her property would be settled upon her nephew and her dear niece lady jane crawley waxy came down to ratify the deedslord southdown gave away his sistershe was married by a bishop and not by the rev bartholomew ironsto the disappointment of the irregular prelate  when they were married pitt would have liked to take a hymeneal tour with his bride as became people of their condition  but the affection of the old lady towards lady jane had grown so strong that she fairly owned she could not part with her favourite  pitt and his wife came therefore and lived with miss crawley and greatly to the annoyance of poor pitt who conceived himself a most injured characterbeing subject to the humours of his aunt on one side and of his motherinlaw on the other lady southdown from her neighbouring house reigned over the whole familypitt lady jane miss crawley briggs bowls firkin and all  she pitilessly dosed them with her tracts and her medicine she dismissed creamer she installed rodgers and soon stripped miss crawley of even the semblance of authority  the poor soul grew so timid that she actually left off bullying briggs any more and clung to her niece more fond and terrified every day  peace to thee kind and selfish vain and generous old heathenwe shall see thee no more  let us hope that lady jane supported her kindly and led her with gentle hand out of the busy struggle of vanity fair    chapter xxxv  widow and mother  the news of the great fights of quatre bras and waterloo reached england at the same time  the gazette first published the result of the two battles at which glorious intelligence all england thrilled with triumph and fear particulars then followed and after the announcement of the victories came the list of the wounded and the slain who can tell the dread with which that catalogue was opened and read  fancy at every village and homestead almost through the three kingdoms the great news coming of the battles in flanders and the feelings of exultation and gratitude bereavement and sickening dismay when the lists of the regimental losses were gone through and it became known whether the dear friend and relative had escaped or fallen  anybody who will take the trouble of looking back to a file of the newspapers of the time must even now feel at secondhand this breathless pause of expectation  the lists of casualties are carried on from day to day  you stop in the midst as in a story which is to be continued in our next  think what the feelings must have been as those papers followed each other fresh from the press and if such an interest could be felt in our country and about a battle where but twenty thousand of our people were engaged think of the condition of europe for twenty years before where people were fighting not by thousands but by millions each one of whom as he struck his enemy wounded horribly some other innocent heart far away  the news which that famous gazette brought to the osbornes gave a dreadful shock to the family and its chief the girls indulged unrestrained in their grief  the gloomstricken old father was still more borne down by his fate and sorrow  he strove to think that a judgment was on the boy for his disobedience  he dared not own that the severity of the sentence frightened him and that its fulfilment had come too soon upon his curses  sometimes a shuddering terror struck him as if he had been the author of the doom which he had called down on his son  there was a chance before of reconciliation the boys wife might have died or he might have come back and said father i have sinned  but there was no hope now  he stood on the other side of the gulf impassable haunting his parent with sad eyes he remembered them once before so in a fever when every one thought the lad was dying and he lay on his bed speechless and gazing with a dreadful gloom  good god how the father clung to the doctor then and with what a sickening anxiety he followed him  what a weight of grief was off his mind when after the crisis of the fever the lad recovered and looked at his father once more with eyes that recognised him but now there was no help or cure or chance of reconcilement above all there were no humble words to soothe vanity outraged and furious or bring to its natural flow the poisoned angry blood  and it is hard to say which pang it was that tore the proud fathers heart most keenlythat his son should have gone out of the reach of his forgiveness or that the apology which his own pride expected should have escaped him  whatever his sensations might have been however the stem old man would have no confidant  he never mentioned his sons name to his daughters but ordered the elder to place all the females of the establishment in mourning and desired that the male servants should be similarly attired in deep black  all parties and entertainments of course were to be put off  no communications were made to his future soninlaw whose marriageday had been fixed  but there was enough in mr osbornes appearance to prevent mr bullock from making any inquiries or in any way pressing forward that ceremony he and the ladies whispered about it under their voices in the drawingroom sometimes whither the father never came  he remained constantly in his own study the whole front part of the house being closed until some time after the completion of the general mourning  about three weeks after the 18th of june mr osbornes acquaintance sir william dobbin called at mr osbornes house in russell square with a very pale and agitated face and insisted upon seeing that gentleman ushered into his room and after a few words which neither the speaker nor the host understood the former produced from an inclosure a letter sealed with a large red seal my son major dobbin the alderman said with some hesitation despatched me a letter by an officer of the th who arrived in town today  my sons letter contains one for you osborne the alderman placed the letter on the table and osborne stared at him for a moment or two in silence his looks frightened the ambassador who after looking guiltily for a little time at the griefstricken man hurried away without another word  the letter was in georges wellknown bold handwriting it was that one which he had written before daybreak on the 16th of june and just before he took leave of amelia  the great red seal was emblazoned with the sham coat of arms which osborne had assumed from the peerage with pax in bello for a motto that of the ducal house with which the vain old man tried to fancy himself connected the hand that signed it would never hold pen or sword more  the very seal that sealed it had been robbed from georges dead body as it lay on the field of battle  the father knew nothing of this but sat and looked at the letter in terrified vacancy  he almost fell when he went to open it  have you ever had a difference with a dear friend how his letters written in the period of love and confidence sicken and rebuke you what a dreary mourning it is to dwell upon those vehement protests of dead affection  what lying epitaphs they make over the corpse of love what dark cruel comments upon life and vanities most of us have got or written drawers full of them they are closetskeletons which we keep and shun osborne trembled long before the letter from his dead son  the poor boys letter did not say much  he had been too proud to acknowledge the tenderness which his heart felt  he only said that on the eve of a great battle he wished to bid his father farewell and solemnly to implore his good offices for the wifeit might be for the childwhom he left behind him  he owned with contrition that his irregularities and his extravagance had already wasted a large part of his mothers little fortune  he thanked his father for his former generous conduct and he promised him that if he fell on the field or survived it he would act in a manner worthy of the name of george osborne  his english habit pride awkwardness perhaps had prevented him from saying more  his father could not see the kiss george had placed on the superscription of his letter  mr osborne dropped it with the bitterest deadliest pang of balked affection and revenge his son was still beloved and unforgiven  about two months afterwards however as the young ladies of the family went to church with their father they remarked how he took a different seat from that which he usually occupied when he chose to attend divine worship and that from his cushion opposite he looked up at the wall over their heads  this caused the young women likewise to gaze in the direction towards which their fathers gloomy eyes pointed  and they saw an elaborate monument upon the wall where britannia was represented weeping over an urn and a broken sword and a couchant lion indicated that the piece of sculpture had been erected in honour of a deceased warrior  the sculptors of those days had stocks of such funereal emblems in hand as you may see still on the walls of st pauls which are covered with hundreds of these braggart heathen allegories  there was a constant demand for them during the first fifteen years of the present century  under the memorial in question were emblazoned the wellknown and pompous osborne arms and the inscription said that the monument was sacred to the memory of george osborne junior esq late a captain in his majestys th regiment of foot who fell on the 18th of june 1815 aged 28 years while fighting for his king and country in the glorious victory of waterloo dulce et decorum est pro patria mori  the sight of that stone agitated the nerves of the sisters so much that miss maria was compelled to leave the church  the congregation made way respectfully for those sobbing girls clothed in deep black and pitied the stern old father seated opposite the memorial of the dead soldier  will he forgive mrs george the girls said to themselves as soon as their ebullition of grief was over much conversation passed too among the acquaintances of the osborne family who knew of the rupture between the son and father caused by the formers marriage as to the chance of a reconciliation with the young widow there were bets among the gentlemen both about russell square and in the city  if the sisters had any anxiety regarding the possible recognition of amelia as a daughter of the family it was increased presently and towards the end of the autumn by their fathers announcement that he was going abroad  he did not say whither but they knew at once that his steps would be turned towards belgium and were aware that georges widow was still in brussels  they had pretty accurate news indeed of poor amelia from lady dobbin and her daughters  our honest captain had been promoted in consequence of the death of the second major of the regiment on the field and the brave odowd who had distinguished himself greatly here as upon all occasions where he had a chance to show his coolness and valour was a colonel and companion of the bath  very many of the brave th who had suffered severely upon both days of action were still at brussels in the autumn recovering of their wounds  the city was a vast military hospital for months after the great battles and as men and officers began to rally from their hurts the gardens and places of public resort swarmed with maimed warriors old and young who just rescued out of death fell to gambling and gaiety and lovemaking as people of vanity fair will do  mr osborne found out some of the th easily  he knew their uniform quite well and had been used to follow all the promotions and exchanges in the regiment and loved to talk about it and its officers as if he had been one of the number  on the day after his arrival at brussels and as he issued from his hotel which faced the park he saw a soldier in the wellknown facings reposing on a stone bench in the garden and went and sate down trembling by the wounded convalescent man  were you in captain osbornes company he said and added after a pause he was my son sir  the man was not of the captains company but he lifted up his unwounded arm and touchedhis cap sadly and respectfully to the haggard brokenspirited gentleman who questioned him  the whole army didnt contain a finer or a better officer the soldier said the sergeant of the captains company captain raymond had it now was in town though and was just well of a shot in the shoulder his honour might see him if he liked who could tell him anything he wanted to know aboutabout the ths actions  but his honour had seen major dobbin no doubt the brave captains great friend and mrs osborne who was here too and had been very bad he heard everybody say  they say she was out of her mind like for six weeks or more  but your honour knows all about thatand asking your pardonthe man added  osborne put a guinea into the soldiers hand and told him he should have another if he would bring the sergeant to the hotel du parc a promise which very soon brought the desired officer to mr osbornes presence and the first soldier went away and after telling a comrade or two how captain osbornes father was arrived and what a freehanded generous gentleman he was they went and made good cheer with drink and feasting as long as the guineas lasted which had come from the proud purse of the mourning old father  in the sergeants company who was also just convalescent osborne made the journey of waterloo and quatre bras a journey which thousands of his countrymen were then taking  he took the sergeant with him in his carriage and went through both fields under his guidance  he saw the point of the road where the regiment marched into action on the 16th and the slope down which they drove the french cavalry who were pressing on the retreating belgians  there was the spot where the noble captain cut down the french officer who was grappling with the young ensign for the colours the coloursergeants having been shot down  along this road they retreated on the next day and here was the bank at which the regiment bivouacked under the rain of the night of the seventeenth  further on was the position which they took and held during the day forming time after time to receive the charge of the enemys horsemen and lying down under the shelter of the bank from the furious french cannonade and it was at this declivity when at evening the whole english line received the order to advance as the enemy fell back after his last charge that the captain hurraying and rushing down the hill waving his sword received a shot and fell dead  it was major dobbin who took back the captains body to brussels the sergeant said in a low voice and had him buried as your honour knows the peasants and relichunters about the place were screaming round the pair as the soldier told his story offering for sale all sorts of mementoes of the fight crosses and epaulets and shattered cuirasses and eagles  osborne gave a sumptuous reward to the sergeant when he parted with him after having visited the scenes of his sons last exploits his burialplace he had already seen  indeed he had driven thither immediately after his arrival at brussels  georges body lay in the pretty burialground of laeken near the city in which place having once visited it on a party of pleasure he had lightly expressed a wish to have his grave made  and there the young officer was laid by his friend in the unconsecrated corner of the garden separated by a little hedge from the temples and towers and plantations of flowers and shrubs under which the roman catholic dead repose  it seemed a humiliation to old osborne to think that his son an english gentleman a captain in the famous british army should not be found worthy to lie in ground where mere foreigners were buried  which of us is there can tell how much vanity lurks in our warmest regard for others and how selfish our love is old osborne did not speculate much upon the mingled nature of his feelings and how his instinct and selfishness were combating together  he firmly believed that everything he did was right that he ought on all occasions to have his own wayand like the sting of a wasp or serpent his hatred rushed out armed and poisonous against anything like opposition  he was proud of his hatred as of everything else  always to be right always to trample forward and never to doubt are not these the great qualities with which dullness takes the lead in the world  as after the drive to waterloo mr osbornes carriage was nearing the gates of the city at sunset they met another open barouche in which were a couple of ladies and a gentleman and by the side of which an officer was riding  osborne gave a start back and the sergeant seated with him cast a look of surprise at his neighbour as he touched his cap to the officer who mechanically returned his salute it was amelia with the lame young ensign by her side and opposite to her her faithful friend mrs odowd  it was amelia but how changed from the fresh and comely girl osborne knew  her face was white and thin  her pretty brown hair was parted under a widows capthe poor child  her eyes were fixed and looking nowhere  they stared blank in the face of osborne as the carriages crossed each other but she did not know him nor did he recognise her until looking up he saw dobbin riding by her  and then he knew who it was  he hated her  he did not know how much until he saw her there  when her carriage had passed on he turned and stared at the sergeant with a curse and defiance in his eye cast at his companion who could not help looking at himas much as to say how dare you look at me damn you  i do hate her  it is she who has tumbled my hopes and all my pride down tell the scoundrel to drive on quick he shouted with an oath to the lackey on the box a minute afterwards a horse came clattering over the pavement behind osbornes carriage and dobbin rode up  his thoughts had been elsewhere as the carriages passed each other and it was not until he had ridden some paces forward that he remembered it was osborne who had just passed him  then he turned to examine if the sight of her fatherinlaw had made any impression on amelia but the poor girl did not know who had passed  then william who daily used to accompany her in his drives taking out his watch made some excuse about an engagement which he suddenly recollected and so rode off  she did not remark that either  but sate looking before her over the homely landscape towards the woods in the distance by which george marched away  mr osborne mr osborne cried dobbin as he rode up and held out his hand  osborne made no motion to take it but shouted out once more and with another curse to his servant to drive on  dobbin laid his hand on the carriage side  i will see you sir he said  i have a message for you  from that woman said osborne fiercely  no replied the other from your son at which osborne fell back into the corner of his carriage and dobbin allowing it to pass on rode close behind it and so through the town until they reached mr osbornes hotel and without a word  there he followed osborne up to his apartments  george had often been in the rooms they were the lodgings which the crawleys had occupied during their stay in brussels  pray have you any commands for me captain dobbin or i beg your pardon i should say major dobbin since better men than you are dead and you step into their shoes said mr osborne in that sarcastic tone which he sometimes was pleased to assume  better men are dead dobbin replied  i want to speak to you about one  make it short sir said the other with an oath scowling at his visitor  i am here as his closest friend the major resumed and the executor of his will  he made it before he went into action  are you aware how small his means are and of the straitened circumstances of his widow  i dont know his widow sir osborne said  let her go back to her father but the gentleman whom he addressed was determined to remain in good temper and went on without heeding the interruption  do you know sir mrs osbornes condition her life and her reason almost have been shaken by the blow which has fallen on her  it is very doubtful whether she will rally  there is a chance left for her however and it is about this i came to speak to you  she will be a mother soon  will you visit the parents offence upon the childs head or will you forgive the child for poor georges sake  osborne broke out into a rhapsody of selfpraise and imprecationsby the first excusing himself to his own conscience for his conduct by the second exaggerating the undutifulness of george no father in all england could have behaved more generously to a son who had rebelled against him wickedly  he had died without even so much as confessing he was wrong  let him take the consequences of his undutifulness and folly  as for himself mr osborne he was a man of his word  he had sworn never to speak to that woman or to recognize her as his sons wife  and thats what you may tell her he concluded with an oath and thats what i will stick to to the last day of my life  there was no hope from that quarter then  the widow must live on her slender pittance or on such aid as jos could give her  i might tell her and she would not heed it thought dobbin sadly for the poor girls thoughts were not here at all since her catastrophe and stupefied under the pressure of her sorrow good and evil were alike indifferent to her  so indeed were even friendship and kindness  she received them both uncomplainingly and having accepted them relapsed into her grief  suppose some twelve months after the above conversation took place to have passed in the life of our poor amelia  she has spent the first portion of that time in a sorrow so profound and pitiable that we who have been watching and describing some of the emotions of that weak and tender heart must draw back in the presence of the cruel grief under which it is bleeding  tread silently round the hapless couch of the poor prostrate soul shut gently the door of the dark chamber wherein she suffers as those kind people did who nursed her through the first months of her pain and never left her until heaven had sent her consolation  a day cameof almost terrified delight and wonderwhen the poor widowed girl pressed a child upon her breasta child with the eyes of george who was gonea little boy as beautiful as a cherub  what a miracle it was to hear its first cry  how she laughed and wept over ithow love and hope and prayer woke again in her bosom as the baby nestled there  she was safe  the doctors who attended her and had feared for her life or for her brain had waited anxiously for this crisis before they could pronounce that either was secure  it was worth the long months of doubt and dread which the persons who had constantly been with her had passed to see her eyes once more beaming tenderly upon them  our friend dobbin was one of them  it was he who brought her back to england and to her mothers house when mrs odowd receiving a peremptory summons from her colonel had been forced to quit her patient to see dobbin holding the infant and to hear amelias laugh of triumph as she watched him would have done any man good who had a sense of humour  william was the godfather of the child and exerted his ingenuity in the purchase of cups spoons papboats and corals for this little christian  how his mother nursed him and dressed him and lived upon him how she drove away all nurses and would scarce allow any hand but her own to touch him how she considered that the greatest favour she could confer upon his godfather major dobbin was to allow the major occasionally to dandle him need not be told here  this child was her being  her existence was a maternal caress  she enveloped the feeble and unconscious creature with love and worship  it was her life which the baby drank in from her bosom  of nights and when alone she had stealthy and intense raptures of motherly love such as gods marvellous care has awarded to the female instinctjoys how far higher and lower than reasonblind beautiful devotions which only womens hearts know  it was william dobbins task to muse upon these movements of amelias and to watch her heart and if his love made him divine almost all the feelings which agitated it alas he could see with a fatal perspicuity that there was no place there for him  and so gently he bore his fate knowing it and content to bear it  i suppose amelias father and mother saw through the intentions of the major and were not illdisposed to encourage him for dobbin visited their house daily and stayed for hours with them or with amelia or with the honest landlord mr clapp and his family  he brought on one pretext or another presents to everybody and almost every day and went with the landlords little girl who was rather a favourite with amelia by the name of major sugarplums  it was this little child who commonly acted as mistress of the ceremonies to introduce him to mrs osborne  she laughed one day when major sugarplums cab drove up to fulham and he descended from it bringing out a wooden horse a drum a trumpet and other warlike toys for little georgy who was scarcely six months old and for whom the articles in question were entirely premature  the child was asleep  hush said amelia annoyed perhaps at the creaking of the majors boots and she held out her hand smiling because william could not take it until he had rid himself of his cargo of toys  go downstairs little mary said he presently to the child i want to speak to mrs osborne she looked up rather astonished and laid down the infant on its bed  i am come to say goodbye amelia said he taking her slender little white hand gently  goodbye and where are you going she said with a smile  send the letters to the agents he said they will forward them for you will write to me wont you i shall be away a long time  ill write to you about georgy she said  dear william how good you have been to him and to me  look at him  isnt he like an angel  the little pink hands of the child closed mechanically round the honest soldiers finger and amelia looked up in his face with bright maternal pleasure  the cruellest looks could not have wounded him more than that glance of hopeless kindness  he bent over the child and mother he could not speak for a moment  and it was only with all his strength that he could force himself to say a god bless you  god bless you said amelia and held up her face and kissed him  hush  dont wake georgy she added as william dobbin went to the door with heavy steps  she did not hear the noise of his cabwheels as he drove away  she was looking at the child who was laughing in his sleep    chapter xxxvi  how to live well on nothing a year  i suppose there is no man in this vanity fair of ours so little observant as not to think sometimes about the worldly affairs of his acquaintances or so extremely charitable as not to wonder how his neighbour jones or his neighbour smith can make both ends meet at the end of the year  with the utmost regard for the family for instance for i dine with them twice or thrice in the season i cannot but own that the appearance of the jenkinses in the park in the large barouche with the grenadierfootmen will surprise and mystify me to my dying day  for though i know the equipage is only jobbed and all the jenkins people are on board wages yet those three men and the carriage must represent an expense of six hundred a year at the very leastand then there are the splendid dinners the two boys at eton the prize governess and masters for the girls the trip abroad or to eastbourne or worthing in the autumn the annual ball with a supper from gunters who by the way supplies most of the firstrate dinners which j gives as i know very well having been invited to one of them to fill a vacant place when i saw at once that these repasts are very superior to the common run of entertainments for which the humbler sort of js acquaintances get cardswho i say with the most goodnatured feelings in the world can help wondering how the jenkinses make out matters what is jenkins we all knowcommissioner of the tape and sealing wax office with 1200 pounds a year for a salary  had his wife a private fortune poohmiss flintone of eleven children of a small squire in buckinghamshire  all she ever gets from her family is a turkey at christmas in exchange for which she has to board two or three of her sisters in the off season and lodge and feed her brothers when they come to town  how does jenkins balance his income i say as every friend of his must say how is it that he has not been outlawed long since and that he ever came back as he did to the surprise of everybody last year from boulogne  i is here introduced to personify the world in generalthe mrs grundy of each respected readers private circleevery one of whom can point to some families of his acquaintance who live nobody knows how many a glass of wine have we all of us drunk i have very little doubt hobandnobbing with the hospitable giver and wondering how the deuce he paid for it  some three or four years after his stay in paris when rawdon crawley and his wife were established in a very small comfortable house in curzon street may fair there was scarcely one of the numerous friends whom they entertained at dinner that did not ask the above question regarding them  the novelist it has been said before knows everything and as i am in a situation to be able to tell the public how crawley and his wife lived without any income may i entreat the public newspapers which are in the habit of extracting portions of the various periodical works now published not to reprint the following exact narrative and calculationsof which i ought as the discoverer and at some expense too to have the benefit my son i would say were i blessed with a childyou may by deep inquiry and constant intercourse with him learn how a man lives comfortably on nothing a year  but it is best not to be intimate with gentlemen of this profession and to take the calculations at second hand as you do logarithms for to work them yourself depend upon it will cost you something considerable  on nothing per annum then and during a course of some two or three years of which we can afford to give but a very brief history crawley and his wife lived very happily and comfortably at paris it was in this period that he quitted the guards and sold out of the army  when we find him again his mustachios and the title of colonel on his card are the only relics of his military profession  it has been mentioned that rebecca soon after her arrival in paris took a very smart and leading position in the society of that capital and was welcomed at some of the most distinguished houses of the restored french nobility  the english men of fashion in paris courted her too to the disgust of the ladies their wives who could not bear the parvenue  for some months the salons of the faubourg st  germain in which her place was secured and the splendours of the new court where she was received with much distinction delighted and perhaps a little intoxicated mrs crawley who may have been disposed during this period of elation to slight the peoplehonest young military men mostlywho formed her husbands chief society  but the colonel yawned sadly among the duchesses and great ladies of the court  the old women who played ecarte made such a noise about a fivefranc piece that it was not worth colonel crawleys while to sit down at a cardtable  the wit of their conversation he could not appreciate being ignorant of their language and what good could his wife get he urged by making curtsies every night to a whole circle of princesses he left rebecca presently to frequent these parties alone resuming his own simple pursuits and amusements amongst the amiable friends of his own choice  the truth is when we say of a gentleman that he lives elegantly on nothing a year we use the word nothing to signify something unknown meaning simply that we dont know how the gentleman in question defrays the expenses of his establishment  now our friend the colonel had a great aptitude for all games of chance and exercising himself as he continually did with the cards the dicebox or the cue it is natural to suppose that he attained a much greater skill in the use of these articles than men can possess who only occasionally handle them to use a cue at billiards well is like using a pencil or a german flute or a smallswordyou cannot master any one of these implements at first and it is only by repeated study and perseverance joined to a natural taste that a man can excel in the handling of either now crawley from being only a brilliant amateur had grown to be a consummate master of billiards  like a great general his genius used to rise with the danger and when the luck had been unfavourable to him for a whole game and the bets were consequently against him he would with consummate skill and boldness make some prodigious hits which would restore the battle and come in a victor at the end to the astonishment of everybodyof everybody that is who was a stranger to his play  those who were accustomed to see it were cautious how they staked their money against a man of such sudden resources and brilliant and overpowering skill  at games of cards he was equally skilful for though he would constantly lose money at the commencement of an evening playing so carelessly and making such blunders that newcomers were often inclined to think meanly of his talent yet when roused to action and awakened to caution by repeated small losses it was remarked that crawleys play became quite different and that he was pretty sure of beating his enemy thoroughly before the night was over indeed very few men could say that they ever had the better of him his successes were so repeated that no wonder the envious and the vanquished spoke sometimes with bitterness regarding them  and as the french say of the duke of wellington who never suffered a defeat that only an astonishing series of lucky accidents enabled him to be an invariable winner yet even they allow that he cheated at waterloo and was enabled to win the last great trick  so it was hinted at headquarters in england that some foul play must have taken place in order to account for the continuous successes of colonel crawley  though frascatis and the salon were open at that time in paris the mania for play was so widely spread that the public gamblingrooms did not suffice for the general ardour and gambling went on in private houses as much as if there had been no public means for gratifying the passion  at crawleys charming little reunions of an evening this fatal amusement commonly was practisedmuch to goodnatured little mrs crawleys annoyance she spoke about her husbands passion for dice with the deepest grief she bewailed it to everybody who came to her house  she besought the young fellows never never to touch a box and when young green of the rifles lost a very considerable sum of money rebecca passed a whole night in tears as the servant told the unfortunate young gentleman and actually went on her knees to her husband to beseech him to remit the debt and burn the acknowledgement how could he he had lost just as much himself to blackstone of the hussars and count punter of the hanoverian cavalry  green might have any decent time but payof course he must pay to talk of burning ious was childs play  other officers chiefly youngfor the young fellows gathered round mrs crawleycame from her parties with long faces having dropped more or less money at her fatal cardtables  her house began to have an unfortunate reputation  the old hands warned the less experienced of their danger  colonel odowd of the th regiment one of those occupying in paris warned lieutenant spooney of that corps  a loud and violent fracas took place between the infantry colonel and his lady who were dining at the cafe de paris and colonel and mrs crawley who were also taking their meal there the ladies engaged on both sides  mrs odowd snapped her fingers in mrs crawleys face and called her husband no betther than a blackleg colonel crawley challenged colonel odowd cb  the commanderinchief hearing of the dispute sent for colonel crawley who was getting ready the same pistols which he shot captain marker and had such a conversation with him that no duel took place  if rebecca had not gone on her knees to general tufto crawley would have been sent back to england and he did not play except with civilians for some weeks after  but in spite of rawdons undoubted skill and constant successes it became evident to rebecca considering these things that their position was but a precarious one and that even although they paid scarcely anybody their little capital would end one day by dwindling into zero  gambling she would say dear is good to help your income but not as an income itself  some day people may be tired of play and then where are we rawdon acquiesced in the justice of her opinion and in truth he had remarked that after a few nights of his little suppers c gentlemen were tired of play with him and in spite of rebeccas charms did not present themselves very eagerly  easy and pleasant as their life at paris was it was after all only an idle dalliance and amiable trifling and rebecca saw that she must push rawdons fortune in their own country  she must get him a place or appointment at home or in the colonies and she determined to make a move upon england as soon as the way could be cleared for her  as a first step she had made crawley sell out of the guards and go on halfpay  his function as aidedecamp to general tufto had ceased previously rebecca laughed in all companies at that officer at his toupee which he mounted on coming to paris at his waistband at his false teeth at his pretensions to be a ladykiller above all and his absurd vanity in fancying every woman whom he came near was in love with him  it was to mrs brent the beetlebrowed wife of mr commissary brent to whom the general transferred his attentions nowhis bouquets his dinners at the restaurateurs his operaboxes and his knickknacks  poor mrs tufto was no more happy than before and had still to pass long evenings alone with her daughters knowing that her general was gone off scented and curled to stand behind mrs brents chair at the play  becky had a dozen admirers in his place to be sure and could cut her rival to pieces with her wit  but as we have said she was growing tired of this idle social life operaboxes and restaurateur dinners palled upon her  nosegays could not be laid by as a provision for future years  and she could not live upon knickknacks laced handkerchiefs and kid gloves  she felt the frivolity of pleasure and longed for more substantial benefits  at this juncture news arrived which was spread among the many creditors of the colonel at paris and which caused them great satisfaction miss crawley the rich aunt from whom he expected his immense inheritance was dying the colonel must haste to her bedside  mrs crawley and her child would remain behind until he came to reclaim them  he departed for calais and having reached that place in safety it might have been supposed that he went to dover but instead he took the diligence to dunkirk and thence travelled to brussels for which place he had a former predilection the fact is he owed more money at london than at paris and he preferred the quiet little belgian city to either of the more noisy capitals  her aunt was dead  mrs crawley ordered the most intense mourning for herself and little rawdon  the colonel was busy arranging the affairs of the inheritance  they could take the premier now instead of the little entresol of the hotel which they occupied mrs crawley and the landlord had a consultation about the new hangings an amicable wrangle about the carpets and a final adjustment of everything except the bill  she went off in one of his carriages her french bonne with her the child by her side the admirable landlord and landlady smiling farewell to her from the gate  general tufto was furious when he heard she was gone and mrs brent furious with him for being furious lieutenant spooney was cut to the heart and the landlord got ready his best apartments previous to the return of the fascinating little woman and her husband  he serred the trunks which she left in his charge with the greatest care  they had been especially recommended to him by madame crawley  they were not however found to be particularly valuable when opened some time after  but before she went to join her husband in the belgic capital mrs crawley made an expedition into england leaving behind her her little son upon the continent under the care of her french maid  the parting between rebecca and the little rawdon did not cause either party much pain  she had not to say truth seen much of the young gentleman since his birth after the amiable fashion of french mothers she had placed him out at nurse in a village in the neighbourhood of paris where little rawdon passed the first months of his life not unhappily with a numerous family of fosterbrothers in wooden shoes his father would ride over many a time to see him here and the elder rawdons paternal heart glowed to see him rosy and dirty shouting lustily and happy in the making of mudpies under the superintendence of the gardeners wife his nurse  rebecca did not care much to go and see the son and heir  once he spoiled a new dovecoloured pelisse of hers  he preferred his nurses caresses to his mammas and when finally he quitted that jolly nurse and almost parent he cried loudly for hours  he was only consoled by his mothers promise that he should return to his nurse the next day indeed the nurse herself who probably would have been pained at the parting too was told that the child would immediately be restored to her and for some time awaited quite anxiously his return  in fact our friends may be said to have been among the first of that brood of hardy english adventurers who have subsequently invaded the continent and swindled in all the capitals of europe the respect in those happy days of 181718 was very great for the wealth and honour of britons  they had not then learned as i am told to haggle for bargains with the pertinacity which now distinguishes them  the great cities of europe had not been as yet open to the enterprise of our rascals and whereas there is now hardly a town of france or italy in which you shall not see some noble countryman of our own with that happy swagger and insolence of demeanour which we carry everywhere swindling innlandlords passing fictitious cheques upon credulous bankers robbing coachmakers of their carriages goldsmiths of their trinkets easy travellers of their money at cards even public libraries of their booksthirty years ago you needed but to be a milor anglais travelling in a private carriage and credit was at your hand wherever you chose to seek it and gentlemen instead of cheating were cheated  it was not for some weeks after the crawleys departure that the landlord of the hotel which they occupied during their residence at paris found out the losses which he had sustained  not until madame marabou the milliner made repeated visits with her little bill for articles supplied to madame crawley not until monsieur didelot from boule dor in the palais royal had asked half a dozen times whether cette charmante miladi who had bought watches and bracelets of him was de retour it is a fact that even the poor gardeners wife who had nursed madames child was never paid after the first six months for that supply of the milk of human kindness with which she had furnished the lusty and healthy little rawdon  no not even the nurse was paidthe crawleys were in too great a hurry to remember their trifling debt to her  as for the landlord of the hotel his curses against the english nation were violent for the rest of his natural life  he asked all travellers whether they knew a certain colonel lor crawleyavec sa femme une petite dame tres spirituelle  ah monsieur he would addils mont affreusement vole it was melancholy to hear his accents as he spoke of that catastrophe  rebeccas object in her journey to london was to effect a kind of compromise with her husbands numerous creditors and by offering them a dividend of ninepence or a shilling in the pound to secure a return for him into his own country  it does not become us to trace the steps which she took in the conduct of this most difficult negotiation but having shown them to their satisfaction that the sum which she was empowered to offer was all her husbands available capital and having convinced them that colonel crawley would prefer a perpetual retirement on the continent to a residence in this country with his debts unsettled having proved to them that there was no possibility of money accruing to him from other quarters and no earthly chance of their getting a larger dividend than that which she was empowered to offer she brought the colonels creditors unanimously to accept her proposals and purchased with fifteen hundred pounds of ready money more than ten times that amount of debts  mrs crawley employed no lawyer in the transaction the matter was so simple to have or to leave as she justly observed that she made the lawyers of the creditors themselves do the business  and mr lewis representing mr davids of red lion square and mr moss acting for mr manasseh of cursitor street chief creditors of the colonels complimented his lady upon the brilliant way in which she did business and declared that there was no professional man who could beat her  rebecca received their congratulations with perfect modesty ordered a bottle of sherry and a bread cake to the little dingy lodgings where she dwelt while conducting the business to treat the enemys lawyers shook hands with them at parting in excellent good humour and returned straightway to the continent to rejoin her husband and son and acquaint the former with the glad news of his entire liberation as for the latter he had been considerably neglected during his mothers absence by mademoiselle genevieve her french maid for that young woman contracting an attachment for a soldier in the garrison of calais forgot her charge in the society of this militaire and little rawdon very narrowly escaped drowning on calais sands at this period where the absent genevieve had left and lost him  and so colonel and mrs crawley came to london and it is at their house in curzon street may fair that they really showed the skill which must be possessed by those who would live on the resources above named    chapter xxxvii  the subject continued  in the first place and as a matter of the greatest necessity we are bound to describe how a house may be got for nothing a year these mansions are to be had either unfurnished where if you have credit with messrs  gillows or bantings you can get them splendidly montees and decorated entirely according to your own fancy or they are to be let furnished a less troublesome and complicated arrangement to most parties  it was so that crawley and his wife preferred to hire their house  before mr bowls came to preside over miss crawleys house and cellar in park lane that lady had had for a butler a mr raggles who was born on the family estate of queens crawley and indeed was a younger son of a gardener there  by good conduct a handsome person and calves and a grave demeanour raggles rose from the knifeboard to the footboard of the carriage from the footboard to the butlers pantry when he had been a certain number of years at the head of miss crawleys establishment where he had had good wages fat perquisites and plenty of opportunities of saving he announced that he was about to contract a matrimonial alliance with a late cook of miss crawleys who had subsisted in an honourable manner by the exercise of a mangle and the keeping of a small greengrocers shop in the neighbourhood the truth is that the ceremony had been clandestinely performed some years back although the news of mr raggles marriage was first brought to miss crawley by a little boy and girl of seven and eight years of age whose continual presence in the kitchen had attracted the attention of miss briggs  mr raggles then retired and personally undertook the superintendence of the small shop and the greens  he added milk and cream eggs and countryfed pork to his stores contenting himself whilst other retired butlers were vending spirits in public houses by dealing in the simplest country produce  and having a good connection amongst the butlers in the neighbourhood and a snug back parlour where he and mrs raggles received them his milk cream and eggs got to be adopted by many of the fraternity and his profits increased every year  year after year he quietly and modestly amassed money and when at length that snug and complete bachelors residence at no 201 curzon street may fair lately the residence of the honourable frederick deuceace gone abroad with its rich and appropriate furniture by the first makers was brought to the hammer who should go in and purchase the lease and furniture of the house but charles raggles a part of the money he borrowed it is true and at rather a high interest from a brother butler but the chief part he paid down and it was with no small pride that mrs raggles found herself sleeping in a bed of carved mahogany with silk curtains with a prodigious cheval glass opposite to her and a wardrobe which would contain her and raggles and all the family  of course they did not intend to occupy permanently an apartment so splendid  it was in order to let the house again that raggles purchased it  as soon as a tenant was found he subsided into the greengrocers shop once more but a happy thing it was for him to walk out of that tenement and into curzon street and there survey his househis own housewith geraniums in the window and a carved bronze knocker  the footman occasionally lounging at the area railing treated him with respect the cook took her green stuff at his house and called him mr landlord and there was not one thing the tenants did or one dish which they had for dinner that raggles might not know of if he liked  he was a good man good and happy  the house brought him in so handsome a yearly income that he was determined to send his children to good schools and accordingly regardless of expense charles was sent to boarding at dr swishtails sugarcane lodge and little matilda to miss peckovers laurentinum house clapham  raggles loved and adored the crawley family as the author of all his prosperity in life  he had a silhouette of his mistress in his back shop and a drawing of the porters lodge at queens crawley done by that spinster herself in india inkand the only addition he made to the decorations of the curzon street house was a print of queens crawley in hampshire the seat of sir walpole crawley baronet who was represented in a gilded car drawn by six white horses and passing by a lake covered with swans and barges containing ladies in hoops and musicians with flags and penwigs  indeed raggles thought there was no such palace in all the world and no such august family  as luck would have it raggles house in curzon street was to let when rawdon and his wife returned to london the colonel knew it and its owner quite well the latters connection with the crawley family had been kept up constantly for raggles helped mr bowls whenever miss crawley received friends  and the old man not only let his house to the colonel but officiated as his butler whenever he had company mrs raggles operating in the kitchen below and sending up dinners of which old miss crawley herself might have approved  this was the way then crawley got his house for nothing for though raggles had to pay taxes and rates and the interest of the mortgage to the brother butler and the insurance of his life and the charges for his children at school and the value of the meat and drink which his own familyand for a time that of colonel crawley tooconsumed and though the poor wretch was utterly ruined by the transaction his children being flung on the streets and himself driven into the fleet prison  yet somebody must pay even for gentlemen who live for nothing a yearand so it was this unlucky raggles was made the representative of colonel crawleys defective capital  i wonder how many families are driven to roguery and to ruin by great practitioners in crawlers wayhow many great noblemen rob their petty tradesmen condescend to swindle their poor retainers out of wretched little sums and cheat for a few shillings when we read that a noble nobleman has left for the continent or that another noble nobleman has an execution in his houseand that one or other owes six or seven millions the defeat seems glorious even and we respect the victim in the vastness of his ruin  but who pities a poor barber who cant get his money for powdering the footmens heads or a poor carpenter who has ruined himself by fixing up ornaments and pavilions for my ladys dejeuner or the poor devil of a tailor whom the steward patronizes and who has pledged all he is worth and more to get the liveries ready which my lord has done him the honour to bespeak when the great house tumbles down these miserable wretches fall under it unnoticed as they say in the old legends before a man goes to the devil himself he sends plenty of other souls thither  rawdon and his wife generously gave their patronage to all such of miss crawleys tradesmen and purveyors as chose to serve them  some were willing enough especially the poor ones  it was wonderful to see the pertinacity with which the washerwoman from tooting brought the cart every saturday and her bills week after week mr raggles himself had to supply the greengroceries  the bill for servants porter at the fortune of war public house is a curiosity in the chronicles of beer every servant also was owed the greater part of his wages and thus kept up perforce an interest in the house nobody in fact was paid not the blacksmith who opened the lock nor the glazier who mended the pane nor the jobber who let the carriage nor the groom who drove it nor the butcher who provided the leg of mutton nor the coals which roasted it nor the cook who basted it nor the servants who ate it and this i am given to understand is not unfrequently the way in which people live elegantly on nothing a year  in a little town such things cannot be done without remark  we know there the quantity of milk our neighbour takes and espy the joint or the fowls which are going in for his dinner  so probably 200 and 202 in curzon street might know what was going on in the house between them the servants communicating through the arearailings but crawley and his wife and his friends did not know 200 and 202 when you came to 201 there was a hearty welcome a kind smile a good dinner and a jolly shake of the hand from the host and hostess there just for all the world as if they had been undisputed masters of three or four thousand a yearand so they were not in money but in produce and labourif they did not pay for the mutton they had it  if they did not give bullion in exchange for their wine how should we know never was better claret at any mans table than at honest rawdons dinners more gay and neatly served   his drawingrooms were the prettiest little modest salons conceivable they were decorated with the greatest taste and a thousand knickknacks from paris by rebecca and when she sat at her piano trilling songs with a lightsome heart the stranger voted himself in a little paradise of domestic comfort and agreed that if the husband was rather stupid the wife was charming and the dinners the pleasantest in the world  rebeccas wit cleverness and flippancy made her speedily the vogue in london among a certain class  you saw demure chariots at her door out of which stepped very great people  you beheld her carriage in the park surrounded by dandies of note  the little box in the third tier of the opera was crowded with heads constantly changing but it must be confessed that the ladies held aloof from her and that their doors were shut to our little adventurer  with regard to the world of female fashion and its customs the present writer of course can only speak at second hand  a man can no more penetrate or understand those mysteries than he can know what the ladies talk about when they go upstairs after dinner  it is only by inquiry and perseverance that one sometimes gets hints of those secrets and by a similar diligence every person who treads the pall mall pavement and frequents the clubs of this metropolis knows either through his own experience or through some acquaintance with whom he plays at billiards or shares the joint something about the genteel world of london and how as there are men such as rawdon crawley whose position we mentioned before who cut a good figure to the eyes of the ignorant world and to the apprentices in the park who behold them consorting with the most notorious dandies there so there are ladies who may be called mens women being welcomed entirely by all the gentlemen and cut or slighted by all their wives  mrs firebrace is of this sort the lady with the beautiful fair ringlets whom you see every day in hyde park surrounded by the greatest and most famous dandies of this empire  mrs rockwood is another whose parties are announced laboriously in the fashionable newspapers and with whom you see that all sorts of ambassadors and great noblemen dine and many more might be mentioned had they to do with the history at present in hand  but while simple folks who are out of the world or country people with a taste for the genteel behold these ladies in their seeming glory in public places or envy them from afar off persons who are better instructed could inform them that these envied ladies have no more chance of establishing themselves in society than the benighted squires wife in somersetshire who reads of their doings in the morning post men living about london are aware of these awful truths you hear how pitilessly many ladies of seeming rank and wealth are excluded from this society the frantic efforts which they make to enter this circle the meannesses to which they submit the insults which they undergo are matters of wonder to those who take human or womankind for a study and the pursuit of fashion under difficulties would be a fine theme for any very great person who had the wit the leisure and the knowledge of the english language necessary for the compiling of such a history  now the few female acquaintances whom mrs crawley had known abroad not only declined to visit her when she came to this side of the channel but cut her severely when they met in public places  it was curious to see how the great ladies forgot her and no doubt not altogether a pleasant study to rebecca  when lady bareacres met her in the waitingroom at the opera she gathered her daughters about her as if they would be contaminated by a touch of becky and retreating a step or two placed herself in front of them and stared at her little enemy to stare becky out of countenance required a severer glance than even the frigid old bareacres could shoot out of her dismal eyes  when lady de la mole who had ridden a score of times by beckys side at brussels met mrs crawleys open carriage in hyde park her ladyship was quite blind and could not in the least recognize her former friend  even mrs blenkinsop the bankers wife cut her at church becky went regularly to church now it was edifying to see her enter there with rawdon by her side carrying a couple of large gilt prayerbooks and afterwards going through the ceremony with the gravest resignation  rawdon at first felt very acutely the slights which were passed upon his wife and was inclined to be gloomy and savage  he talked of calling out the husbands or brothers of every one of the insolent women who did not pay a proper respect to his wife and it was only by the strongest commands and entreaties on her part that he was brought into keeping a decent behaviour  you cant shoot me into society she said goodnaturedly  remember my dear that i was but a governess and you you poor silly old man have the worst reputation for debt and dice and all sorts of wickedness  we shall get quite as many friends as we want by and by and in the meanwhile you must be a good boy and obey your schoolmistress in everything she tells you to do when we heard that your aunt had left almost everything to pitt and his wife do you remember what a rage you were in you would have told all paris if i had not made you keep your temper and where would you have been nowin prison at ste  pelagie for debt and not established in london in a handsome house with every comfort about youyou were in such a fury you were ready to murder your brother you wicked cain you and what good would have come of remaining angry all the rage in the world wont get us your aunts money and it is much better that we should be friends with your brothers family than enemies as those foolish butes are  when your father dies queens crawley will be a pleasant house for you and me to pass the winter in  if we are ruined you can carve and take charge of the stable and i can be a governess to lady janes children  ruined fiddlededee  i will get you a good place before that or pitt and his little boy will die and we will be sir rawdon and my lady  while there is life there is hope my dear and i intend to make a man of you yet  who sold your horses for you who paid your debts for you rawdon was obliged to confess that he owed all these benefits to his wife and to trust himself to her guidance for the future  indeed when miss crawley quitted the world and that money for which all her relatives had been fighting so eagerly was finally left to pitt bute crawley who found that only five thousand pounds had been left to him instead of the twenty upon which he calculated was in such a fury at his disappointment that he vented it in savage abuse upon his nephew and the quarrel always rankling between them ended in an utter breach of intercourse  rawdon crawleys conduct on the other hand who got but a hundred pounds was such as to astonish his brother and delight his sisterinlaw who was disposed to look kindly upon all the members of her husbands family  he wrote to his brother a very frank manly goodhumoured letter from paris  he was aware he said that by his own marriage he had forfeited his aunts favour and though he did not disguise his disappointment that she should have been so entirely relentless towards him he was glad that the money was still kept in their branch of the family and heartily congratulated his brother on his good fortune  he sent his affectionate remembrances to his sister and hoped to have her goodwill for mrs rawdon and the letter concluded with a postscript to pitt in the latter ladys own handwriting  she too begged to join in her husbands congratulations  she should ever remember mr crawleys kindness to her in early days when she was a friendless orphan the instructress of his little sisters in whose welfare she still took the tenderest interest  she wished him every happiness in his married life and asking his permission to offer her remembrances to lady jane of whose goodness all the world informed her she hoped that one day she might be allowed to present her little boy to his uncle and aunt and begged to bespeak for him their goodwill and protection  pitt crawley received this communication very graciouslymore graciously than miss crawley had received some of rebeccas previous compositions in rawdons handwriting and as for lady jane she was so charmed with the letter that she expected her husband would instantly divide his aunts legacy into two equal portions and send off onehalf to his brother at paris  to her ladyships surprise however pitt declined to accommodate his brother with a cheque for thirty thousand pounds  but he made rawdon a handsome offer of his hand whenever the latter should come to england and choose to take it and thanking mrs crawley for her good opinion of himself and lady jane he graciously pronounced his willingness to take any opportunity to serve her little boy  thus an almost reconciliation was brought about between the brothers when rebecca came to town pitt and his wife were not in london  many a time she drove by the old door in park lane to see whether they had taken possession of miss crawleys house there but the new family did not make its appearance it was only through raggles that she heard of their movementshow miss crawleys domestics had been dismissed with decent gratuities and how mr pitt had only once made his appearance in london when he stopped for a few days at the house did business with his lawyers there and sold off all miss crawleys french novels to a bookseller out of bond street  becky had reasons of her own which caused her to long for the arrival of her new relation when lady jane comes thought she she shall be my sponsor in london society and as for the women bah the women will ask me when they find the men want to see me  an article as necessary to a lady in this position as her brougham or her bouquet is her companion  i have always admired the way in which the tender creatures who cannot exist without sympathy hire an exceedingly plain friend of their own sex from whom they are almost inseparable  the sight of that inevitable woman in her faded gown seated behind her dear friend in the operabox or occupying the back seat of the barouche is always a wholesome and moral one to me as jolly a reminder as that of the deathshead which figured in the repasts of egyptian bonvivants a strange sardonic memorial of vanity fair  what even battered brazen beautiful conscienceless heartless mrs firebrace whose father died of her shame  even lovely daring mrs mantrap who will ride at any fence which any man in england will take and who drives her greys in the park while her mother keeps a hucksters stall in bath stilleven those who are so bold one might fancy they could face anything dare not face the world without a female friend  they must have somebody to cling to the affectionate creatures  and you will hardly see them in any public place without a shabby companion in a dyed silk sitting somewhere in the shade close behind them  rawdon said becky very late one night as a party of gentlemen were seated round her crackling drawingroom fire for the men came to her house to finish the night and she had ice and coffee for them the best in london  i must have a sheepdog  a what said rawdon looking up from an ecarte table  a sheepdog said young lord southdown  my dear mrs crawley what a fancy  why not have a danish dog i know of one as big as a camelleopard by jove it would almost pull your brougham  or a persian greyhound eh i propose if you please or a little pug that would go into one of lord steynes snuffboxes theres a man at bayswater got one with such a nose that you mighti mark the king and playthat you might hang your hat on it  i mark the trick rawdon gravely said  he attended to his game commonly and didnt much meddle with the conversation except when it was about horses and betting  what can you want with a shepherds dog the lively little southdown continued  i mean a moral shepherds dog said becky laughing and looking up at lord steyne  what the devils that said his lordship  a dog to keep the wolves off me rebecca continued a companion  dear little innocent lamb you want one said the marquis and his jaw thrust out and he began to grin hideously his little eyes leering towards rebecca  the great lord of steyne was standing by the fire sipping coffee the fire crackled and blazed pleasantly there was a score of candles sparkling round the mantel piece in all sorts of quaint sconces of gilt and bronze and porcelain  they lighted up rebeccas figure to admiration as she sat on a sofa covered with a pattern of gaudy flowers  she was in a pink dress that looked as fresh as a rose her dazzling white arms and shoulders were halfcovered with a thin hazy scarf through which they sparkled her hair hung in curls round her neck one of her little feet peeped out from the fresh crisp folds of the silk  the prettiest little foot in the prettiest little sandal in the finest silk stocking in the world  the candles lighted up lord steynes shining bald head which was fringed with red hair  he had thick bushy eyebrows with little twinkling bloodshot eyes surrounded by a thousand wrinkles  his jaw was underhung and when he laughed two white buckteeth protruded themselves and glistened savagely in the midst of the grin he had been dining with royal personages and wore his garter and ribbon  a short man was his lordship broadchested and bowlegged but proud of the fineness of his foot and ankle and always caressing his garterknee  and so the shepherd is not enough said he to defend his lambkin  the shepherd is too fond of playing at cards and going to his clubs answered becky laughing  gad what a debauched corydon said my lordwhat a mouth for a pipe  i take your three to two here said rawdon at the cardtable  hark at meliboeus snarled the noble marquis hes pastorally occupied too  hes shearing a southdown what an innocent mutton hey damme what a snowy fleece  rebeccas eyes shot out gleams of scornful humour my lord she said you are a knight of the order he had the collar round his neck indeeda gift of the restored princes of spain  lord steyne in early life had been notorious for his daring and his success at play  he had sat up two days and two nights with mr fox at hazard  he had won money of the most august personages of the realm he had won his marquisate it was said at the gamingtable but he did not like an allusion to those bygone fredaines  rebecca saw the scowl gathering over his heavy brow  she rose up from her sofa and went and took his coffee cup out of his hand with a little curtsey  yes she said i must get a watchdog but he wont bark at you and going into the other drawingroom she sat down to the piano and began to sing little french songs in such a charming thrilling voice that the mollified nobleman speedily followed her into that chamber and might be seen nodding his head and bowing time over her  rawdon and his friend meanwhile played ecarte until they had enough the colonel won but say that he won ever so much and often nights like these which occurred many times in the weekhis wife having all the talk and all the admiration and he sitting silent without the circle not comprehending a word of the jokes the allusions the mystical language withinmust have been rather wearisome to the exdragoon  how is mrs crawleys husband lord steyne used to say to him by way of a good day when they met and indeed that was now his avocation in life  he was colonel crawley no more  he was mrs crawleys husband  about the little rawdon if nothing has been said all this while it is because he is hidden upstairs in a garret somewhere or has crawled below into the kitchen for companionship  his mother scarcely ever took notice of him  he passed the days with his french bonne as long as that domestic remained in mr crawleys family and when the frenchwoman went away the little fellow howling in the loneliness of the night had compassion taken on him by a housemaid who took him out of his solitary nursery into her bed in the garret hard by and comforted him  rebecca my lord steyne and one or two more were in the drawingroom taking tea after the opera when this shouting was heard overhead its my cherub crying for his nurse she said  she did not offer to move to go and see the child  dont agitate your feelings by going to look for him said lord steyne sardonically bah replied the other with a sort of blush hell cry himself to sleep and they fell to talking about the opera  rawdon had stolen off though to look after his son and heir and came back to the company when he found that honest dolly was consoling the child  the colonels dressingroom was in those upper regions  he used to see the boy there in private  they had interviews together every morning when he shaved rawdon minor sitting on a box by his fathers side and watching the operation with neverceasing pleasure he and the sire were great friends the father would bring him sweetmeats from the dessert and hide them in a certain old epaulet box where the child went to seek them and laughed with joy on discovering the treasure laughed but not too loud  for mamma was below asleep and must not be disturbed  she did not go to rest till very late and seldom rose till after noon  rawdon bought the boy plenty of picturebooks and crammed his nursery with toys  its walls were covered with pictures pasted up by the fathers own hand and purchased by him for ready money  when he was off duty with mrs rawdon in the park he would sit up here passing hours with the boy who rode on his chest who pulled his great mustachios as if they were drivingreins and spent days with him in indefatigable gambols  the room was a low room and once when the child was not five years old his father who was tossing him wildly up in his arms hit the poor little chaps skull so violently against the ceiling that he almost dropped the child so terrified was he at the disaster  rawdon minor had made up his face for a tremendous howlthe severity of the blow indeed authorized that indulgence but just as he was going to begin the father interposed  for gods sake rawdy dont wake mamma he cried  and the child looking in a very hard and piteous way at his father bit his lips clenched his hands and didnt cry a bit  rawdon told that story at the clubs at the mess to everybody in town  by gad sir he explained to the public in general what a good plucked one that boy of mine iswhat a trump he is  i halfsent his head through the ceiling by gad and he wouldnt cry for fear of disturbing his mother  sometimesonce or twice in a weekthat lady visited the upper regions in which the child lived  she came like a vivified figure out of the magasin des modesblandly smiling in the most beautiful new clothes and little gloves and boots  wonderful scarfs laces and jewels glittered about her  she had always a new bonnet on and flowers bloomed perpetually in it or else magnificent curling ostrich feathers soft and snowy as camellias  she nodded twice or thrice patronizingly to the little boy who looked up from his dinner or from the pictures of soldiers he was painting  when she left the room an odour of rose or some other magical fragrance lingered about the nursery she was an unearthly being in his eyes superior to his fatherto all the world  to be worshipped and admired at a distance to drive with that lady in the carriage was an awful rite  he sat up in the back seat and did not dare to speak  he gazed with all his eyes at the beautifully dressed princess opposite to him  gentlemen on splendid prancing horses came up and smiled and talked with her how her eyes beamed upon all of them  her hand used to quiver and wave gracefully as they passed  when he went out with her he had his new red dress on  his old brown holland was good enough when he stayed at home sometimes when she was away and dolly his maid was making his bed he came into his mothers room  it was as the abode of a fairy to hima mystic chamber of splendour and delights  there in the wardrobe hung those wonderful robespink and blue and manytinted  there was the jewelcase silverclasped and the wondrous bronze hand on the dressingtable glistening all over with a hundred rings  there was the chevalglass that miracle of art in which he could just see his own wondering head and the reflection of dolly queerly distorted and as if up in the ceiling plumping and patting the pillows of the bed oh thou poor lonely little benighted boy mother is the name for god in the lips and hearts of little children and here was one who was worshipping a stone  now rawdon crawley rascal as the colonel was had certain manly tendencies of affection in his heart and could love a child and a woman still  for rawdon minor he had a great secret tenderness then which did not escape rebecca though she did not talk about it to her husband  it did not annoy her  she was too goodnatured it only increased her scorn for him  he felt somehow ashamed of this paternal softness and hid it from his wifeonly indulging in it when alone with the boy  he used to take him out of mornings when they would go to the stables together and to the park  little lord southdown the bestnatured of men who would make you a present of the hat from his head and whose main occupation in life was to buy knickknacks that he might give them away afterwards bought the little chap a pony not much bigger than a large rat the donor said and on this little black shetland pygmy young rawdons great father was pleased to mount the boy and to walk by his side in the park  it pleased him to see his old quarters and his old fellowguardsmen at knightsbridge he had begun to think of his bachelorhood with something like regret  the old troopers were glad to recognize their ancient officer and dandle the little colonel colonel crawley found dining at mess and with his brotherofficers very pleasant hang it i aint clever enough for heri know it  she wont miss me he used to say  and he was right his wife did not miss him  rebecca was fond of her husband  she was always perfectly goodhumoured and kind to him  she did not even show her scorn much for him perhaps she liked him the better for being a fool  he was her upper servant and maitre dhotel  he went on her errands obeyed her orders without question drove in the carriage in the ring with her without repining took her to the operabox solaced himself at his club during the performance and came punctually back to fetch her when due  he would have liked her to be a little fonder of the boy but even to that he reconciled himself  hang it you know shes so clever he said and im not literary and that you know for as we have said before it requires no great wisdom to be able to win at cards and billiards and rawdon made no pretensions to any other sort of skill  when the companion came his domestic duties became very light  his wife encouraged him to dine abroad  she would let him off duty at the opera  dont stay and stupefy yourself at home tonight my dear she would say  some men are coming who will only bore you i would not ask them but you know its for your good and now i have a sheepdog i need not be afraid to be alone  a sheepdoga companion  becky sharp with a companion  isnt it good fun thought mrs crawley to herself  the notion tickled hugely her sense of humour  one sunday morning as rawdon crawley his little son and the pony were taking their accustomed walk in the park they passed by an old acquaintance of the colonels corporal clink of the regiment who was in conversation with a friend an old gentleman who held a boy in his arms about the age of little rawdon  this other youngster had seized hold of the waterloo medal which the corporal wore and was examining it with delight  good morning your honour said clink in reply to the how do clink of the colonel  this ere young gentleman is about the little colonels age sir continued the corporal  his father was a waterloo man too said the old gentleman who carried the boy  wasnt he georgy  yes said georgy  he and the little chap on the pony were looking at each other with all their mightsolemnly scanning each other as children do  in a line regiment clink said with a patronizing air  he was a captain in the th regiment said the old gentleman rather pompously  captain george osborne sirperhaps you knew him  he died the death of a hero sir fighting against the corsican tyrant colonel crawley blushed quite red  i knew him very well sir he said and his wife his dear little wife sirhow is she  she is my daughter sir said the old gentleman putting down the boy and taking out a card with great solemnity which he handed to the colonel  on it written  mr sedley sole agent for the black diamond and anticinder coal association bunkers wharf thames street and annamaria cottages fulham road west  little georgy went up and looked at the shetland pony  should you like to have a ride said rawdon minor from the saddle  yes said georgy  the colonel who had been looking at him with some interest took up the child and put him on the pony behind rawdon minor  take hold of him georgy he saidtake my little boy round the waisthis name is rawdon and both the children began to laugh  you wont see a prettier pair i think this summers day sir said the goodnatured corporal and the colonel the corporal and old mr sedley with his umbrella walked by the side of the children    chapter xxxviii  a family in a very small way  we must suppose little george osborne has ridden from knightsbridge towards fulham and will stop and make inquiries at that village regarding some friends whom we have left there  how is mrs amelia after the storm of waterloo is she living and thriving what has come of major dobbin whose cab was always hankering about her premises and is there any news of the collector of boggley wollah the facts concerning the latter are briefly these  our worthy fat friend joseph sedley returned to india not long after his escape from brussels  either his furlough was up or he dreaded to meet any witnesses of his waterloo flight  however it might be he went back to his duties in bengal very soon after napoleon had taken up his residence at st  helena where jos saw the exemperor to hear mr sedley talk on board ship you would have supposed that it was not the first time he and the corsican had met and that the civilian had bearded the french general at mount st  john  he had a thousand anecdotes about the famous battles he knew the position of every regiment and the loss which each had incurred  he did not deny that he had been concerned in those victoriesthat he had been with the army and carried despatches for the duke of wellington and he described what the duke did and said on every conceivable moment of the day of waterloo with such an accurate knowledge of his graces sentiments and proceedings that it was clear he must have been by the conquerors side throughout the day though as a noncombatant his name was not mentioned in the public documents relative to the battle  perhaps he actually worked himself up to believe that he had been engaged with the army certain it is that he made a prodigious sensation for some time at calcutta and was called waterloo sedley during the whole of his subsequent stay in bengal  the bills which jos had given for the purchase of those unlucky horses were paid without question by him and his agents  he never was heard to allude to the bargain and nobody knows for a certainty what became of the horses or how he got rid of them or of isidor his belgian servant who sold a grey horse very like the one which jos rode at valenciennes sometime during the autumn of 1815  joss london agents had orders to pay one hundred and twenty pounds yearly to his parents at fulham  it was the chief support of the old couple for mr sedleys speculations in life subsequent to his bankruptcy did not by any means retrieve the broken old gentlemans fortune  he tried to be a winemerchant a coalmerchant a commission lottery agent c c  he sent round prospectuses to his friends whenever he took a new trade and ordered a new brass plate for the door and talked pompously about making his fortune still  but fortune never came back to the feeble and stricken old man  one by one his friends dropped off and were weary of buying dear coals and bad wine from him and there was only his wife in all the world who fancied when he tottered off to the city of a morning that he was still doing any business there  at evening he crawled slowly back and he used to go of nights to a little club at a tavern where he disposed of the finances of the nation it was wonderful to hear him talk about millions and agios and discounts and what rothschild was doing and baring brothers  he talked of such vast sums that the gentlemen of the club the apothecary the undertaker the great carpenter and builder the parish clerk who was allowed to come stealthily and mr clapp our old acquaintance respected the old gentleman  i was better off once sir he did not fail to tell everybody who used the room my son sir is at this minute chief magistrate of ramgunge in the presidency of bengal and touching his four thousand rupees per mensem my daughter might be a colonels lady if she liked  i might draw upon my son the first magistrate sir for two thousand pounds tomorrow and alexander would cash my bill down sir down on the counter sir but the sedleys were always a proud family you and i my dear reader may drop into this condition one day for have not many of our friends attained it our luck may fail our powers forsake us  our place on the boards be taken by better and younger mimesthe chance of life roll away and leave us shattered and stranded  then men will walk across the road when they meet youor worse still hold you out a couple of fingers and patronize you in a pitying waythen you will know as soon as your back is turned that your friend begins with a poor devil what imprudences he has committed what chances that chap has thrown away well wella carriage and three thousand a year is not the summit of the reward nor the end of gods judgment of men  if quacks prosper as often as they go to the wallif zanies succeed and knaves arrive at fortune and vice versa sharing ill luck and prosperity for all the world like the ablest and most honest amongst usi say brother the gifts and pleasures of vanity fair cannot be held of any great account and that it is probable    but we are wandering out of the domain of the story  had mrs sedley been a woman of energy she would have exerted it after her husbands ruin and occupying a large house would have taken in boarders  the broken sedley would have acted well as the boardinghouse landladys husband the munoz of private life the titular lord and master  the carver housesteward and humble husband of the occupier of the dingy throne  i have seen men of good brains and breeding and of good hopes and vigour once who feasted squires and kept hunters in their youth meekly cutting up legs of mutton for rancorous old harridans and pretending to preside over their dreary tablesbut mrs sedley we say had not spirit enough to bustle about for a few select inmates to join a cheerful musical family such as one reads of in the times  she was content to lie on the shore where fortune had stranded herand you could see that the career of this old couple was over  i dont think they were unhappy  perhaps they were a little prouder in their downfall than in their prosperity mrs sedley was always a great person for her landlady mrs clapp when she descended and passed many hours with her in the basement or ornamented kitchen the irish maid betty flanagans bonnets and ribbons her sauciness her idleness her reckless prodigality of kitchen candles her consumption of tea and sugar and so forth occupied and amused the old lady almost as much as the doings of her former household when she had sambo and the coachman and a groom and a footboy and a housekeeper with a regiment of female domesticsher former household about which the good lady talked a hundred times a day and besides betty flanagan mrs sedley had all the maidsofallwork in the street to superintend she knew how each tenant of the cottages paid or owed his little rent  she stepped aside when mrs rougemont the actress passed with her dubious family  she flung up her head when mrs pestler the apothecarys lady drove by in her husbands professional onehorse chaise  she had colloquies with the greengrocer about the pennorth of turnips which mr sedley loved she kept an eye upon the milkman and the bakers boy and made visitations to the butcher who sold hundreds of oxen very likely with less ado than was made about mrs sedleys loin of mutton  and she counted the potatoes under the joint on sundays on which days dressed in her best she went to church twice and read blairs sermons in the evening  on that day for business prevented him on weekdays from taking such a pleasure it was old sedleys delight to take out his little grandson georgy to the neighbouring parks or kensington gardens to see the soldiers or to feed the ducks  georgy loved the redcoats and his grandpapa told him how his father had been a famous soldier and introduced him to many sergeants and others with waterloo medals on their breasts to whom the old grandfather pompously presented the child as the son of captain osborne of the th who died gloriously on the glorious eighteenth  he has been known to treat some of these noncommissioned gentlemen to a glass of porter and indeed in their first sunday walks was disposed to spoil little georgy sadly gorging the boy with apples and parliament to the detriment of his healthuntil amelia declared that george should never go out with his grandpapa unless the latter promised solemnly and on his honour not to give the child any cakes lollipops or stall produce whatever  between mrs sedley and her daughter there was a sort of coolness about this boy and a secret jealousyfor one evening in georges very early days amelia who had been seated at work in their little parlour scarcely remarking that the old lady had quitted the room ran upstairs instinctively to the nursery at the cries of the child who had been asleep until that momentand there found mrs sedley in the act of surreptitiously administering daffys elixir to the infant  amelia the gentlest and sweetest of everyday mortals when she found this meddling with her maternal authority thrilled and trembled all over with anger  her cheeks ordinarily pale now flushed up until they were as red as they used to be when she was a child of twelve years old  she seized the baby out of her mothers arms and then grasped at the bottle leaving the old lady gaping at her furious and holding the guilty teaspoon  amelia flung the bottle crashing into the fireplace i will not have baby poisoned mamma cried emmy rocking the infant about violently with both her arms round him and turning with flashing eyes at her mother  poisoned amelia said the old lady this language to me  he shall not have any medicine but that which mr pestler sends for hi n  he told me that daffys elixir was poison  very good  you think im a murderess then replied mrs sedley this is the language you use to your mother i have met with misfortunes  i have sunk low in life  i have kept my carriage and now walk on foot  but i did not know i was a murderess before and thank you for the news  mamma said the poor girl who was always ready for tearsyou shouldnt be hard upon me  ii didnt meani mean i did not wish to say you would to any wrong to this dear child only  oh no my loveonly that i was a murderess in which case i had better go to the old bailey  though i didnt poison you when you were a child but gave you the best of education and the most expensive masters money could procure  yes ive nursed five children and buried three and the one i loved the best of all and tended through croup and teething and measles and hoopingcough and brought up with foreign masters regardless of expense and with accomplishments at minerva housewhich i never had when i was a girlwhen i was too glad to honour my father and mother that i might live long in the land and to be useful and not to mope all day in my room and act the fine ladysays im a murderess  ah mrs osborne may you never nourish a viper in your bosom thats my prayer  mamma mamma cried the bewildered girl and the child in her arms set up a frantic chorus of shouts a murderess indeed  go down on your knees and pray to god to cleanse your wicked ungrateful heart amelia and may he forgive you as i do and mrs sedley tossed out of the room hissing out the word poison once more and so ending her charitable benediction  till the termination of her natural life this breach between mrs sedley and her daughter was never thoroughly mended  the quarrel gave the elder lady numberless advantages which she did not fail to turn to account with female ingenuity and perseverance  for instance she scarcely spoke to amelia for many weeks afterwards she warned the domestics not to touch the child as mrs osborne might be offended she asked her daughter to see and satisfy herself that there was no poison prepared in the little daily messes that were concocted for georgy when neighbours asked after the boys health she referred them pointedly to mrs osborne  she never ventured to ask whether the baby was well or not  she would not touch the child although he was her grandson and own precious darling for she was not used to children and might kill it  and whenever mr pestler came upon his healing inquisition she received the doctor with such a sarcastic and scornful demeanour as made the surgeon declare that not lady thistlewood herself whom he had the honour of attending professionally could give herself greater airs than old mrs sedley from whom he never took a fee  and very likely emmy was jealous too upon her own part as what mother is not of those who would manage her children for her or become candidates for the first place in their affections  it is certain that when anybody nursed the child she was uneasy and that she would no more allow mrs clapp or the domestic to dress or tend him than she would have let them wash her husbands miniature which hung up over her little bedthe same little bed from which the poor girl had gone to his and to which she retired now for many long silent tearful but happy years  in this room was all amelias heart and treasure  here it was that she tended her boy and watched him through the many ills of childhood with a constant passion of love  the elder george returned in him somehow only improved and as if come back from heaven  in a hundred little tones looks and movements the child was so like his father that the widows heart thrilled as she held him to it and he would often ask the cause of her tears  it was because of his likeness to his father she did not scruple to tell him  she talked constantly to him about this dead father and spoke of her love for george to the innocent and wondering child much more than she ever had done to george himself or to any confidante of her youth  to her parents she never talked about this matter shrinking from baring her heart to them  little george very likely could understand no better than they but into his ears she poured her sentimental secrets unreservedly and into his only  the very joy of this woman was a sort of grief or so tender at least that its expression was tears  her sensibilities were so weak and tremulous that perhaps they ought not to be talked about in a book i was told by dr pestler now a most flourishing ladys physician with a sumptuous dark green carriage a prospect of speedy knighthood and a house in manchester square that her grief at weaning the child was a sight that would have unmanned a herod  he was very softhearted many years ago and his wife was mortally jealous of mrs amelia then and long afterwards  perhaps the doctors lady had good reason for her jealousy  most women shared it of those who formed the small circle of amelias acquaintance and were quite angry at the enthusiasm with which the other sex regarded her  for almost all men who came near her loved her though no doubt they would be at a loss to tell you why  she was not brilliant nor witty nor wise over much nor extraordinarily handsome  but wherever she went she touched and charmed every one of the male sex as invariably as she awakened the scorn and incredulity of her own sisterhood  i think it was her weakness which was her principal charma kind of sweet submission and softness which seemed to appeal to each man she met for his sympathy and protection  we have seen how in the regiment though she spoke but to few of georges comrades there all the swords of the young fellows at the messtable would have leapt from their scabbards to fight round her and so it was in the little narrow lodginghouse and circle at fulham she interested and pleased everybody  if she had been mrs mango herself of the great house of mango plantain and co crutched friars and the magnificent proprietress of the pineries fulham who gave summer dejeuners frequented by dukes and earls and drove about the parish with magnificent yellow liveries and bay horses such as the royal stables at kensington themselves could not turn outi say had she been mrs mango herself or her sons wife lady mary mango daughter of the earl of castlemouldy who condescended to marry the head of the firm the tradesmen of the neighbourhood could not pay her more honour than they invariably showed to the gentle young widow when she passed by their doors or made her humble purchases at their shops  thus it was not only mr pestler the medical man but mr linton the young assistant who doctored the servant maids and small tradesmen and might be seen any day reading the times in the surgery who openly declared himself the slave of mrs osborne  he was a personable young gentleman more welcome at mrs sedleys lodgings than his principal and if anything went wrong with georgy he would drop in twice or thrice in the day to see the little chap and without so much as the thought of a fee  he would abstract lozenges tamarinds and other produce from the surgerydrawers for little georgys benefit and compounded draughts and mixtures for him of miraculous sweetness so that it was quite a pleasure to the child to be ailing  he and pestler his chief sat up two whole nights by the boy in that momentous and awful week when georgy had the measles and when you would have thought from the mothers terror that there had never been measles in the world before would they have done as much for other people did they sit up for the folks at the pineries when ralph plantagenet and gwendoline and guinever mango had the same juvenile complaint did they sit up for little mary clapp the landlords daughter who actually caught the disease of little georgy truth compels one to say no they slept quite undisturbed at least as far as she was concernedpronounced hers to be a slight case which would almost cure itself sent her in a draught or two and threw in bark when the child rallied with perfect indifference and just for forms sake  again there was the little french chevalier opposite who gave lessons in his native tongue at various schools in the neighbourhood and who might be heard in his apartment of nights playing tremulous old gavottes and minuets on a wheezy old fiddle whenever this powdered and courteous old man who never missed a sunday at the convent chapel at hammersmith and who was in all respects thoughts conduct and bearing utterly unlike the bearded savages of his nation who curse perfidious albion and scowl at you from over their cigars in the quadrant arcades at the present daywhenever the old chevalier de talonrouge spoke of mistress osborne he would first finish his pinch of snuff flick away the remaining particles of dust with a graceful wave of his hand gather up his fingers again into a bunch and bringing them up to his mouth blow them open with a kiss exclaiming ah la divine creature  he vowed and protested that when amelia walked in the brompton lanes flowers grew in profusion under her feet  he called little georgy cupid and asked him news of venus his mamma and told the astonished betty flanagan that she was one of the graces and the favourite attendant of the reine des amours  instances might be multiplied of this easily gained and unconscious popularity  did not mr binny the mild and genteel curate of the district chapel which the family attended call assiduously upon the widow dandle the little boy on his knee and offer to teach him latin to the anger of the elderly virgin his sister who kept house for him there is nothing in her beilby the latter lady would say  when she comes to tea here she does not speak a word during the whole evening  she is but a poor lackadaisical creature and it is my belief has no heart at all  it is only her pretty face which all you gentlemen admire so  miss grits who has five thousand pounds and expectations besides has twice as much character and is a thousand times more agreeable to my taste and if she were goodlooking i know that you would think her perfection  very likely miss binny was right to a great extent  it is the pretty face which creates sympathy in the hearts of men those wicked rogues a woman may possess the wisdom and chastity of minerva and we give no heed to her if she has a plain face  what folly will not a pair of bright eyes make pardonable what dulness may not red lips and sweet accents render pleasant and so with their usual sense of justice ladies argue that because a woman is handsome therefore she is a fool o ladies ladies there are some of you who are neither handsome nor wise  these are but trivial incidents to recount in the life of our heroine her tale does not deal in wonders as the gentle reader has already no doubt perceived and if a journal had been kept of her proceedings during the seven years after the birth of her son there would be found few incidents more remarkable in it than that of the measles recorded in the foregoing page  yes one day and greatly to her wonder the reverend mr binny just mentioned asked her to change her name of osborne for his own when with deep blushes and tears in her eyes and voice she thanked him for his regard for her expressed gratitude for his attentions to her and to her poor little boy but said that she never never could think of any butbut the husband whom she had lost  on the twentyfifth of april and the eighteenth of june the days of marriage and widowhood she kept her room entirely consecrating them and we do not know how many hours of solitary nightthought her little boy sleeping in his crib by her bedside to the memory of that departed friend  during the day she was more active she had to teach george to read and to write and a little to draw  she read books in order that she might tell him stories from them  as his eyes opened and his mind expanded under the influence of the outward nature round about him she taught the child to the best of her humble power to acknowledge the maker of all and every night and every morning he and shein that awful and touching communion which i think must bring a thrill to the heart of every man who witnesses or who remembers itthe mother and the little boyprayed to our father together the mother pleading with all her gentle heart the child lisping after her as she spoke  and each time they prayed to god to bless dear papa as if he were alive and in the room with them  to wash and dress this young gentlemanto take him for a run of the mornings before breakfast and the retreat of grandpapa for businessto make for him the most wonderful and ingenious dresses for which end the thrifty widow cut up and altered every available little bit of finery which she possessed out of her wardrobe during her marriagefor mrs osborne herself greatly to her mothers vexation who preferred fine clothes especially since her misfortunes always wore a black gown and a straw bonnet with a black ribbonoccupied her many hours of the day  others she had to spare at the service of her mother and her old father  she had taken the pains to learn and used to play cribbage with this gentleman on the nights when he did not go to his club  she sang for him when he was so minded and it was a good sign for he invariably fell into a comfortable sleep during the music  she wrote out his numerous memorials letters prospectuses and projects  it was in her handwriting that most of the old gentlemans former acquaintances were informed that he had become an agent for the black diamond and anticinder coal company and could supply his friends and the public with the best coals at s per chaldron  all he did was to sign the circulars with his flourish and signature and direct them in a shaky clerklike hand  one of these papers was sent to major dobbinregt care of messrs  cox and greenwood but the major being in madras at the time had no particular call for coals  he knew though the hand which had written the prospectus  good god what would he not have given to hold it in his own  a second prospectus came out informing the major that j  sedley and company having established agencies at oporto bordeaux and st  marys were enabled to offer to their friends and the public generally the finest and most celebrated growths of ports sherries and claret wines at reasonable prices and under extraordinary advantages acting upon this hint dobbin furiously canvassed the governor the commanderinchief the judges the regiments and everybody whom he knew in the presidency and sent home to sedley and co  orders for wine which perfectly astonished mr sedley and mr clapp who was the co  in the business  but no more orders came after that first burst of good fortune on which poor old sedley was about to build a house in the city a regiment of clerks a dock to himself and correspondents all over the world  the old gentlemans former taste in wine had gone  the curses of the messroom assailed major dobbin for the vile drinks he had been the means of introducing there and he bought back a great quantity of the wine and sold it at public outcry at an enormous loss to himself as for jos who was by this time promoted to a seat at the revenue board at calcutta he was wild with rage when the post brought him out a bundle of these bacchanalian prospectuses with a private note from his father telling jos that his senior counted upon him in this enterprise and had consigned a quantity of select wines to him as per invoice drawing bills upon him for the amount of the same  jos who would no more have it supposed that his father jos sedleys father of the board of revenue was a wine merchant asking for orders than that he was jack ketch refused the bills with scorn wrote back contumeliously to the old gentleman bidding him to mind his own affairs and the protested paper coming back sedley and co  had to take it up with the profits which they had made out of the madras venture and with a little portion of emmys savings  besides her pension of fifty pounds a year there had been five hundred pounds as her husbands executor stated left in the agents hands at the time of osbornes demise which sum as georges guardian dobbin proposed to put out at 8 per cent in an indian house of agency  mr sedley who thought the major had some roguish intentions of his own about the money was strongly against this plan and he went to the agents to protest personally against the employment of the money in question when he learned to his surprise that there had been no such sum in their hands that all the late captains assets did not amount to a hundred pounds and that the five hundred pounds in question must be a separate sum of which major dobbin knew the particulars more than ever convinced that there was some roguery old sedley pursued the major  as his daughters nearest friend he demanded with a high hand a statement of the late captains accounts  dobbins stammering blushing and awkwardness added to the others convictions that he had a rogue to deal with and in a majestic tone he told that officer a piece of his mind as he called it simply stating his belief that the major was unlawfully detaining his late soninlaws money  dobbin at this lost all patience and if his accuser had not been so old and so broken a quarrel might have ensued between them at the slaughters coffeehouse in a box of which place of entertainment the gentlemen had their colloquy  come upstairs sir lisped out the major  i insist on your coming up the stairs and i will show which is the injured party poor george or i and dragging the old gentleman up to his bedroom he produced from his desk osbornes accounts and a bundle of ious which the latter had given who to do him justice was always ready to give an iou  he paid his bills in england dobbin added but he had not a hundred pounds in the world when he fell  i and one or two of his brother officers made up the little sum which was all that we could spare and you dare tell us that we are trying to cheat the widow and the orphan sedley was very contrite and humbled though the fact is that william dobbin had told a great falsehood to the old gentleman having himself given every shilling of the money having buried his friend and paid all the fees and charges incident upon the calamity and removal of poor amelia  about these expenses old osborne had never given himself any trouble to think nor any other relative of amelia nor amelia herself indeed she trusted to major dobbin as an accountant took his somewhat confused calculations for granted and never once suspected how much she was in his debt  twice or thrice in the year according to her promise she wrote him letters to madras letters all about little georgy  how he treasured these papers  whenever amelia wrote he answered and not until then but he sent over endless remembrances of himself to his godson and to her  he ordered and sent a box of scarfs and a grand ivory set of chessmen from china  the pawns were little green and white men with real swords and shields the knights were on horseback the castles were on the backs of elephants  mrs mangos own set at the pineries was not so fine mr pestler remarked  these chessmen were the delight of georgys life who printed his first letter in acknowledgement of this gift of his godpapa  he sent over preserves and pickles which latter the young gentleman tried surreptitiously in the sideboard and halfkilled himself with eating  he thought it was a judgement upon him for stealing they were so hot  emmy wrote a comical little account of this mishap to the major  it pleased him to think that her spirits were rallying and that she could be merry sometimes now  he sent over a pair of shawls a white one for her and a black one with palmleaves for her mother and a pair of red scarfs as winter wrappers for old mr sedley and george the shawls were worth fifty guineas apiece at the very least as mrs sedley knew  she wore hers in state at church at brompton and was congratulated by her female friends upon the splendid acquisition  emmys too became prettily her modest black gown  what a pity it is she wont think of him mrs sedley remarked to mrs clapp and to all her friends of brompton  jos never sent us such presents i am sure and grudges us everything  it is evident that the major is over head and ears in love with her and yet whenever i so much as hint it she turns red and begins to cry and goes and sits upstairs with her miniature  im sick of that miniature  i wish we had never seen those odious purseproud osbornes  amidst such humble scenes and associates georges early youth was passed and the boy grew up delicate sensitive imperious womanbreddomineering the gentle mother whom he loved with passionate affection  he ruled all the rest of the little world round about him as he grew the elders were amazed at his haughty manner and his constant likeness to his father  he asked questions about everything as inquiring youth will do  the profundity of his remarks and interrogatories astonished his old grandfather who perfectly bored the club at the tavern with stories about the little lads learning and genius  he suffered his grandmother with a goodhumoured indifference  the small circle round about him believed that the equal of the boy did not exist upon the earth  georgy inherited his fathers pride and perhaps thought they were not wrong  when he grew to be about six years old dobbin began to write to him very much  the major wanted to hear that georgy was going to a school and hoped he would acquit himself with credit there  or would he have a good tutor at home it was time that he should begin to learn and his godfather and guardian hinted that he hoped to be allowed to defray the charges of the boys education which would fall heavily upon his mothers straitened income  the major in a word was always thinking about amelia and her little boy and by orders to his agents kept the latter provided with picturebooks paintboxes desks and all conceivable implements of amusement and instruction  three days before georges sixth birthday a gentleman in a gig accompanied by a servant drove up to mr sedleys house and asked to see master george osborne it was mr woolsey military tailor of conduit street who came at the majors order to measure the young gentleman for a suit of clothes  he had had the honour of making for the captain the young gentlemans father sometimes too and by the majors desire no doubt his sisters the misses dobbin would call in the family carriage to take amelia and the little boy to drive if they were so inclined  the patronage and kindness of these ladies was very uncomfortable to amelia but she bore it meekly enough for her nature was to yield and besides the carriage and its splendours gave little georgy immense pleasure the ladies begged occasionally that the child might pass a day with them and he was always glad to go to that fine gardenhouse at denmark hill where they lived and where there were such fine grapes in the hothouses and peaches on the walls  one day they kindly came over to amelia with news which they were sure would delight hersomething very interesting about their dear william  what was it  was he coming home she asked with pleasure beaming in her eyes  oh nonot the leastbut they had very good reason to believe that dear william was about to be marriedand to a relation of a very dear friend of ameliasto miss glorvina odowd sir michael odowds sister who had gone out to join lady odowd at madrasa very beautiful and accomplished girl everybody said  amelia said oh amelia was very very happy indeed but she supposed glorvina could not be like her old acquaintance who was most kindbutbut she was very happy indeed  and by some impulse of which i cannot explain the meaning she took george in her arms and kissed him with an extraordinary tenderness  her eyes were quite moist when she put the child down and she scarcely spoke a word during the whole of the drivethough she was so very happy indeed    chapter xxxix  a cynical chapter  our duty now takes us back for a brief space to some old hampshire acquaintances of ours whose hopes respecting the disposal of their rich kinswomans property were so woefully disappointed  after counting upon thirty thousand pounds from his sister it was a heavy blow to bute crawley to receive but five out of which sum when he had paid his own debts and those of jim his son at college a very small fragment remained to portion off his four plain daughters  mrs bute never knew or at least never acknowledged how far her own tyrannous behaviour had tended to ruin her husband all that woman could do she vowed and protested she had done  was it her fault if she did not possess those sycophantic arts which her hypocritical nephew pitt crawley practised she wished him all the happiness which he merited out of his illgotten gains  at least the money will remain in the family she said charitably  pitt will never spend it my dear that is quite certain for a greater miser does not exist in england and he is as odious though in a different way as his spendthrift brother the abandoned rawdon  so mrs bute after the first shock of rage and disappointment began to accommodate herself as best she could to her altered fortunes and to save and retrench with all her might  she instructed her daughters how to bear poverty cheerfully and invented a thousand notable methods to conceal or evade it  she took them about to balls and public places in the neighbourhood with praiseworthy energy nay she entertained her friends in a hospitable comfortable manner at the rectory and much more frequently than before dear miss crawleys legacy had fallen in from her outward bearing nobody would have supposed that the family had been disappointed in their expectations or have guessed from her frequent appearance in public how she pinched and starved at home  her girls had more milliners furniture than they had ever enjoyed before they appeared perseveringly at the winchester and southampton assemblies they penetrated to cowes for the raceballs and regattagaieties there and their carriage with the horses taken from the plough was at work perpetually until it began almost to be believed that the four sisters had had fortunes left them by their aunt whose name the family never mentioned in public but with the most tender gratitude and regard  i know no sort of lying which is more frequent in vanity fair than this and it may be remarked how people who practise it take credit to themselves for their hypocrisy and fancy that they are exceedingly virtuous and praiseworthy because they are able to deceive the world with regard to the extent of their means  mrs bute certainly thought herself one of the most virtuous women in england and the sight of her happy family was an edifying one to strangers  they were so cheerful so loving so welleducated so simple  martha painted flowers exquisitely and furnished half the charity bazaars in the county  emma was a regular county bulbul and her verses in the hampshire telegraph were the glory of its poets corner  fanny and matilda sang duets together mamma playing the piano and the other two sisters sitting with their arms round each others waists and listening affectionately  nobody saw the poor girls drumming at the duets in private  no one saw mamma drilling them rigidly hour after hour  in a word mrs bute put a good face against fortune and kept up appearances in the most virtuous manner  everything that a good and respectable mother could do mrs bute did she got over yachting men from southampton parsons from the cathedral close at winchester and officers from the barracks there she tried to inveigle the young barristers at assizes and encouraged jim to bring home friends with whom he went out hunting with the h h  what will not a mother do for the benefit of her beloved ones  between such a woman and her brotherinlaw the odious baronet at the hall it is manifest that there could be very little in common the rupture between bute and his brother sir pitt was complete indeed between sir pitt and the whole county to which the old man was a scandal  his dislike for respectable society increased with age and the lodgegates had not opened to a gentlemans carriagewheels since pitt and lady jane came to pay their visit of duty after their marriage  that was an awful and unfortunate visit never to be thought of by the family without horror  pitt begged his wife with a ghastly countenance never to speak of it and it was only through mrs bute herself who still knew everything which took place at the hall that the circumstances of sir pitts reception of his son and daughterinlaw were ever known at all  as they drove up the avenue of the park in their neat and wellappointed carriage pitt remarked with dismay and wrath great gaps among the treeshis treeswhich the old baronet was felling entirely without license  the park wore an aspect of utter dreariness and ruin the drives were ill kept and the neat carriage splashed and floundered in muddy pools along the road  the great sweep in front of the terrace and entrance stair was black and covered with mosses the once trim flowerbeds rank and weedy shutters were up along almost the whole line of the house the great halldoor was unbarred after much ringing of the bell an individual in ribbons was seen flitting up the black oak stair as horrocks at length admitted the heir of queens crawley and his bride into the halls of their fathers  he led the way into sir pitts library as it was called the fumes of tobacco growing stronger as pitt and lady jane approached that apartment sir pitt aint very well horrocks remarked apologetically and hinted that his master was afflicted with lumbago  the library looked out on the front walk and park sir pitt had opened one of the windows and was bawling out thence to the postilion and pitts servant who seemed to be about to take the baggage down  dont move none of them trunks he cried pointing with a pipe which he held in his hand  its only a morning visit tucker you fool lor what cracks that off hoss has in his heels  aint there no one at the kings head to rub em a little how do pitt how do my dear come to see the old man hay gadyouve a pretty face too you aint like that old horsegodmother your mother come and give old pitt a kiss like a good little gal  the embrace disconcerted the daughterinlaw somewhat as the caresses of the old gentleman unshorn and perfumed with tobacco might well do but she remembered that her brother southdown had mustachios and smoked cigars and submitted to the baronet with a tolerable grace  pitt has got vat said the baronet after this mark of affection does he read ee very long zermons my dear hundredth psalm evening hymn hay pitt go and get a glass of malmsey and a cake for my lady jane horrocks you great big booby and dont stand stearing there like a fat pig  i wont ask you to stop my dear youll find it too stoopid and so should i too along a

down to the rectory and ask buty for a dinner  hell be charmed to see you you know hes so much obliged to you for gettin the old womans money  ha ha some of it will do to patch up the hall when im

instant  im gittin very old and have been cruel bad this year with the lumbago  i shant be here now for long but im glad eeve come daughterinlaw  i like your face lady jane  its got none of the damned highboned binkie look in it and ill give ee something pretty my dear to go to court in and he shuffled across the room to a cupboard from which he took a little old case containing jewels of some value  take that said he my dear it belonged to my mother and afterwards to the first lady binkie pretty pearlsnever gave em the ironmongers daughter no no  take em and put em up quick said he thrusting the case into his daughters hand and clapping the door of the cabinet to as horrocks entered with a salver and refreshments  what have you a been and given pitts wife said the individual in ribbons when pitt and lady jane had taken leave of the old gentleman it was miss horrocks the butlers daughterthe cause of the scandal throughout the countythe lady who reigned now almost supreme at queens crawley  the rise and progress of those ribbons had been marked with dismay by the county and family  the ribbons opened an account at the mudbury branch savings bank the ribbons drove to church monopolising the ponychaise which was for the use of the servants at the hall  the domestics were dismissed at her pleasure the scotch gardener who still lingered on the premises taking a pride in his walls and hothouses and indeed making a pretty good livelihood by the garden which he farmed and of which he sold the produce at southampton found the ribbons eating peaches on a sunshiny morning at the southwall and had his ears boxed when he remonstrated about this attack on his property  he and his scotch wife and his scotch children the only respectable inhabitants of queens crawley were forced to migrate with their goods and their chattels and left the stately comfortable gardens to go to waste and the flowerbeds to run to seed  poor lady crawleys rosegarden became the dreariest wilderness  only two or three domestics shuddered in the bleak old servants hall  the stables and offices were vacant and shut up and half ruined  sir pitt lived in private and boozed nightly with horrocks his butler or housesteward as he now began to be called and the abandoned ribbons the times were very much changed since the period when she drove to mudbury in the springcart and called the small tradesmen sir it may have been shame or it may have been dislike of his neighbours but the old cynic of queens crawley hardly issued from his parkgates at all now he quarrelled with his agents and screwed his tenants by letter  his days were passed in conducting his own correspondence the lawyers and farmbailiffs who had to do business with him could not reach him but through the ribbons who received them at the door of the housekeepers room which commanded the back entrance by which they were admitted and so the baronets daily perplexities increased and his embarrassments multiplied round him  the horror of pitt crawley may be imagined as these reports of his fathers dotage reached the most exemplary and correct of gentlemen he trembled daily lest he should hear that the ribbons was proclaimed his second legal motherinlaw  after that first and last visit his fathers name was never mentioned in pitts polite and genteel establishment  it was the skeleton in his house and all the family walked by it in terror and silence  the countess southdown kept on dropping per coach at the lodgegate the most exciting tracts tracts which ought to frighten the hair off your head  mrs bute at the parsonage nightly looked out to see if the sky was red over the elms behind which the hall stood and the mansion was on fire  sir g wapshot and sir h  fuddlestone old friends of the house wouldnt sit on the bench with sir pitt at quarter sessions and cut him dead in the high street of southampton where the reprobate stood offering his dirty old hands to them  nothing had any effect upon him he put his hands into his pockets and burst out laughing as he scrambled into his carriage and four he used to burst out laughing at lady southdowns tracts and he laughed at his sons and at the world and at the ribbons when she was angry which was not seldom  miss horrocks was installed as housekeeper at queens crawley and ruled all the domestics there with great majesty and rigour  all the servants were instructed to address her as mum or madamand there was one little maid on her promotion who persisted in calling her my lady without any rebuke on the part of the housekeeper there has been better ladies and there has been worser hester was miss horrocks reply to this compliment of her inferior so she ruled having supreme power over all except her father whom however she treated with considerable haughtiness warning him not to be too familiar in his behaviour to one as was to be a baronets lady indeed she rehearsed that exalted part in life with great satisfaction to herself and to the amusement of old sir pitt who chuckled at her airs and graces and would laugh by the hour together at her assumptions of dignity and imitations of genteel life he swore it was as good as a play to see her in the character of a fine dame and he made her put on one of the first lady crawleys courtdresses swearing entirely to miss horrocks own concurrence that the dress became her prodigiously and threatening to drive her off that very instant to court in a coachandfour  she had the ransacking of the wardrobes of the two defunct ladies and cut and hacked their posthumous finery so as to suit her own tastes and figure  and she would have liked to take possession of their jewels and trinkets too but the old baronet had locked them away in his private cabinet nor could she coax or wheedle him out of the keys  and it is a fact that some time after she left queens crawley a copybook belonging to this lady was discovered which showed that she had taken great pains in private to learn the art of writing in general and especially of writing her own name as lady crawley lady betsy horrocks lady elizabeth crawley c  though the good people of the parsonage never went to the hall and shunned the horrid old dotard its owner yet they kept a strict knowledge of all that happened there and were looking out every day for the catastrophe for which miss horrocks was also eager  but fate intervened enviously and prevented her from receiving the reward due to such immaculate love and virtue  one day the baronet surprised her ladyship as he jocularly called her seated at that old and tuneless piano in the drawingroom which had scarcely been touched since becky sharp played quadrilles upon itseated at the piano with the utmost gravity and squalling to the best of her power in imitation of the music which she had sometimes heard  the little kitchenmaid on her promotion was standing at her mistresss side quite delighted during the operation and wagging her head up and down and crying lor mum tis bittifuljust like a genteel sycophant in a real drawingroom  this incident made the old baronet roar with laughter as usual  he narrated the circumstance a dozen times to horrocks in the course of the evening and greatly to the discomfiture of miss horrocks  he thrummed on the table as if it had been a musical instrument and squalled in imitation of her manner of singing  he vowed that such a beautiful voice ought to be cultivated and declared she ought to have singingmasters in which proposals she saw nothing ridiculous he was in great spirits that night and drank with his friend and butler an extraordinary quantity of rumandwaterat a very late hour the faithful friend and domestic conducted his master to his bedroom  half an hour afterwards there was a great hurry and bustle in the house  lights went about from window to window in the lonely desolate old hall whereof but two or three rooms were ordinarily occupied by its owner presently a boy on a pony went galloping off to mudbury to the doctors house there  and in another hour by which fact we ascertain how carefully the excellent mrs bute crawley had always kept up an understanding with the great house that lady in her clogs and calash the reverend bute crawley and james crawley her son had walked over from the rectory through the park and had entered the mansion by the open halldoor  they passed through the hall and the small oak parlour on the table of which stood the three tumblers and the empty rumbottle which had served for sir pitts carouse and through that apartment into sir pitts study where they found miss horrocks of the guilty ribbons with a wild air trying at the presses and escritoires with a bunch of keys  she dropped them with a scream of terror as little mrs butes eyes flashed out at her from under her black calash  look at that james and mr crawley cried mrs bute pointing at the scared figure of the blackeyed guilty wench  he gave em me he gave em me she cried  gave them you you abandoned creature screamed mrs bute  bear witness mr crawley we found this goodfornothing woman in the act of stealing your brothers property and she will be hanged as i always said she would  betsy horrocks quite daunted flung herself down on her knees bursting into tears  but those who know a really good woman are aware that she is not in a hurry to forgive and that the humiliation of an enemy is a triumph to her soul  ring the bell james mrs bute said  go on ringing it till the people come the three or four domestics resident in the deserted old house came presently at that jangling and continued summons  put that woman in the strongroom she said  we caught her in the act of robbing sir pitt  mr crawley youll make out her committaland beddoes youll drive her over in the spring cart in the morning to southampton gaol  my dear interposed the magistrate and rectorshes only  are there no handcuffs mrs bute continued stamping in her clogs there used to be handcuffs wheres the creatures abominable father  he did give em me still cried poor betsy didnt he hester you saw sir pittyou know you didgive em me ever so long agothe day after mudbury fair  not that i want em  take em if you think they aint mine and here the unhappy wretch pulled out from her pocket a large pair of paste shoebuckles which had excited her admiration and which she had just appropriated out of one of the bookcases in the study where they had lain  law betsy how could you go for to tell such a wicked story said hester the little kitchenmaid late on her promotionand to madame crawley so good and kind and his revrince with a curtsey and you may search all my boxes mum im sure and heres my keys as im an honest girl though of pore parents and workhouse bredand if you find so much as a beggarly bit of lace or a silk stocking out of all the gownds as youve had the picking of may i never go to church agin  give up your keys you hardened hussy hissed out the virtuous little lady in the calash  and heres a candle mum and if you please mum i can show you her room mum and the press in the housekeepers room mum where she keeps heaps and heaps of things mum cried out the eager little hester with a profusion of curtseys  hold your tongue if you please  i know the room which the creature occupies perfectly well  mrs brown have the goodness to come with me and beddoes dont you lose sight of that woman said mrs bute seizing the candle  mr crawley you had better go upstairs and see that they are not murdering your unfortunate brotherand the calash escorted by mrs brown walked away to the apartment which as she said truly she knew perfectly well  bute went upstairs and found the doctor from mudbury with the frightened horrocks over his master in a chair  they were trying to bleed sir pitt crawley  with the early morning an express was sent off to mr pitt crawley by the rectors lady who assumed the command of everything and had watched the old baronet through the night  he had been brought back to a sort of life he could not speak but seemed to recognize people mrs bute kept resolutely by his bedside  she never seemed to want to sleep that little woman and did not close her fiery black eyes once though the doctor snored in the armchair horrocks made some wild efforts to assert his authority and assist his master but mrs bute called him a tipsy old wretch and bade him never show his face again in that house or he should be transported like his abominable daughter  terrified by her manner he slunk down to the oak parlour where mr james was who having tried the bottle standing there and found no liquor in it ordered mr horrocks to get another bottle of rum which he fetched with clean glasses and to which the rector and his son sat down ordering horrocks to put down the keys at that instant and never to show his face again  cowed by this behaviour horrocks gave up the keys and he and his daughter slunk off silently through the night and gave up possession of the house of queens crawley    chapter xl  in which becky is recognized by the family  the heir of crawley arrived at home in due time after this catastrophe and henceforth may be said to have reigned in queens crawley  for though the old baronet survived many months he never recovered the use of his intellect or his speech completely and the government of the estate devolved upon his elder son  in a strange condition pitt found it  sir pitt was always buying and mortgaging he had twenty men of business and quarrels with each quarrels with all his tenants and lawsuits with them lawsuits with the lawyers lawsuits with the mining and dock companies in which he was proprietor and with every person with whom he had business  to unravel these difficulties and to set the estate clear was a task worthy of the orderly and persevering diplomatist of pumpernickel and he set himself to work with prodigious assiduity  his whole family of course was transported to queens crawley whither lady southdown of course came too and she set about converting the parish under the rectors nose and brought down her irregular clergy to the dismay of the angry mrs bute  sir pitt had concluded no bargain for the sale of the living of queens crawley when it should drop her ladyship proposed to take the patronage into her own hands and present a young protege to the rectory on which subject the diplomatic pitt said nothing  mrs butes intentions with regard to miss betsy horrocks were not carried into effect and she paid no visit to southampton gaol  she and her father left the hall when the latter took possession of the crawley arms in the village of which he had got a lease from sir pitt the exbutler had obtained a small freehold there likewise which gave him a vote for the borough  the rector had another of these votes and these and four others formed the representative body which returned the two members for queens crawley  there was a show of courtesy kept up between the rectory and the hall ladies between the younger ones at least for mrs bute and lady southdown never could meet without battles and gradually ceased seeing each other  her ladyship kept her room when the ladies from the rectory visited their cousins at the hall  perhaps mr pitt was not very much displeased at these occasional absences of his mammainlaw he believed the binkie family to be the greatest and wisest and most interesting in the world and her ladyship and his aunt had long held ascendency over him but sometimes he felt that she commanded him too much  to be considered young was complimentary doubtless but at sixandforty to be treated as a boy was sometimes mortifying  lady jane yielded up everything however to her mother  she was only fond of her children in private and it was lucky for her that lady southdowns multifarious business her conferences with ministers and her correspondence with all the missionaries of africa asia and australasia c occupied the venerable countess a great deal so that she had but little time to devote to her granddaughter the little matilda and her grandson master pitt crawley the latter was a feeble child and it was only by prodigious quantities of calomel that lady southdown was able to keep him in life at all  as for sir pitt he retired into those very apartments where lady crawley had been previously extinguished and here was tended by miss hester the girl upon her promotion with constant care and assiduity what love what fidelity what constancy is there equal to that of a nurse with good wages they smooth pillows and make arrowroot they get up at nights they bear complaints and querulousness they see the sun shining out of doors and dont want to go abroad they sleep on armchairs and eat their meals in solitude they pass long long evenings doing nothing watching the embers and the patients drink simmering in the jug they read the weekly paper the whole week through and laws serious call or the whole duty of man suffices them for literature for the yearand we quarrel with them because when their relations come to see them once a week a little gin is smuggled in in their linen basket ladies what mans love is there that would stand a years nursing of the object of his affection whereas a nurse will stand by you for ten pounds a quarter and we think her too highly paid  at least mr crawley grumbled a good deal about paying half as much to miss hester for her constant attendance upon the baronet his father  of sunshiny days this old gentleman was taken out in a chair on the terracethe very chair which miss crawley had had at brighton and which had been transported thence with a number of lady southdowns effects to queens crawley  lady jane always walked by the old man and was an evident favourite with him  he used to nod many times to her and smile when she came in and utter inarticulate deprecatory moans when she was going away  when the door shut upon her he would cry and sobwhereupon hesters face and manner which was always exceedingly bland and gentle while her lady was present would change at once and she would make faces at him and clench her fist and scream out hold your tongue you stoopid old fool and twirl away his chair from the fire which he loved to look atat which he would cry more for this was all that was left after more than seventy years of cunning and struggling and drinking and scheming and sin and selfishnessa whimpering old idiot put in and out of bed and cleaned and fed like a baby  at last a day came when the nurses occupation was over  early one morning as pitt crawley was at his stewards and bailiffs books in the study a knock came to the door and hester presented herself dropping a curtsey and said  if you please sir pitt sir pitt died this morning sir pitt  i was amaking of his toast sir pitt for his gruel sir pitt which he took every morning regular at six sir pitt andi thought i heard a moanlike sir pittandandand she dropped another curtsey  what was it that made pitts pale face flush quite red was it because he was sir pitt at last with a seat in parliament and perhaps future honours in prospect ill clear the estate now with the ready money he thought and rapidly calculated its incumbrances and the improvements which he would make  he would not use his aunts money previously lest sir pitt should recover and his outlay be in vain  all the blinds were pulled down at the hall and rectory the church bell was tolled and the chancel hung in black and bute crawley didnt go to a coursing meeting but went and dined quietly at fuddleston where they talked about his deceased brother and young sir pitt over their port  miss betsy who was by this time married to a saddler at mudbury cried a good deal the family surgeon rode over and paid his respectful compliments and inquiries for the health of their ladyships  the death was talked about at mudbury and at the crawley arms the landlord whereof had become reconciled with the rector of late who was occasionally known to step into the parlour and taste mr horrocks mild beer  shall i write to your brotheror will you asked lady jane of her husband sir pitt  i will write of course sir pitt said and invite him to the funeral  it will be but becoming  andandmrs rawdon said lady jane timidly  jane said lady southdown how can you think of such a thing  mrs rawdon must of course be asked said sir pitt resolutely  not whilst i am in the house said lady southdown  your ladyship will be pleased to recollect that i am the head of this family sir pitt replied  if you please lady jane you will write a letter to mrs rawdon crawley requesting her presence upon this melancholy occasion  jane i forbid you to put pen to paper cried the countess  i believe i am the head of this family sir pitt repeated and however much i may regret any circumstance which may lead to your ladyship quitting this house must if you please continue to govern it as i see fit  lady southdown rose up as magnificent as mrs siddons in lady macbeth and ordered that horses might be put to her carriage  if her son and daughter turned her out of their house she would hide her sorrows somewhere in loneliness and pray for their conversion to better thoughts  we dont turn you out of our house mamma said the timid lady jane imploringly  you invite such company to it as no christian lady should meet and i will have my horses tomorrow morning  have the goodness to write jane under my dictation said sir pitt rising and throwing himself into an attitude of command like the portrait of a gentleman in the exhibition and begin  queens crawley september 14 1822my dear brother  hearing these decisive and terrible words lady macbeth who had been waiting for a sign of weakness or vacillation on the part of her soninlaw rose and with a scared look left the library lady jane looked up to her husband as if she would fain follow and soothe her mamma but pitt forbade his wife to move  she wont go away he said  she has let her house at brighton and has spent her last halfyears dividends a countess living at an inn is a ruined woman  i have been waiting long for an opportunityto take thisthis decisive step my love for as you must perceive it is impossible that there should be two chiefs in a family and now if you please we will resume the dictation  my dear brother the melancholy intelligence which it is my duty to convey to my family must have been long anticipated by c  in a word pitt having come to his kingdom and having by good luck or desert rather as he considered assumed almost all the fortune which his other relatives had expected was determined to treat his family kindly and respectably and make a house of queens crawley once more it pleased him to think that he should be its chief  he proposed to use the vast influence that his commanding talents and position must speedily acquire for him in the county to get his brother placed and his cousins decently provided for and perhaps had a little sting of repentance as he thought that he was the proprietor of all that they had hoped for  in the course of three or four days reign his bearing was changed and his plans quite fixed  he determined to rule justly and honestly to depose lady southdown and to be on the friendliest possible terms with all the relations of his blood  so he dictated a letter to his brother rawdona solemn and elaborate letter containing the profoundest observations couched in the longest words and filling with wonder the simple little secretary who wrote under her husbands order  what an orator this will be thought she when he enters the house of commons on which point and on the tyranny of lady southdown pitt had sometimes dropped hints to his wife in bed how wise and good and what a genius my husband is  i fancied him a little cold but how good and what a genius  the fact is pitt crawley had got every word of the letter by heart and had studied it with diplomatic secrecy deeply and perfectly long before he thought fit to communicate it to his astonished wife  this letter with a huge black border and seal was accordingly despatched by sir pitt crawley to his brother the colonel in london rawdon crawley was but halfpleased at the receipt of it whats the use of going down to that stupid place thought he  i cant stand being alone with pitt after dinner and horses there and back will cost us twenty pound  he carried the letter as he did all difficulties to becky upstairs in her bedroomwith her chocolate which he always made and took to her of a morning  he put the tray with the breakfast and the letter on the dressingtable before which becky sat combing her yellow hair  she took up the blackedged missive and having read it she jumped up from the chair crying hurray and waving the note round her head  hurray said rawdon wondering at the little figure capering about in a streaming flannel dressinggown with tawny locks dishevelled hes not left us anything becky  i had my share when i came of age  youll never be of age you silly old man becky replied  run out now to madam brunoys for i must have some mourning  and get a crape on your hat and a black waistcoati dont think youve got one order it to be brought home tomorrow so that we may be able to start on thursday  you dont mean to go rawdon interposed  of course i mean to go  i mean that lady jane shall present me at court next year  i mean that your brother shall give you a seat in parliament you stupid old creature  i mean that lord steyne shall have your vote and his my dear old silly man and that you shall be an irish secretary or a west indian governor  or a treasurer or a consul or some such thing  posting will cost a dooce of a lot of money grumbled rawdon  we might take southdowns carriage which ought to be present at the funeral as he is a relation of the family  but noi intend that we shall go by the coach theyll like it better  it seems more humble  rawdy goes of course the colonel asked  no such thing why pay an extra place hes too big to travel bodkin between you and me  let him stay here in the nursery and briggs can make him a black frock  go you and do as i bid you and you had best tell sparks your man that old sir pitt is dead and that you will come in for something considerable when the affairs are arranged  hell tell this to raggles who has been pressing for money and it will console poor raggles and so becky began sipping her chocolate  when the faithful lord steyne arrived in the evening he found becky and her companion who was no other than our friend briggs busy cutting ripping snipping and tearing all sorts of black stuffs available for the melancholy occasion  miss briggs and i are plunged in grief and despondency for the death of our papa rebecca said  sir pitt crawley is dead my lord  we have been tearing our hair all the morning and now we are tearing up our old clothes  oh rebecca how can you was all that briggs could say as she turned up her eyes  oh rebecca how can you echoed my lord  so that old scoundrels dead is he he might have been a peer if he had played his cards better  mr pitt had very nearly made him but he ratted always at the wrong time  what an old silenus it was  i might have been silenuss widow said rebecca dont you remember miss briggs how you peeped in at the door and saw old sir pitt on his knees to me miss briggs our old friend blushed very much at this reminiscence and was glad when lord steyne ordered her to go downstairs and make him a cup of tea  briggs was the housedog whom rebecca had provided as guardian of her innocence and reputation  miss crawley had left her a little annuity she would have been content to remain in the crawley family with lady jane who was good to her and to everybody but lady southdown dismissed poor briggs as quickly as decency permitted and mr pitt who thought himself much injured by the uncalledfor generosity of his deceased relative towards a lady who had only been miss crawleys faithful retainer a score of years made no objection to that exercise of the dowagers authority bowls and firkin likewise received their legacies and their dismissals and married and set up a lodginghouse according to the custom of their kind  briggs tried to live with her relations in the country but found that attempt was vain after the better society to which she had been accustomed  briggss friends small tradesmen in a country town quarrelled over miss briggss forty pounds a year as eagerly and more openly than miss crawleys kinsfolk had for that ladys inheritance briggss brother a radical hatter and grocer called his sister a purseproud aristocrat because she would not advance a part of her capital to stock his shop and she would have done so most likely but that their sister a dissenting shoemakers lady at variance with the hatter and grocer who went to another chapel showed how their brother was on the verge of bankruptcy and took possession of briggs for a while  the dissenting shoemaker wanted miss briggs to send his son to college and make a gentleman of him between them the two families got a great portion of her private savings out of her and finally she fled to london followed by the anathemas of both and determined to seek for servitude again as infinitely less onerous than liberty  and advertising in the papers that a gentlewoman of agreeable manners and accustomed to the best society was anxious to c she took up her residence with mr bowls in half moon street and waited the result of the advertisement  so it was that she fell in with rebecca  mrs rawdons dashing little carriage and ponies was whirling down the street one day just as miss briggs fatigued had reached mr bowlss door after a weary walk to the times office in the city to insert her advertisement for the sixth time  rebecca was driving and at once recognized the gentlewoman with agreeable manners and being a perfectly goodhumoured woman as we have seen and having a regard for briggs she pulled up the ponies at the doorsteps gave the reins to the groom and jumping out had hold of both briggss hands before she of the agreeable manners had recovered from the shock of seeing an old friend  briggs cried and becky laughed a great deal and kissed the gentlewoman as soon as they got into the passage and thence into mrs bowlss front parlour with the red moreen curtains and the round lookingglass with the chained eagle above gazing upon the back of the ticket in the window which announced apartments to let  briggs told all her history amidst those perfectly uncalledfor sobs and ejaculations of wonder with which women of her soft nature salute an old acquaintance or regard a rencontre in the street for though people meet other people every day yet some there are who insist upon discovering miracles and women even though they have disliked each other begin to cry when they meet deploring and remembering the time when they last quarrelled  so in a word briggs told all her history and becky gave a narrative of her own life with her usual artlessness and candour  mrs bowls late firkin came and listened grimly in the passage to the hysterical sniffling and giggling which went on in the front parlour becky had never been a favourite of hers  since the establishment of the married couple in london they had frequented their former friends of the house of raggles and did not like the latters account of the colonels menage  i wouldnt trust him ragg my boy bowls remarked and his wife when mrs rawdon issued from the parlour only saluted the lady with a very sour curtsey and her fingers were like so many sausages cold and lifeless when she held them out in deference to mrs rawdon who persisted in shaking hands with the retired ladys maid  she whirled away into piccadilly nodding with the sweetest of smiles towards miss briggs who hung nodding at the window close under the advertisementcard and at the next moment was in the park with a halfdozen of dandies cantering after her carriage  when she found how her friend was situated and how having a snug legacy from miss crawley salary was no object to our gentlewoman becky instantly formed some benevolent little domestic plans concerning her  this was just such a companion as would suit her establishment and she invited briggs to come to dinner with her that very evening when she should see beckys dear little darling rawdon  mrs bowls cautioned her lodger against venturing into the lions den wherein you will rue it miss b mark my words and as sure as my name is bowls and briggs promised to be very cautious  the upshot of which caution was that she went to live with mrs rawdon the next week and had lent rawdon crawley six hundred pounds upon annuity before six months were over    chapter xli  in which becky revisits the halls of her ancestors  so the mourning being ready and sir pitt crawley warned of their arrival colonel crawley and his wife took a couple of places in the same old highflyer coach by which rebecca had travelled in the defunct baronets company on her first journey into the world some nine years before  how well she remembered the inn yard and the ostler to whom she refused money and the insinuating cambridge lad who wrapped her in his coat on the journey  rawdon took his place outside and would have liked to drive but his grief forbade him he sat by the coachman and talked about horses and the road the whole way and who kept the inns and who horsed the coach by which he had travelled so many a time when he and pitt were boys going to eton  at mudbury a carriage and a pair of horses received them with a coachman in black  its the old drag rawdon rebecca said as they got in  the worms have eaten the cloth a good dealtheres the stain which sir pittha  i see dawson the ironmonger has his shutters upwhich sir pitt made such a noise about it was a bottle of cherry brandy he broke which we went to fetch for your aunt from southampton  how time flies to be sure  that cant be polly talboys that bouncing girl standing by her mother at the cottage there  i remember her a mangy little urchin picking weeds in the garden  fine gal said rawdon returning the salute which the cottage gave him by two fingers applied to his crape hatband  becky bowed and saluted and recognized people here and there graciously  these recognitions were inexpressibly pleasant to her  it seemed as if she was not an imposter any more and was coming to the home of her ancestors  rawdon was rather abashed and cast down on the other hand what recollections of boyhood and innocence might have been flitting across his brain what pangs of dim remorse and doubt and shame  your sisters must be young women now rebecca said thinking of those girls for the first time perhaps since she had left them  dont know im shaw replied the colonel  hullo heres old mother lock  howdydo mrs lock remember me dont you master rawdon hey dammy how those old women last she was a hundred when i was a boy  they were going through the lodgegates kept by old mrs lock whose hand rebecca insisted upon shaking as she flung open the creaking old iron gate and the carriage passed between the two mossgrown pillars surmounted by the dove and serpent  the governor has cut into the timber rawdon said looking about and then was silentso was becky  both of them were rather agitated and thinking of old times he about eton and his mother whom he remembered a frigid demure woman and a sister who died of whom he had been passionately fond and how he used to thrash pitt and about little rawdy at home  and rebecca thought about her own youth and the dark secrets of those early tainted days and of her entrance into life by yonder gates and of miss pinkerton and joe and amelia  the gravel walk and terrace had been scraped quite clean  a grand painted hatchment was already over the great entrance and two very solemn and tall personages in black flung open each a leaf of the door as the carriage pulled up at the familiar steps  rawdon turned red and becky somewhat pale as they passed through the old hall arm in arm  she pinched her husbands arm as they entered the oak parlour where sir pitt and his wife were ready to receive them sir pitt in black lady jane in black and my lady southdown with a large black headpiece of bugles and feathers which waved on her ladyships head like an undertakers tray  sir pitt had judged correctly that she would not quit the premises she contented herself by preserving a solemn and stony silence when in company of pitt and his rebellious wife and by frightening the children in the nursery by the ghastly gloom of her demeanour only a very faint bending of the headdress and plumes welcomed rawdon and his wife as those prodigals returned to their family  to say the truth they were not affected very much one way or other by this coolness  her ladyship was a person only of secondary consideration in their minds just thenthey were intent upon the reception which the reigning brother and sister would afford them  pitt with rather a heightened colour went up and shook his brother by the hand and saluted rebecca with a handshake and a very low bow but lady jane took both the hands of her sisterinlaw and kissed her affectionately the embrace somehow brought tears into the eyes of the little adventuresswhich ornaments as we know she wore very seldom the artless mark of kindness and confidence touched and pleased her and rawdon encouraged by this demonstration on his sisters part twirled up his mustachios and took leave to salute lady jane with a kiss which caused her ladyship to blush exceedingly  devlish nice little woman lady jane was his verdict when he and his wife were together again  pitts got fat too and is doing the thing handsomely he can afford it said rebecca and agreed in her husbands farther opinion that the motherinlaw was a tremendous old guyand that the sisters were rather welllooking young women  they too had been summoned from school to attend the funeral ceremonies  it seemed sir pitt crawley for the dignity of the house and family had thought right to have about the place as many persons in black as could possibly be assembled  all the men and maids of the house the old women of the alms house whom the elder sir pitt had cheated out of a great portion of their due the parish clerks family and the special retainers of both hall and rectory were habited in sable added to these the undertakers men at least a score with crapes and hatbands and who made goodly show when the great burying show took placebut these are mute personages in our drama and having nothing to do or say need occupy a very little space here  with regard to her sistersinlaw rebecca did not attempt to forget her former position of governess towards them but recalled it frankly and kindly and asked them about their studies with great gravity and told them that she had thought of them many and many a day and longed to know of their welfare  in fact you would have supposed that ever since she had left them she had not ceased to keep them uppermost in her thoughts and to take the tenderest interest in their welfare  so supposed lady crawley herself and her young sisters  shes hardly changed since eight years said miss rosalind to miss violet as they were preparing for dinner  those redhaired women look wonderfully well replied the other  hers is much darker than it was i think she must dye it miss rosalind added  she is stouter too and altogether improved continued miss rosalind who was disposed to be very fat  at least she gives herself no airs and remembers that she was our governess once miss violet said intimating that it befitted all governesses to keep their proper place and forgetting altogether that she was granddaughter not only of sir walpole crawley but of mr dawson of mudbury and so had a coalscuttle in her scutcheon there are other very wellmeaning people whom one meets every day in vanity fair who are surely equally oblivious  it cant be true what the girls at the rectory said that her mother was an operadancer  a person cant help their birth rosalind replied with great liberality  and i agree with our brother that as she is in the family of course we are bound to notice her i am sure aunt bute need not talk she wants to marry kate to young hooper the winemerchant and absolutely asked him to come to the rectory for orders  i wonder whether lady southdown will go away she looked very glum upon mrs rawdon the other said  i wish she would  i wont read the washerwoman of finchley common vowed violet and so saying and avoiding a passage at the end of which a certain coffin was placed with a couple of watchers and lights perpetually burning in the closed room these young women came down to the family dinner for which the bell rang as usual  but before this lady jane conducted rebecca to the apartments prepared for her which with the rest of the house had assumed a very much improved appearance of order and comfort during pitts regency and here beholding that mrs rawdons modest little trunks had arrived and were placed in the bedroom and dressingroom adjoining helped her to take off her neat black bonnet and cloak and asked her sisterinlaw in what more she could be useful  what i should like best said rebecca would be to go to the nursery and see your dear little children on which the two ladies looked very kindly at each other and went to that apartment hand in hand  becky admired little matilda who was not quite four years old as the most charming little love in the world and the boy a little fellow of two yearspale heavyeyed and largeheadedshe pronounced to be a perfect prodigy in point of size intelligence and beauty  i wish mamma would not insist on giving him so much medicine lady jane said with a sigh  i often think we should all be better without it and then lady jane and her newfound friend had one of those confidential medical conversations about the children which all mothers and most women as i am given to understand delight in fifty years ago and when the present writer being an interesting little boy was ordered out of the room with the ladies after dinner i remember quite well that their talk was chiefly about their ailments and putting this question directly to two or three since i have always got from them the acknowledgement that times are not changed  let my fair readers remark for themselves this very evening when they quit the desserttable and assemble to celebrate the drawingroom mysteries wellin half an hour becky and lady jane were close and intimate friendsand in the course of the evening her ladyship informed sir pitt that she thought her new sisterinlaw was a kind frank unaffected and affectionate young woman  and so having easily won the daughters goodwill the indefatigable little woman bent herself to conciliate the august lady southdown as soon as she found her ladyship alone rebecca attacked her on the nursery question at once and said that her own little boy was saved actually saved by calomel freely administered when all the physicians in paris had given the dear child up  and then she mentioned how often she had heard of lady southdown from that excellent man the reverend lawrence grills minister of the chapel in may fair which she frequented and how her views were very much changed by circumstances and misfortunes and how she hoped that a past life spent in worldliness and error might not incapacitate her from more serious thought for the future she described how in former days she had been indebted to mr crawley for religious instruction touched upon the washerwoman of finchley common which she had read with the greatest profit and asked about lady emily its gifted author now lady emily hornblower at cape town where her husband had strong hopes of becoming bishop of caffraria  but she crowned all and confirmed herself in lady southdowns favour by feeling very much agitated and unwell after the funeral and requesting her ladyships medical advice which the dowager not only gave but wrapped up in a bedgown and looking more like lady macbeth than ever came privately in the night to beckys room with a parcel of favourite tracts and a medicine of her own composition which she insisted that mrs rawdon should take  becky first accepted the tracts and began to examine them with great interest engaging the dowager in a conversation concerning them and the welfare of her soul by which means she hoped that her body might escape medication  but after the religious topics were exhausted lady macbeth would not quit beckys chamber until her cup of nightdrink was emptied too and poor mrs rawdon was compelled actually to assume a look of gratitude and to swallow the medicine under the unyielding old dowagers nose who left her victim finally with a benediction  it did not much comfort mrs rawdon her countenance was very queer when rawdon came in and heard what had happened and his explosions of laughter were as loud as usual when becky with a fun which she could not disguise even though it was at her own expense described the occurrence and how she had been victimized by lady southdown  lord steyne and her son in london had many a laugh over the story when rawdon and his wife returned to their quarters in may fair  becky acted the whole scene for them  she put on a nightcap and gown  she preached a great sermon in the true serious manner she lectured on the virtue of the medicine which she pretended to administer with a gravity of imitation so perfect that you would have thought it was the countesss own roman nose through which she snuffled give us lady southdown and the black dose was a constant cry amongst the folks in beckys little drawingroom in may fair  and for the first time in her life the dowager countess of southdown was made amusing  sir pitt remembered the testimonies of respect and veneration which rebecca had paid personally to himself in early days and was tolerably well disposed towards her  the marriage illadvised as it was had improved rawdon very muchthat was clear from the colonels altered habits and demeanourand had it not been a lucky union as regarded pitt himself the cunning diplomatist smiled inwardly as he owned that he owed his fortune to it and acknowledged that he at least ought not to cry out against it  his satisfaction was not removed by rebeccas own statements behaviour and conversation  she doubled the deference which before had charmed him calling out his conversational powers in such a manner as quite to surprise pitt himself who always inclined to respect his own talents admired them the more when rebecca pointed them out to him  with her sisterinlaw rebecca was satisfactorily able to prove that it was mrs bute crawley who brought about the marriage which she afterwards so calumniated that it was mrs butes avaricewho hoped to gain all miss crawleys fortune and deprive rawdon of his aunts favourwhich caused and invented all the wicked reports against rebecca  she succeeded in making us poor rebecca said with an air of angelical patience but how can i be angry with a woman who has given me one of the best husbands in the world and has not her own avarice been sufficiently punished by the ruin of her own hopes and the loss of the property by which she set so much store poor she cried  dear lady jane what care we for poverty i am used to it from childhood and i am often thankful that miss crawleys money has gone to restore the splendour of the noble old family of which i am so proud to be a member  i am sure sir pitt will make a much better use of it than rawdon would  all these speeches were reported to sir pitt by the most faithful of wives and increased the favourable impression which rebecca made so much so that when on the third day after the funeral the family party were at dinner sir pitt crawley carving fowls at the head of the table actually said to mrs rawdon ahem  rebecca may i give you a winga speech which made the little womans eyes sparkle with pleasure  while rebecca was prosecuting the above schemes and hopes and pitt crawley arranging the funeral ceremonial and other matters connected with his future progress and dignity and lady jane busy with her nursery as far as her mother would let her and the sun rising and setting and the clocktower bell of the hall ringing to dinner and to prayers as usual the body of the late owner of queens crawley lay in the apartment which he had occupied watched unceasingly by the professional attendants who were engaged for that rite  a woman or two and three or four undertakers men the best whom southampton could furnish dressed in black and of a proper stealthy and tragical demeanour had charge of the remains which they watched turn about having the housekeepers room for their place of rendezvous when off duty where they played at cards in privacy and drank their beer  the members of the family and servants of the house kept away from the gloomy spot where the bones of the descendant of an ancient line of knights and gentlemen lay awaiting their final consignment to the family crypt no regrets attended them save those of the poor woman who had hoped to be sir pitts wife and widow and who had fled in disgrace from the hall over which she had so nearly been a ruler beyond her and a favourite old pointer he had and between whom and himself an attachment subsisted during the period of his imbecility the old man had not a single friend to mourn him having indeed during the whole course of his life never taken the least pains to secure one  could the best and kindest of us who depart from the earth have an opportunity of revisiting it i suppose he or she assuming that any vanity fair feelings subsist in the sphere whither we are bound would have a pang of mortification at finding how soon our survivors were consoled  and so sir pitt was forgottenlike the kindest and best of usonly a few weeks sooner  those who will may follow his remains to the grave whither they were borne on the appointed day in the most becoming manner the family in black coaches with their handkerchiefs up to their noses ready for the tears which did not come the undertaker and his gentlemen in deep tribulation the select tenantry mourning out of compliment to the new landlord the neighbouring gentrys carriages at three miles an hour empty and in profound affliction the parson speaking out the formula about our dear brother departed as long as we have a mans body we play our vanities upon it surrounding it with humbug and ceremonies laying it in state and packing it up in gilt nails and velvet and we finish our duty by placing over it a stone written all over with lies butes curate a smart young fellow from oxford and sir pitt crawley composed between them an appropriate latin epitaph for the late lamented baronet and the former preached a classical sermon exhorting the survivors not to give way to grief and informing them in the most respectful terms that they also would be one day called upon to pass that gloomy and mysterious portal which had just closed upon the remains of their lamented brother then the tenantry mounted on horseback again or stayed and refreshed themselves at the crawley arms  then after a lunch in the servants hall at queens crawley the gentrys carriages wheeled off to their different destinations then the undertakers men taking the ropes palls velvets ostrich feathers and other mortuary properties clambered up on the roof of the hearse and rode off to southampton  their faces relapsed into a natural expression as the horses clearing the lodgegates got into a brisker trot on the open road and squads of them might have been seen speckling with black the publichouse entrances with pewterpots flashing in the sunshine  sir pitts invalid chair was wheeled away into a toolhouse in the garden the old pointer used to howl sometimes at first but these were the only accents of grief which were heard in the hall of which sir pitt crawley baronet had been master for some threescore years  as the birds were pretty plentiful and partridge shooting is as it were the duty of an english gentleman of statesmanlike propensities sir pitt crawley the first shock of grief over went out a little and partook of that diversion in a white hat with crape round it the sight of those fields of stubble and turnips now his own gave him many secret joys  sometimes and with an exquisite humility he took no gun but went out with a peaceful bamboo cane rawdon his big brother and the keepers blazing away at his side  pitts money and acres had a great effect upon his brother  the penniless colonel became quite obsequious and respectful to the head of his house and despised the milksop pitt no longer  rawdon listened with sympathy to his seniors prospects of planting and draining gave his advice about the stables and cattle rode over to mudbury to look at a mare which he thought would carry lady jane and offered to break her c  the rebellious dragoon was quite humbled and subdued and became a most creditable younger brother  he had constant bulletins from miss briggs in london respecting little rawdon who was left behind there who sent messages of his own  i am very well he wrote  i hope you are very well  i hope mamma is very well  the pony is very well  grey takes me to ride in the park i can canter  i met the little boy who rode before  he cried when he cantered  i do not cry rawdon read these letters to his brother and lady jane who was delighted with them  the baronet promised to take charge of the lad at school and his kindhearted wife gave rebecca a banknote begging her to buy a present with it for her little nephew  one day followed another and the ladies of the house passed their life in those calm pursuits and amusements which satisfy country ladies bells rang to meals and to prayers  the young ladies took exercise on the pianoforte every morning after breakfast rebecca giving them the benefit of her instruction  then they put on thick shoes and walked in the park or shrubberies or beyond the palings into the village descending upon the cottages with lady southdowns medicine and tracts for the sick people there  lady southdown drove out in a ponychaise when rebecca would take her place by the dowagers side and listen to her solemn talk with the utmost interest  she sang handel and haydn to the family of evenings and engaged in a large piece of worsted work as if she had been born to the business and as if this kind of life was to continue with her until she should sink to the grave in a polite old age leaving regrets and a great quantity of consols behind heras if there were not cares and duns schemes shifts and poverty waiting outside the park gates to pounce upon her when she issued into the world again  it isnt difficult to be a country gentlemans wife rebecca thought i think i could be a good woman if i had five thousand a year  i could dawdle about in the nursery and count the apricots on the wall i could water plants in a greenhouse and pick off dead leaves from the geraniums  i could ask old women about their rheumatisms and order halfacrowns worth of soup for the poor  i shouldnt miss it much out of five thousand a year  i could even drive out ten miles to dine at a neighbours and dress in the fashions of the year before last i could go to church and keep awake in the great family pew or go to sleep behind the curtains with my veil down if i only had practice i could pay everybody if i had but the money  this is what the conjurors here pride themselves upon doing  they look down with pity upon us miserable sinners who have none  they think themselves generous if they give our children a fivepound note and us contemptible if we are without one and who knows but rebecca was right in her speculationsand that it was only a question of money and fortune which made the difference between her and an honest woman if you take temptations into account who is to say that he is better than his neighbour a comfortable career of prosperity if it does not make people honest at least keeps them so  an alderman coming from a turtle feast will not step out of his carnage to steal a leg of mutton but put him to starve and see if he will not purloin a loaf  becky consoled herself by so balancing the chances and equalizing the distribution of good and evil in the world  the old haunts the old fields and woods the copses ponds and gardens the rooms of the old house where she had spent a couple of years seven years ago were all carefully revisited by her  she had been young there or comparatively so for she forgot the time when she ever was youngbut she remembered her thoughts and feelings seven years back and contrasted them with those which she had at present now that she had seen the world and lived with great people and raised herself far beyond her original humble station  i have passed beyond it because i have brains becky thought and almost all the rest of the world are fools i could not go back and consort with those people now whom i used to meet in my fathers studio  lords come up to my door with stars and garters instead of poor artists with screws of tobacco in their pockets  i have a gentleman for my husband and an earls daughter for my sister in the very house where i was little better than a servant a few years ago but am i much better to do now in the world than i was when i was the poor painters daughter and wheedled the grocer round the corner for sugar and tea suppose i had married francis who was so fond of mei couldnt have been much poorer than i am now  heigho  i wish i could exchange my position in society and all my relations for a snug sum in the three per cent  consols for so it was that becky felt the vanity of human affairs and it was in those securities that she would have liked to cast anchor  it may perhaps have struck her that to have been honest and humble to have done her duty and to have marched straightforward on her way would have brought her as near happiness as that path by which she was striving to attain it  butjust as the children at queens crawley went round the room where the body of their father layif ever becky had these thoughts she was accustomed to walk round them and not look in  she eluded them and despised themor at least she was committed to the other path from which retreat was now impossible  and for my part i believe that remorse is the least active of all a mans moral sensesthe very easiest to be deadened when wakened and in some never wakened at all  we grieve at being found out and at the idea of shame or punishment but the mere sense of wrong makes very few people unhappy in vanity fair  so rebecca during her stay at queens crawley made as many friends of the mammon of unrighteousness as she could possibly bring under control  lady jane and her husband bade her farewell with the warmest demonstrations of goodwill  they looked forward with pleasure to the time when the family house in gaunt street being repaired and beautified they were to meet again in london  lady southdown made her up a packet of medicine and sent a letter by her to the rev lawrence grills exhorting that gentleman to save the brand who honoured the letter from the burning  pitt accompanied them with four horses in the carriage to mudbury having sent on their baggage in a cart previously accompanied with loads of game  how happy you will be to see your darling little boy again lady crawley said taking leave of her kinswoman  oh so happy said rebecca throwing up the green eyes she was immensely happy to be free of the place and yet loath to go queens crawley was abominably stupid and yet the air there was somehow purer than that which she had been accustomed to breathe everybody had been dull but had been kind in their way  it is all the influence of a long course of three per cents becky said to herself and was right very likely  however the london lamps flashed joyfully as the stage rolled into piccadilly and briggs had made a beautiful fire in curzon street and little rawdon was up to welcome back his papa and mamma    chapter xlii  which treats of the osborne family  considerable time has elapsed since we have seen our respectable friend old mr osborne of russell square  he has not been the happiest of mortals since last we met him events have occurred which have not improved his temper and in more in stances than one he has not been allowed to have his own way  to be thwarted in this reasonable desire was always very injurious to the old gentleman and resistance became doubly exasperating when gout age loneliness and the force of many disappointments combined to weigh him down  his stiff black hair began to grow quite white soon after his sons death hisface grew redder his hands trembled more and more as he poured out his glass of port wine  he led his clerks a dire life in the city his family at home were not much happier  i doubt if rebecca whom we have seen piously praying for consols would have exchanged her poverty and the daredevil excitement and chances of her life for osbornes money and the humdrum gloom which enveloped him  he had proposed for miss swartz but had been rejected scornfully by the partisans of that lady who married her to a young sprig of scotch nobility  he was a man to have married a woman out of low life and bullied her dreadfully afterwards but no person presented herself suitable to his taste and instead he tyrannized over his unmarried daughter at home  she had a fine carriage and fine horses and sat at the head of a table loaded with the grandest plate  she had a chequebook a prize footman to follow her when she walked unlimited credit and bows and compliments from all the tradesmen and all the appurtenances of an heiress but she spent a woeful time the little charitygirls at the foundling the sweeperess at the crossing the poorest underkitchenmaid in the servants hall was happy compared to that unfortunate and now middleaged young lady  frederick bullock esq of the house of bullock hulker and bullock had married maria osborne not without a great deal of difficulty and grumbling on mr bullocks part george being dead and cut out of his fathers will frederick insisted that the half of the old gentlemans property should be settled upon his maria and indeed for a long time refused to come to the scratch it was mr fredericks own expression on any other terms  osborne said fred had agreed to take his daughter with twenty thousand and he should bind himself to no more  fred might take it and welcome or leave it and go and be hanged fred whose hopes had been raised when george had been disinherited thought himself infamously swindled by the old merchant and for some time made as if he would break off the match altogether osborne withdrew his account from bullock and hulkers went on change with a horsewhip which he swore he would lay across the back of a certain scoundrel that should be nameless and demeaned himself in his usual violent manner  jane osborne condoled with her sister maria during this family feud  i always told you maria that it was your money he loved and not you she said soothingly  he selected me and my money at any rate he didnt choose you and yours replied maria tossing up her head  the rapture was however only temporary  freds father and senior partners counselled him to take maria even with the twenty thousand settled half down and half at the death of mr osborne with the chances of the further division of the property  so he knuckled down again to use his own phrase and sent old hulker with peaceable overtures to osborne  it was his father he said who would not hear of the match and had made the difficulties he was most anxious to keep the engagement  the excuse was sulkily accepted by mr osborne hulker and bullock were a high family of the city aristocracy and connected with the nobs at the west end it was something for the old man to be able to say my son sir of the house of hulker bullock and co sir my daughters cousin lady mary mango sir daughter of the right hon  the earl of castlemouldy in his imagination he saw his house peopled by the nobs so he forgave young bullock and consented that the marriage should take place  it was a grand affairthe bridegrooms relatives giving the breakfast their habitations being near st  georges hanover square where the business took place  the nobs of the west end were invited and many of them signed the book  mr mango and lady mary mango were there with the dear young gwendoline and guinever mango as bridesmaids colonel bludyer of the dragoon guards eldest son of the house of bludyer brothers mincing lane another cousin of the bridegroom and the honourable mrs bludyer the honourable george boulter lord levants son and his lady miss mango that was lord viscount castletoddy honourable james mcmull and mrs mcmull formerly miss swartz and a host of fashionables who have all married into lombard street and done a great deal to ennoble cornhill  the young couple had a house near berkeley square and a small villa at roehampton among the banking colony there  fred was considered to have made rather a mesalliance by the ladies of his family whose grandfather had been in a charity school and who were allied through the husbands with some of the best blood in england  and maria was bound by superior pride and great care in the composition of her visitingbook to make up for the defects of birth and felt it her duty to see her father and sister as little as possible  that she should utterly break with the old man who had still so many scores of thousand pounds to give away is absurd to suppose fred bullock would never allow her to do that  but she was still young and incapable of hiding her feelings and by inviting her papa and sister to her thirdrate parties and behaving very coldly to them when they came and by avoiding russell square and indiscreetly begging her father to quit that odious vulgar place she did more harm than all fredericks diplomacy could repair and perilled her chance of her inheritance like a giddy heedless creature as she was  so russell square is not good enough for mrs maria hay said the old gentleman rattling up the carriage windows as he and his daughter drove away one night from mrs frederick bullocks after dinner  so she invites her father and sister to a second days dinner if those sides or ontrys as she calls em werent served yesterday im dd and to meet city folks and littery men and keeps the earls and the ladies and the honourables to herself honourables damn honourables  i am a plain british merchant i am and could buy the beggarly hounds over and over  lords indeedwhy at one of her swarreys i saw one of em speak to a dam fiddlera fellar i despise and they wont come to russell square wont they why ill lay my life ive got a better glass of wine and pay a better figure for it and can show a handsomer service of silver and can lay a better dinner on my mahogany than ever they see on theirsthe cringing sneaking stuckup fools  drive on quick james  i want to get back to russell squareha ha and he sank back into the corner with a furious laugh with such reflections on his own superior merit it was the custom of the old gentleman not unfrequently to console himself  jane osborne could not but concur in these opinions respecting her sisters conduct and when mrs fredericks firstborn frederick augustus howard stanley devereux bullock was born old osborne who was invited to the christening and to be godfather contented himself with sending the child a gold cup with twenty guineas inside it for the nurse  thats more than any of your lords will give ill warrant he said and refused to attend at the ceremony  the splendour of the gift however caused great satisfaction to the house of bullock  maria thought that her father was very much pleased with her and frederick augured the best for his little son and heir  one can fancy the pangs with which miss osborne in her solitude in russell square read the morning post where her sisters name occurred every now and then in the articles headed fashionable reunions and where she had an opportunity of reading a description of mrs f bullocks costume when presented at the drawing room by lady frederica bullock  janes own life as we have said admitted of no such grandeur  it was an awful existence she had to get up of black winters mornings to make breakfast for her scowling old father who would have turned the whole house out of doors if his tea had not been ready at halfpast eight  she remained silent opposite to him listening to the urn hissing and sitting in tremor while the parent read his paper and consumed his accustomed portion of muffins and tea at halfpast nine he rose and went to the city and she was almost free till dinnertime to make visitations in the kitchen and to scold the servants to drive abroad and descend upon the tradesmen who were prodigiously respectful to leave her cards and her papas at the great glum respectable houses of their city friends or to sit alone in the large drawingroom expecting visitors and working at a huge piece of worsted by the fire on the sofa hard by the great iphigenia clock which ticked and tolled with mournful loudness in the dreary room  the great glass over the mantelpiece faced by the other great console glass at the opposite end of the room increased and multiplied between them the brown holland bag in which the chandelier hung until you saw these brown holland bags fading away in endless perspectives and this apartment of miss osbornes seemed the centre of a system of drawingrooms when she removed the cordovan leather from the grand piano and ventured to play a few notes on it it sounded with a mournful sadness startling the dismal echoes of the house  georges picture was gone and laid upstairs in a lumberroom in the garret and though there was a consciousness of him and father and daughter often instinctively knew that they were thinking of him no mention was ever made of the brave and once darling son  at five oclock mr osborne came back to his dinner which he and his daughter took in silence seldom broken except when he swore and was savage if the cooking was not to his liking or which they shared twice in a month with a party of dismal friends of osbornes rank and age  old dr gulp and his lady from bloomsbury square old mr frowser the attorney from bedford row a very great man and from his business handinglove with the nobs at the west end old colonel livermore of the bombay army and mrs livermore from upper bedford place old sergeant toffy and mrs toffy and sometimes old sir thomas coffin and lady coffin from bedford square  sir thomas was celebrated as a hanging judge and the particular tawny port was produced when he dined with mr osborne  these people and their like gave the pompous russell square merchant pompous dinners back again  they had solemn rubbers of whist when they went upstairs after drinking and their carriages were called at half past ten many rich people whom we poor devils are in the habit of envying lead contentedly an existence like that above described jane osborne scarcely ever met a man under sixty and almost the only bachelor who appeared in their society was mr smirk the celebrated ladies doctor  i cant say that nothing had occurred to disturb the monotony of this awful existence  the fact is there had been a secret in poor janes life which had made her father more savage and morose than even nature pride and overfeeding had made him  this secret was connected with miss wirt who had a cousin an artist mr smee very celebrated since as a portraitpainter and ra but who once was glad enough to give drawing lessons to ladies of fashion  mr smee has forgotten where russell square is now but he was glad enough to visit it in the year 1818 when miss osborne had instruction from him  smee formerly a pupil of sharpe of frith street a dissolute irregular and unsuccessful man but a man with great knowledge of his art being the cousin of miss wirt we say and introduced by her to miss osborne whose hand and heart were still free after various incomplete love affairs felt a great attachment for this lady and it is believed inspired one in her bosom  miss wirt was the confidante of this intrigue  i know not whether she used to leave the room where the master and his pupil were painting in order to give them an opportunity for exchanging those vows and sentiments which cannot be uttered advantageously in the presence of a third party i know not whether she hoped that should her cousin succeed in carrying off the rich merchants daughter he would give miss wirt a portion of the wealth which she had enabled him to winall that is certain is that mr osborne got some hint of the transaction came back from the city abruptly and entered the drawingroom with his bamboo cane found the painter the pupil and the companion all looking exceedingly pale there turned the former out of doors with menaces that he would break every bone in his skin and half an hour afterwards dismissed miss wirt likewise kicking her trunks down the stairs trampling on her bandboxes and shaking his fist at her hackney coach as it bore her away  jane osborne kept her bedroom for many days  she was not allowed to have a companion afterwards  her father swore to her that she should not have a shilling of his money if she made any match without his concurrence and as he wanted a woman to keep his house he did not choose that she should marry so that she was obliged to give up all projects with which cupid had any share during her papas life then she resigned herself to the manner of existence here described and was content to be an old maid  her sister meanwhile was having children with finer names every year and the intercourse between the two grew fainter continually  jane and i do not move in the same sphere of life mrs bullock said  i regard her as a sister of coursewhich meanswhat does it mean when a lady says that she regards jane as a sister  it has been described how the misses dobbin lived with their father at a fine villa at denmark hill where there were beautiful graperies and peachtrees which delighted little georgy osborne the misses dobbin who drove often to brompton to see our dear amelia came sometimes to russell square too to pay a visit to their old acquaintance miss osborne  i believe it was in consequence of the commands of their brother the major in india for whom their papa had a prodigious respect that they paid attention to mrs george for the major the godfather and guardian of amelias little boy still hoped that the childs grandfather might be induced to relent towards him and acknowledge him for the sake of his son  the misses dobbin kept miss osborne acquainted with the state of amelias affairs how she was living with her father and mother how poor they were how they wondered what men and such men as their brother and dear captain osborne could find in such an insignificant little chit how she was still as heretofore a nambypamby milkandwater affected creaturebut how the boy was really the noblest little boy ever seenfor the hearts of all women warm towards young children and the sourest spinster is kind to them  one day after great entreaties on the part of the misses dobbin amelia allowed little george to go and pass a day with them at denmark hilla part of which day she spent herself in writing to the major in india  she congratulated him on the happy news which his sisters had just conveyed to her  she prayed for his prosperity and that of the bride he had chosen  she thanked him for a thousand thousand kind offices and proofs of stead fast friendship to her in her affliction she told him the last news about little georgy and how he was gone to spend that very day with his sisters in the country  she underlined the letter a great deal and she signed herself affectionately his friend amelia osborne  she forgot to send any message of kindness to lady odowd as her wont wasand did not mention glorvina by name and only in italics as the majors bride for whom she begged blessings but the news of the marriage removed the reserve which she had kept up towards him  she was glad to be able to own and feel how warmly and gratefully she regarded himand as for the idea of being jealous of glorvina glorvina indeed amelia would have scouted it if an angel from heaven had hinted it to her  that night when georgy came back in the ponycarriage in which he rejoiced and in which he was driven by sir wm dobbins old coachman he had round his neck a fine gold chain and watch  he said an old lady not pretty had given it him who cried and kissed him a great deal  but he didnt like her  he liked grapes very much  and he only liked his mamma  amelia shrank and started the timid soul felt a presentiment of terror when she heard that the relations of the childs father had seen him  miss osborne came back to give her father his dinner  he had made a good speculation in the city and was rather in a good humour that day and chanced to remark the agitation under which she laboured whats the matter miss osborne he deigned to say  the woman burst into tears  oh sir she said ive seen little george  he is as beautiful as an angeland so like him the old man opposite to her did not say a word but flushed up and began to tremble in every limb    chapter xliii  in which the reader has to double the cape  the astonished reader must be called upon to transport himself ten thousand miles to the military station of bundlegunge in the madras division of our indian empire where our gallant old friends of the th regiment are quartered under the command of the brave colonel sir michael odowd  time has dealt kindly with that stout officer as it does ordinarily with men who have good stomachs and good tempers and are not perplexed over much by fatigue of the brain the colonel plays a good knife and fork at tiffin and resumes those weapons with great success at dinner  he smokes his hookah after both meals and puffs as quietly while his wife scolds him as he did under the fire of the french at waterloo  age and heat have not diminished the activity or the eloquence of the descendant of the malonys and the molloys  her ladyship our old acquaintance is as much at home at madras as at brussels in the cantonment as under the tents  on the march you saw her at the head of the regiment seated on a royal elephant a noble sight mounted on that beast she has been into action with tigers in the jungle she has been received by native princes who have welcomed her and glorvina into the recesses of their zenanas and offered her shawls and jewels which it went to her heart to refuse  the sentries of all arms salute her wherever she makes her appearance and she touches her hat gravely to their salutation  lady odowd is one of the greatest ladies in the presidency of madrasher quarrel with lady smith wife of sir minos smith the puisne judge is still remembered by some at madras when the colonels lady snapped her fingers in the judges ladys face and said shed never walk behind ever a beggarly civilian  even now though it is fiveandtwenty years ago people remember lady odowd performing a jig at government house where she danced down two aidesdecamp a major of madras cavalry and two gentlemen of the civil service and persuaded by major dobbin cb second in command of the th to retire to the supperroom lassata nondum satiata recessit  peggy odowd is indeed the same as ever kind in act and thought impetuous in temper eager to command a tyrant over her michael a dragon amongst all the ladies of the regiment a mother to all the young men whom she tends in their sickness defends in all their scrapes and with whom lady peggy is immensely popular  but the subalterns and captains ladies the major is unmarried cabal against her a good deal  they say that glorvina gives herself airs and that peggy herself is ill tolerably domineering  she interfered with a little congregation which mrs kirk had got up and laughed the young men away from her sermons stating that a soldiers wife had no business to be a parsonthat mrs kirk would be much better mending her husbands clothes and if the regiment wanted sermons that she had the finest in the world those of her uncle the dean she abruptly put a termination to a flirtation which lieutenant stubble of the regiment had commenced with the surgeons wife threatening to come down upon stubble for the money which he had borrowed from her for the young fellow was still of an extravagant turn unless he broke off at once and went to the cape on sick leave  on the other hand she housed and sheltered mrs posky who fled from her bungalow one night pursued by her infuriate husband wielding his second brandy bottle and actually carried posky through the delirium tremens and broke him of the habit of drinking which had grown upon that officer as all evil habits will grow upon men  in a word in adversity she was the best of comforters in good fortune the most troublesome of friends having a perfectly good opinion of herself always and an indomitable resolution to have her own way  among other points she had made up her mind that glorvina should marry our old friend dobbin  mrs odowd knew the majors expectations and appreciated his good qualities and the high character which he enjoyed in his profession  glorvina a very handsome freshcoloured blackhaired blueeyed young lady who could ride a horse or play a sonata with any girl out of the county cork seemed to be the very person destined to insure dobbins happinessmuch more than that poor good little weakspurted amelia about whom he used to take on solook at glorvina enter a room mrs odowd would say and compare her with that poor mrs osborne who couldnt say boo to a goose  shed be worthy of you majoryoure a quiet man yourself and want some one to talk for ye  and though she does not come of such good blood as the malonys or molloys let me tell ye shes of an ancient family that any nobleman might be proud to marry into  but before she had come to such a resolution and determined to subjugate major dobbin by her endearments it must be owned that glorvina had practised them a good deal elsewhere  she had had a season in dublin and who knows how many in cork killarney and mallow she had flirted with all the marriageable officers whom the depots of her country afforded and all the bachelor squires who seemed eligible  she had been engaged to be married a halfscore times in ireland besides the clergyman at bath who used her so ill she had flirted all the way to madras with the captain and chief mate of the ramchunder east indiaman and had a season at the presidency with her brother and mrs odowd who was staying there while the major of the regiment was in command at the station everybody admired her there everybody danced with her but no one proposed who was worth the marryingone or two exceedingly young subalterns sighed after her and a beardless civilian or two but she rejected these as beneath her pretensionsand other and younger virgins than glorvina were married before her  there are women and handsome women too who have this fortune in life  they fall in love with the utmost generosity they ride and walk with half the armylist though they draw near to forty and yet the misses ogrady are the misses ogrady still  glorvina persisted that but for lady odowds unlucky quarrel with the judges lady she would have made a good match at madras where old mr chutney who was at the head of the civil service and who afterwards married miss dolby a young lady only thirteen years of age who had just arrived from school in europe was just at the point of proposing to her  well although lady odowd and glorvina quarrelled a great number of times every day and upon almost every conceivable subjectindeed if mick odowd had not possessed the temper of an angel two such women constantly about his ears would have driven him out of his sensesyet they agreed between themselves on this point that glorvina should marry major dobbin and were determined that the major should have no rest until the arrangement was brought about undismayed by forty or fifty previous defeats glorvina laid siege to him  she sang irish melodies at him unceasingly  she asked him so frequently and pathetically will ye come to the bower that it is a wonder how any man of feeling could have resisted the invitation  she was never tired of inquiring if sorrow had his young days faded and was ready to listen and weep like desdemona at the stories of his dangers and his campaigns  it has been said that our honest and dear old friend used to perform on the flute in private glorvina insisted upon having duets with him and lady odowd would rise and artlessly quit the room when the young couple were so engaged glorvina forced the major to ride with her of mornings  the whole cantonment saw them set out and return  she was constantly writing notes over to him at his house borrowing his books and scoring with her great pencilmarks such passages of sentiment or humour as awakened her sympathy  she borrowed his horses his servants his spoons and palanquinno wonder that public rumour assigned her to him and that the majors sisters in england should fancy they were about to have a sisterinlaw  dobbin who was thus vigorously besieged was in the meanwhile in a state of the most odious tranquillity  he used to laugh when the young fellows of the regiment joked him about glorvinas manifest attentions to him bah said he she is only keeping her hand inshe practises upon me as she does upon mrs tozers piano because its the most handy instrument in the station  i am much too battered and old for such a fine young lady as glorvina and so he went on riding with her and copying music and verses into her albums and playing at chess with her very submissively for it is with these simple amusements that some officers in india are accustomed to while away their leisure moments while others of a less domestic turn hunt hogs and shoot snipes or gamble and smoke cheroots and betake themselves to brandyandwater  as for sir michael odowd though his lady and her sister both urged him to call upon the major to explain himself and not keep on torturing a poor innocent girl in that shameful way the old soldier refused pointblank to have anything to do with the conspiracy faith the majors big enough to choose for himself sir michael said hell ask ye when he wants ye or else he would turn the matter off jocularly declaring that dobbin was too young to keep house and had written home to ask lave of his mamma nay he went farther and in private communications with his major would caution and rally him crying mind your oi dob my boy them girls is bent on mischiefme lady has just got a box of gowns from europe  and theres a pink satin for glorvina which will finish ye  dob if its in the power of woman or satin to move ye  but the truth is neither beauty nor fashion could conquer him  our honest friend had but one idea of a woman in his head and that one did not in the least resemble miss glorvina odowd in pink satin  a gentle little woman in black with large eyes and brown hair seldom speaking save when spoken to and then in a voice not the least resembling miss glorvinasa soft young mother tending an infant and beckoning the major up with a smile to look at hima rosycheeked lass coming singing into the room in russell square or hanging on george osbornes arm happy and lovingthere was but this image that filled our honest majors mind by day and by night and reigned over it always  very likely amelia was not like the portrait the major had formed of her there was a figure in a book of fashions which his sisters had in england and with which william had made away privately pasting it into the lid of his desk and fancying he saw some resemblance to mrs osborne in the print whereas i have seen it and can vouch that it is but the picture of a highwaisted gown with an impossible dolls face simpering over itand perhaps mr dobbins sentimental amelia was no more like the real one than this absurd little print which he cherished  but what man in love of us is better informedor is he much happier when he sees and owns his delusion dobbin was under this spell  he did not bother his friends and the public much about his feelings or indeed lose his natural rest or appetite on account of them  his head has grizzled since we saw him last and a line or two of silver may be seen in the soft brown hair likewise  but his feelings are not in the least changed or oldened and his love remains as fresh as a mans recollections of boyhood are  we have said how the two misses dobbin and amelia the majors correspondents in europe wrote him letters from england mrs osborne congratulating him with great candour and cordiality upon his approaching nuptials with miss odowd your sister has just kindly visited me amelia wrote in her letter and informed me of an interesting event upon which i beg to offer my most sincere congratulations i hope the young lady to whom i hear you are to be united will in every respect prove worthy of one who is himself all kindness and goodness  the poor widow has only her prayers to offer and her cordial cordial wishes for your prosperity  georgy sends his love to his dear godpapa and hopes that you will not forget him i tell him that you are about to form other ties with one who i am sure merits all your affection but that although such ties must of course be the strongest and most sacred and supersede all others yet that i am sure the widow and the child whom you have ever protected and loved will always have a corner in your heart the letter which has been before alluded to went on in this strain protesting throughout as to the extreme satisfaction of the writer  this letter which arrived by the very same ship which brought out lady odowds box of millinery from london and which you may be sure dobbin opened before any one of the other packets which the mail brought him put the receiver into such a state of mind that glorvina and her pink satin and everything belonging to her became perfectly odious to him  the major cursed the talk of women and the sex in general  everything annoyed him that daythe parade was insufferably hot and wearisome  good heavens was a man of intellect to waste his life day after day inspecting crossbelts and putting fools through their manoeuvres the senseless chatter of the young men at mess was more than ever jarring what cared he a man on the high road to forty to know how many snipes lieutenant smith had shot or what were the performances of ensign browns mare the jokes about the table filled him with shame  he was too old to listen to the banter of the assistant surgeon and the slang of the youngsters at which old odowd with his bald head and red face laughed quite easily  the old man had listened to those jokes any time these thirty yearsdobbin himself had been fifteen years hearing them  and after the boisterous dulness of the messtable the quarrels and scandal of the ladies of the regiment it was unbearable shameful  o amelia amelia he thought you to whom i have been so faithfulyou reproach me  it is because you cannot feel for me that i drag on this wearisome life  and you reward me after years of devotion by giving me your blessing upon my marriage forsooth with this flaunting irish girl sick and sorry felt poor william more than ever wretched and lonely  he would like to have done with life and its vanity altogetherso bootless and unsatisfactory the struggle so cheerless and dreary the prospect seemed to him  he lay all that night sleepless and yearning to go home  amelias letter had fallen as a blank upon him  no fidelity no constant truth and passion could move her into warmth  she would not see that he loved her  tossing in his bed he spoke out to her good god amelia he said dont you know that i only love you in the worldyou who are a stone to meyou whom i tended through months and months of illness and grief and who bade me farewell with a smile on your face and forgot me before the door shut between us the native servants lying outside his verandas beheld with wonder the major so cold and quiet ordinarily at present so passionately moved and cast down  would she have pitied him had she seen him he read over and over all the letters which he ever had from herletters of business relative to the little property which he had made her believe her husband had left to herbrief notes of invitationevery scrap of writing that she had ever sent to himhow cold how kind how hopeless how selfish they were  had there been some kind gentle soul near at hand who could read and appreciate this silent generous heart who knows but that the reign of amelia might have been over and that friend williams love might have flowed into a kinder channel but there was only glorvina of the jetty ringlets with whom his intercourse was familiar and this dashing young woman was not bent upon loving the major but rather on making the major admire hera most vain and hopeless task too at least considering the means that the poor girl possessed to carry it out she curled her hair and showed her shoulders at him as much as to say did ye ever see such jet ringlets and such a complexion she grinned at him so that he might see that every tooth in her head was soundand he never heeded all these charms  very soon after the arrival of the box of millinery and perhaps indeed in honour of it lady odowd and the ladies of the kings regiment gave a ball to the companys regiments and the civilians at the station  glorvina sported the killing pink frock and the major who attended the party and walked very ruefully up and down the rooms never so much as perceived the pink garment glorvina danced past him in a fury with all the young subalterns of the station and the major was not in the least jealous of her performance or angry because captain bangles of the cavalry handed her to supper it was not jealousy or frocks or shoulders that could move him and glorvina had nothing more  so these two were each exemplifying the vanity of this life and each longing for what he or she could not get glorvina cried with rage at the failure  she had set her mind on the major more than on any of the others she owned sobbing  hell break my heart he will peggy she would whimper to her sisterinlaw when they were good friends sure every one of me frocks must be taken inits such a skeleton im growing fat or thin laughing or melancholy on horseback or the musicstool it was all the same to the major  and the colonel puffing his pipe and listening to these complaints would suggest that glory should have some black frocks out in the next box from london and told a mysterious story of a lady in ireland who died of grief for the loss of her husband before she got ere a one  while the major was going on in this tantalizing way not proposing and declining to fall in love there came another ship from europe bringing letters on board and amongst them some more for the heartless man  these were home letters bearing an earlier postmark than that of the former packets and as major dobbin recognized among his the handwriting of his sister who always crossed and recrossed her letters to her brothergathered together all the possible bad news which she could collect abused him and read him lectures with sisterly frankness and always left him miserable for the day after dearest william had achieved the perusal of one of her epistlesthe truth must be told that dearest william did not hurry himself to break the seal of miss dobbins letter but waited for a particularly favourable day and mood for doing so  a fortnight before moreover he had written to scold her for telling those absurd stories to mrs osborne and had despatched a letter in reply to that lady undeceiving her with respect to the reports concerning him and assuring her that he had no sort of present intention of altering his condition  two or three nights after the arrival of the second package of letters the major had passed the evening pretty cheerfully at lady odowds house where glorvina thought that he listened with rather more attention than usual to the meeting of the wathers the minsthrel boy and one or two other specimens of song with which she favoured him the truth is he was no more listening to glorvina than to the howling of the jackals in the moonlight outside and the delusion was hers as usual and having played his game at chess with her cribbage with the surgeon was lady odowds favourite evening pastime major dobbin took leave of the colonels family at his usual hour and retired to his own house  there on his table his sisters letter lay reproaching him  he took it up ashamed rather of his negligence regarding it and prepared himself for a disagreeable hours communing with that crabbedhanded absent relative    it may have been an hour after the majors departure from the colonels housesir michael was sleeping the sleep of the just glorvina had arranged her black ringlets in the innumerable little bits of paper in which it was her habit to confine them lady odowd too had gone to her bed in the nuptial chamber on the groundfloor and had tucked her musquito curtains round her fair form when the guard at the gates of the commandingofficers compound beheld major dobbin in the moonlight rushing towards the house with a swift step and a very agitated countenance and he passed the sentinel and went up to the windows of the colonels bedchamber  odowdcolonel said dobbin and kept up a great shouting  heavens meejor said glorvina of the curlpapers putting out her head too from her window  what is it dob me boy said the colonel expecting there was a fire in the station or that the route had come from headquarters  ii must have leave of absence  i must go to englandon the most urgent private affairs dobbin said  good heavens what has happened thought glorvina trembling with all the papillotes  i want to be offnowtonight dobbin continued and the colonel getting up came out to parley with him  in the postscript of miss dobbins crossletter the major had just come upon a paragraph to the following effecti drove yesterday to see your old acquaintance mrs osborne  the wretched place they live at since they were bankrupts you knowmr s to judge from a brass plate on the door of his hut it is little better is a coalmerchant the little boy your godson is certainly a fine child though forward and inclined to be saucy and selfwilled but we have taken notice of him as you wish it and have introduced him to his aunt miss o who was rather pleased with him  perhaps his grandpapa not the bankrupt one who is almost doting but mr osborne of russell square may be induced to relent towards the child of your friend his erring and selfwilled son  and amelia will not be illdisposed to give him up the widow is consoled and is about to marry a reverend gentleman the rev mr binny one of the curates of brompton  a poor match  but mrs o is getting old and i saw a great deal of grey in her hairshe was in very good spirits  and your little godson overate himself at our house mamma sends her love with that of your affectionate ann dobbin    chapter xliv  a roundabout chapter between london and hampshire  our old friends the crawleys family house in great gaunt street still bore over its front the hatchment which had been placed there as a token of mourning for sir pitt crawleys demise yet this heraldic emblem was in itself a very splendid and gaudy piece of furniture and all the rest of the mansion became more brilliant than it had ever been during the late baronets reign  the black outercoating of the bricks was removed and they appeared with a cheerful blushing face streaked with white the old bronze lions of the knocker were gilt handsomely the railings painted and the dismallest house in great gaunt street became the smartest in the whole quarter before the green leaves in hampshire had replaced those yellowing ones which were on the trees in queens crawley avenue when old sir pitt crawley passed under them for the last time  a little woman with a carriage to correspond was perpetually seen about this mansion an elderly spinster accompanied by a little boy also might be remarked coming thither daily  it was miss briggs and little rawdon whose business it was to see to the inward renovation of sir pitts house to superintend the female band engaged in stitching the blinds and hangings to poke and rummage in the drawers and cupboards crammed with the dirty relics and congregated trumperies of a couple of generations of lady crawleys and to take inventories of the china the glass and other properties in the closets and storerooms  mrs rawdon crawley was generalinchief over these arrangements with full orders from sir pitt to sell barter confiscate or purchase furniture and she enjoyed herself not a little in an occupation which gave full scope to her taste and ingenuity  the renovation of the house was determined upon when sir pitt came to town in november to see his lawyers and when he passed nearly a week in curzon street under the roof of his affectionate brother and sister  he had put up at an hotel at first but becky as soon as she heard of the baronets arrival went off alone to greet him and returned in an hour to curzon street with sir pitt in the carriage by her side  it was impossible sometimes to resist this artless little creatures hospitalities so kindly were they pressed so frankly and amiably offered  becky seized pitts hand in a transport of gratitude when he agreed to come  thank you she said squeezing it and looking into the baronets eyes who blushed a good deal how happy this will make rawdon she bustled up to pitts bedroom leading on the servants who were carrying his trunks thither  she came in herself laughing with a coalscuttle out of her own room  a fire was blazing already in sir pitts apartment it was miss briggss room by the way who was sent upstairs to sleep with the maid  i knew i should bring you she said with pleasure beaming in her glance  indeed she was really sincerely happy at having him for a guest  becky made rawdon dine out once or twice on business while pitt stayed with them and the baronet passed the happy evening alone with her and briggs  she went downstairs to the kitchen and actually cooked little dishes for him  isnt it a good salmi she said i made it for you i can make you better dishes than that and will when you come to see me  everything you do you do well said the baronet gallantly  the salmi is excellent indeed  a poor mans wife rebecca replied gaily must make herself useful you know on which her brotherinlaw vowed that she was fit to be the wife of an emperor and that to be skilful in domestic duties was surely one of the most charming of womans qualities and sir pitt thought with something like mortification of lady jane at home and of a certain pie which she had insisted on making and serving to him at dinnera most abominable pie  besides the salmi which was made of lord steynes pheasants from his lordships cottage of stillbrook becky gave her brotherinlaw a bottle of white wine some that rawdon had brought with him from france and had picked up for nothing the little storyteller said whereas the liquor was in truth some white hermitage from the marquis of steynes famous cellars which brought fire into the baronets pallid cheeks and a glow into his feeble frame  then when he had drunk up the bottle of petit vin blanc she gave him her hand and took him up to the drawingroom and made him snug on the sofa by the fire and let him talk as she listened with the tenderest kindly interest sitting by him and hemming a shirt for her dear little boy  whenever mrs rawdon wished to be particularly humble and virtuous this little shirt used to come out of her workbox  it had got to be too small for rawdon long before it was finished  well rebecca listened to pitt she talked to him she sang to him she coaxed him and cuddled him so that he found himself more and more glad every day to get back from the lawyers at grays inn to the blazing fire in curzon streeta gladness in which the men of law likewise participated for pitts harangues were of the longestand so that when he went away he felt quite a pang at departing how pretty she looked kissing her hand to him from the carriage and waving her handkerchief when he had taken his place in the mail she put the handkerchief to her eyes once  he pulled his sealskin cap over his as the coach drove away and sinking back he thought to himself how she respected him and how he deserved it and how rawdon was a foolish dull fellow who didnt halfappreciate his wife and how mum and stupid his own wife was compared to that brilliant little becky  becky had hinted every one of these things herself perhaps but so delicately and gently that you hardly knew when or where  and before they parted it was agreed that the house in london should be redecorated for the next season and that the brothers families should meet again in the country at christmas  i wish you could have got a little money out of him rawdon said to his wife moodily when the baronet was gone  i should like to give something to old raggles hanged if i shouldnt  it aint right you know that the old fellow should be kept out of all his money  it may be inconvenient and he might let to somebody else besides us you know  tell him said becky that as soon as sir pitts affairs are settled everybody will be paid and give him a little something on account  heres a cheque that pitt left for the boy and she took from her bag and gave her husband a paper which his brother had handed over to her on behalf of the little son and heir of the younger branch of the crawleys  the truth is she had tried personally the ground on which her husband expressed a wish that she should venturetried it ever so delicately and found it unsafe even at a hint about embarrassments sir pitt crawley was off and alarmed  and he began a long speech explaining how straitened he himself was in money matters how the tenants would not pay how his fathers affairs and the expenses attendant upon the demise of the old gentleman had involved him how he wanted to pay off incumbrances and how the bankers and agents were overdrawn and pitt crawley ended by making a compromise with his sisterinlaw and giving her a very small sum for the benefit of her little boy  pitt knew how poor his brother and his brothers family must be  it could not have escaped the notice of such a cool and experienced old diplomatist that rawdons family had nothing to live upon and that houses and carriages are not to be kept for nothing  he knew very well that he was the proprietor or appropriator of the money which according to all proper calculation ought to have fallen to his younger brother and he had we may be sure some secret pangs of remorse within him which warned him that he ought to perform some act of justice or let us say compensation towards these disappointed relations  a just decent man not without brains who said his prayers and knew his catechism and did his duty outwardly through life he could not be otherwise than aware that something was due to his brother at his hands and that morally he was rawdons debtor  but as one reads in the columns of the times newspaper every now and then queer announcements from the chancellor of the exchequer acknowledging the receipt of 50 pounds from a b or 10 pounds from w t as consciencemoney on account of taxes due by the said a b or w t which payments the penitents beg the right honourable gentleman to acknowledge through the medium of the public pressso is the chancellor no doubt and the reader likewise always perfectly sure that the abovenamed a b  and w t are only paying a very small instalment of what they really owe and that the man who sends up a twentypound note has very likely hundreds or thousands more for which he ought to account  such at least are my feelings when i see a b or w ts insufficient acts of repentance  and i have no doubt that pitt crawleys contrition or kindness if you will towards his younger brother by whom he had so much profited was only a very small dividend upon the capital sum in which he was indebted to rawdon not everybody is willing to pay even so much  to part with money is a sacrifice beyond almost all men endowed with a sense of order  there is scarcely any man alive who does not think himself meritorious for giving his neighbour five pounds  thriftless gives not from a beneficent pleasure in giving but from a lazy delight in spending he would not deny himself one enjoyment not his operastall not his horse not his dinner not even the pleasure of giving lazarus the five pounds  thrifty who is good wise just and owes no man a penny turns from a beggar haggles with a hackneycoachman or denies a poor relation and i doubt which is the most selfish of the two  money has only a different value in the eyes of each  so in a word pitt crawley thought he would do something for his brother and then thought that he would think about it some other time  and with regard to becky she was not a woman who expected too much from the generosity of her neighbours and so was quite content with all that pitt crawley had done for her  she was acknowledged by the head of the family  if pitt would not give her anything he would get something for her some day  if she got no money from her brotherinlaw she got what was as good as moneycredit  raggles was made rather easy in his mind by the spectacle of the union between the brothers by a small payment on the spot and by the promise of a much larger sum speedily to be assigned to him  and rebecca told miss briggs whose christmas dividend upon the little sum lent by her becky paid with an air of candid joy and as if her exchequer was brimming over with goldrebecca we say told miss briggs in strict confidence that she had conferred with sir pitt who was famous as a financier on briggss special behalf as to the most profitable investment of miss bs remaining capital that sir pitt after much consideration had thought of a most safe and advantageous way in which briggs could lay out her money that being especially interested in her as an attached friend of the late miss crawley and of the whole family and that long before he left town he had recommended that she should be ready with the money at a moments notice so as to purchase at the most favourable opportunity the shares which sir pitt had in his eye  poor miss briggs was very grateful for this mark of sir pitts attentionit came so unsolicited she said for she never should have thought of removing the money from the fundsand the delicacy enhanced the kindness of the office and she promised to see her man of business immediately and be ready with her little cash at the proper hour  and this worthy woman was so grateful for the kindness of rebecca in the matter and for that of her generous benefactor the colonel that she went out and spent a great part of her halfyears dividend in the purchase of a black velvet coat for little rawdon who by the way was grown almost too big for black velvet now and was of a size and age befitting him for the assumption of the virile jacket and pantaloons  he was a fine openfaced boy with blue eyes and waving flaxen hair sturdy in limb but generous and soft in heart fondly attaching himself to all who were good to himto the ponyto lord southdown who gave him the horse he used to blush and glow all over when he saw that kind young noblemanto the groom who had charge of the ponyto molly the cook who crammed him with ghost stories at night and with good things from the dinnerto briggs whom he plagued and laughed atand to his father especially whose attachment towards the lad was curious too to witness  here as he grew to be about eight years old his attachments may be said to have ended  the beautiful mothervision had faded away after a while  during near two years she had scarcely spoken to the child she disliked him  he had the measles and the hoopingcough  he bored her  one day when he was standing at the landingplace having crept down from the upper regions attracted by the sound of his mothers voice who was singing to lord steyne the drawing room door opening suddenly discovered the little spy who but a moment before had been rapt in delight and listening to the music  his mother came out and struck him violently a couple of boxes on the ear  he heard a laugh from the marquis in the inner room who was amused by this free and artless exhibition of beckys temper and fled down below to his friends of the kitchen bursting in an agony of grief  it is not because it hurts me little rawdon gasped outonlyonlysobs and tears wound up the sentence in a storm  it was the little boys heart that was bleeding  why maynt i hear her singing  why dont she ever sing to meas she does to that baldheaded man with the large teeth he gasped out at various intervals these exclamations of rage and grief  the cook looked at the housemaid the housemaid looked knowingly at the footmanthe awful kitchen inquisition which sits in judgement in every house and knows everythingsat on rebecca at that moment  after this incident the mothers dislike increased to hatred the consciousness that the child was in the house was a reproach and a pain to her  his very sight annoyed her  fear doubt and resistance sprang up too in the boys own bosom  they were separated from that day of the boxes on the ear  lord steyne also heartily disliked the boy  when they met by mischance he made sarcastic bows or remarks to the child or glared at him with savagelooking eyes rawdon used to stare him in the face and double his little fists in return  he knew his enemy and this gentleman of all who came to the house was the one who angered him most  one day the footman found him squaring his fists at lord steynes hat in the hall  the footman told the circumstance as a good joke to lord steynes coachman that officer imparted it to lord steynes gentleman and to the servants hall in general and very soon afterwards when mrs rawdon crawley made her appearance at gaunt house the porter who unbarred the gates the servants of all uniforms in the hall the functionaries in white waistcoats who bawled out from landing to landing the names of colonel and mrs rawdon crawley knew about her or fancied they did the man who brought her refreshment and stood behind her chair had talked her character over with the large gentleman in motleycoloured clothes at his side  bon dieu it is awful that servants inquisition  you see a woman in a great party in a splendid saloon surrounded by faithful admirers distributing sparkling glances dressed to perfection curled rouged smiling and happydiscovery walks respectfully up to her in the shape of a huge powdered man with large calves and a tray of iceswith calumny which is as fatal as truth behind him in the shape of the hulking fellow carrying the waferbiscuits  madam your secret will be talked over by those men at their club at the publichouse tonight  jeames will tell chawles his notions about you over their pipes and pewter beerpots some people ought to have mutes for servants in vanity fairmutes who could not write if you are guilty tremble  that fellow behind your chair may be a janissary with a bowstring in his plush breeches pocket  if you are not guilty have a care of appearances which are as ruinous as guilt  was rebecca guilty or not the vehmgericht of tho servants hall had pronounced against her  and i shame to say she would not have got credit had they not believed her to be guilty  it was the sight of the marquis of steynes carriagelamps at her door contemplated by raggles burning in the blackness of midnight that kep him up as he afterwards said that even more than rebeccas arts and coaxings  and soguiltless very likelyshe was writhing and pushing onward towards what they call a position in society and the servants were pointing at her as lost and ruined  so you see molly the housemaid of a morning watching a spider in the doorpost lay his thread and laboriously crawl up it until tired of the sport she raises her broom and sweeps away the thread and the artificer  a day or two before christmas becky her husband and her son made ready and went to pass the holidays at the seat of their ancestors at queens crawley  becky would have liked to leave the little brat behind and would have done so but for lady janes urgent invitations to the youngster and the symptoms of revolt and discontent which rawdon manifested at her neglect of her son  hes the finest boy in england the father said in a tone of reproach to her and you dont seem to care for him becky as much as you do for your spaniel  he shant bother you much at home he will be away from you in the nursery and he shall go outside on the coach with me  where you go yourself because you want to smoke those filthy cigars replied mrs rawdon  i remember when you liked em though answered the husband  becky laughed she was almost always goodhumoured that was when i was on my promotion goosey she said  take rawdon outside with you and give him a cigar too if you like  rawdon did not warm his little son for the winters journey in this way but he and briggs wrapped up the child in shawls and comforters and he was hoisted respectfully onto the roof of the coach in the dark morning under the lamps of the white horse cellar and with no small delight he watched the dawn rise and made his first journey to the place which his father still called home it was a journey of infinite pleasure to the boy to whom the incidents of the road afforded endless interest his father answering to him all questions connected with it and telling him who lived in the great white house to the right and whom the park belonged to  his mother inside the vehicle with her maid and her furs her wrappers and her scent bottles made such a todo that you would have thought she never had been in a stagecoach beforemuch less that she had been turned out of this very one to make room for a paying passenger on a certain journey performed some halfscore years ago  it was dark again when little rawdon was wakened up to enter his uncles carriage at mudbury and he sat and looked out of it wondering as the great iron gates flew open and at the white trunks of the limes as they swept by until they stopped at length before the light windows of the hall which were blazing and comfortable with christmas welcome  the halldoor was flung opena big fire was burning in the great old fireplacea carpet was down over the chequered black flagsits the old turkey one that used to be in the ladies gallery thought rebecca and the next instant was kissing lady jane  she and sir pitt performed the same salute with great gravity but rawdon having been smoking hung back rather from his sisterinlaw whose two children came up to their cousin and while matilda held out her hand and kissed him pitt binkie southdown the son and heir stood aloof rather and examined him as a little dog does a big dog  then the kind hostess conducted her guests to the snug apartments blazing with cheerful fires  then the young ladies came and knocked at mrs rawdons door under the pretence that they were desirous to be useful but in reality to have the pleasure of inspecting the contents of her band and bonnetboxes and her dresses which though black were of the newest london fashion  and they told her how much the hall was changed for the better and how old lady southdown was gone and how pitt was taking his station in the county as became a crawley in fact then the great dinnerbell having rung the family assembled at dinner at which meal rawdon junior was placed by his aunt the goodnatured lady of the house sir pitt being uncommonly attentive to his sisterinlaw at his own right hand  little rawdon exhibited a fine appetite and showed a gentlemanlike behaviour  i like to dine here he said to his aunt when he had completed his meal at the conclusion of which and after a decent grace by sir pitt the younger son and heir was introduced and was perched on a high chair by the baronets side while the daughter took possession of the place and the little wineglass prepared for her near her mother  i like to dine here said rawdon minor looking up at his relations kind face  why said the good lady jane  i dine in the kitchen when i am at home replied rawdon minor or else with briggs but becky was so engaged with the baronet her host pouring out a flood of compliments and delights and raptures and admiring young pitt binkie whom she declared to be the most beautiful intelligent noblelooking little creature and so like his father that she did not hear the remarks of her own flesh and blood at the other end of the broad shining table  as a guest and it being the first night of his arrival rawdon the second was allowed to sit up until the hour when tea being over and a great gilt book being laid on the table before sir pitt all the domestics of the family streamed in and sir pitt read prayers  it was the first time the poor little boy had ever witnessed or heard of such a ceremonial  the house had been much improved even since the baronets brief reign and was pronounced by becky to be perfect charming delightful when she surveyed it in his company  as for little rawdon who examined it with the children for his guides it seemed to him a perfect palace of enchantment and wonder  there were long galleries and ancient state bedrooms there were pictures and old china and armour  there were the rooms in which grandpapa died and by which the children walked with terrified looks  who was grandpapa he asked and they told him how he used to be very old and used to be wheeled about in a gardenchair and they showed him the gardenchair one day rotting in the outhouse in which it had lain since the old gentleman had been wheeled away yonder to the church of which the spire was glittering over the park elms  the brothers had good occupation for several mornings in examining the improvements which had been effected by sir pitts genius and economy and as they walked or rode and looked at them they could talk without too much boring each other  and pitt took care to tell rawdon what a heavy outlay of money these improvements had occasioned and that a man of landed and funded property was often very hard pressed for twenty pounds there is that new lodgegate said pitt pointing to it humbly with the bamboo cane i can no more pay for it before the dividends in january than i can fly  i can lend you pitt till then rawdon answered rather ruefully and they went in and looked at the restored lodge where the family arms were just new scraped in stone and where old mrs lock for the first time these many long years had tight doors sound roofs and whole windows    chapter xlv  between hampshire and london  sir pitt crawley had done more than repair fences and restore dilapidated lodges on the queens crawley estate like a wise man he had set to work to rebuild the injured popularity of his house and stop up the gaps and ruins in which his name had been left by his disreputable and thriftless old predecessor  he was elected for the borough speedily after his fathers demise a magistrate a member of parliament a county magnate and representative of an ancient family he made it his duty to show himself before the hampshire public subscribed handsomely to the county charities called assiduously upon all the county folk and laid himself out in a word to take that position in hampshire and in the empire afterwards to which he thought his prodigious talents justly entitled him  lady jane was instructed to be friendly with the fuddlestones and the wapshots and the other famous baronets their neighbours  their carriages might frequently be seen in the queens crawley avenue now they dined pretty frequently at the hall where the cookery was so good that it was clear lady jane very seldom had a hand in it and in return pitt and his wife most energetically dined out in all sorts of weather and at all sorts of distances  for though pitt did not care for joviality being a frigid man of poor hearth and appetite yet he considered that to be hospitable and condescending was quite incumbent onhis station and every time that he got a headache from too long an afterdinner sitting he felt that he was a martyr to duty  he talked about crops cornlaws politics with the best country gentlemen he who had been formerly inclined to be a sad freethinker on these points entered into poaching and game preserving with ardour  he didnt hunt he wasnt a hunting man he was a man of books and peaceful habits but he thought that the breed of horses must be kept up in the country and that the breed of foxes must therefore be looked to and for his part if his friend sir huddlestone fuddlestone liked to draw his country and meet as of old the f  hounds used to do at queens crawley he should be happy to see him there and the gentlemen of the fuddlestone hunt  and to lady southdowns dismay too he became more orthodox in his tendencies every day gave up preaching in public and attending meetinghouses went stoutly to church called on the bishop and all the clergy at winchester and made no objection when the venerable archdeacon trumper asked for a game of whist  what pangs must have been those of lady southdown and what an utter castaway she must have thought her soninlaw for permitting such a godless diversion  and when on the return of the family from an oratorio at winchester the baronet announced to the young ladies that he should next year very probably take them to the county balls they worshipped him for his kindness  lady jane was only too obedient and perhaps glad herself to go  the dowager wrote off the direst descriptions of her daughters worldly behaviour to the authoress of the washerwoman of finchley common at the cape and her house in brighton being about this time unoccupied returned to that wateringplace her absence being not very much deplored by her children we may suppose too that rebecca on paying a second visit to queens crawley did not feel particularly grieved at the absence of the lady of the medicine chest though she wrote a christmas letter to her ladyship in which she respectfully recalled herself to lady southdowns recollection spoke with gratitude of the delight which her ladyships conversation had given her on the former visit dilated on the kindness with which her ladyship had treated her in sickness and declared that everything at queens crawley reminded her of her absent friend  a great part of the altered demeanour and popularity of sir pitt crawley might have been traced to the counsels of that astute little lady of curzon street  you remain a baronetyou consent to be a mere country gentleman she said to him while he had been her guest in london no sir pitt crawley i know you better  i know your talents and your ambition  you fancy you hide them both but you can conceal neither from me  i showed lord steyne your pamphlet on malt  he was familiar with it and said it was in the opinion of the whole cabinet the most masterly thing that had appeared on the subject the ministry has its eye upon you and i know what you want  you want to distinguish yourself in parliament every one says you are the finest speaker in england for your speeches at oxford are still remembered you want to be member for the county where with your own vote and your borough at your back you can command anything  and you want to be baron crawley of queens crawley and will be before you die  i saw it all  i could read your heart sir pitt  if i had a husband who possessed your intellect as he does your name i sometimes think i should not be unworthy of himbutbut i am your kinswoman now she added with a laugh  poor little penniless i have got a little interestand who knows perhaps the mouse may be able to aid the lion pitt crawley was amazed and enraptured with her speech  how that woman comprehends me he said i never could get jane to read three pages of the malt pamphlet  she has no idea that i have commanding talents or secret ambition  so they remember my speaking at oxford do they the rascals  now that i represent my borough and may sit for the county they begin to recollect me  why lord steyne cut me at the levee last year they are beginning to find out that pitt crawley is some one at last  yes the man was always the same whom these people neglected  it was only the opportunity that was wanting and i will show them now that i can speak and act as well as write achilles did not declare himself until they gave him the sword  i hold it now and the world shall yet hear of pitt crawley  therefore it was that this roguish diplomatist has grown so hospitable that he was so civil to oratorios and hospitals so kind to deans and chapters so generous in giving and accepting dinners so uncommonly gracious to farmers on marketdays and so much interested about county business and that the christmas at the hall was the gayest which had been known there for many a long day  on christmas day a great family gathering took place all the crawleys from the rectory came to dine  rebecca was as frank and fond of mrs bute as if the other had never been her enemy she was affectionately interested in the dear girls and surprised at the progress which they had made in music since her time and insisted upon encoring one of the duets out of the great songbooks which jim grumbling had been forced to bring under his arm from the rectory  mrs bute perforce was obliged to adopt a decent demeanour towards the little adventuressof course being free to discourse with her daughters afterwards about the absurd respect with which sir pitt treated his sisterinlaw  but jim who had sat next to her at dinner declared she was a trump and one and all of the rectors family agreed that the little rawdon was a fine boy they respected a possible baronet in the boy between whom and the title there was only the little sickly pale pitt binkie  the children were very good friends  pitt binkie was too little a dog for such a big dog as rawdon to play with and matilda being only a girl of course not fit companion for a young gentleman who was near eight years old and going into jackets very soon  he took the command of this small party at oncethe little girl and the little boy following him about with great reverence at such times as he condescended to sport with them  his happiness and pleasure in the country were extreme  the kitchen garden pleased him hugely the flowers moderately but the pigeons and the poultry and the stables when he was allowed to visit them were delightful objects to him  he resisted being kissed by the misses crawley but he allowed lady jane sometimes to embrace him and it was by her side that he liked to sit when the signal to retire to the drawingroom being given the ladies left the gentlemen to their claretby her side rather than by his mother  for rebecca seeing that tenderness was the fashion called rawdon to her one evening and stooped down and kissed him in the presence of all the ladies  he looked her full in the face after the operation trembling and turning very red as his wont was when moved  you never kiss me at home mamma he said at which there was a general silence and consternation and a by no means pleasant look in beckys eyes  rawdon was fond of his sisterinlaw for her regard for his son lady jane and becky did not get on quite so well at this visit as on occasion of the former one when the colonels wife was bent upon pleasing  those two speeches of the child struck rather a chill perhaps sir pitt was rather too attentive to her  but rawdon as became his age and size was fonder of the society of the men than of the women and never wearied of accompanying his sire to the stables whither the colonel retired to smoke his cigarjim the rectors son sometimes joining his cousin in that and other amusements he and the baronets keeper were very close friends their mutual taste for dawgs bringing them much together on one day mr james the colonel and horn the keeper went and shot pheasants taking little rawdon with them  on another most blissful morning these four gentlemen partook of the amusement of rathunting in a barn than which sport rawdon as yet had never seen anything more noble they stopped up the ends of certain drains in the barn into the other openings of which ferrets were inserted and then stood silently aloof with uplifted stakes in their hands and an anxious little terrier mr jamess celebrated dawg forceps indeed scarcely breathing from excitement listening motionless on three legs to the faint squeaking of the rats below desperately bold at last the persecuted animals bolted abovegroundthe terrier accounted for one the keeper for another rawdon from flurry and excitement missed his rat but on the other hand he halfmurdered a ferret  but the greatest day of all was that on which sir huddlestone fuddlestones hounds met upon the lawn at queens crawley  that was a famous sight for little rawdon  at halfpast ten tom moody sir huddlestone fuddlestones huntsman was seen trotting up the avenue followed by the noble pack of hounds in a compact bodythe rear being brought up by the two whips clad in stained scarlet frockslight hardfeatured lads on wellbred lean horses possessing marvellous dexterity in casting the points of their long heavy whips at the thinnest part of any dogs skin who dares to straggle from the main body or to take the slightest notice or even so much as wink at the hares and rabbits starting under their noses  next comes boy jack tom moodys son who weighs five stone measures eightandforty inches and will never be any bigger  he is perched on a large rawboned hunter halfcovered by a capacious saddle  this animal is sir huddlestone fuddlestones favourite horse the nob other horses ridden by other small boys arrive from time to time awaiting their masters who will come cantering on anon  tom moody rides up to the door of the hall where he is welcomed by the butler who offers him drink which he declines  he and his pack then draw off into a sheltered corner of the lawn where the dogs roll on the grass and play or growl angrily at one another ever and anon breaking out into furious fight speedily to be quelled by toms voice unmatched at rating or the snaky thongs of the whips  many young gentlemen canter up on thoroughbred hacks spatterdashed to the knee and enter the house to drink cherrybrandy and pay their respects to the ladies or more modest and sportsmanlike divest themselves of their mudboots exchange their hacks for their hunters and warm their blood by a preliminary gallop round the lawn  then they collect round the pack in the corner and talk with tom moody of past sport and the merits of sniveller and diamond and of the state of the country and of the wretched breed of foxes  sir huddlestone presently appears mounted on a clever cob and rides up to the hall where he enters and does the civil thing by the ladies after which being a man of few words he proceeds to business  the hounds are drawn up to the halldoor and little rawdon descends amongst them excited yet halfalarmed by the caresses which they bestow upon him at the thumps he receives from their waving tails and at their canine bickerings scarcely restrained by tom moodys tongue and lash  meanwhile sir huddlestone has hoisted himself unwieldily on the nob lets try sowsters spinney tom says the baronet farmer mangle tells me there are two foxes in it tom blows his horn and trots off followed by the pack by the whips by the young gents from winchester by the farmers of the neighbourhood by the labourers of the parish on foot with whom the day is a great holiday sir huddlestone bringing up the rear with colonel crawley and the whole cortege disappears down the avenue  the reverend bute crawley who has been too modest to appear at the public meet before his nephews windows whom tom moody remembers forty years back a slender divine riding the wildest horses jumping the widest brooks and larking over the newest gates in the countryhis reverence we say happens to trot out from the rectory lane on his powerful black horse just as sir huddlestone passes he joins the worthy baronet  hounds and horsemen disappear and little rawdon remains on the doorsteps wondering and happy  during the progress of this memorable holiday little rawdon if he had got no special liking for his uncle always awful and cold and locked up in his study plunged in justicebusiness and surrounded by bailiffs and farmershas gained the good graces of his married and maiden aunts of the two little folks of the hall and of jim of the rectory whom sir pitt is encouraging to pay his addresses to one of the young ladies with an understanding doubtless that he shall be presented to the living when it shall be vacated by his foxhunting old sire  jim has given up that sport himself and confines himself to a little harmless duck or snipeshooting or a little quiet trifling with the rats during the christmas holidays after which he will return to the university and try and not be plucked once more  he has already eschewed green coats red neckcloths and other worldly ornaments and is preparing himself for a change in his condition  in this cheap and thrifty way sir pitt tries to pay off his debt to his family  also before this merry christmas was over the baronet had screwed up courage enough to give his brother another draft on his bankers and for no less a sum than a hundred pounds an act which caused sir pitt cruel pangs at first but which made him glow afterwards to think himself one of the most generous of men  rawdon and his son went away with the utmost heaviness of heart  becky and the ladies parted with some alacrity however and our friend returned to london to commence those avocations with which we find her occupied when this chapter begins under her care the crawley house in great gaunt street was quite rejuvenescent and ready for the reception of sir pitt and his family when the baronet came to london to attend his duties in parliament and to assume that position in the country for which his vast genius fitted him  for the first session this profound dissembler hid his projects and never opened his lips but to present a petition from mudbury  but he attended assiduously in his place and learned thoroughly the routine and business of the house  at home he gave himself up to the perusal of blue books to the alarm and wonder of lady jane who thought he was killing himself by late hours and intense application  and he made acquaintance with the ministers and the chiefs of his party determining to rank as one of them before many years were over  lady janes sweetness and kindness had inspired rebecca with such a contempt for her ladyship as the little woman found no small difficulty in concealing  that sort of goodness and simplicity which lady jane possessed annoyed our friend becky and it was impossible for her at times not to show or to let the other divine her scorn her presence too rendered lady jane uneasy  her husband talked constantly with becky  signs of intelligence seemed to pass between them and pitt spoke with her on subjects on which he never thought of discoursing with lady jane  the latter did not understand them to be sure but it was mortifying to remain silent still more mortifying to know that you had nothing to say and hear that little audacious mrs rawdon dashing on from subject to subject with a word for every man and a joke always pat and to sit in ones own house alone by the fireside and watching all the men round your rival  in the country when lady jane was telling stories to the children who clustered about her knees little rawdon into the bargain who was very fond of her and becky came into the room sneering with green scornful eyes poor lady jane grew silent under those baleful glances her simple little fancies shrank away tremulously as fairies in the storybooks before a superior bad angel  she could not go on although rebecca with the smallest inflection of sarcasm in her voice besought her to continue that charming story  and on her side gentle thoughts and simple pleasures were odious to mrs becky they discorded with her she hated people for liking them she spurned children and childrenlovers  i have no taste for bread and butter she would say when caricaturing lady jane and her ways to my lord steyne  no more has a certain person for holy water his lordship replied with a bow and a grin and a great jarring laugh afterwards  so these two ladies did not see much of each other except upon those occasions when the younger brothers wife having an object to gain from the other frequented her  they myloved and mydeared each other assiduously but kept apart generally whereas sir pitt in the midst of his multiplied avocations found daily time to see his sisterinlaw  on the occasion of his first speakers dinner sir pitt took the opportunity of appearing before his sisterinlaw in his uniformthat old diplomatic suit which he had worn when attache to the pumpernickel legation  becky complimented him upon that dress and admired him almost as much as his own wife and children to whom he displayed himself before he set out  she said that it was only the thoroughbred gentleman who could wear the court suit with advantage  it was only your men of ancient race whom the culotte courte became  pitt looked down with complacency at his legs which had not in truth much more symmetry or swell than the lean court sword which dangled by his sidelooked down at his legs and thought in his heart that he was killing  when he was gone mrs becky made a caricature of his figure which she showed to lord steyne when he arrived  his lordship carried off the sketch delighted with the accuracy of the resemblance  he had done sir pitt crawley the honour to meet him at mrs beckys house and had been most gracious to the new baronet and member  pitt was struck too by the deference with which the great peer treated his sisterinlaw by her ease and sprightliness in the conversation and by the delight with which the other men of the party listened to her talk lord steyne made no doubt but that the baronet had only commenced his career in public life and expected rather anxiously to hear him as an orator as they were neighbours for great gaunt street leads into gaunt square whereof gaunt house as everybody knows forms one side my lord hoped that as soon as lady steyne arrived in london she would have the honour of making the acquaintance of lady crawley  he left a card upon his neighbour in the course of a day or two having never thought fit to notice his predecessor though they had lived near each other for near a century past  in the midst of these intrigues and fine parties and wise and brilliant personages rawdon felt himself more and more isolated every day  he was allowed to go to the club more to dine abroad with bachelor friends to come and go when he liked without any questions being asked  and he and rawdon the younger many a time would walk to gaunt street and sit with the lady and the children there while sir pitt was closeted with rebecca on his way to the house or on  his return from it  the excolonel would sit for hours in his brothers house very silent and thinking and doing as little as possible  he was glad to be employed of an errand to go and make inquiries about a horse or a servant or to carve the roast mutton for the dinner of the children he was beat and cowed into laziness and submission delilah had imprisoned him and cut his hair off too  the bold and reckless young blood of tenyears back was subjugated and was turned into a torpid submissive middleaged stout gentleman  and poor lady jane was aware that rebecca had captivated her husband although she and mrs rawdon mydeared and myloved each other every day they met    chapter xlvi  struggles and trials  our friends at brompton were meanwhile passing their christmas after their fashion and in a manner by no means too cheerful  out of the hundred pounds a year which was about the amount of her income the widow osborne had been in the habit of giving up nearly threefourths to her father and mother for the expenses of herself and her little boy  with 120 more supplied by jos this family of four people attended by a single irish servant who also did for clapp and his wife might manage to live in decent comfort through the year and hold up their heads yet and be able to give a friend a dish of tea still after the storms and disappointments of their early life sedley still maintained his ascendency over the family of mr clapp his exclerk  clapp remembered the time when sitting on the edge of the chair he tossed off a bumper to the health of mrs s miss emmy and mr joseph in india at the merchants rich table in russell square  time magnified the splendour of those recollections in the honest clerks bosom  whenever he came up from the kitchenparlour to the drawingroom and partook of tea or ginandwater with mr sedley he would say this was not what you was accustomed to once sir and as gravely and reverentially drink the health of the ladies as he had done in the days of their utmost prosperity  he thought miss melias playing the divinest music ever performed and her the finest lady he never would sit down before sedley at the club even nor would he have that gentlemans character abused by any member of the society  he had seen the first men in london shaking hands with mr s he said hed known him in times when rothschild might be seen on change with him any day and he owed him personally everythink  clapp with the best of characters and handwritings had been able very soon after his masters disaster to find other employment for himself such a little fish as me can swim in any bucket he used to remark and a member of the house from which old sedley had seceded was very glad to make use of mr clapps services and to reward them with a comfortable salary  in fine all sedleys wealthy friends had dropped off one by one and this poor exdependent still remained faithfully attached to him  out of the small residue of her income which amelia kept back for herself the widow had need of all the thrift and care possible in order to enable her to keep her darling boy dressed in such a manner as became george osbornes son and to defray the expenses of the little school to which after much misgiving and reluctance and many secret pangs and fears on her own part she had been induced to send the lad she had sat up of nights conning lessons and spelling over crabbed grammars and geography books in order to teach them to georgy  she had worked even at the latin accidence fondly hoping that she might be capable of instructing him in that language  to part with him all day to send him out to the mercy of a schoolmasters cane and his schoolfellows roughness was almost like weaning him over again to that weak mother so tremulous and full of sensibility  he for his part rushed off to the school with the utmost happiness  he was longing for the change that childish gladness wounded his mother who was herself so grieved to part with him  she would rather have had him more sorry she thought and then was deeply repentant within herself for daring to be so selfish as to wish her own son to be unhappy  georgy made great progress in the school which was kept by a friend of his mothers constant admirer the rev mr binny  he brought home numberless prizes and testimonials of ability  he told his mother countless stories every night about his schoolcompanions and what a fine fellow lyons was and what a sneak sniffin was and how steels father actually supplied the meat for the establishment whereas goldings mother came in a carriage to fetch him every saturday and how neat had straps to his trowsersmight he have strapsand how bull major was so strong though only in eutropius that it was believed he could lick the usher mr ward himself  so amelia learned to know every one of the boys in that school as well as georgy himself and of nights she used to help him in his exercises and puzzle her little head over his lessons as eagerly as if she was herself going in the morning into the presence of the master once after a certain combat with master smith george came home to his mother with a black eye and bragged prodigiously to his parent and his delighted old grandfather about his valour in the fight in which if the truth was known he did not behave with particular heroism and in which he decidedly had the worst  but amelia has never forgiven that smith to this day though he is now a peaceful apothecary near leicester square  in these quiet labours and harmless cares the gentle widows life was passing away a silver hair or two marking the progress of time on her head and a line deepening ever so little on her fair forehead  she used to smile at these marks of time  what matters it she asked for an old woman like me all she hoped for was to live to see her son great famous and glorious as he deserved to be  she kept his copybooks his drawings and compositions and showed them about in her little circle as if they were miracles of genius  she confided some of these specimens to miss dobbin to show them to miss osborne georges aunt to show them to mr osborne himselfto make that old man repent of his cruelty and ill feeling towards him who was gone all her husbands faults and foibles she had buried in the grave with him she only remembered the lover who had married her at all sacrifices the noble husband so brave and beautiful in whose arms she had hung on the morning when he had gone away to fight and die gloriously for his king from heaven the hero must be smiling down upon that paragon of a boy whom he had left to comfort and console her we have seen how one of georges grandfathers mr osborne in his easy chair in russell square daily grew more violent and moody and how his daughter with her fine carriage and her fine horses and her name on half the public charitylists of the town was a lonely miserable persecuted old maid  she thought again and again of the beautiful little boy her brothers son whom she had seen  she longed to be allowed to drive in the fine carriage to the house in which he lived and she used to look out day after day as she took her solitary drive in the park in hopes that she might see him  her sister the bankers lady occasionally condescended to pay her old home and companion a visit in russell square  she brought a couple of sickly children attended by a prim nurse and in a faint genteel giggling tone cackled to her sister about her fine acquaintance and how her little frederick was the image of lord claud lollypop and her sweet maria had been noticed by the baroness as they were driving in their donkeychaise at roehampton  she urged her to make her papa do something for the darlings frederick she had determined should go into the guards and if they made an elder son of him and mr bullock was positively ruining and pinching himself to death to buy land how was the darling girl to be provided for i expect you dear mrs bullock would say for of course my share of our papas property must go to the head of the house you know  dear rhoda mcmull will disengage the whole of the castletoddy property as soon as poor dear lord castletoddy dies who is quite epileptic and little macduff mcmull will be viscount castletoddy  both the mr bludyers of mincing lane have settled their fortunes on fanny bludyers little boy  my darling frederick must positively be an eldest son andand do ask papa to bring us back his account in lombard street will you dear it doesnt look well his going to stumpy and rowdys after which kind of speeches in which fashion and the main chance were blended together and after a kiss which was like the contact of an oystermrs frederick bullock would gather her starched nurslings and simper back into her carriage  every visit which this leader of ton paid to her family was more unlucky for her  her father paid more money into stumpy and rowdys her patronage became more and more insufferable  the poor widow in the little cottage at brompton guarding her treasure there little knew how eagerly some people coveted it  on that night when jane osborne had told her father that she had seen his grandson the old man had made her no reply but he had shown no angerand had bade her goodnight on going himself to his room in rather a kindly voice  and he must have meditated on what she said and have made some inquiries of the dobbin family regarding her visit for a fortnight after it took place he asked her where was her little french watch and chain she used to wear  i bought it with my money sir she said in a great fright  go and order another like it or a better if you can get it said the old gentleman and lapsed again into silence  of late the misses dobbin more than once repeated their entreaties to amelia to allow george to visit them his aunt had shown her inclination perhaps his grandfather himself they hinted might be disposed to be reconciled to him  surely amelia could not refuse such advantageous chances for the boy  nor could she but she acceded to their overtures with a very heavy and suspicious heart was always uneasy during the childs absence from her and welcomed him back as if he was rescued out of some danger  he brought back money and toys at which the widow looked with alarm and jealousy she asked him always if he had seen any gentlemanonly old sir william who drove him about in the fourwheeled chaise and mr dobbin who arrived on the beautiful bay horse in the afternoonin the green coat and pink neckcloth with the goldheaded whip who promised to show him the tower of london and take him out with the surrey hounds at last he said there was an old gentleman with thick eyebrows and a broad hat and large chain and seals he came one day as the coachman was lunging georgy round the lawn on the gray pony  he looked at me very much  he shook very much  i said my name is norval after dinner my aunt began to cry  she is always crying such was georges report on that night  then amelia knew that the boy had seen his grandfather and looked out feverishly for a proposal which she was sure would follow and which came in fact in a few days afterwards  mr osborne formally offered to take the boy and make him heir to the fortune which he had intended that his father should inherit  he would make mrs george osborne an allowance such as to assure her a decent competency  if mrs george osborne proposed to marry again as mr o  heard was her intention he would not withdraw that allowance but it must be understood that the child would live entirely with his grandfather in russell square or at whatever other place mr o should select and that he would be occasionally permitted to see mrs george osborne at her own residence this message was brought or read to her in a letter one day when her mother was from home and her father absent as usual in the city  she was never seen angry but twice or thrice in her life and it was in one of these moods that mr osbornes attorney had the fortune to behold her  she rose up trembling and flushing very much as soon as after reading the letter mr poe handed it to her and she tore the paper into a hundred fragments which she trod on  i marry again  i take money to part from my child  who dares insult me by proposing such a thing tell mr osborne it is a cowardly letter sira cowardly letteri will not answer it  i wish you good morning sirand she bowed me out of the room like a tragedy queen said the lawyer who told the story  her parents never remarked her agitation on that day and she never told them of the interview  they had their own affairs to interest them affairs which deeply interested this innocent and unconscious lady  the old gentleman her father was always dabbling in speculation we have seen how the wine company and the coal company had failed him  but prowling about the city always eagerly and restlessly still he lighted upon some other scheme of which he thought so well that he embarked in it in spite of the remonstrances of mr clapp to whom indeed he never dared to tell how far he had engaged himself in it  and as it was always mr sedleys maxim not to talk about money matters before women they had no inkling of the misfortunes that were in store for them until the unhappy old gentleman was forced to make gradual confessions  the bills of the little household which had been settled weekly first fell into arrear  the remittances had not arrived from india mr sedley told his wife with a disturbed face  as she had paid her bills very regularly hitherto one or two of the tradesmen to whom the poor lady was obliged to go round asking for time were very angry at a delay to which they were perfectly used from more irregular customers emmys contribution paid over cheerfully without any questions kept the little company in halfrations however  and the first six months passed away pretty easily old sedley still keeping up with the notion that his shares must rise and that all would be well  no sixty pounds however came to help the household at the end of the half year and it fell deeper and deeper into troublemrs sedley who was growing infirm and was much shaken remained silent or wept a great deal with mrs clapp in the kitchen  the butcher was particularly surly the grocer insolent  once or twice little georgy had grumbled about the dinners and amelia who still would have been satisfied with a slice of bread for her own dinner could not but perceive that her son was neglected and purchased little things out of her private purse to keep the boy in health  at last they told her or told her such a garbled story as people in difficulties tell  one day her own money having been received and amelia about to pay it over she who had kept an account of the moneys expended by her proposed to keep a certain portion back out of her dividend having contracted engagements for a new suit for georgy  then it came out that joss remittances were not paid that the house was in difficulties which amelia ought to have seen before her mother said but she cared for nothing or nobody except georgy at this she passed all her money across the table without a word to her mother and returned to her room to cry her eyes out she had a great access of sensibility too that day when obliged to go and countermand the clothes the darling clothes on which she had set her heart for christmas day and the cut and fashion of which she had arranged in many conversations with a small milliner her friend  hardest of all she had to break the matter to georgy who made a loud outcry  everybody had new clothes at christmas  the others would laugh at him  he would have new clothes  she had promised them to him  the poor widow had only kisses to give him  she darned the old suit in tears  she cast about among her little ornaments to see if she could sell anything to procure the desired novelties  there was her india shawl that dobbin had sent her  she remembered in former days going with her mother to a fine india shop on ludgate hill where the ladies had all sorts of dealings and bargains in these articles  her cheeks flushed and her eyes shone with pleasure as she thought of this resource and she kissed away george to school in the morning smiling brightly after him  the boy felt that there was good news in her look  packing up her shawl in a handkerchief another of the gifts of the good major she hid them under her cloak and walked flushed and eager all the way to ludgate hill tripping along by the park wall and running over the crossings so that many a man turned as she hurried by him and looked after her rosy pretty face  she calculated how she should spend the proceeds of her shawlhow besides the clothes she would buy the books that he longed for and pay his halfyears schooling and how she would buy a cloak for her father instead of that old greatcoat which he wore  she was not mistaken as to the value of the majors gift  it was a very fine and beautiful web and the merchant made a very good bargain when he gave her twenty guineas for her shawl  she ran on amazed and flurried with her riches to dartons shop in st pauls churchyard and there purchased the parents assistant and the sandford and merton georgy longed for and got into the coach there with her parcel and went home exulting  and she pleased herself by writing in the flyleaf in her neatest little hand george osborne a christmas gift from his affectionate mother the books are extant to this day with the fair delicate superscription  she was going from her own room with the books in her hand to place them on georges table where he might find them on his return from school when in the passage she and her mother met  the gilt bindings of the seven handsome little volumes caught the old ladys eye  what are those she said  some books for georgy amelia repliedii promised them to him at christmas  books cried the elder lady indignantly books when the whole house wants bread  books when to keep you and your son in luxury and your dear father out of gaol ive sold every trinket i had the india shawl from my back even down to the very spoons that our tradesmen mightnt insult us and that mr clapp which indeed he is justly entitled being not a hard landlord and a civil man and a father might have his rent  oh amelia you break my heart with your books and that boy of yours whom you are ruining though part with him you will not  oh amelia may god send you a more dutiful child than i have had  theres jos deserts his father in his old age and theres george who might be provided for and who might be rich going to school like a lord with a gold watch and chain round his neckwhile my dear dear old man is without a shshilling hysteric sobs and cries ended mrs sedleys speechit echoed through every room in the small house whereof the other female inmates heard every word of the colloquy  oh mother mother cried poor amelia in reply you told me nothingii promised him the books ii only sold my shawl this morning  take the moneytake everythingand with quivering hands she took out her silver and her sovereignsher precious golden sovereigns which she thrust into the hands of her mother whence they overflowed and tumbled rolling down the stairs  and then she went into her room and sank down in despair and utter misery  she saw it all now  her selfishness was sacrificing the boy but for her he might have wealth station education and his fathers place which the elder george had forfeited for her sake she had but to speak the words and her father was restored to competency and the boy raised to fortune  oh what a conviction it was to that tender and stricken heart    chapter xlvii  gaunt house  all the world knows that lord steynes town palace stands in gaunt square out of which great gaunt street leads whither we first conducted rebecca in the time of the departed sir pitt crawley peering over the railings and through the black trees into the garden of the square you see a few miserable governesses with wanfaced pupils wandering round and round it and round the dreary grassplot in the centre of which rises the statue of lord gaunt who fought at minden in a threetailed wig and otherwise habited like a roman emperor  gaunt house occupies nearly a side of the square the remaining three sides are composed of mansions that have passed away into dowagerismtall dark houses with windowframes of stone or picked out of a lighter red  little light seems to be behind those lean comfortless casements now and hospitality to have passed away from those doors as much as the laced lacqueys and linkboys of old times who used to put out their torches in the blank iron extinguishers that still flank the lamps over the steps brass plates have penetrated into the squaredoctors the diddlesex bank western branchthe english and european reunion cit has a dreary looknor is my lord steynes palace less dreary  all i have ever seen of it is the vast wall in front with the rustic columns at the great gate through which an old porter peers sometimes with a fat and gloomy red faceand over the wall the garret and bedroom windows and the chimneys out of which there seldom comes any smoke now  for the present lord steyne lives at naples preferring the view of the bay and capri and vesuvius to the dreary aspect of the wall in gaunt square  a few score yards down new gaunt street and leading into gaunt mews indeed is a little modest back door which you would not remark from that of any of the other stables  but many a little close carriage has stopped at that door as my informant little tom eaves who knows everything and who showed me the place told me the prince and perdita have been in and out of that door sir he had often told me marianne clarke has entered it with the duke of  it conducts to the famous petits appartements of lord steyneone sir fitted up all in ivory and white satin another in ebony and black velvet there is a little banquetingroom taken from sallusts house at pompeii and painted by coswaya little private kitchen in which every saucepan was silver and all the spits were gold  it was there that egalite orleans roasted partridges on the night when he and the marquis of steyne won a hundred thousand from a great personage at ombre  half of the money went to the french revolution half to purchase lord gaunts marquisate and garterand the remainder but it forms no part of our scheme to tell what became of the remainder for every shilling of which and a great deal more little tom eaves who knows everybodys affairs is ready to account  besides his town palace the marquis had castles and palaces in various quarters of the three kingdoms whereof the descriptions may be found in the roadbookscastle strongbow with its woods on the shannon shore gaunt castle in carmarthenshire where richard ii was taken prisonergauntly hall in yorkshire where i have been informed there were two hundred silver teapots for the breakfasts of the guests of the house with everything to correspond in splendour and stillbrook in hampshire which was my lords farm an humble place of residence of which we all remember the wonderful furniture which was sold at my lords demise by a late celebrated auctioneer  the marchioness of steyne was of the renowned and ancient family of the caerlyons marquises of camelot who have preserved the old faith ever since the conversion of the venerable druid their first ancestor and whose pedigree goes far beyond the date of the arrival of king brute in these islands  pendragon is the title of the eldest son of the house the sons have been called arthurs uthers and caradocs from immemorial time their heads have fallen in many a loyal conspiracy elizabeth chopped off the head of the arthur of her day who had been chamberlain to philip and mary and carried letters between the queen of scots and her uncles the guises  a cadet of the house was an officer of the great duke and distinguished in the famous saint bartholomew conspiracy  during the whole of marys confinement the house of camelot conspired in her behalf it was as much injured by its charges in fitting out an armament against the spaniards during the time of the armada as by the fines and confiscations levied on it by elizabeth for harbouring of priests obstinate recusancy and popish misdoings  a recreant of jamess time was momentarily perverted from his religion by the arguments of that great theologian and the fortunes of the family somewhat restored by his timely weakness  but the earl of camelot of the reign of charles returned to the old creed of his family and they continued to fight for it and ruin themselves for it as long as there was a stuart left to head or to instigate a rebellion  lady mary caerlyon was brought up at a parisian convent the dauphiness marie antoinette was her godmother  in the pride of her beauty she had been marriedsold it was saidto lord gaunt then at paris who won vast sums from the ladys brother at some of philip of orleanss banquets  the earl of gaunts famous duel with the count de la marche of the grey musqueteers was attributed by common report to the pretensions of that officer who had been a page and remained a favourite of the queen to the hand of the beautiful lady mary caerlyon  she was married to lord gaunt while the count lay ill of his wound and came to dwell at gaunt house and to figure for a short time in the splendid court of the prince of wales  fox had toasted her morris and sheridan had written songs about her  malmesbury had made her his best bow walpole had pronounced her charming devonshire had been almost jealous of her but she was scared by the wild pleasures and gaieties of the society into which she was flung and after she had borne a couple of sons shrank away into a life of devout seclusion no wonder that my lord steyne who liked pleasure and cheerfulness was not often seen after their marriage by the side of this trembling silent superstitious unhappy lady  the beforementioned tom eaves who has no part in this history except that he knew all the great folks in london and the stories and mysteries of each family had further information regarding my lady steyne which may or may not be true  the humiliations tom used to say which that woman has been made to undergo in her own house have been frightful lord steyne has made her sit down to table with women with whom i would rather die than allow mrs eaves to associatewith lady crackenbury with mrs chippenham with madame de la cruchecassee the french secretarys wife from every one of which ladies tom eaveswho would have sacrificed his wife for knowing themwas too glad to get a bow or a dinner with the reigning favourite in a word and do you suppose that that woman of that family who are as proud as the bourbons and to whom the steynes are but lackeys mushrooms of yesterday for after all they are not of the old gaunts but of a minor and doubtful branch of the house do you suppose i say the reader must bear in mind that it is always tom eaves who speaks that the marchioness of steyne the haughtiest woman in england would bend down to her husband so submissively if there were not some cause pooh i tell you there are secret reasons i tell you that in the emigration the abbe de la marche who was here and was employed in the quiberoon business with puisaye and tinteniac was the same colonel of mousquetaires gris with whom steyne fought in the year 86that he and the marchioness met againthat it was after the reverend colonel was shot in brittany that lady steyne took to those extreme practices of devotion which she carries on now for she is closeted with her director every dayshe is at service at spanish place every morning ive watched her therethat is ive happened to be passing thereand depend on it theres a mystery in her case people are not so unhappy unless they have something to repent of added tom eaves with a knowing wag of his head and depend on it that woman would not be so submissive as she is if the marquis had not some sword to hold over her  so if mr eavess information be correct it is very likely that this lady in her high station had to submit to many a private indignity and to hide many secret griefs under a calm face  and let us my brethren who have not our names in the red book console ourselves by thinking comfortably how miserable our betters may be and that damocles who sits on satin cushions and is served on gold plate has an awful sword hanging over his head in the shape of a bailiff or an hereditary disease or a family secret which peeps out every now and then from the embroidered arras in a ghastly manner and will be sure to drop one day or the other in the right place  in comparing too the poor mans situation with that of the great there is always according to mr eaves another source of comfort for the former  you who have little or no patrimony to bequeath or to inherit may be on good terms with your father or your son whereas the heir of a great prince such as my lord steyne must naturally be angry at being kept out of his kingdom and eye the occupant of it with no very agreeable glances take it as a rule this sardonic old laves would say the fathers and elder sons of all great families hate each other  the crown prince is always in opposition to the crown or hankering after it  shakespeare knew the world my good sir and when he describes prince hal from whose family the gaunts pretend to be descended though they are no more related to john of gaunt than you are trying on his fathers coronet he gives you a natural description of all heirs apparent if you were heir to a dukedom and a thousand pounds a day do you mean to say you would not wish for possession pooh  and it stands to reason that every great man having experienced this feeling towards his father must be aware that his son entertains it towards himself and so they cant but be suspicious and hostile  then again as to the feeling of elder towards younger sons  my dear sir you ought to know that every elder brother looks upon the cadets of the house as his natural enemies who deprive him of so much ready money which ought to be his by right  i have often heard george mac turk lord bajazets eldest son say that if he had his will when he came to the title he would do what the sultans do and clear the estate by chopping off all his younger brothers heads at once and so the case is more or less with them all  i tell you they are all turks in their hearts  pooh sir they know the world and here haply a great man coming up tom eavess hat would drop off his head and he would rush forward with a bow and a grin which showed that he knew the world tooin the tomeavesian way that is  and having laid out every shilling of his fortune on an annuity tom could afford to bear no malice to his nephews and nieces and to have no other feeling with regard to his betters but a constant and generous desire to dine with them  between the marchioness and the natural and tender regard of mother for children there was that cruel barrier placed of difference of faith the very love which she might feel for her sons only served to render the timid and pious lady more fearful and unhappy  the gulf which separated them was fatal and impassable  she could not stretch her weak arms across it or draw her children over to that side away from which her belief told her there was no safety during the youth of his sons lord steyne who was a good scholar and amateur casuist had no better sport in the evening after dinner in the country than in setting the boys tutor the reverend mr trail now my lord bishop of ealing on her ladyships director father mole over their wine and in pitting oxford against st acheul  he cried bravo latimer  well said loyola alternately he promised mole a bishopric if he would come over and vowed he would use all his influence to get trail a cardinals hat if he would secede  neither divine allowed himself to be conquered and though the fond mother hoped that her youngest and favourite son would be reconciled to her churchhis mother churcha sad and awful disappointment awaited the devout ladya disappointment which seemed to be a judgement upon her for the sin of her marriage  my lord gaunt married as every person who frequents the peerage knows the lady blanche thistlewood a daughter of the noble house of bareacres before mentioned in this veracious history  a wing of gaunt house was assigned to this couple for the head of the family chose to govern it and while he reigned to reign supreme his son and heir however living little at home disagreeing with his wife and borrowing upon postobits such moneys as he required beyond the very moderate sums which his father was disposed to allow him  the marquis knew every shilling of his sons debts at his lamented demise he was found himself to be possessor of many of his heirs bonds purchased for their benefit and devised by his lordship to the children of his younger son  as to my lord gaunts dismay and the chuckling delight of his natural enemy and father the lady gaunt had no childrenthe lord george gaunt was desired to return from vienna where he was engaged in waltzing and diplomacy and to contract a matrimonial alliance with the honourable joan only daughter of john johnes first baron helvellyn and head of the firm of jones brown and robinson of threadneedle street bankers from which union sprang several sons and daughters whose doings do not appertain to this story  the marriage at first was a happy and prosperous one my lord george gaunt could not only read but write pretty correctly  he spoke french with considerable fluency and was one of the finest waltzers in europe  with these talents and his interest at home there was little doubt that his lordship would rise to the highest dignities in his profession  the lady his wife felt that courts were her sphere and her wealth enabled her to receive splendidly in those continental towns whither her husbands diplomatic duties led him there was talk of appointing him minister and bets were laid at the travellers that he would be ambassador ere long when of a sudden rumours arrived of the secretarys extraordinary behaviour at a grand diplomatic dinner given by his chief he had started up and declared that a pate de foie gras was poisoned  he went to a ball at the hotel of the bavarian envoy the count de springbockhohenlaufen with his head shaved and dressed as a capuchin friar it was not a masked ball as some folks wanted to persuade you  it was something queer people whispered  his grandfather was so  it was in the family  his wife and family returned to this country and took up their abode at gaunt house  lord george gave up his post on the european continent and was gazetted to brazil  but people knew better he never returned from that brazil expeditionnever died therenever lived therenever was there at all  he was nowhere he was gone out altogether brazil said one gossip to another with a grinbrazil is st johns wood  rio de janeiro is a cottage surrounded by four walls and george gaunt is accredited to a keeper who has invested him with the order of the straitwaistcoat these are the kinds of epitaphs which men pass over one another in vanity fair  twice or thrice in a week in the earliest morning the poor mother went for her sins and saw the poor invalid sometimes he laughed at her and his laughter was more pitiful than to hear him cry sometimes she found the brilliant dandy diplomatist of the congress of vienna dragging about a childs toy or nursing the keepers babys doll sometimes he knew her and father mole her director and companion oftener he forgot her as he had done wife children love ambition vanity  but he remembered his dinnerhour and used to cry if his wineandwater was not strong enough  it was the mysterious taint of the blood the poor mother had brought it from her own ancient race  the evil had broken out once or twice in the fathers family long before lady steynes sins had begun or her fasts and tears and penances had been offered in their expiation  the pride of the race was struck down as the firstborn of pharaoh  the dark mark of fate and doom was on the thresholdthe tall old threshold surmounted by coronets and caned heraldry  the absent lords children meanwhile prattled and grew on quite unconscious that the doom was over them too  first they talked of their father and devised plans against his return  then the name of the living dead man was less frequently in their mouththen not mentioned at all  but the stricken old grandmother trembled to think that these too were the inheritors of their fathers shame as well as of his honours and watched sickening for the day when the awful ancestral curse should come down on them  this dark presentiment also haunted lord steyne  he tried to lay the horrid bedside ghost in red seas of wine and jollity and lost sight of it sometimes in the crowd and rout of his pleasures  but it always came back to him when alone and seemed to grow more threatening with years  i have taken your son it said why not you i may shut you up in a prison some day like your son george  i may tap you on the head tomorrow and away go pleasure and honours feasts and beauty friends flatterers french cooks fine horses and housesin exchange for a prison a keeper and a straw mattress like george gaunts and then my lord would defy the ghost which threatened him for he knew of a remedy by which he could baulk his enemy  so there was splendour and wealth but no great happiness perchance behind the tall caned portals of gaunt house with its smoky coronets and ciphers  the feasts there were of the grandest in london but there was not overmuch content therewith except among the guests who sat at my lords table  had he not been so great a prince very few possibly would have visited him but in vanity fair the sins of very great personages are looked at indulgently  nous regardons a deux fois as the french lady said before we condemn a person of my lords undoubted quality  some notorious carpers and squeamish moralists might be sulky with lord steyne but they were glad enough to come when he asked them  lord steyne is really too bad lady slingstone said but everybody goes and of course i shall see that my girls come to no harm his lordship is a man to whom i owe much everything in life said the right reverend doctor trail thinking that the archbishop was rather shaky and mrs trail and the young ladies would as soon have missed going to church as to one of his lordships parties  his morals are bad said little lord southdown to his sister who meekly expostulated having heard terrific legends from her mamma with respect to the doings at gaunt house but hang it hes got the best dry sillery in europe and as for sir pitt crawley bartsir pitt that pattern of decorum sir pitt who had led off at missionary meetingshe never for one moment thought of not going too  where you see such persons as the bishop of ealing and the countess of slingstone you may be pretty sure jane the baronet would say that we cannot be wrong the great rank and station of lord steyne put him in a position to command people in our station in life  the lord lieutenant of a county my dear is a respectable man  besides george gaunt and i were intimate in early life he was my junior when we were attaches at pumpernickel together  in a word everybody went to wait upon this great maneverybody who was asked as you the reader do not say nay or i the writer hereof would go if we had an invitation    chapter xlviii  in which the reader is introduced to the very best of company  at last beckys kindness and attention to the chief of her husbands family were destined to meet with an exceeding great reward a reward which though certainly somewhat unsubstantial the little woman coveted with greater eagerness than more positive benefits if she did not wish to lead a virtuous life at least she desired to enjoy a character for virtue and we know that no lady in the genteel world can possess this desideratum until she has put on a train and feathers and has been presented to her sovereign at court from that august interview they come out stamped as honest women the lord chamberlain gives them a certificate of virtue  and as dubious goods or letters are passed through an oven at quarantine sprinkled with aromatic vinegar and then pronounced clean many a lady whose reputation would be doubtful otherwise and liable to give infection passes through the wholesome ordeal of the royal presence and issues from it free from all taint  it might be very well for my lady bareacres my lady tufto mrs bute crawley in the country and other ladies who had come into contact with mrs rawdon crawley to cry fie at the idea of the odious little adventuress making her curtsey before the sovereign and to declare that if dear good queen charlotte had been alive she never would have admitted such an extremely illregulated personage into her chaste drawingroom  but when we consider that it was the first gentleman in europe in whose high presence mrs rawdon passed her examination and as it were took her degree in reputation it surely must be flat disloyalty to doubt any more about her virtue  i for my part look back with love and awe to that great character in history  ah what a high and noble appreciation of gentlewomanhood there must have been in vanity fair when that revered and august being was invested by the universal acclaim of the refined and educated portion of this empire with the title of premier gentilhomme of his kingdom  do you remember dear m oh friend of my youth how one blissful night fiveandtwenty years since the hypocrite being acted elliston being manager dowton and liston performers two boys had leave from their loyal masters to go out from slaughterhouse school where they were educated and to appear on drury lane stage amongst a crowd which assembled there to greet the king  the king there he was beefeaters were before the august box the marquis of steyne lord of the powder closet and other great officers of state were behind the chair on which he sat he satflorid of face portly of person covered with orders and in a rich curling head of hairhow we sang god save him how the house rocked and shouted with that magnificent music  how they cheered and cried and waved handkerchiefs  ladies wept mothers clasped their children some fainted with emotion  people were suffocated in the pit shrieks and groans rising up amidst the writhing and shouting mass there of his people who were and indeed showed themselves almost to be ready to die for him  yes we saw him  fate cannot deprive us of that  others have seen napoleon  some few still exist who have beheld frederick the great doctor johnson marie antoinette cbe it our reasonable boast to our children that we saw george the good the magnificent the great  well there came a happy day in mrs rawdon crawleys existence when this angel was admitted into the paradise of a court which she coveted her sisterinlaw acting as her godmother  on the appointed day sir pitt and his lady in their great family carriage just newly built and ready for the baronets assumption of the office of high sheriff of his county drove up to the little house in curzon street to the edification of raggles who was watching from his greengrocers shop and saw fine plumes within and enormous bunches of flowers in the breasts of the new liverycoats of the footmen  sir pitt in a glittering uniform descended and went into curzon street his sword between his legs  little rawdon stood with his face against the parlour windowpanes smiling and nodding with all his might to his aunt in the carriage within and presently sir pitt issued forth from the house again leading forth a lady with grand feathers covered in a white shawl and holding up daintily a train of magnificent brocade  she stepped into the vehicle as if she were a princess and accustomed all her life to go to court smiling graciously on the footman at the door and on sir pitt who followed her into the carriage  then rawdon followed in his old guards uniform which had grown woefully shabby and was much too tight  he was to have followed the procession and waited upon his sovereign in a cab but that his goodnatured sisterinlaw insisted that they should be a family party the coach was large the ladies not very big they would hold their trains in their lapsfinally the four went fraternally together and their carriage presently joined the line of royal equipages which was making its way down piccadilly and st  jamess street towards the old brick palace where the star of brunswick was in waiting to receive his nobles and gentlefolks  becky felt as if she could bless the people out of the carriage windows so elated was she in spirit and so strong a sense had she of the dignified position which she had at last attained in life even our becky had her weaknesses and as one often sees how men pride themselves upon excellences which others are slow to perceive how for instance comus firmly believes that he is the greatest tragic actor in england how brown the famous novelist longs to be considered not a man of genius but a man of fashion while robinson the great lawyer does not in the least care about his reputation in westminster hall but believes himself incomparable across country and at a fivebarred gateso to be and to be thought a respectable woman was beckys aim in life and she got up the genteel with amazing assiduity readiness and success  we have said there were times when she believed herself to be a fine lady and forgot that there was no money in the chest at homeduns round the gate tradesmen to coax and wheedleno ground to walk upon in a word  and as she went to court in the carriage the family carriage she adopted a demeanour so grand selfsatisfied deliberate and imposing that it made even lady jane laugh  she walked into the royal apartments with a toss of the head which would have befitted an empress and i have no doubt had she been one she would have become the character perfectly  we are authorized to state that mrs rawdon crawleys costume de cour on the occasion of her presentation to the sovereign was of the most elegant and brilliant description  some ladies we may have seenwe who wear stars and cordons and attend the st  jamess assemblies or we who in muddy boots dawdle up and down pall mall and peep into the coaches as they drive up with the great folks in their featherssome ladies of fashion i say we may have seen about two oclock of the forenoon of a levee day as the lacedjacketed band of the life guards are blowing triumphal marches seated on those prancing musicstools their creamcoloured chargerswho are by no means lovely and enticing objects at that early period of noon  a stout countess of sixty decolletee painted wrinkled with rouge up to her drooping eyelids and diamonds twinkling in her wig is a wholesome and edifying but not a pleasant sight  she has the faded look of a st  jamess street illumination as it may be seen of an early morning when half the lamps are out and the others are blinking wanly as if they were about to vanish like ghosts before the dawn  such charms as those of which we catch glimpses while her ladyships carriage passes should appear abroad at night alone  if even cynthia looks haggard of an afternoon as we may see her sometimes in the present winter season with phoebus staring her out of countenance from the opposite side of the heavens how much more can old lady castlemouldy keep her head up when the sun is shining full upon it through the chariot windows and showing all the chinks and crannies with which time has marked her face  no drawingrooms should be announced for november or the first foggy day or the elderly sultanas of our vanity fair should drive up in closed litters descend in a covered way and make their curtsey to the sovereign under the protection of lamplight  our beloved rebecca had no need however of any such a friendly halo to set off her beauty  her complexion could bear any sunshine as yet and her dress though if you were to see it now any present lady of vanity fair would pronounce it to be the most foolish and preposterous attire ever worn was as handsome in her eyes and those of the public some fiveandtwenty years since as the most brilliant costume of the most famous beauty of the present season a score of years hence that too that milliners wonder will have passed into the domain of the absurd along with all previous vanities  but we are wandering too much  mrs rawdons dress was pronounced to be charmante on the eventful day of her presentation even good little lady jane was forced to acknowledge this effect as she looked at her kinswoman and owned sorrowfully to herself that she was quite inferior in taste to mrs becky  she did not know how much care thought and genius mrs rawdon had bestowed upon that garment  rebecca had as good taste as any milliner in europe and such a clever way of doing things as lady jane little understood the latter quickly spied out the magnificence of the brocade of beckys train and the splendour of the lace on her dress  the brocade was an old remnant becky said and as for the lace it was a great bargain  she had had it these hundred years  my dear mrs crawley it must have cost a little fortune lady jane said looking down at her own lace which was not nearly so good and then examining the quality of the ancient brocade which formed the material of mrs rawdons court dress she felt inclined to say that she could not afford such fine clothing but checked that speech with an effort as one uncharitable to her kinswoman  and yet if lady jane had known all i think even her kindly temper would have failed her  the fact is when she was putting sir pitts house in order mrs rawdon had found the lace and the brocade in old wardrobes the property of the former ladies of the house and had quietly carried the goods home and had suited them to her own little person  briggs saw her take them asked no questions told no stories but i believe quite sympathised with her on this matter and so would many another honest woman  and the diamondswhere the doose did you get the diamonds becky said her husband admiring some jewels which he had never seen before and which sparkled in her ears and on her neck with brilliance and profusion  becky blushed a little and looked at him hard for a moment  pitt crawley blushed a little too and looked out of window  the fact is he had given her a very small portion of the brilliants a pretty diamond clasp which confined a pearl necklace which she woreand the baronet had omitted to mention the circumstance to his lady  becky looked at her husband and then at sir pitt with an air of saucy triumphas much as to say shall i betray you  guess she said to her husband  why you silly man she continued where do you suppose i got themall except the little clasp which a dear friend of mine gave me long ago  i hired them to be sure  i hired them at mr poloniuss in coventry street you dont suppose that all the diamonds which go to court belong to the wearers like those beautiful stones which lady jane has and which are much handsomer than any which i have i am certain  they are family jewels said sir pitt again looking uneasy  and in this family conversation the carriage rolled down the street until its cargo was finally discharged at the gates of the palace where the sovereign was sitting in state  the diamonds which had created rawdons admiration never went back to mr polonius of coventry street and that gentleman never applied for their restoration but they retired into a little private repository in an old desk which amelia sedley had given her years and years ago and in which becky kept a number of useful and perhaps valuable things about which her husband knew nothing to know nothing or little is in the nature of some husbands  to hide in the nature of how many women oh ladies how many of you have surreptitious milliners bills how many of you have gowns and bracelets which you darent show or which you wear tremblingtrembling and coaxing with smiles the husband by your side who does not know the new velvet gown from the old one or the new bracelet from last years or has any notion that the raggedlooking yellow lace scarf cost forty guineas and that madame bobinot is writing dunning letters every week for the money  thus rawdon knew nothing about the brilliant diamond earrings or the superb brilliant ornament which decorated the fair bosom of his lady but lord steyne who was in his place at court as lord of the powder closet and one of the great dignitaries and illustrious defences of the throne of england and came up with all his stars garters collars and cordons and paid particular attention to the little woman knew whence the jewels came and who paid for them  as he bowed over her he smiled and quoted the hackneyed and beautiful lines from the rape of the lock about belindas diamonds which jews might kiss and infidels adore  but i hope your lordship is orthodox said the little lady with a toss of her head  and many ladies round about whispered and talked and many gentlemen nodded and whispered as they saw what marked attention the great nobleman was paying to the little adventuress  what were the circumstances of the interview between rebecca crawley nee sharp and her imperial master it does not become such a feeble and inexperienced pen as mine to attempt to relate  the dazzled eyes close before that magnificent idea  loyal respect and decency tell even the imagination not to look too keenly and audaciously about the sacred audiencechamber but to back away rapidly silently and respectfully making profound bows out of the august presence  this may be said that in all london there was no more loyal heart than beckys after this interview  the name of her king was always on her lips and he was proclaimed by her to be the most charming of men  she went to colnaghis and ordered the finest portrait of him that art had produced and credit could supply  she chose that famous one in which the best of monarchs is represented in a frockcoat with a fur collar and breeches and silk stockings simpering on a sofa from under his curly brown wig  she had him painted in a brooch and wore itindeed she amused and somewhat pestered her acquaintance with her perpetual talk about his urbanity and beauty who knows  perhaps the little woman thought she might play the part of a maintenon or a pompadour  but the finest sport of all after her presentation was to hear her talk virtuously  she had a few female acquaintances not it must be owned of the very highest reputation in vanity fair  but being made an honest woman of so to speak becky would not consort any longer with these dubious ones and cut lady crackenbury when the latter nodded to her from her operabox and gave mrs washington white the goby in the ring  one must my dear show one is somebody she said  one mustnt be seen with doubtful people  i pity lady crackenbury from my heart and mrs washington white may be a very goodnatured person you may go and dine with them as you like your rubber  but i mustnt and wont and you will have the goodness to tell smith to say i am not at home when either of them calls  the particulars of beckys costume were in the newspapersfeathers lappets superb diamonds and all the rest  lady crackenbury read the paragraph in bitterness of spirit and discoursed to her followers about the airs which that woman was giving herself  mrs bute crawley and her young ladies in the country had a copy of the morning post from town and gave a vent to their honest indignation if you had been sandyhaired greeneyed and a french ropedancers daughter mrs bute said to her eldest girl who on the contrary was a very swarthy short and snubnosed young lady you might have had superb diamonds forsooth and have been presented at court by your cousin the lady jane  but youre only a gentlewoman my poor dear child  you have only some of the best blood in england in your veins and good principles and piety for your portion  i myself the wife of a baronets younger brother too never thought of such a thing as going to courtnor would other people if good queen charlotte had been alive in this way the worthy rectoress consoled herself and her daughters sighed and sat over the peerage all night  a few days after the famous presentation another great and exceeding honour was vouchsafed to the virtuous becky  lady steynes carriage drove up to mr rawdon crawleys door and the footman instead of driving down the front of the house as by his tremendous knocking he appeared to be inclined to do relented and only delivered in a couple of cards on which were engraven the names of the marchioness of steyne and the countess of gaunt  if these bits of pasteboard had been beautiful pictures or had had a hundred yards of malines lace rolled round them worth twice the number of guineas becky could not have regarded them with more pleasure you may be sure they occupied a conspicuous place in the china bowl on the drawingroom table where becky kept the cards of her visitors  lord lord how poor mrs washington whites card and lady crackenburys cardwhich our little friend had been glad enough to get a few months back and of which the silly little creature was rather proud oncelord lord i say how soon at the appearance of these grand court cards did those poor little neglected deuces sink down to the bottom of the pack  steyne bareacres johnes of helvellyn  and caerylon of camelot we may be sure that becky and briggs looked out those august names in the peerage and followed the noble races up through all the ramifications of the family tree  my lord steyne coming to call a couple of hours afterwards and looking about him and observing everything as was his wont found his ladies cards already ranged as the trumps of beckys hand and grinned as this old cynic always did at any naive display of human weakness becky came down to him presently whenever the dear girl expected his lordship her toilette was prepared her hair in perfect order her mouchoirs aprons scarfs little morocco slippers and other female gimcracks arranged and she seated in some artless and agreeable posture ready to receive himwhenever she was surprised of course she had to fly to her apartment to take a rapid survey of matters in the glass and to trip down again to wait upon the great peer  she found him grinning over the bowl  she was discovered and she blushed a little  thank you monseigneur she said  you see your ladies have been here  how good of you  i couldnt come beforei was in the kitchen making a pudding  i know you were i saw you through the arearailings as i drove up replied the old gentleman  you see everything she replied  a few things but not that my pretty lady he said goodnaturedly you silly little fibster  i heard you in the room overhead where i have no doubt you were putting a little rouge onyou must give some of yours to my lady gaunt whose complexion is quite preposterousand i heard the bedroom door open and then you came downstairs  is it a crime to try and look my best when you come here answered mrs rawdon plaintively and she rubbed her cheek with her handkerchief as if to show there was no rouge at all only genuine blushes and modesty in her case  about this who can tell i know there is some rouge that wont come off on a pockethandkerchief and some so good that even tears will not disturb it  well said the old gentleman twiddling round his wifes card you are bent on becoming a fine lady you pester my poor old life out to get you into the world  you wont be able to hold your own there you silly little fool  youve got no money  you will get us a place interposed becky as quick as possible  youve got no money and you want to compete with those who have you poor little earthenware pipkin you want to swim down the stream along with the great copper kettles  all women are alike everybody is striving for what is not worth the having  gad  i dined with the king yesterday and we had neck of mutton and turnips a dinner of herbs is better than a stalled ox very often you will go to gaunt house  you give an old fellow no rest until you get there  its not half so nice as here youll be bored there  i am  my wife is as gay as lady macbeth and my daughters as cheerful as regan and goneril  i darent sleep in what they call my bedroom the bed is like the baldaquin of st  peters and the pictures frighten me  i have a little brass bed in a dressingroom and a little hair mattress like an anchorite i am an anchorite ho  ho  youll be asked to dinner next week  and gare aux femmes look out and hold your own  how the women will bully you this was a very long speech for a man of few words like my lord steyne nor was it the first which he uttered for beckys benefit on that day  briggs looked up from the worktable at which she was seated in the farther room and gave a deep sigh as she heard the great marquis speak so lightly of her sex  if you dont turn off that abominable sheepdog said lord steyne with a savage look over his shoulder at her i will have her poisoned  i always give my dog dinner from my own plate said rebecca laughing mischievously and having enjoyed for some time the discomfiture of my lord who hated poor briggs for interrupting his teteatete with the fair colonels wife mrs rawdon at length had pity upon her admirer and calling to briggs praised the fineness of the weather to her and bade her to take out the child for a walk  i cant send her away becky said presently after a pause and in a very sad voice  her eyes filled with tears as she spoke and she turned away her head  you owe her her wages i suppose said the peer  worse than that said becky still casting down her eyes i have ruined her  ruined her then why dont you turn her out the gentleman asked  men do that becky answered bitterly  women are not so bad as you last year when we were reduced to our last guinea she gave us everything  she shall never leave me until we are ruined utterly ourselves which does not seem far off or until i can pay her the utmost farthing   it how much is it said the peer with an oath and becky reflecting on the largeness of his means mentioned not only the sum which she had borrowed from miss briggs but one of nearly double the amount  this caused the lord steyne to break out in another brief and energetic expression of anger at which rebecca held down her head the more and cried bitterly  i could not help it  it was my only chance  i dare not tell my husband  he would kill me if i told him what i have done i have kept it a secret from everybody but youand you forced it from me  ah what shall i do lord steyne for i am very very unhappy  lord steyne made no reply except by beating the devils tattoo and biting his nails  at last he clapped his hat on his head and flung out of the room  rebecca did not rise from her attitude of misery until the door slammed upon him and his carriage whirled away  then she rose up with the queerest expression of victorious mischief glittering in her green eyes  she burst out laughing once or twice to herself as she sat at work and sitting down to the piano she rattled away a triumphant voluntary on the keys which made the people pause under her window to listen to her brilliant music  that night there came two notes from gaunt house for the little woman the one containing a card of invitation from lord and lady steyne to a dinner at gaunt house next friday while the other enclosed a slip of gray paper bearing lord steynes signature and the address of messrs jones brown and robinson lombard street  rawdon heard becky laughing in the night once or twice  it was only her delight at going to gaunt house and facing the ladies there she said which amused her so  but the truth was that she was occupied with a great number of other thoughts  should she pay off old briggs and give her her conge should she astonish raggles by settling his account she turned over all these thoughts on her pillow and on the next day when rawdon went out to pay his morning visit to the club mrs crawley in a modest dress with a veil on whipped off in a hackneycoach to the city  and being landed at messrs jones and robinsons bank presented a document there to the authority at the desk who in reply asked her how she would take it  she gently said she would take a hundred and fifty pounds in small notes and the remainder in one note and passing through st pauls churchyard stopped there and bought the handsomest black silk gown for briggs which money could buy and which with a kiss and the kindest speeches she presented to the simple old spinster  then she walked to mr raggles inquired about his children affectionately and gave him fifty pounds on account  then she went to the liveryman from whom she jobbed her carriages and gratified him with a similar sum  and i hope this will be a lesson to you spavin she said and that on the next drawingroom day my brother sir pitt will not be inconvenienced by being obliged to take four of us in his carriage to wait upon his majesty because my own carriage is not forthcoming it appears there had been a difference on the last drawingroom day  hence the degradation which the colonel had almost suffered of being obliged to enter the presence of his sovereign in a hack cab  these arrangements concluded becky paid a visit upstairs to the beforementioned desk which amelia sedley had given her years and years ago and which contained a number of useful and valuable little thingsin which private museum she placed the one note which messrs jones and robinsons cashier had given her    chapter xlix  in which we enjoy three courses and a dessert  when the ladies of gaunt house were at breakfast that morning lord steyne who took his chocolate in private and seldom disturbed the females of his household or saw them except upon public days or when they crossed each other in the hall or when from his pitbox at the opera he surveyed them in their box on the grand tier his lordship we say appeared among the ladies and the children who were assembled over the tea and toast and a battle royal ensued apropos of rebecca  my lady steyne he said i want to see the list for your dinner on friday and i want you if you please to write a card for colonel and mrs crawley  blanche writes them lady steyne said in a flutter lady gaunt writes them  i will not write to that person lady gaunt said a tall and stately lady who looked up for an instant and then down again after she had spoken  it was not good to meet lord steynes eyes for those who had offended him  send the children out of the room  go said he pulling at the bellrope  the urchins always frightened before him retired their mother would have followed too  not you he said  you stop  my lady steyne he said once more will you have the goodness to go to the desk and write that card for your dinner on friday  my lord i will not be present at it lady gaunt said i will go home  i wish you would and stay there  you will find the bailiffs at bareacres very pleasant company and i shall be freed from lending money to your relations and from your own damned tragedy airs  who are you to give orders here you have no money  youve got no brains  you were here to have children and you have not had any gaunts tired of you and georges wife is the only person in the family who doesnt wish you were dead  gaunt would marry again if you were  i wish i were her ladyship answered with tears and rage in her eyes  you forsooth must give yourself airs of virtue while my wife who is an immaculate saint as everybody knows and never did wrong in her life has no objection to meet my young friend mrs crawley my lady steyne knows that appearances are sometimes against the best of women that lies are often told about the most innocent of them pray madam shall i tell you some little anecdotes about my lady bareacres your mamma  you may strike me if you like sir or hit any cruel blow lady gaunt said  to see his wife and daughter suffering always put his lordship into a good humour  my sweet blanche he said i am a gentleman and never lay my hand upon a woman save in the way of kindness  i only wish to correct little faults in your character  you women are too proud and sadly lack humility as father mole im sure would tell my lady steyne if he were here  you mustnt give yourselves airs you must be meek and humble my blessings  for all lady steyne knows this calumniated simple goodhumoured mrs crawley is quite innocenteven more innocent than herself  her husbands character is not good but it is as good as bareacres who has played a little and not paid a great deal who cheated you out of the only legacy you ever had and left you a pauper on my hands  and mrs crawley is not very wellborn but she is not worse than fannys illustrious ancestor the first de la jones  the money which i brought into the family sir lady george cried out  you purchased a contingent reversion with it the marquis said darkly  if gaunt dies your husband may come to his honours your little boys may inherit them and who knows what besides in the meanwhile ladies be as proud and virtuous as you like abroad but dont give me any airs  as for mrs crawleys character i shant demean myself or that most spotless and perfectly irreproachable lady by even hinting that it requires a defence  you will be pleased to receive her with the utmost cordiality as you will receive all persons whom i present in this house  this house he broke out with a laugh who is the master of it and what is it this temple of virtue belongs to me  and if i invite all newgate or all bedlam here by  they shall be welcome  after this vigorous allocution to one of which sort lord steyne treated his hareem whenever symptoms of insubordination appeared in his household the crestfallen women had nothing for it but to obey lady gaunt wrote the invitation which his lordship required and she and her motherinlaw drove in person and with bitter and humiliated hearts to leave the cards on mrs rawdon the reception of which caused that innocent woman so much pleasure  there were families in london who would have sacrificed a years income to receive such an honour at the hands of those great ladies mrs frederick bullock for instance would have gone on her knees from may fair to lombard street if lady steyne and lady gaunt had been waiting in the city to raise her up and say come to us next fridaynot to one of the great crushes and grand balls of gaunt house whither everybody went but to the sacred unapproachable mysterious delicious entertainments to be admitted to one of which was a privilege and an honour and a blessing indeed  severe spotless and beautiful lady gaunt held the very highest rank in vanity fair  the distinguished courtesy with which lord steyne treated her charmed everybody who witnessed his behaviour caused the severest critics to admit how perfect a gentleman he was and to own that his lordships heart at least was in the right place  the ladies of gaunt house called lady bareacres in to their aid in order to repulse the common enemy  one of lady gaunts carriages went to hill street for her ladyships mother all whose equipages were in the hands of the bailiffs whose very jewels and wardrobe it was said had been seized by those inexorable israelites bareacres castle was theirs too with all its costly pictures furniture and articles of vertuthe magnificent vandykes the noble reynolds pictures the lawrence portraits tawdry and beautiful and thirty years ago deemed as precious as works of real genius the matchless dancing nymph of canova for which lady bareacres had sat in her youthlady bareacres splendid then and radiant in wealth rank and beautya toothless bald old woman nowa mere rag of a former robe of state  her lord painted at the same time by lawrence as waving his sabre in front of bareacres castle and clothed in his uniform as colonel of the thistlewood yeomanry was a withered old lean man in a greatcoat and a brutus wig slinking about grays inn of mornings chiefly and dining alone at clubs  he did not like to dine with steyne now  they had run races of pleasure together in youth when bareacres was the winner but steyne had more bottom than he and had lasted him out  the marquis was ten times a greater man now than the young lord gaunt of 85 and bareacres nowhere in the raceold beaten bankrupt and broken down he had borrowed too much money of steyne to find it pleasant to meet his old comrade often  the latter whenever he wished to be merry used jeeringly to ask lady gaunt why her father had not come to see her he has not been here for four months lord steyne would say  i can always tell by my chequebook afterwards when i get a visit from bareacres  what a comfort it is my ladies i bank with one of my sons fathersinlaw and the other banks with me  of the other illustrious persons whom becky had the honour to encounter on this her first presentation to the grand world it does not become the present historian to say much  there was his excellency the prince of peterwaradin with his princessa nobleman tightly girthed with a large military chest on which the plaque of his order shone magnificently and wearing the red collar of the golden fleece round his neck  he was the owner of countless flocks look at his face  i think he must be descended from a sheep becky whispered to lord steyne  indeed his excellencys countenance long solemn and white with the ornament round his neck bore some resemblance to that of a venerable bellwether  there was mr john paul jefferson jones titularly attached to the american embassy and correspondent of the new york demagogue who by way of making himself agreeable to the company asked lady steyne during a pause in the conversation at dinner how his dear friend george gaunt liked the brazils he and george had been most intimate at naples and had gone up vesuvius together  mr jones wrote a full and particular account of the dinner which appeared duly in the demagogue  he mentioned the names and titles of all the guests giving biographical sketches of the principal people  he described the persons of the ladies with great eloquence the service of the table the size and costume of the servants enumerated the dishes and wines served the ornaments of the sideboard and the probable value of the plate  such a dinner he calculated could not be dished up under fifteen or eighteen dollars per head and he was in the habit until very lately of sending over proteges with letters of recommendation to the present marquis of steyne encouraged to do so by the intimate terms on which he had lived with his dear friend the late lord  he was most indignant that a young and insignificant aristocrat the earl of southdown should have taken the pas of him in their procession to the diningroom  just as i was stepping up to offer my hand to a very pleasing and witty fashionable the brilliant and exclusive mrs rawdon crawleyhe wrotethe young patrician interposed between me and the lady and whisked my helen off without a word of apology i was fain to bring up the rear with the colonel the ladys husband a stout redfaced warrior who distinguished himself at waterloo where he had better luck than befell some of his brother redcoats at new orleans  the colonels countenance on coming into this polite society wore as many blushes as the face of a boy of sixteen assumes when he is confronted with his sisters schoolfellows  it has been told before that honest rawdon had not been much used at any period of his life to ladies company  with the men at the club or the mess room he was well enough and could ride bet smoke or play at billiards with the boldest of them  he had had his time for female friendships too but that was twenty years ago and the ladies were of the rank of those with whom young marlow in the comedy is represented as having been familiar before he became abashed in the presence of miss hardcastle the times are such that one scarcely dares to allude to that kind of company which thousands of our young men in vanity fair are frequenting every day which nightly fills casinos and dancingrooms which is known to exist as well as the ring in hyde park or the congregation at st  jamessbut which the most squeamish if not the most moral of societies is determined to ignore  in a word although colonel crawley was now fiveandforty years of age it had not been his lot in life to meet with a half dozen good women besides his paragon of a wife  all except her and his kind sister lady jane whose gentle nature had tamed and won him scared the worthy colonel and on occasion of his first dinner at gaunt house he was not heard to make a single remark except to state that the weather was very hot  indeed becky would have left him at home but that virtue ordained that her husband should be by her side to protect the timid and fluttering little creature on her first appearance in polite society  on her first appearance lord steyne stepped forward taking her hand and greeting her with great courtesy and presenting her to lady steyne and their ladyships her daughters  their ladyships made three stately curtsies and the elder lady to be sure gave her hand to the newcomer but it was as cold and lifeless as marble  becky took it however with grateful humility and performing a reverence which would have done credit to the best dancermaster put herself at lady steynes feet as it were by saying that his lordship had been her fathers earliest friend and patron and that she becky had learned to honour and respect the steyne family from the days of her childhood  the fact is that lord steyne had once purchased a couple of pictures of the late sharp and the affectionate orphan could never forget her gratitude for that favour  the lady bareacres then came under beckys cognizanceto whom the colonels lady made also a most respectful obeisance  it was returned with severe dignity by the exalted person in question  i had the pleasure of making your ladyships acquaintance at brussels ten years ago becky said in the most winning manner  i had the good fortune to meet lady bareacres at the duchess of richmonds ball the night before the battle of waterloo  and i recollect your ladyship and my lady blanche your daughter sitting in the carriage in the portecochere at the inn waiting for horses i hope your ladyships diamonds are safe  everybodys eyes looked into their neighbours  the famous diamonds had undergone a famous seizure it appears about which becky of course knew nothing rawdon crawley retreated with lord southdown into a window where the latter was heard to laugh immoderately as rawdon told him the story of lady bareacres wanting horses and knuckling down by jove to mrs crawley  i think i neednt be afraid of that woman becky thought  indeed lady bareacres exchanged terrified and angry looks with her daughter and retreated to a table where she began to look at pictures with great energy  when the potentate from the danube made his appearance the conversation was carried on in the french language and the lady bareacres and the younger ladies found to their farther mortification that mrs crawley was much better acquainted with that tongue and spoke it with a much better accent than they becky had met other hungarian magnates with the army in france in 181617  she asked after her friends with great interest the foreign personages thought that she was a lady of great distinction and the prince and the princess asked severally of lord steyne and the marchioness whom they conducted to dinner who was that petite dame who spoke so well  finally the procession being formed in the order described by the american diplomatist they marched into the apartment where the banquet was served and which as i have promised the reader he shall enjoy it he shall have the liberty of ordering himself so as to suit his fancy  but it was when the ladies were alone that becky knew the tug of war would come  and then indeed the little woman found herself in such a situation as made her acknowledge the correctness of lord steynes caution to her to beware of the society of ladies above her own sphere as they say the persons who hate irishmen most are irishmen so assuredly the greatest tyrants over women are women when poor little becky alone with the ladies went up to the fireplace whither the great ladies had repaired the great ladies marched away and took possession of a table of drawings  when becky followed them to the table of drawings they dropped off one by one to the fire again  she tried to speak to one of the children of whom she was commonly fond in public places but master george gaunt was called away by his mamma and the stranger was treated with such cruelty finally that even lady steyne herself pitied her and went up to speak to the friendless little woman  lord steyne said her ladyship as her wan cheeks glowed with a blush says you sing and play very beautifully mrs crawleyi wish you would do me the kindness to sing to me  i will do anything that may give pleasure to my lord steyne or to you said rebecca sincerely grateful and seating herself at the piano began to sing  she sang religious songs of mozart which had been early favourites of lady steyne and with such sweetness and tenderness that the lady lingering round the piano sat down by its side and listened until the tears rolled down her eyes  it is true that the opposition ladies at the other end of the room kept up a loud and ceaseless buzzing and talking but the lady steyne did not hear those rumours  she was a child againand had wandered back through a forty years wilderness to her convent garden  the chapel organ had pealed the same tones the organist the sister whom she loved best of the community had taught them to her in those early happy days  she was a girl once more and the brief period of her happiness bloomed out again for an hourshe started when the jarring doors were flung open and with a loud laugh from lord steyne the men of the party entered full of gaiety  he saw at a glance what had happened in his absence and was grateful to his wife for once  he went and spoke to her and called her by her christian name so as again to bring blushes to her pale facemy wife says you have been singing like an angel he said to becky  now there are angels of two kinds and both sorts it is said are charming in their way  whatever the previous portion of the evening had been the rest of that night was a great triumph for becky  she sang her very best and it was so good that every one of the men came and crowded round the piano the women her enemies were left quite alone and mr paul jefferson jones thought he had made a conquest of lady gaunt by going up to her ladyship and praising her delightful friends firstrate singing    chapter l  contains a vulgar incident  the muse whoever she be who presides over this comic history must now descend from the genteel heights in which she has been soaring and have the goodness to drop down upon the lowly roof of john sedley at brompton and describe what events are taking place there here too in this humble tenement live care and distrust and dismay  mrs clapp in the kitchen is grumbling in secret to her husband about the rent and urging the good fellow to rebel against his old friend and patron and his present lodger  mrs sedley has ceased to visit her landlady in the lower regions now and indeed is in a position to patronize mrs clapp no longer  how can one be condescending to a lady to whom one owes a matter of forty pounds and who is perpetually throwing out hints for the money the irish maidservant has not altered in the least in her kind and respectful behaviour but mrs sedley fancies that she is growing insolent and ungrateful and as the guilty thief who fears each bush an officer sees threatening innuendoes and hints of capture in all the girls speeches and answers  miss clapp grown quite a young woman now is declared by the soured old lady to be an unbearable and impudent little minx  why amelia can be so fond of her or have her in her room so much or walk out with her so constantly mrs sedley cannot conceive the bitterness of poverty has poisoned the life of the once cheerful and kindly woman  she is thankless for amelias constant and gentle bearing towards her carps at her for her efforts at kindness or service rails at her for her silly pride in her child and her neglect of her parents  georgys house is not a very lively one since uncle joss annuity has been withdrawn and the little family are almost upon famine diet  amelia thinks and thinks and racks her brain to find some means of increasing the small pittance upon which the household is starving can she give lessons in anything paint cardracks do fine work she finds that women are working hard and better than she can for twopence a day  she buys a couple of begilt bristol boards at the fancy stationers and paints her very best upon thema shepherd with a red waistcoat on one and a pink face smiling in the midst of a pencil landscapea shepherdess on the other crossing a little bridge with a little dog nicely shaded  the man of the fancy repository and brompton emporium of fine arts of whom she bought the screens vainly hoping that he would repurchase them when ornamented by her hand can hardly hide the sneer with which he examines these feeble works of art he looks askance at the lady who waits in the shop and ties up the cards again in their envelope of whiteybrown paper and hands them to the poor widow and miss clapp who had never seen such beautiful things in her life and had been quite confident that the man must give at least two guineas for the screens  they try at other shops in the interior of london with faint sickening hopes  dont want em says one  be off says another fiercely  threeandsixpence has been spent in vainthe screens retire to miss clapps bedroom who persists in thinking them lovely  she writes out a little card in her neatest hand and after long thought and labour of composition in which the public is informed that a lady who has some time at her disposal wishes to undertake the education of some little girls whom she would instruct in english in french in geography in history and in musicaddress a  o at mr browns and she confides the card to the gentleman of the fine art repository who consents to allow it to lie upon the counter where it grows dingy and flyblown  amelia passes the door wistfully many a time in hopes that mr brown will have some news to give her but he never beckons her in  when she goes to make little purchases there is no news for her  poor simple lady tender and weakhow are you to battle with the struggling violent world  she grows daily more careworn and sad fixing upon her child alarmed eyes whereof the little boy cannot interpret the expression  she starts up of a night and peeps into his room stealthily to see that he is sleeping and not stolen away  she sleeps but little now  a constant thought and terror is haunting her  how she weeps and prays in the long silent nightshow she tries to hide from herself the thought which will return to her that she ought to part with the boy that she is the only barrier between him and prosperity  she cant she cant not now at least  some other day  oh it is too hard to think of and to bear  a thought comes over her which makes her blush and turn from herselfher parents might keep the annuitythe curate would marry her and give a home to her and the boy  but georges picture and dearest memory are there to rebuke her  shame and love say no to the sacrifice  she shrinks from it as from something unholy and such thoughts never found a restingplace in that pure and gentle bosom  the combat which we describe in a sentence or two lasted for many weeks in poor amelias heart during which she had no confidante indeed she could never have one as she would not allow to herself the possibility of yielding though she was giving way daily before the enemy with whom she had to battle  one truth after another was marshalling itself silently against her and keeping its ground poverty and misery for all want and degradation for her parents injustice to the boyone by one the outworks of the little citadel were taken in which the poor soul passionately guarded her only love and treasure  at the beginning of the struggle she had written off a letter of tender supplication to her brother at calcutta imploring him not to withdraw the support which he had granted to their parents and painting in terms of artless pathos their lonely and hapless condition  she did not know the truth of the matter  the payment of joss annuity was still regular but it was a moneylender in the city who was receiving it  old sedley had sold it for a sum of money wherewith to prosecute his bootless schemes  emmy was calculating eagerly the time that would elapse before the letter would arrive and be answered  she had written down the date in her pocketbook of the day when she dispatched it  to her sons guardian the good major at madras she had not communicated any of her griefs and perplexities  she had not written to him since she wrote to congratulate him on his approaching marriage  she thought with sickening despondency that that friendthe only one the one who had felt such a regard for herwas fallen away  one day when things had come to a very bad passwhen the creditors were pressing the mother in hysteric grief the father in more than usual gloom the inmates of the family avoiding each other each secretly oppressed with his private unhappiness and notion of wrongthe father and daughter happened to be left alone together and amelia thought to comfort her father by telling him what she had done she had written to josephan answer must come in three or four months he was always generous though careless  he could not refuse when he knew how straitened were the circumstances of his parents  then the poor old gentleman revealed the whole truth to herthat his son was still paying the annuity which his own imprudence had flung away  he had not dared to tell it sooner  he thought amelias ghastly and terrified look when with a trembling miserable voice he made the confession conveyed reproaches to him for his concealment  ah said he with quivering lips and turning away you despise your old father now  oh papa it is not that amelia cried out falling on his neck and kissing him many times  you are always good and kind  you did it for the best  it is not for the moneyit ismy god my god have mercy upon me and give me strength to bear this trial and she kissed him again wildly and went away  still the father did not know what that explanation meant and the burst of anguish with which the poor girl left him  it was that she was conquered  the sentence was passed  the child must go from herto othersto forget her  her heart and her treasureher joy hope love worshipher god almost  she must give him up and thenand then she would go to george and they would watch over the child and wait for him until he came to them in heaven  she put on her bonnet scarcely knowing what she did and went out to walk in the lanes by which george used to come back from school and where she was in the habit of going on his return to meet the boy  it was may a halfholiday  the leaves were all coming out the weather was brilliant the boy came running to her flushed with health singing his bundle of schoolbooks hanging by a thong there he was both her arms were round him  no it was impossible they could not be going to part  what is the matter mother said he you look very pale  nothing my child she said and stooped down and kissed him  that night amelia made the boy read the story of samuel to her and how hannah his mother having weaned him brought him to eli the high priest to minister before the lord  and he read the song of gratitude which hannah sang and which says who it is who maketh poor and maketh rich and bringeth low and exaltethhow the poor shall be raised up out of the dust and how in his own might no man shall be strong then he read how samuels mother made him a little coat and brought it to him from year to year when she came up to offer the yearly sacrifice  and then in her sweet simple way georges mother made commentaries to the boy upon this affecting story  how hannah though she loved her son so much yet gave him up because of her vow  and how she must always have thought of him as she sat at home far away making the little coat and samuel she was sure never forgot his mother and how happy she must have been as the time came and the years pass away very quick when she should see her boy and how good and wise he had grown  this little sermon she spoke with a gentle solemn voice and dry eyes until she came to the account of their meetingthen the discourse broke off suddenly the tender heart overflowed and taking the boy to her breast she rocked him in her arms and wept silently over him in a sainted agony of tears  her mind being made up the widow began to take such measures as seemed right to her for advancing the end which she proposed  one day miss osborne in russell square amelia had not written the name or number of the house for ten yearsher youth her early story came back to her as she wrote the superscription one day miss osborne got a letter from amelia which made her blush very much and look towards her father sitting glooming in his place at the other end of the table  in simple terms amelia told her the reasons which had induced her to change her mind respecting her boy her father had met with fresh misfortunes which had entirely ruined him  her own pittance was so small that it would barely enable her to support her parents and would not suffice to give george the advantages which were his due great as her sufferings would be at parting with him she would by gods help endure them for the boys sake  she knew that those to whom he was going would do all in their power to make him happy she described his disposition such as she fancied itquick and impatient of control or harshness easily to be moved by love and kindness  in a postscript she stipulated that she should have a written agreement that she should see the child as often as she wishedshe could not part with him under any other terms  what mrs pride has come down has she old osborne said when with a tremulous eager voice miss osborne read him the letter reglar starved out hey ha ha  i knew she would he tried to keep his dignity and to read his paper as usualbut he could not follow it  he chuckled and swore to himself behind the sheet  at last he flung it down and scowling at his daughter as his wont was went out of the room into his study adjoining from whence he presently returned with a key  he flung it to miss osborne  get the room over minehis room that wasready he said  yes sir his daughter replied in a tremble it was georges room  it had not been opened for more than ten years  some of his clothes papers handkerchiefs whips and caps fishingrods and sporting gear were still there  an army list of 1814 with his name written on the cover a little dictionary he was wont to use in writing and the bible his mother had given him were on the mantelpiece with a pair of spurs and a dried inkstand covered with the dust of ten years  ah since that ink was wet what days and people had passed away  the writingbook still on the table was blotted with his hand  miss osborne was much affected when she first entered this room with the servants under her  she sank quite pale on the little bed this is blessed news mamindeed mam the housekeeper said and the good old times is returning mam  the dear little feller to be sure mam how happy he will be  but some folks in may fair mam will owe him a grudge mam and she clicked back the bolt which held the windowsash and let the air into the chamber  you had better send that woman some money mr osborne said before he went out  she shant want for nothing  send her a hundred pound  and ill go and see her tomorrow miss osborne asked  thats your look out  she dont come in here mind no by  not for all the money in london  but she mustnt want now  so look out and get things right with which brief speeches mr osborne took leave of his daughter and went on his accustomed way into the city  here papa is some money amelia said that night kissing the old man her father and putting a bill for a hundred pounds into his hands  andand mamma dont be harsh with georgy  hehe is not going to stop with us long she could say nothing more and walked away silently to her room  let us close it upon her prayers and her sorrow  i think we had best speak little about so much love and grief  miss osborne came the next day according to the promise contained in her note and saw amelia  the meeting between them was friendly a look and a few words from miss osborne showed the poor widow that with regard to this woman at least there need be no fear lest she should take the first place in her sons affection she was cold sensible not unkind  the mother had not been so well pleased perhaps had the rival been better looking younger more affectionate warmerhearted miss osborne on the other hand thought of old times and memories and could not but be touched with the poor mothers pitiful situation  she was conquered and laying down her arms as it were she humbly submitted  that day they arranged together the preliminaries of the treaty of capitulation  george was kept from school the next day and saw his aunt  amelia left them alone together and went to her room  she was trying the separationas that poor gentle lady jane grey felt the edge of the axe that was to come down and sever her slender life  days were passed in parleys visits preparations  the widow broke the matter to georgy with great caution she looked to see him very much affected by the intelligence  he was rather elated than otherwise and the poor woman turned sadly away  he bragged about the news that day to the boys at school told them how he was going to live with his grandpapa his fathers father not the one who comes here sometimes and that he would be very rich and have a carriage and a pony and go to a much finer school and when he was rich he would buy leaders pencilcase and pay the tartwoman  the boy was the image of his father as his fond mother thought  indeed i have no heart on account of our dear amelias sake to go through the story of georges last days at home  at last the day came the carriage drove up the little humble packets containing tokens of love and remembrance were ready and disposed in the hall long sincegeorge was in his new suit for which the tailor had come previously to measure him  he had sprung up with the sun and put on the new clothes his mother hearing him from the room close by in which she had been lying in speechless grief and watching  days before she had been making preparations for the end purchasing little stores for the boys use marking his books and linen talking with him and preparing him for the changefondly fancying that he needed preparation  so that he had change what cared he he was longing for it  by a thousand eager declarations as to what he would do when he went to live with his grandfather he had shown the poor widow how little the idea of parting had cast him down  he would come and see his mamma often on the pony he said  he would come and fetch her in the carriage they would drive in the park and she should have everything she wanted the poor mother was fain to content herself with these selfish demonstrations of attachment and tried to convince herself how sincerely her son loved her  he must love her all children were so a little anxious for novelty andno not selfish but selfwilled her child must have his enjoyments and ambition in the world  she herself by her own selfishness and imprudent love for him had denied him his just rights and pleasures hitherto  i know few things more affecting than that timorous debasement and selfhumiliation of a woman  how she owns that it is she and not the man who is guilty how she takes all the faults on her side how she courts in a manner punishment for the wrongs which she has not committed and persists in shielding the real culprit  it is those who injure women who get the most kindness from themthey are born timid and tyrants and maltreat those who are humblest before them  so poor amelia had been getting ready in silent misery for her sons departure and had passed many and many a long solitary hour in making preparations for the end george stood by his mother watching her arrangements without the least concern  tears had fallen into his boxes passages had been scored in his favourite books old toys relics treasures had been hoarded away for him and packed with strange neatness and careand of all these things the boy took no note  the child goes away smiling as the mother breaks her heart  by heavens it is pitiful the bootless love of women for children in vanity fair  a few days are past and the great event of amelias life is consummated  no angel has intervened  the child is sacrificed and offered up to fate and the widow is quite alone  the boy comes to see her often to be sure  he rides on a pony with a coachman behind him to the delight of his old grandfather sedley who walks proudly down the lane by his side  she sees him but he is not her boy any more  why he rides to see the boys at the little school too and to show off before them his new wealth and splendour  in two days he has adopted a slightly imperious air and patronizing manner he was born to command his mother thinks as his father was before him  it is fine weather now  of evenings on the days when he does not come she takes a long walk into londonyes as far as russell square and rests on the stone by the railing of the garden opposite mr osbornes house it is so pleasant and cool  she can look up and see the drawingroom windows illuminated and at about nine oclock the chamber in the upper story where georgy sleeps  she knowshe has told her  she prays there as the light goes out prays with an humble heart and walks home shrinking and silent she is very tired when she comes home  perhaps she will sleep the better for that long weary walk and she may dream about georgy  one sunday she happened to be walking in russell square at some distance from mr osbornes house she could see it from a distance though when all the bells of sabbath were ringing and george and his aunt came out to go to church a little sweep asked for charity and the footman who carried the books tried to drive him away but georgy stopped and gave him money  may gods blessing be on the boy  emmy ran round the square and coming up to the sweep gave him her mite too all the bells of sabbath were ringing and she followed them until she came to the foundling church into which she went  there she sat in a place whence she could see the head of the boy under his fathers tombstone many hundred fresh childrens voices rose up there and sang hymns to the father beneficent and little georges soul thrilled with delight at the burst of glorious psalmody  his mother could not see him for awhile through the mist that dimmed her eyes    chapter li  in which a charade is acted which may or may not puzzle the reader  after beckys appearance at my lord steynes private and select parties the claims of that estimable woman as regards fashion were settled and some of the very greatest and tallest doors in the metropolis were speedily opened to herdoors so great and tall that the beloved reader and writer hereof may hope in vain to enter at them dear brethren let us tremble before those august portals  i fancy them guarded by grooms of the chamber with flaming silver forks with which they prong all those who have not the right of the entree they say the honest newspaperfellow who sits in the hall and takes down the names of the great ones who are admitted to the feasts dies after a little time  he cant survive the glare of fashion long  it scorches him up as the presence of jupiter in full dress wasted that poor imprudent semelea giddy moth of a creature who ruined herself by venturing out of her natural atmosphere her myth ought to be taken to heart amongst the tyburnians the belgraviansher story and perhaps beckys too ah ladiesask the reverend mr thurifer if belgravia is not a sounding brass and tyburnia a tinkling cymbal  these are vanities even these will pass away  and some day or other but it will be after our time thank goodness hyde park gardens will be no better known than the celebrated horticultural outskirts of babylon and belgrave square will be as desolate as baker street or tadmor in the wilderness  ladies are you aware that the great pitt lived in baker street what would not your grandmothers have given to be asked to lady hesters parties in that now decayed mansion i have dined in itmoi qui vous parle i peopled the chamber with ghosts of the mighty dead as we sat soberly drinking claret there with men of today the spirits of the departed came in and took their places round the darksome board  the pilot who weathered the storm tossed off great bumpers of spiritual port the shade of dundas did not leave the ghost of a heeltap addington sat bowing and smirking in a ghastly manner and would not be behindhand when the noiseless bottle went round scott from under bushy eyebrows winked at the apparition of a beeswing wilberforces eyes went up to the ceiling so that he did not seem to know how his glass went up full to his mouth and came down empty up to the ceiling which was above us only yesterday and which the great of the past days have all looked at they let the house as a furnished lodging now yes lady hester once lived in baker street and lies asleep in the wilderness eothen saw her therenot in baker street but in the other solitude  it is all vanity to be sure but who will not own to liking a little of it i should like to know what wellconstituted mind merely because it is transitory dislikes roast beef that is a vanity but may every man who reads this have a wholesome portion of it through life i beg aye though my readers were five hundred thousand sit down gentlemen and fall to with a good hearty appetite the fat the lean the gravy the horseradish as you like itdont spare it  another glass of wine jones my boya little bit of the sunday side  yes let us eat our fill of the vain thing and be thankful therefor and let us make the best of beckys aristocratic pleasures likewisefor these too like all other mortal delights were but transitory  the upshot of her visit to lord steyne was that his highness the prince of peterwaradin took occasion to renew his acquaintance with colonel crawley when they met on the next day at the club and to compliment mrs crawley in the ring of hyde park with a profound salute of the hat  she and her husband were invited immediately to one of the princes small parties at levant house then occupied by his highness during the temporary absence from england of its noble proprietor  she sang after dinner to a very little comite the marquis of steyne was present paternally superintending the progress of his pupil  at levant house becky met one of the finest gentlemen and greatest ministers that europe has producedthe duc de la jabotiere then ambassador from the most christian king and subsequently minister to that monarch  i declare i swell with pride as these august names are transcribed by my pen and i think in what brilliant company my dear becky is moving  she became a constant guest at the french embassy where no party was considered to be complete without the presence of the charming madame ravdonn cravley  messieurs de truffigny of the perigord family and champignac both attaches of the embassy were straightway smitten by the charms of the fair colonels wife and both declared according to the wont of their nation for who ever yet met a frenchman come out of england that has not left half a dozen families miserable and brought away as many hearts in his pocketbook both i say declared that they were au mieux with the charming madame ravdonn  but i doubt the correctness of the assertion  champignac was very fond of ecarte and made many parties with the colonel of evenings while becky was singing to lord steyne in the other room and as for truffigny it is a wellknown fact that he dared not go to the travellers where he owed money to the waiters and if he had not had the embassy as a diningplace the worthy young gentleman must have starved  i doubt i say that becky would have selected either of these young men as a person on whom she would bestow her special regard  they ran of her messages purchased her gloves and flowers went in debt for operaboxes for her and made themselves amiable in a thousand ways  and they talked english with adorable simplicity and to the constant amusement of becky and my lord steyne she would mimic one or other to his face and compliment him on his advance in the english language with a gravity which never failed to tickle the marquis her sardonic old patron truffigny gave briggs a shawl by way of winning over beckys confidante and asked her to take charge of a letter which the simple spinster handed over in public to the person to whom it was addressed and the composition of which amused everybody who read it greatly lord steyne read it everybody but honest rawdon to whom it was not necessary to tell everything that passed in the little house in may fair  here before long becky received not only the best foreigners as the phrase is in our noble and admirable society slang but some of the best english people too i dont mean the most virtuous or indeed the least virtuous or the cleverest or the stupidest or the richest or the best born but the bestin a word people about whom there is no questionsuch as the great lady fitzwillis that patron saint of almacks the great lady slowbore the great lady grizzel macbeth she was lady g  glowry daughter of lord grey of glowry and the like  when the countess of fitzwillis her ladyship is of the kingstreet family see debrett and burke takes up a person he or she is safe  there is no question about them any more  not that my lady fitzwillis is any better than anybody else being on the contrary a faded person fiftyseven years of age and neither handsome nor wealthy nor entertaining but it is agreed on all sides that she is of the best people those who go to her are of the best  and from an old grudge probably to lady steyne for whose coronet her ladyship then the youthful georgina frederica daughter of the prince of waless favourite the earl of portansherry had once tried this great and famous leader of the fashion chose to acknowledge mrs rawdon crawley made her a most marked curtsey at the assembly over which she presided and not only encouraged her son st  kitts his lordship got his place through lord steynes interest to frequent mrs crawleys house but asked her to her own mansion and spoke to her twice in the most public and condescending manner during dinner  the important fact was known all over london that night  people who had been crying fie about mrs crawley were silent  wenham the wit and lawyer lord steynes righthand man went about everywhere praising her  some who had hesitated came forward at once and welcomed her little tom toady who had warned southdown about visiting such an abandoned woman now besought to be introduced to her  in a word she was admitted to be among the best people  ah my beloved readers and brethren do not envy poor becky prematurelyglory like this is said to be fugitive it is currently reported that even in the very inmost circles they are no happier than the poor wanderers outside the zone and becky who penetrated into the very centre of fashion and saw the great george iv face to face has owned since that there too was vanity  we must be brief in descanting upon this part of her career  as i cannot describe the mysteries of freemasonry although i have a shrewd idea that it is a humbug so an uninitiated man cannot take upon himself to portray the great world accurately and had best keep his opinions to himself whatever they are  becky has often spoken in subsequent years of this season of her life when she moved among the very greatest circles of the london fashion her success excited elated and then bored her  at first no occupation was more pleasant than to invent and procure the latter a work of no small trouble and ingenuity by the way in a person of mrs rawdon crawleys very narrow meansto procure we say the prettiest new dresses and ornaments to drive to fine dinner parties where she was welcomed by great people and from the fine dinner parties to fine assemblies whither the same people came with whom she had been dining whom she had met the night before and would see on the morrowthe young men faultlessly appointed handsomely cravatted with the neatest glossy boots and white glovesthe elders portly brassbuttoned noblelooking polite and prosythe young ladies blonde timid and in pinkthe mothers grand beautiful sumptuous solemn and in diamonds  they talked in english not in bad french as they do in the novels  they talked about each others houses and characters and familiesjust as the joneses do about the smiths  beckys former acquaintances hated and envied her the poor woman herself was yawning in spirit i wish i were out of it she said to herself  i would rather be a parsons wife and teach a sunday school than this or a sergeants lady and ride in the regimental waggon or oh how much gayer it would be to wear spangles and trousers and dance before a booth at a fair  you would do it very well said lord steyne laughing she used to tell the great man her ennuis and perplexities in her artless waythey amused him  rawdon would make a very good ecuyermaster of the ceremonieswhat do you call himthe man in the large boots and the uniform who goes round the ring cracking the whip he is large heavy and of a military figure  i recollect becky continued pensively my father took me to see a show at brookgreen fair when i was a child and when we came home i made myself a pair of stilts and danced in the studio to the wonder of all the pupils  i should have liked to see it said lord steyne  i should like to do it now becky continued  how lady blinkey would open her eyes and lady grizzel macbeth would stare  hush silence there is pasta beginning to sing becky always made a point of being conspicuously polite to the professional ladies and gentlemen who attended at these aristocratic partiesof following them into the corners where they sat in silence and shaking hands with them and smiling in the view of all persons  she was an artist herself as she said very truly there was a frankness and humility in the manner in which she acknowledged her origin which provoked or disarmed or amused lookerson as the case might be how cool that woman is said one what airs of independence she assumes where she ought to sit still and be thankful if anybody speaks to her what an honest and goodnatured soul she is said another what an artful little minx said a third  they were all right very likely but becky went her own way and so fascinated the professional personages that they would leave off their sore throats in order to sing at her parties and give her lessons for nothing  yes she gave parties in the little house in curzon street  many scores of carriages with blazing lamps blocked up the street to the disgust of no 100 who could not rest for the thunder of the knocking and of 102 who could not sleep for envy  the gigantic footmen who accompanied the vehicles were too big to be contained in beckys little hall and were billeted off in the neighbouring publichouses whence when they were wanted callboys summoned them from their beer scores of the great dandies of london squeezed and trod on each other on the little stairs laughing to find themselves there and many spotless and severe ladies of ton were seated in the little drawingroom listening to the professional singers who were singing according to their wont and as if they wished to blow the windows down  and the day after there appeared among the fashionable reunions in the morning post a paragraph to the following effect  yesterday colonel and mrs crawley entertained a select party at dinner at their house in may fair  their excellencies the prince and princess of peterwaradin h e papoosh pasha the turkish ambassador attended by kibob bey dragoman of the mission the marquess of steyne earl of southdown sir pitt and lady jane crawley mr wagg c  after dinner mrs crawley had an assembly which was attended by the duchess dowager of stilton duc de la gruyere marchioness of cheshire marchese alessandro strachino comte de brie baron schapzuger chevalier tosti countess of slingstone and lady f macadam majorgeneral and lady g macbeth and 2 miss macbeths viscount paddington sir horace fogey hon  sands bedwin bobachy bahawder and an c which the reader may fill at his pleasure through a dozen close lines of small type  and in her commerce with the great our dear friend showed the same frankness which distinguished her transactions with the lowly in station  on one occasion when out at a very fine house rebecca was perhaps rather ostentatiously holding a conversation in the french language with a celebrated tenor singer of that nation while the lady grizzel macbeth looked over her shoulder scowling at the pair  how very well you speak french lady grizzel said who herself spoke the tongue in an edinburgh accent most remarkable to hear  i ought to know it becky modestly said casting down her eyes i taught it in a school and my mother was a frenchwoman  lady grizzel was won by her humility and was mollified towards the little woman  she deplored the fatal levelling tendencies of the age which admitted persons of all classes into the society of their superiors but her ladyship owned that this one at least was well behaved and never forgot her place in life  she was a very good woman good to the poor stupid blameless unsuspicious it is not her ladyships fault that she fancies herself better than you and me  the skirts of her ancestors garments have been kissed for centuries it is a thousand years they say since the tartans of the head of the family were embraced by the defunct duncans lords and councillors when the great ancestor of the house became king of scotland  lady steyne after the music scene succumbed before becky and perhaps was not disinclined to her  the younger ladies of the house of gaunt were also compelled into submission  once or twice they set people at her but they failed  the brilliant lady stunnington tried a passage of arms with her but was routed with great slaughter by the intrepid little becky  when attacked sometimes becky had a knack of adopting a demure ingenue air under which she was most dangerous  she said the wickedest things with the most simple unaffected air when in this mood and would take care artlessly to apologize for her blunders so that all the world should know that she had made them  mr wagg the celebrated wit and a led captain and trencherman of my lord steyne was caused by the ladies to charge her and the worthy fellow leering at his patronesses and giving them a wink as much as to say now look out for sport one evening began an assault upon becky who was unsuspiciously eating her dinner the little woman attacked on a sudden but never without arms lighted up in an instant parried and riposted with a homethrust which made waggs face tingle with shame then she returned to her soup with the most perfect calm and a quiet smile on her face  waggs great patron who gave him dinners and lent him a little money sometimes and whose election newspaper and other jobs wagg did gave the luckless fellow such a savage glance with the eyes as almost made him sink under the table and burst into tears  he looked piteously at my lord who never spoke to him during dinner and at the ladies who disowned him  at last becky herself took compassion upon him and tried to engage him in talk he was not asked to dinner again for six weeks and fiche my lords confidential man to whom wagg naturally paid a good deal of court was instructed to tell him that if he ever dared to say a rude thing to mrs crawley again or make her the butt of his stupid jokes milor would put every one of his notes of hand into his lawyers hands and sell him up without mercy  wagg wept before fiche and implored his dear friend to intercede for him  he wrote a poem in favour of mrs r c which appeared in the very next number of the harumscarum magazine which he conducted  he implored her goodwill at parties where he met her  he cringed and coaxed rawdon at the club  he was allowed to come back to gaunt house after a while becky was always good to him always amused never angry  his lordships vizier and chief confidential servant with a seat in parliament and at the dinner table mr wenham was much more prudent in his behaviour and opinions than mr wagg  however much he might be disposed to hate all parvenus mr wenham himself was a staunch old true blue tory and his father a small coalmerchant in the north of england this aidedecamp of the marquis never showed any sort of hostility to the new favourite but pursued her with stealthy kindnesses and a sly and deferential politeness which somehow made becky more uneasy than other peoples overt hostilities  how the crawleys got the money which was spent upon the entertainments with which they treated the polite world was a mystery which gave rise to some conversation at the time and probably added zest to these little festivities  some persons averred that sir pitt crawley gave his brother a handsome allowance if he did beckys power over the baronet must have been extraordinary indeed and his character greatly changed in his advanced age  other parties hinted that it was beckys habit to levy contributions on all her husbands friends going to this one in tears with an account that there was an execution in the house falling on her knees to that one and declaring that the whole family must go to gaol or commit suicide unless such and such a bill could be paid  lord southdown it was said had been induced to give many hundreds through these pathetic representations young feltham of the th dragoons and son of the firm of tiler and feltham hatters and army accoutrement makers and whom the crawleys introduced into fashionable life was also cited as one of beckys victims in the pecuniary way  people declared that she got money from various simply disposed persons under pretence of getting them confidential appointments under government who knows what stories were or were not told of our dear and innocent friend certain it is that if she had had all the money which she was said to have begged or borrowed or stolen she might have capitalized and been honest for life whereasbut this is advancing matters  the truth is that by economy and good managementby a sparing use of ready money and by paying scarcely anybodypeople can manage for a time at least to make a great show with very little means and it is our belief that beckys muchtalkedof parties which were not after all was said very numerous cost this lady very little more than the wax candles which lighted the walls stillbrook and queens crawley supplied her with game and fruit in abundance  lord steynes cellars were at her disposal and that excellent noblemans famous cooks presided over her little kitchen or sent by my lords order the rarest delicacies from their own  i protest it is quite shameful in the world to abuse a simple creature as people of her time abuse becky and i warn the public against believing onetenth of the stories against her if every person is to be banished from society who runs into debt and cannot payif we are to be peering into everybodys private life speculating upon their income and cutting them if we dont approve of their expenditurewhy what a howling wilderness and intolerable dwelling vanity fair would be every mans hand would be against his neighbour in this case my dear sir and the benefits of civilization would be done away with we should be quarrelling abusing avoiding one another  our houses would become caverns and we should go in rags because we cared for nobody  rents would go down parties wouldnt be given any more all the tradesmen of the town would be bankrupt  wine waxlights comestibles rouge crinolinepetticoats diamonds wigs louisquatorze gimcracks and old china park hacks and splendid highstepping carriage horsesall the delights of life i saywould go to the deuce if people did but act upon their silly principles and avoid those whom they dislike and abuse  whereas by a little charity and mutual forbearance things are made to go on pleasantly enough  we may abuse a man as much as we like and call him the greatest rascal unhangedbut do we wish to hang him therefore no we shake hands when we meet  if his cook is good we forgive him and go and dine with him and we expect he will do the same by us  thus trade flourishescivilization advances peace is kept new dresses are wanted for new assemblies every week and the last years vintage of lafitte will remunerate the honest proprietor who reared it  at the time whereof we are writing though the great george was on the throne and ladies wore gigots and large combs like tortoiseshell shovels in their hair instead of the simple sleeves and lovely wreaths which are actually in fashion the manners of the very polite world were not i take it essentially different from those of the present day  and their amusements pretty similar  to us from the outside gazing over the policemans shoulders at the bewildering beauties as they pass into court or ball they may seem beings of unearthly splendour and in the enjoyment of an exquisite happiness by us unattainable it is to console some of these dissatisfied beings that we are narrating our dear beckys struggles and triumphs and disappointments of all of which indeed as is the case with all persons of merit she had her share  at this time the amiable amusement of acting charades had come among us from france and was considerably in vogue in this country enabling the many ladies amongst us who had beauty to display their charms and the fewer number who had cleverness to exhibit their wit my lord steyne was incited by becky who perhaps believed herself endowed with both the above qualifications to give an entertainment at gaunt house which should include some of these little dramasand we must take leave to introduce the reader to this brilliant reunion and with a melancholy welcome too for it will be among the very last of the fashionable entertainments to which it will be our fortune to conduct him  a portion of that splendid room the picture gallery of gaunt house was arranged as the charade theatre  it had been so used when george iii was king and a picture of the marquis of gaunt is still extant with his hair in powder and a pink ribbon in a roman shape as it was called enacting the part of cato in mr addisons tragedy of that name performed before their royal highnesses the prince of wales the bishop of osnaburgh and prince william henry then children like the actor one or two of the old properties were drawn out of the garrets where they had lain ever since and furbished up anew for the present festivities  young bedwin sands then an elegant dandy and eastern traveller was manager of the revels  an eastern traveller was somebody in those days and the adventurous bedwin who had published his quarto and passed some months under the tents in the desert was a personage of no small importance  in his volume there were several pictures of sands in various oriental costumes and he travelled about with a black attendant of most unprepossessing appearance just like another brian de bois guilbert  bedwin his costumes and black man were hailed at gaunt house as very valuable acquisitions  he led off the first charade  a turkish officer with an immense plume of feathers the janizaries were supposed to be still in existence and the tarboosh had not as yet displaced the ancient and majestic headdress of the true believers was seen couched on a divan and making believe to puff at a narghile in which however for the sake of the ladies only a fragrant pastille was allowed to smoke  the turkish dignitary yawns and expresses signs of weariness and idleness he claps his hands and mesrour the nubian appears with bare arms bangles yataghans and every eastern ornamentgaunt tall and hideous  he makes a salaam before my lord the aga  a thrill of terror and delight runs through the assembly the ladies whisper to one another  the black slave was given to bedwin sands by an egyptian pasha in exchange for three dozen of maraschino  he has sewn up ever so many odalisques in sacks and tilted them into the nile  bid the slavemerchant enter says the turkish voluptuary with a wave of his hand  mesrour conducts the slavemerchant into my lords presence he brings a veiled female with him  he removes the veil  a thrill of applause bursts through the house  it is mrs winkworth she was a miss absolom with the beautiful eyes and hair she is in a gorgeous oriental costume the black braided locks are twined with innumerable jewels her dress is covered over with gold piastres  the odious mahometan expresses himself charmed by her beauty  she falls down on her knees and entreats him to restore her to the mountains where she was born and where her circassian lover is still deploring the absence of his zuleikah no entreaties will move the obdurate hassan  he laughs at the notion of the circassian bridegroom zuleikah covers her face with her hands and drops down in an attitude of the most beautiful despair  there seems to be no hope for her whenwhen the kislar aga appears  the kislar aga brings a letter from the sultan  hassan receives and places on his head the dread firman  a ghastly terror seizes him while on the negros face it is mesrour again in another costume appears a ghastly joy  mercy  mercy cries the pasha  while the kislar aga grinning horribly pulls outa bowstring  the curtain draws just as he is going to use that awful weapon hassan from within bawls out first two syllablesand mrs rawdon crawley who is going to act in the charade comes forward and compliments mrs winkworth on the admirable taste and beauty of her costume  the second part of the charade takes place  it is still an eastern scene  hassan in another dress is in an attitude by zuleikah who is perfectly reconciled to him the kislar aga has become a peaceful black slave  it is sunrise on the desert and the turks turn their heads eastwards and bow to the sand  as there are no dromedaries at hand the band facetiously plays the camels are coming an enormous egyptian head figures in the scene  it is a musical oneand to the surprise of the oriental travellers sings a comic song composed by mr wagg  the eastern voyagers go off dancing like papageno and the moorish king in the magic flute  last two syllables roars the head  the last act opens  it is a grecian tent this time  a tall and stalwart man reposes on a couch there  above him hang his helmet and shield  there is no need for them now  ilium is down iphigenia is slain  cassandra is a prisoner in his outer halls the king of men it is colonel crawley who indeed has no notion about the sack of ilium or the conquest of cassandra the anax andron is asleep in his chamber at argos  a lamp casts the broad shadow of the sleeping warrior flickering on the wallthe sword and shield of troy glitter in its light the band plays the awful music of don juan before the statue enters  aegisthus steals in pale and on tiptoe  what is that ghastly face looking out balefully after him from behind the arras he raises his dagger to strike the sleeper who turns in his bed and opens his broad chest as if for the blow  he cannot strike the noble slumbering chieftain clytemnestra glides swiftly into the room like an apparitionher arms are bare and whiteher tawny hair floats down her shouldersher face is deadly paleand her eyes are lighted up with a smile so ghastly that people quake as they look at her  a tremor ran through the room  good god somebody said its mrs rawdon crawley  scornfully she snatches the dagger out of aegisthuss hand and advances to the bed  you see it shining over her head in the glimmer of the lamp andand the lamp goes out with a groan and all is dark  the darkness and the scene frightened people  rebecca performed her part so well and with such ghastly truth that the spectators were all dumb until with a burst all the lamps of the hall blazed out again when everybody began to shout applause  brava  brava old steynes strident voice was heard roaring over all the rest  by shed do it too he said between his teeth the performers were called by the whole house which sounded with cries of manager clytemnestra agamemnon could not be got to show in his classical tunic but stood in the background with aegisthus and others of the performers of the little play  mr bedwin sands led on zuleikah and clytemnestra  a great personage insisted on being presented to the charming clytemnestra  heigh ha run him through the body marry somebody else hay was the apposite remark made by his royal highness  mrs rawdon crawley was quite killing in the part said lord steyne becky laughed gay and saucy looking and swept the prettiest little curtsey ever seen  servants brought in salvers covered with numerous cool dainties and the performers disappeared to get ready for the second charadetableau  the three syllables of this charade were to be depicted in pantomime and the performance took place in the following wise  first syllable  colonel rawdon crawley cb with a slouched hat and a staff a greatcoat and a lantern borrowed from the stables passed across the stage bawling out as if warning the inhabitants of the hour  in the lower window are seen two bagmen playing apparently at the game of cribbage over which they yawn much to them enters one looking like boots the honourable g  ringwood which character the young gentleman performed to perfection and divests them of their lower coverings and presently chambermaid the right honourable lord southdown with two candlesticks and a warmingpan  she ascends to the upper apartment and warms the bed she uses the warmingpan as a weapon wherewith she wards off the attention of the bagmen she exits they put on their nightcaps and pull down the blinds  boots comes out and closes the shutters of the groundfloor chamber  you hear him bolting and chaining the door within  all the lights go out  the music plays dormez dormez chers amours  a voice from behind the curtain says first syllable  second syllable  the lamps are lighted up all of a sudden  the music plays the old air from john of paris ah quel plaisir detre en voyage it is the same scene between the first and second floors of the house represented you behold a sign on which the steyne arms are painted all the bells are ringing all over the house in the lower apartment you see a man with a long slip of paper presenting it to another who shakes his fists threatens and vows that it is monstrous  ostler bring round my gig cries another at the door  he chucks chambermaid the right honourable lord southdown under the chin she seems to deplore his absence as calypso did that of that other eminent traveller ulysses boots the honourable g  ringwood passes with a wooden box containing silver flagons and cries pots with such exquisite humour and naturalness that the whole house rings with applause and a bouquet is thrown to him  crack crack crack go the whips   landlord chambermaid waiter rush to the door but just as some distinguished guest is arriving the curtains close and the invisible theatrical manager cries out second syllable  i think it must be hotel says captain grigg of the life guards there is a general laugh at the captains cleverness  he is not very far from the mark  while the third syllable is in preparation the band begins a nautical medleyall in the downs cease rude boreas rule britannia in the bay of biscay osome maritime event is about to take place  a ben is heard ringing as the curtain draws aside now gents for the shore a voice exclaims  people take leave of each other  they point anxiously as if towards the clouds which are represented by a dark curtain and they nod their heads in fear lady squeams the right honourable lord southdown her lapdog her bags reticules and husband sit down and cling hold of some ropes it is evidently a ship  the captain colonel crawley cb with a cocked hat and a telescope comes in holding his hat on his head and looks out his coat tails fly about as if in the wind  when he leaves go of his hat to use his telescope his hat flies off with immense applause it is blowing fresh  the music rises and whistles louder and louder the mariners go across the stage staggering as if the ship was in severe motion  the steward the honourable g ringwood passes reeling by holding six basins  he puts one rapidly by lord squeamslady squeams giving a pinch to her dog which begins to howl piteously puts her pockethandkerchief to her face and rushes away as for the cabin  the music rises up to the wildest pitch of stormy excitement and the third syllable is concluded  there was a little ballet le rossignol in which montessu and noblet used to be famous in those days and which mr wagg transferred to the english stage as an opera putting his verse of which he was a skilful writer to the pretty airs of the ballet  it was dressed in old french costume and little lord southdown now appeared admirably attired in the disguise of an old woman hobbling about the stage with a faultless crooked stick  trills of melody were heard behind the scenes and gurgling from a sweet pasteboard cottage covered with roses and trellis work philomele philomele cries the old woman and philomele comes out  more applauseit is mrs rawdon crawley in powder and patches the most ravissante little marquise in the world  she comes in laughing humming and frisks about the stage with all the innocence of theatrical youthshe makes a curtsey  mamma says why child you are always laughing and singing and away she goes with    the rose upon my balcony    the rose upon my balcony the morning air perfuming   was leafless all the winter time and pining for the spring   you ask me why her breath is sweet and why her cheek is blooming   it is because the sun is out and birds begin to sing    the nightingale whose melody is through the greenwood ringing   was silent when the boughs were bare and winds were blowing keen   and if mamma you ask of me the reason of his singing   it is because the sun is out and all the leaves are green    thus each performs his part mamma the birds have found their voices   the blowing rose a flush mamma her bonny cheek to dye   and theres sunshine in my heart mamma which wakens and rejoices   and so i sing and blush mamma and thats the reason why   during the intervals of the stanzas of this ditty the goodnatured personage addressed as mamma by the singer and whose large whiskers appeared under her cap seemed very anxious to exhibit her maternal affection by embracing the innocent creature who performed the daughters part  every caress was received with loud acclamations of laughter by the sympathizing audience at its conclusion while the music was performing a symphony as if ever so many birds were warbling the whole house was unanimous for an encore  and applause and bouquets without end were showered upon the nightingale of the evening  lord steynes voice of applause was loudest of all becky the nightingale took the flowers which he threw to her and pressed them to her heart with the air of a consummate comedian lord steyne was frantic with delight  his guests enthusiasm harmonized with his own  where was the beautiful blackeyed houri whose appearance in the first charade had caused such delight she was twice as handsome as becky but the brilliancy of the latter had quite eclipsed her  all voices were for her  stephens caradori ronzi de begnis people compared her to one or the other and agreed with good reason very likely that had she been an actress none on the stage could have surpassed her she had reached her culmination her voice rose trilling and bright over the storm of applause and soared as high and joyful as her triumph  there was a ball after the dramatic entertainments and everybody pressed round becky as the great point of attraction of the evening  the royal personage declared with an oath that she was perfection and engaged her again and again in conversation  little beckys soul swelled with pride and delight at these honours she saw fortune fame fashion before her  lord steyne was her slave followed her everywhere and scarcely spoke to any one in the room beside and paid her the most marked compliments and attention  she still appeared in her marquise costume and danced a minuet with monsieur de truffigny monsieur le duc de la jabotieres attache and the duke who had all the traditions of the ancient court pronounced that madame crawley was worthy to have been a pupil of vestris or to have figured at versailles only a feeling of dignity the gout and the strongest sense of duty and personal sacrifice prevented his excellency from dancing with her himself and he declared in public that a lady who could talk and dance like mrs rawdon was fit to be ambassadress at any court in europe  he was only consoled when he heard that she was half a frenchwoman by birth  none but a compatriot his excellency declared could have performed that majestic dance in such a way  then she figured in a waltz with monsieur de klingenspohr the prince of peterwaradins cousin and attache  the delighted prince having less retenue than his french diplomatic colleague insisted upon taking a turn with the charming creature and twirled round the ballroom with her scattering the diamonds out of his boottassels and hussar jacket until his highness was fairly out of breath papoosh pasha himself would have liked to dance with her if that amusement had been the custom of his country  the company made a circle round her and applauded as wildly as if she had been a noblet or a taglioni everybody was in ecstacy and becky too you may be sure  she passed by lady stunnington with a look of scorn  she patronized lady gaunt and her astonished and mortified sisterinlawshe ecrased all rival charmers  as for poor mrs winkworth and her long hair and great eyes which had made such an effect at the commencement of the eveningwhere was she now nowhere in the race  she might tear her long hair and cry her great eyes out but there was not a person to heed or to deplore the discomfiture  the greatest triumph of all was at supper time  she was placed at the grand exclusive table with his royal highness the exalted personage before mentioned and the rest of the great guests  she was served on gold plate  she might have had pearls melted into her champagne if she likedanother cleopatraand the potentate of peterwaradin would have given half the brilliants off his jacket for a kind glance from those dazzling eyes jabotiere wrote home about her to his government  the ladies at the other tables who supped off mere silver and marked lord steynes constant attention to her vowed it was a monstrous infatuation a gross insult to ladies of rank  if sarcasm could have killed lady stunnington would have slain her on the spot  rawdon crawley was scared at these triumphs  they seemed to separate his wife farther than ever from him somehow  he thought with a feeling very like pain how immeasurably she was his superior  when the hour of departure came a crowd of young men followed her to her carriage for which the people without bawled the cry being caught up by the linkmen who were stationed outside the tall gates of gaunt house congratulating each person who issued from the gate and hoping his lordship had enjoyed this noble party  mrs rawdon crawleys carriage coming up to the gate after due shouting rattled into the illuminated courtyard and drove up to the covered way  rawdon put his wife into the carriage which drove off mr wenham had proposed to him to walk home and offered the colonel the refreshment of a cigar  they lighted their cigars by the lamp of one of the many linkboys outside and rawdon walked on with his friend wenham  two persons separated from the crowd and followed the two gentlemen and when they had walked down gaunt square a few score of paces one of the men came up and touching rawdon on the shoulder said beg your pardon colonel i vish to speak to you most particular this gentlemans acquaintance gave a loud whistle as the latter spoke at which signal a cab came clattering up from those stationed at the gate of gaunt houseand the aidedecamp ran round and placed himself in front of colonel crawley  that gallant officer at once knew what had befallen him  he was in the hands of the bailiffs  he started back falling against the man who had first touched him  were three on usits no use bolting the man behind said  its you moss is it said the colonel who appeared to know his interlocutor  how much is it  only a small thing whispered mr moss of cursitor street chancery lane and assistant officer to the sheriff of middlesexone hundred and sixtysix six and eightpence at the suit of mr nathan  lend me a hundred wenham for gods sake poor rawdon saidive got seventy at home  ive not got ten pounds in the world said poor mr wenhamgood night my dear fellow  good night said rawdon ruefully  and wenham walked awayand rawdon crawley finished his cigar as the cab drove under temple bar    chapter lii  in which lord steyne shows himself in a most amiable light  when lord steyne was benevolently disposed he did nothing by halves and his kindness towards the crawley family did the greatest honour to his benevolent discrimination  his lordship extended his goodwill to little rawdon  he pointed out to the boys parents the necessity of sending him to a public school that he was of an age now when emulation the first principles of the latin language pugilistic exercises and the society of his fellowboys would be of the greatest benefit to the boy  his father objected that he was not rich enough to send the child to a good public school his mother that briggs was a capital mistress for him and had brought him on as indeed was the fact famously in english the latin rudiments and in general learning  but all these objections disappeared before the generous perseverance of the marquis of steyne  his lordship was one of the governors of that famous old collegiate institution called the whitefriars  it had been a cistercian convent in old days when the smithfield which is contiguous to it was a tournament ground obstinate heretics used to be brought thither convenient for burning hard by  henry viii the defender of the faith seized upon the monastery and its possessions and hanged and tortured some of the monks who could not accommodate themselves to the pace of his reform finally a great merchant bought the house and land adjoining in which and with the help of other wealthy endowments of land and money he established a famous foundation hospital for old men and children an extern school grew round the old almost monastic foundation which subsists still with its middleage costume and usagesand all cistercians pray that it may long flourish  of this famous house some of the greatest noblemen prelates and dignitaries in england are governors  and as the boys are very comfortably lodged fed and educated and subsequently inducted to good scholarships at the university and livings in the church many little gentlemen are devoted to the ecclesiastical profession from their tenderest years and there is considerable emulation to procure nominations for the foundation  it was originally intended for the sons of poor and deserving clerics and laics but many of the noble governors of the institution with an enlarged and rather capricious benevolence selected all sorts of objects for their bounty to get an education for nothing and a future livelihood and profession assured was so excellent a scheme that some of the richest people did not disdain it and not only great mens relations but great men themselves sent their sons to profit by the chanceright rev prelates sent their own kinsmen or the sons of their clergy while on the other hand some great noblemen did not disdain to patronize the children of their confidential servantsso that a lad entering this establishment had every variety of youthful society wherewith to mingle  rawdon crawley though the only book which he studied was the racing calendar and though his chief recollections of polite learning were connected with the floggings which he received at eton in his early youth had that decent and honest reverence for classical learning which all english gentlemen feel and was glad to think that his son was to have a provision for life perhaps and a certain opportunity of becoming a scholar  and although his boy was his chief solace and companion and endeared to him by a thousand small ties about which he did not care to speak to his wife who had all along shown the utmost indifference to their son yet rawdon agreed at once to part with him and to give up his own greatest comfort and benefit for the sake of the welfare of the little lad  he did not know how fond he was of the child until it became necessary to let him go away when he was gone he felt more sad and downcast than he cared to ownfar sadder than the boy himself who was happy enough to enter a new career and find companions of his own age  becky burst out laughing once or twice when the colonel in his clumsy incoherent way tried to express his sentimental sorrows at the boys departure  the poor fellow felt that his dearest pleasure and closest friend was taken from him  he looked often and wistfully at the little vacant bed in his dressingroom where the child used to sleep  he missed him sadly of mornings and tried in vain to walk in the park without him  he did not know how solitary he was until little rawdon was gone  he liked the people who were fond of him and would go and sit for long hours with his goodnatured sister lady jane and talk to her about the virtues and good looks and hundred good qualities of the child  young rawdons aunt we have said was very fond of him as was her little girl who wept copiously when the time for her cousins departure came  the elder rawdon was thankful for the fondness of mother and daughter  the very best and honestest feelings of the man came out in these artless outpourings of paternal feeling in which he indulged in their presence and encouraged by their sympathy  he secured not only lady janes kindness but her sincere regard by the feelings which he manifested and which he could not show to his own wife  the two kinswomen met as seldom as possible becky laughed bitterly at janes feelings and softness the others kindly and gentle nature could not but revolt at her sisters callous behaviour  it estranged rawdon from his wife more than he knew or acknowledged to himself  she did not care for the estrangement  indeed she did not miss him or anybody she looked upon him as her errandman and humble slave  he might be ever so depressed or sulky and she did not mark his demeanour or only treated it with a sneer  she was busy thinking about her position or her pleasures or her advancement in society she ought to have held a great place in it that is certain  it was honest briggs who made up the little kit for the boy which he was to take to school  molly the housemaid blubbered in the passage when he went awaymolly kind and faithful in spite of a long arrear of unpaid wages  mrs becky could not let her husband have the carriage to take the boy to school  take the horses into the citysuch a thing was never heard of  let a cab be brought she did not offer to kiss him when he went nor did the child propose to embrace her but gave a kiss to old briggs whom in general he was very shy of caressing and consoled her by pointing out that he was to come home on saturdays when she would have the benefit of seeing him  as the cab rolled towards the city beckys carriage rattled off to the park she was chattering and laughing with a score of young dandies by the serpentine as the father and son entered at the old gates of the schoolwhere rawdon left the child and came away with a sadder purer feeling in his heart than perhaps that poor battered fellow had ever known since he himself came out of the nursery  he walked all the way home very dismally and dined alone with briggs he was very kind to her and grateful for her love and watchfulness over the boy  his conscience smote him that he had borrowed briggss money and aided in deceiving her  they talked about little rawdon a long time for becky only came home to dress and go out to dinnerand then he went off uneasily to drink tea with lady jane and tell her of what had happened and how little rawdon went off like a trump and how he was to wear a gown and little kneebreeches and how young blackball jack blackballs son of the old regiment had taken him in charge and promised to be kind to him  in the course of a week young blackball had constituted little rawdon his fag shoeblack and breakfast toaster initiated him into the mysteries of the latin grammar and thrashed him three or four times but not severely  the little chaps goodnatured honest face won his way for him  he only got that degree of beating which was no doubt good for him and as for blacking shoes toasting bread and fagging in general were these offices not deemed to be necessary parts of every young english gentlemans education  our business does not lie with the second generation and master rawdons life at school otherwise the present tale might be carried to any indefinite length  the colonel went to see his son a short time afterwards and found the lad sufficiently well and happy grinning and laughing in his little black gown and little breeches  his father sagaciously tipped blackball his master a sovereign and secured that young gentlemans goodwill towards his fag  as a protege of the great lord steyne the nephew of a county member and son of a colonel and cb whose name appeared in some of the most fashionable parties in the morning post perhaps the school authorities were disposed not to look unkindly on the child  he had plenty of pocketmoney which he spent in treating his comrades royally to raspberry tarts and he was often allowed to come home on saturdays to his father who always made a jubilee of that day when free rawdon would take him to the play or send him thither with the footman and on sundays he went to church with briggs and lady jane and his cousins rawdon marvelled over his stories about school and fights and fagging  before long he knew the names of all the masters and the principal boys as well as little rawdon himself  he invited little rawdons crony from school and made both the children sick with pastry and oysters and porter after the play  he tried to look knowing over the latin grammar when little rawdon showed him what part of that work he was in stick to it my boy he said to him with much gravity theres nothing like a good classical education nothing  beckys contempt for her husband grew greater every day  do what you likedine where you pleasego and have gingerbeer and sawdust at astleys or psalmsinging with lady janeonly dont expect me to busy myself with the boy  i have your interests to attend to as you cant attend to them yourself  i should like to know where you would have been now and in what sort of a position in society if i had not looked after you indeed nobody wanted poor old rawdon at the parties whither becky used to go  she was often asked without him now  she talked about great people as if she had the feesimple of may fair and when the court went into mourning she always wore black  little rawdon being disposed of lord steyne who took such a parental interest in the affairs of this amiable poor family thought that their expenses might be very advantageously curtailed by the departure of miss briggs and that becky was quite clever enough to take the management of her own house  it has been narrated in a former chapter how the benevolent nobleman had given his protegee money to pay off her little debt to miss briggs who however still remained behind with her friends whence my lord came to the painful conclusion that mrs crawley had made some other use of the money confided to her than that for which her generous patron had given the loan  however lord steyne was not so rude as to impart his suspicions upon this head to mrs becky whose feelings might be hurt by any controversy on the moneyquestion and who might have a thousand painful reasons for disposing otherwise of his lordships generous loan  but he determined to satisfy himself of the real state of the case and instituted the necessary inquiries in a most cautious and delicate manner  in the first place he took an early opportunity of pumping miss briggs that was not a difficult operation a very little encouragement would set that worthy woman to talk volubly and pour out all within her  and one day when mrs rawdon had gone out to drive as mr fiche his lordships confidential servant easily learned at the livery stables where the crawleys kept their carriage and horses or rather where the liveryman kept a carriage and horses for mr and mrs crawleymy lord dropped in upon the curzon street houseasked briggs for a cup of coffeetold her that he had good accounts of the little boy at schooland in five minutes found out from her that mrs rawdon had given her nothing except a black silk gown for which miss briggs was immensely grateful  he laughed within himself at this artless story  for the truth is our dear friend rebecca had given him a most circumstantial narration of briggss delight at receiving her moneyeleven hundred and twentyfive poundsand in what securities she had invested it and what a pang becky herself felt in being obliged to pay away such a delightful sum of money  who knows the dear woman may have thought within herself perhaps he may give me a little more my lord however made no such proposal to the little schemervery likely thinking that he had been sufficiently generous already  he had the curiosity then to ask miss briggs about the state of her private affairsand she told his lordship candidly what her position washow miss crawley had left her a legacyhow her relatives had had part of ithow colonel crawley had put out another portion for which she had the best security and interestand how mr and mrs rawdon had kindly busied themselves with sir pitt who was to dispose of the remainder most advantageously for her when he had time  my lord asked how much the colonel had already invested for her and miss briggs at once and truly told him that the sum was six hundred and odd pounds  but as soon as she had told her story the voluble briggs repented of her frankness and besought my lord not to tell mr crawley of the confessions which she had made  the colonel was so kindmr crawley might be offended and pay back the money for which she could get no such good interest anywhere else lord steyne laughing promised he never would divulge their conversation and when he and miss briggs parted he laughed still more  what an accomplished little devil it is thought he what a splendid actress and manager  she had almost got a second supply out of me the other day with her coaxing ways  she beats all the women i have ever seen in the course of all my wellspent life they are babies compared to her  i am a greenhorn myself and a fool in her handsan old fool she is unsurpassable in lies his lordships admiration for becky rose immeasurably at this proof of her cleverness  getting the money was nothingbut getting double the sum she wanted and paying nobodyit was a magnificent stroke and crawley my lord thoughtcrawley is not such a fool as he looks and seems  he has managed the matter cleverly enough on his side nobody would ever have supposed from his face and demeanour that he knew anything about this money business and yet he put her up to it and has spent the money no doubt  in this opinion my lord we know was mistaken but it influenced a good deal his behaviour towards colonel crawley whom he began to treat with even less than that semblance of respect which he had formerly shown towards that gentleman  it never entered into the head of mrs crawleys patron that the little lady might be making a purse for herself and perhaps if the truth must be told he judged of colonel crawley by his experience of other husbands whom he had known in the course of the long and wellspent life which had made him acquainted with a great deal of the weakness of mankind  my lord had bought so many men during his life that he was surely to be pardoned for supposing that he had found the price of this one  he taxed becky upon the point on the very first occasion when he met her alone and he complimented her goodhumouredly on her cleverness in getting more than the money which she required  becky was only a little taken aback  it was not the habit of this dear creature to tell falsehoods except when necessity compelled but in these great emergencies it was her practice to lie very freely and in an instant she was ready with another neat plausible circumstantial story which she administered to her patron  the previous statement which she had made to him was a falsehooda wicked falsehoodshe owned it  but who had made her tell it ah my lord she said you dont know all i have to suffer and bear in silence you see me gay and happy before youyou little know what i have to endure when there is no protector near me  it was my husband by threats and the most savage treatment forced me to ask for that sum about which i deceived you  it was he who foreseeing that questions might be asked regarding the disposal of the money forced me to account for it as i did  he took the money he told me he had paid miss briggs i did not want i did not dare to doubt him pardon the wrong which a desperate man is forced to commit and pity a miserable miserable woman she burst into tears as she spoke  persecuted virtue never looked more bewitchingly wretched  they had a long conversation driving round and round the regents park in mrs crawleys carriage together a conversation of which it is not necessary to repeat the details but the upshot of it was that when becky came home she flew to her dear briggs with a smiling face and announced that she had some very good news for her lord steyne had acted in the noblest and most generous manner  he was always thinking how and when he could do good  now that little rawdon was gone to school a dear companion and friend was no longer necessary to her she was grieved beyond measure to part with briggs but her means required that she should practise every retrenchment and her sorrow was mitigated by the idea that her dear briggs would be far better provided for by her generous patron than in her humble home  mrs pilkington the housekeeper at gauntly hall was growing exceedingly old feeble and rheumatic she was not equal to the work of superintending that vast mansion and must be on the look out for a successor  it was a splendid position the family did not go to gauntly once in two years  at other times the housekeeper was the mistress of the magnificent mansionhad four covers daily for her table was visited by the clergy and the most respectable people of the countywas the lady of gauntly in fact and the two last housekeepers before mrs pilkington had married rectors of gauntlybut mrs p could not being the aunt of the present rector  the place was not to be hers yet but she might go down on a visit to mrs pilkington and see whether she would like to succeed her  what words can paint the ecstatic gratitude of briggs all she stipulated for was that little rawdon should be allowed to come down and see her at the hall  becky promised thisanything  she ran up to her husband when he came home and told him the joyful news rawdon was glad deuced glad the weight was off his conscience about poor briggss money  she was provided for at any rate butbut his mind was disquiet  he did not seem to be all right somehow  he told little southdown what lord steyne had done and the young man eyed crawley with an air which surprised the latter  he told lady jane of this second proof of steynes bounty and she too looked odd and alarmed so did sir pitt  she is too clever andand gay to be allowed to go from party to party without a companion both said  you must go with her rawdon wherever she goes and you must have somebody with herone of the girls from queens crawley perhaps though they were rather giddy guardians for her  somebody becky should have  but in the meantime it was clear that honest briggs must not lose her chance of settlement for life and so she and her bags were packed and she set off on her journey and so two of rawdons outsentinels were in the hands of the enemy  sir pitt went and expostulated with his sisterinlaw upon the subject of the dismissal of briggs and other matters of delicate family interest  in vain she pointed out to him how necessary was the protection of lord steyne for her poor husband how cruel it would be on their part to deprive briggs of the position offered to her cajolements coaxings smiles tears could not satisfy sir pitt and he had something very like a quarrel with his once admired becky  he spoke of the honour of the family the unsullied reputation of the crawleys expressed himself in indignant tones about her receiving those young frenchmenthose wild young men of fashion my lord steyne himself whose carriage was always at her door who passed hours daily in her company and whose constant presence made the world talk about her  as the head of the house he implored her to be more prudent society was already speaking lightly of her  lord steyne though a nobleman of the greatest station and talents was a man whose attentions would compromise any woman he besought he implored he commanded his sisterinlaw to be watchful in her intercourse with that nobleman  becky promised anything and everything pitt wanted but lord steyne came to her house as often as ever and sir pitts anger increased i wonder was lady jane angry or pleased that her husband at last found fault with his favourite rebecca lord steynes visits continuing his own ceased and his wife was for refusing all further intercourse with that nobleman and declining the invitation to the charadenight which the marchioness sent to her but sir pitt thought it was necessary to accept it as his royal highness would be there  although he went to the party in question sir pitt quitted it very early and his wife too was very glad to come away  becky hardly so much as spoke to him or noticed her sisterinlaw  pitt crawley declared her behaviour was monstrously indecorous reprobated in strong terms the habit of playacting and fancy dressing as highly unbecoming a british female and after the charades were over took his brother rawdon severely to task for appearing himself and allowing his wife to join in such improper exhibitions  rawdon said she should not join in any more such amusementsbut indeed and perhaps from hints from his elder brother and sister he had already become a very watchful and exemplary domestic character he left off his clubs and billiards  he never left home  he took becky out to drive he went laboriously with her to all her parties whenever my lord steyne called he was sure to find the colonel and when becky proposed to go out without her husband or received invitations for herself he peremptorily ordered her to refuse them and there was that in the gentlemans manner which enforced obedience  little becky to do her justice was charmed with rawdons gallantry  if he was surly she never was whether friends were present or absent she had always a kind smile for him and was attentive to his pleasure and comfort  it was the early days of their marriage over again  the same good humour prevenances merriment and artless confidence and regard  how much pleasanter it is she would say to have you by my side in the carriage than that foolish old briggs  let us always go on so dear rawdon  how nice it would be and how happy we should always be if we had but the money he fell asleep after dinner in his chair he did not see the face opposite to him haggard weary and terrible it lighted up with fresh candid smiles when he woke  it kissed him gaily he wondered that he had ever had suspicions  no he never had suspicions all those dumb doubts and surly misgivings which had been gathering on his mind were mere idle jealousies  she was fond of him she always had been  as for her shining in society it was no fault of hers she was formed to shine there was there any woman who could talk or sing or do anything like her if she would but like the boy rawdon thought  but the mother and son never could be brought together  and it was while rawdons mind was agitated with these doubts and perplexities that the incident occurred which was mentioned in the last chapter and the unfortunate colonel found himself a prisoner away from home    chapter liii  a rescue and a catastrophe  friend rawdon drove on then to mr mosss mansion in cursitor street and was duly inducted into that dismal place of hospitality morning was breaking over the cheerful housetops of chancery lane as the rattling cab woke up the echoes there  a little pinkeyed jewboy with a head as ruddy as the rising morn let the party into the house and rawdon was welcomed to the groundfloor apartments by mr moss his travelling companion and host who cheerfully asked him if he would like a glass of something warm after his drive  the colonel was not so depressed as some mortals would be who quitting a palace and a placens uxor find themselves barred into a spunginghouse for if the truth must be told he had been a lodger at mr mosss establishment once or twice before  we have not thought it necessary in the previous course of this narrative to mention these trivial little domestic incidents  but the reader may be assured that they cant unfrequently occur in the life of a man who lives on nothing a year  upon his first visit to mr moss the colonel then a bachelor had been liberated by the generosity of his aunt on the second mishap little becky with the greatest spirit and kindness had borrowed a sum of money from lord southdown and had coaxed her husbands creditor who was her shawl velvetgown lace pockethandkerchief trinket and gimcrack purveyor indeed to take a portion of the sum claimed and rawdons promissory note for the remainder  so on both these occasions the capture and release had been conducted with the utmost gallantry on all sides and moss and the colonel were therefore on the very best of terms  youll find your old bed colonel and everything comfortable that gentleman said as i may honestly say you may be pretty sure its kep aired and by the best of company too  it was slep in the night afore last by the honorable capting famish of the fiftieth dragoons whose mar took him out after a fortnight jest to punish him she said but law bless you i promise you he punished my champagne and had a party ere every nightreglar tiptop swells down from the clubs and the west endcapting ragg the honorable deuceace who lives in the temple and some fellers as knows a good glass of wine i warrant you ive got a doctor of diwinity upstairs five gents in the coffeeroom and mrs moss has a tablydyhoty at halfpast five and a little cards or music afterwards when we shall be most happy to see you  ill ring when i want anything said rawdon and went quietly to his bedroom  he was an old soldier we have said and not to be disturbed by any little shocks of fate  a weaker man would have sent off a letter to his wife on the instant of his capture  but what is the use of disturbing her nights rest thought rawdon she wont know whether i am in my room or not  it will be time enough to write to her when she has had her sleep out and i have had mine  its only a hundredandseventy and the deuce is in it if we cant raise that and so thinking about little rawdon whom he would not have know that he was in such a queer place the colonel turned into the bed lately occupied by captain famish and fell asleep  it was ten oclock when he woke up and the ruddyheaded youth brought him with conscious pride a fine silver dressingcase wherewith he might perform the operation of shaving indeed mr mosss house though somewhat dirty was splendid throughout  there were dirty trays and winecoolers en permanence on the sideboard huge dirty gilt cornices with dingy yellow satin hangings to the barred windows which looked into cursitor streetvast and dirty gilt picture frames surrounding pieces sporting and sacred all of which works were by the greatest mastersand fetched the greatest prices too in the bill transactions in the course of which they were sold and bought over and over again  the colonels breakfast was served to him in the same dingy and gorgeous plated ware  miss moss a darkeyed maid in curlpapers appeared with the teapot and smiling asked the colonel how he had slep and she brought him in the morning post with the names of all the great people who had figured at lord steynes entertainment the night before  it contained a brilliant account of the festivities and of the beautiful and accomplished mrs rawdon crawleys admirable personifications  after a lively chat with this lady who sat on the edge of the breakfast table in an easy attitude displaying the drapery of her stocking and an exwhite satin shoe which was down at heel colonel crawley called for pens and ink and paper and being asked how many sheets chose one which was brought to him between miss mosss own finger and thumb  many a sheet had that darkeyed damsel brought in many a poor fellow had scrawled and blotted hurried lines of entreaty and paced up and down that awful room until his messenger brought back the reply  poor men always use messengers instead of the post  who has not had their letters with the wafers wet and the announcement that a person is waiting in the hall  now on the score of his application rawdon had not many misgivings  dear becky rawdon wrote  i hope you slept well  dont be frightened if i dont bring you in your coffy  last night as i was coming home smoaking i met with an accadent  i was nabbed by moss of cursitor streetfrom whose gilt and splendid parler i write thisthe same that had me this time two years miss moss brought in my teashe is grown very fat and as usual had her stockens down at heal  its nathans businessa hundredandfiftywith costs

seventyfive down and ask him to renewsay ill take winewe may as well have some dinner sherry but not picturs theyre too dear  if he wont stand it  take my ticker and such of your things as you can spare and send them to ballswe must of coarse have the sum tonight  it wont do to let it stand over as tomorrows sunday the beds here are not very clean and there may be other things out against meim glad it ant rawdons saturday for coming home  god bless you  yours in haste r c ps  make haste and come  this letter sealed with a wafer was dispatched by one of the messengers who are always hanging about mr mosss establishment and rawdon having seen him depart went out in the courtyard and smoked his cigar with a tolerably easy mindin spite of the bars overheadfor mr mosss courtyard is railed in like a cage lest the gentlemen who are boarding with him should take a fancy to escape from his hospitality  three hours he calculated would be the utmost time required before becky should arrive and open his prison doors and he passed these pretty cheerfully in smoking in reading the paper and in the coffeeroom with an acquaintance captain walker who happened to be there and with whom he cut for sixpences for some hours with pretty equal luck on either side  but the day passed away and no messenger returnedno becky  mr mosss tablydyhoty was served at the appointed hour of halfpast five when such of the gentlemen lodging in the house as could afford to pay for the banquet came and partook of it in the splendid front parlour before described and with which mr crawleys temporary lodging communicated when miss m  miss hem as her papa called her appeared without the curlpapers of the morning and mrs hem did the honours of a prime boiled leg of mutton and turnips of which the colonel ate with a very faint appetite  asked whether he would stand a bottle of champagne for the company he consented and the ladies drank to his ealth and mr moss in the most polite manner looked towards him  in the midst of this repast however the doorbell was heardyoung moss of the ruddy hair rose up with the keys and answered the summons and coming back told the colonel that the messenger had returned with a bag a desk and a letter which he gave him  no ceramony colonel i beg said mrs moss with a wave of her hand and he opened the letter rather tremulously  it was a beautiful letter highly scented on a pink paper and with a light green seal  mon pauvre cher petit mrs crawley wrote  i could not sleep one wink for thinking of what had become of my odious old monstre and only got to rest in the morning after sending for mr blench for i was in a fever who gave me a composing draught and left orders with finette that i should be disturbed on no account  so that my poor old mans messenger who had bien mauvaise mine finette says and sentoit le genievre remained in the hall for some hours waiting my bell you may fancy my state when i read your poor dear old illspelt letter  ill as i was i instantly called for the carriage and as soon as i was dressed though i couldnt drink a drop of chocolatei assure you i couldnt without my monstre to bring it to me i drove ventre a terre to nathans  i saw himi wepti criedi fell at his odious knees nothing would mollify the horrid man he would have all the money he said or keep my poor monstre in prison  i drove home with the intention of paying that triste visite chez mon oncle when every trinket i have should be at your disposal though they would not fetch a hundred pounds for some you know are with ce cher oncle already and found milor there with the bulgarian old sheepfaced monster who had come to compliment me upon last nights performances paddington came in too drawling and lisping and twiddling his hair so did champignac and his chefeverybody with foison of compliments and pretty speechesplaguing poor me who longed to be rid of them and was thinking every moment of the time of mon pauvre prisonnier  when they were gone i went down on my knees to milor told him we were going to pawn everything and begged and prayed him to give me two hundred pounds he pishd and pshad in a furytold me not to be such a fool as to pawnand said he would see whether he could lend me the money  at last he went away promising that he would send it me in the morning  when i will bring it to my poor old monster with a kiss from his affectionate  becky  i am writing in bed  oh i have such a headache and such a heartache  when rawdon read over this letter he turned so red and looked so savage that the company at the table dhote easily perceived that bad news had reached him  all his suspicions which he had been trying to banish returned upon him  she could not even go out and sell her trinkets to free him  she could laugh and talk about compliments paid to her whilst he was in prison  who had put him there wenham had walked with him  was there  he could hardly bear to think of what he suspected  leaving the room hurriedly he ran into his ownopened his desk wrote two hurried lines which he directed to sir pitt or lady crawley and bade the messenger carry them at once to gaunt street bidding him to take a cab and promising him a guinea if he was back in an hour  in the note he besought his dear brother and sister for the sake of god for the sake of his dear child and his honour to come to him and relieve him from his difficulty  he was in prison he wanted a hundred pounds to set him freehe entreated them to come to him  he went back to the diningroom after dispatching his messenger and called for more wine  he laughed and talked with a strange boisterousness as the people thought  sometimes he laughed madly at his own fears and went on drinking for an hour listening all the while for the carriage which was to bring his fate back  at the expiration of that time wheels were heard whirling up to the gatethe young janitor went out with his gatekeys  it was a lady whom he let in at the bailiffs door  colonel crawley she said trembling very much  he with a knowing look locked the outer door upon herthen unlocked and opened the inner one and calling out colonel youre wanted led her into the back parlour which he occupied  rawdon came in from the diningparlour where all those people were carousing into his back room a flare of coarse light following him into the apartment where the lady stood still very nervous  it is i rawdon she said in a timid voice which she strove to render cheerful  it is jane rawdon was quite overcome by that kind voice and presence  he ran up to hercaught her in his armsgasped out some inarticulate words of thanks and fairly sobbed on her shoulder  she did not know the cause of his emotion  the bills of mr moss were quickly settled perhaps to the disappointment of that gentleman who had counted on having the colonel as his guest over sunday at least and jane with beaming smiles and happiness in her eyes carried away rawdon from the bailiffs house and they went homewards in the cab in which she had hastened to his release  pitt was gone to a parliamentary dinner she said when rawdons note came and so dear rawdon ii came myself and she put her kind hand in his  perhaps it was well for rawdon crawley that pitt was away at that dinner  rawdon thanked his sister a hundred times and with an ardour of gratitude which touched and almost alarmed that softhearted woman oh said he in his rude artless way youyou dont know how im changed since ive known you andand little rawdy iid like to change somehow  you see i wanti wantto be he did not finish the sentence but she could interpret it  and that night after he left her and as she sat by her own little boys bed she prayed humbly for that poor wayworn sinner  rawdon left her and walked home rapidly  it was nine oclock at night he ran across the streets and the great squares of vanity fair and at length came up breathless opposite his own house  he started back and fell against the railings trembling as he looked up  the drawingroom windows were blazing with light  she had said that she was in bed and ill  he stood there for some time the light from the rooms on his pale face  he took out his doorkey and let himself into the house  he could hear laughter in the upper rooms  he was in the balldress in which he had been captured the night before  he went silently up the stairs leaning against the banisters at the stairhead  nobody was stirring in the house besidesall the servants had been sent away rawdon heard laughter withinlaughter and singing becky was singing a snatch of the song of the night before a hoarse voice shouted brava bravait was lord steynes  rawdon opened the door and went in  a little table with a dinner was laid outand wine and plate  steyne was hanging over the sofa on which becky sat  the wretched woman was in a brilliant full toilette her arms and all her fingers sparkling with bracelets and rings and the brilliants on her breast which steyne had given her he had her hand in his and was bowing over it to kiss it when becky started up with a faint scream as she caught sight of rawdons white face  at the next instant she tried a smile a horrid smile as if to welcome her husband and steyne rose up grinding his teeth pale and with fury in his looks  he too attempted a laughand came forward holding out his hand what come back  how dye do crawley he said the nerves of his mouth twitching as he tried to grin at the intruder  there was that in rawdons face which caused becky to fling herself before him  i am innocent rawdon she said before god i am innocent she clung hold of his coat of his hands her own were all covered with serpents and rings and baubles  i am innocent say i am innocent she said to lord steyne  he thought a trap had been laid for him and was as furious with the wife as with the husband  you innocent  damn you he screamed out you innocent  why every trinket you have on your body is paid for by me i have given you thousands of pounds which this fellow has spent and for which he has sold you  innocent by  youre as innocent as your mother the balletgirl and your husband the bully  dont think to frighten me as you have done others make way sir and let me pass and lord steyne seized up his hat and with flame in his eyes and looking his enemy fiercely in the face marched upon him never for a moment doubting that the other would give way  but rawdon crawley springing out seized him by the neckcloth until steyne almost strangled writhed and bent under his arm  you lie you dog said rawdon you lie you coward and villain and he struck the peer twice over the face with his open hand and flung him bleeding to the ground  it was all done before rebecca could interpose  she stood there trembling before him  she admired her husband strong brave and victorious  come here he said  she came up at once  take off those things she began trembling pulling the jewels from her arms and the rings from her shaking fingers and held them all in a heap quivering and looking up at him  throw them down he said and she dropped them  he tore the diamond ornament out of her breast and flung it at lord steyne  it cut him on his bald forehead  steyne wore the scar to his dying day  come upstairs rawdon said to his wife  dont kill me rawdon she said  he laughed savagely  i want to see if that man lies about the money as he has about me  has he given you any  no said rebecca that is  give me your keys rawdon answered and they went out together  rebecca gave him all the keys but one and she was in hopes that he would not have remarked the absence of that  it belonged to the little desk which amelia had given her in early days and which she kept in a secret place  but rawdon flung open boxes and wardrobes throwing the multifarious trumpery of their contents here and there and at last he found the desk  the woman was forced to open it  it contained papers loveletters many years oldall sorts of small trinkets and womans memoranda  and it contained a pocketbook with banknotes some of these were dated ten years back too and one was quite a fresh onea note for a thousand pounds which lord steyne had given her  did he give you this rawdon said  yes rebecca answered  ill send it to him today rawdon said for day had dawned again and many hours had passed in this search and i will pay briggs who was kind to the boy and some of the debts  you will let me know where i shall send the rest to you  you might have spared me a hundred pounds becky out of all thisi have always shared with you  i am innocent said becky  and he left her without another word  what were her thoughts when he left her she remained for hours after he was gone the sunshine pouring into the room and rebecca sitting alone on the beds edge  the drawers were all opened and their contents scattered aboutdresses and feathers scarfs and trinkets a heap of tumbled vanities lying in a wreck  her hair was falling over her shoulders her gown was torn where rawdon had wrenched the brilliants out of it  she heard him go downstairs a few minutes after he left her and the door slamming and closing on him  she knew he would never come back  he was gone forever would he kill himselfshe thoughtnot until after he had met lord steyne  she thought of her long past life and all the dismal incidents of it  ah how dreary it seemed how miserable lonely and profitless  should she take laudanum and end it to have done with all hopes schemes debts and triumphs the french maid found her in this positionsitting in the midst of her miserable ruins with clasped hands and dry eyes  the woman was her accomplice and in steynes pay  mon dieu madame what has happened she asked  what had happened was she guilty or not she said not but who could tell what was truth which came from those lips or if that corrupt heart was in this case pure  all her lies and her schemes an her selfishness and her wiles all her wit and genius had come to this bankruptcy  the woman closed the curtains and with some entreaty and show of kindness persuaded her mistress to lie down on the bed  then she went below and gathered up the trinkets which had been lying on the floor since rebecca dropped them there at her husbands orders and lord steyne went away    chapter liv  sunday after the battle  the mansion of sir pitt crawley in great gaunt street was just beginning to dress itself for the day as rawdon in his evening costume which he had now worn two days passed by the scared female who was scouring the steps and entered into his brothers study lady jane in her morninggown was up and above stairs in the nursery superintending the toilettes of her children and listening to the morning prayers which the little creatures performed at her knee every morning she and they performed this duty privately and before the public ceremonial at which sir pitt presided and at which all the people of the household were expected to assemble rawdon sat down in the study before the baronets table set out with the orderly blue books and the letters the neatly docketed bills and symmetrical pamphlets the locked accountbooks desks and dispatch boxes the bible the quarterly review and the court guide which all stood as if on parade awaiting the inspection of their chief  a book of family sermons one of which sir pitt was in the habit of administering to his family on sunday mornings lay ready on the study table and awaiting his judicious selection  and by the sermonbook was the observer newspaper damp and neatly folded and for sir pitts own private use  his gentleman alone took the opportunity of perusing the newspaper before he laid it by his masters desk  before he had brought it into the study that morning he had read in the journal a flaming account of festivities at gaunt house with the names of all the distinguished personages invited by tho marquis of steyne to meet his royal highness  having made comments upon this entertainment to the housekeeper and her niece as they were taking early tea and hot buttered toast in the former ladys apartment and wondered how the rawding crawleys could git on the valet had damped and folded the paper once more so that it looked quite fresh and innocent against the arrival of the master of the house  poor rawdon took up the paper and began to try and read it until his brother should arrive  but the print fell blank upon his eyes and he did not know in the least what he was reading  the government news and appointments which sir pitt as a public man was bound to peruse otherwise he would by no means permit the introduction of sunday papers into his household the theatrical criticisms the fight for a hundred pounds a side between the barking butcher and the tutbury pet the gaunt house chronicle itself which contained a most complimentary though guarded account of the famous charades of which mrs becky had been the heroineall these passed as in a haze before rawdon as he sat waiting the arrival of the chief of the family  punctually as the shrilltoned bell of the black marble study clock began to chime nine sir pitt made his appearance fresh neat smugly shaved with a waxy clean face and stiff shirt collar his scanty hair combed and oiled trimming his nails as he descended the stairs majestically in a starched cravat and a grey flannel dressinggowna real old english gentleman in a worda model of neatness and every propriety  he started when he saw poor rawdon in his study in tumbled clothes with bloodshot eyes and his hair over his face  he thought his brother was not sober and had been out all night on some orgy good gracious rawdon he said with a blank face what brings you here at this time of the morning why aint you at home  home said rawdon with a wild laugh  dont be frightened pitt im not drunk  shut the door i want to speak to you  pitt closed the door and came up to the table where he sat down in the other armchairthat one placed for the reception of the steward agent or confidential visitor who came to transact business with the baronetand trimmed his nails more vehemently than ever  pitt its all over with me the colonel said after a pause  im done  i always said it would come to this the baronet cried peevishly and beating a tune with his cleantrimmed nails  i warned you a thousand times  i cant help you any more  every shilling of my money is tied up  even the hundred pounds that jane took you last night were promised to my lawyer tomorrow morning and the want of it will put me to great inconvenience i dont mean to say that i wont assist you ultimately but as for paying your creditors in full i might as well hope to pay the national debt  it is madness sheer madness to think of such a thing  you must come to a compromise  its a painful thing for the family but everybody does it  there was george kitely lord raglands son went through the court last week and was what they call whitewashed i believe lord ragland would not pay a shilling for him and  its not money i want rawdon broke in  im not come to you about myself  never mind what happens to me  what is the matter then said pitt somewhat relieved  its the boy said rawdon in a husky voice  i want you to promise me that you will take charge of him when im gone  that dear good wife of yours has always been good to him and hes fonder of her than he is of his   damn it  look here pittyou know that i was to have had miss crawleys money  i wasnt brought up like a younger brother but was always encouraged to be extravagant and kep idle  but for this i might have been quite a different man  i didnt do my duty with the regiment so bad  you know how i was thrown over about the money and who got it  after the sacrifices i have made and the manner in which i have stood by you i think this sort of reproach is useless sir pitt said your marriage was your own doing not mine  thats over now said rawdon  thats over now and the words were wrenched from him with a groan which made his brother start  good god  is she dead sir pitt said with a voice of genuine alarm and commiseration  i wish i was rawdon replied  if it wasnt for little rawdon id have cut my throat this morningand that damned villains too  sir pitt instantly guessed the truth and surmised that lord steyne was the person whose life rawdon wished to take  the colonel told his senior briefly and in broken accents the circumstances of the case it was a regular plan between that scoundrel and her he said  the bailiffs were put upon me i was taken as i was going out of his house when i wrote to her for money she said she was ill in bed and put me off to another day and when i got home i found her in diamonds and sitting with that villain alone he then went on to describe hurriedly the personal conflict with lord steyne  to an affair of that nature of course he said there was but one issue and after his conference with his brother he was going away to make the necessary arrangements for the meeting which must ensue  and as it may end fatally with me rawdon said with a broken voice and as the boy has no mother i must leave him to you and jane pittonly it will be a comfort to me if you will promise me to be his friend  the elder brother was much affected and shook rawdons hand with a cordiality seldom exhibited by him rawdon passed his hand over his shaggy eyebrows thank you brother said he  i know i can trust your word  i will upon my honour the baronet said  and thus and almost mutely this bargain was struck between them  then rawdon took out of his pocket the little pocketbook which he had discovered in beckys desk and from which he drew a bundle of the notes which it contained heres six hundred he saidyou didnt know i was so rich  i want you to give the money to briggs who lent it to usand who was kind to the boyand ive always felt ashamed of having taken the poor old womans money  and heres some moreive only kept back a few poundswhich becky may as well have to get on with as he spoke he took hold of the other notes to give to his brother but his hands shook and he was so agitated that the pocketbook fell from him and out of it the thousandpound note which had been the last of the unlucky beckys winnings  pitt stooped and picked them up amazed at so much wealth  not that rawdon said  i hope to put a bullet into the man whom that belongs to he had thought to himself it would be a fine revenge to wrap a ball in the note and kill steyne with it  after this colloquy the brothers once more shook hands and parted lady jane had heard of the colonels arrival and was waiting for her husband in the adjoining diningroom with female instinct auguring evil  the door of the diningroom happened to be left open and the lady of course was issuing from it as the two brothers passed out of the study  she held out her hand to rawdon and said she was glad he was come to breakfast though she could perceive by his haggard unshorn face and the dark looks of her husband that there was very little question of breakfast between them  rawdon muttered some excuses about an engagement squeezing hard the timid little hand which his sisterinlaw reached out to him  her imploring eyes could read nothing but calamity in his face but he went away without another word  nor did sir pitt vouchsafe her any explanation the children came up to salute him and he kissed them in his usual frigid manner the mother took both of them close to herself and held a hand of each of them as they knelt down to prayers which sir pitt read to them and to the servants in their sunday suits or liveries ranged upon chairs on the other side of the hissing teaurn breakfast was so late that day in consequence of the delays which had occurred that the churchbells began to ring whilst they were sitting over their meal and lady jane was too ill she said to go to church though her thoughts had been entirely astray during the period of family devotion  rawdon crawley meanwhile hurried on from great gaunt street and knocking at the great bronze medusas head which stands on the portal of gaunt house brought out the purple silenus in a red and silver waistcoat who acts as porter of that palace  the man was scared also by the colonels dishevelled appearance and barred the way as if afraid that the other was going to force it  but colonel crawley only took out a card and enjoined him particularly to send it in to lord steyne and to mark the address written on it and say that colonel crawley would be all day after one oclock at the regent club in st jamess streetnot at home  the fat redfaced man looked after him with astonishment as he strode away so did the people in their sunday clothes who were out so early the charityboys with shining faces the greengrocer lolling at his door and the publican shutting his shutters in the sunshine against service commenced  the people joked at the cabstand about his appearance as he took a carriage there and told the driver to drive him to knightsbridge barracks  all the bells were jangling and tolling as he reached that place he might have seen his old acquaintance amelia on her way from brompton to russell square had he been looking out  troops of schools were on their march to church the shiny pavement and outsides of coaches in the suburbs were thronged with people out upon their sunday pleasure but the colonel was much too busy to take any heed of these phenomena and arriving at knightsbridge speedily made his way up to the room of his old friend and comrade captain macmurdo who crawley found to his satisfaction was in barracks  captain macmurdo a veteran officer and waterloo man greatly liked by his regiment in which want of money alone prevented him from attaining the highest ranks was enjoying the forenoon calmly in bed  he had been at a fast supperparty given the night before by captain the honourable george cinqbars at his house in brompton square to several young men of the regiment and a number of ladies of the corps de ballet and old mac who was at home with people of all ages and ranks and consorted with generals dogfanciers operadancers bruisers and every kind of person in a word was resting himself after the nights labours and not being on duty was in bed  his room was hung round with boxing sporting and dancing pictures presented to him by comrades as they retired from the regiment and married and settled into quiet life  and as he was now nearly fifty years of age twentyfour of which he had passed in the corps he had a singular museum  he was one of the best shots in england and for a heavy man one of the best riders indeed he and crawley had been rivals when the latter was in the army  to be brief mr macmurdo was lying in bed reading in bells life an account of that very fight between the tutbury pet and the barking butcher which has been before mentioneda venerable bristly warrior with a little closeshaved grey head with a silk nightcap a red face and nose and a great dyed moustache  when rawdon told the captain he wanted a friend the latter knew perfectly well on what duty of friendship he was called to act and indeed had conducted scores of affairs for his acquaintances with the greatest prudence and skill  his royal highness the late lamented commanderinchief had had the greatest regard for macmurdo on this account and he was the common refuge of gentlemen in trouble  whats the row about crawley my boy said the old warrior  no more gambling business hay like that when we shot captain marker  its aboutabout my wife crawley answered casting down his eyes and turning very red  the other gave a whistle  i always said shed throw you over he beganindeed there were bets in the regiment and at the clubs regarding the probable fate of colonel crawley so lightly was his wifes character esteemed by his comrades and the world but seeing the savage look with which rawdon answered the expression of this opinion macmurdo did not think fit to enlarge upon it further  is there no way out of it old boy the captain continued in a grave tone  is it only suspicion you know oror what is it any letters cant you keep it quiet best not make any noise about a thing of that sort if you can help it think of his only finding her out now the captain thought to himself and remembered a hundred particular conversations at the messtable in which mrs crawleys reputation had been torn to shreds  theres no way but one out of it rawdon repliedand theres only a way out of it for one of us macdo you understand i was put out of the wayarrestedi found em alone together  i told him he was a liar and a coward and knocked him down and thrashed him  serve him right macmurdo said  who is it  rawdon answered it was lord steyne  the deuce  a marquis  they said hethat is they said you  what the devil do you mean roared out rawdon do you mean that you ever heard a fellow doubt about my wife and didnt tell me mac  the worlds very censorious old boy the other replied  what the deuce was the good of my telling you what any tomfools talked about  it was damned unfriendly mac said rawdon quite overcome and covering his face with his hands he gave way to an emotion the sight of which caused the tough old campaigner opposite him to wince with sympathy hold up old boy he said great man or not well put a bullet in him damn him  as for women theyre all so  you dont know how fond i was of that one rawdon said halfinarticulately  damme i followed her like a footman  i gave up everything i had to her  im a beggar because i would marry her by jove sir ive pawned my own watch in order to get her anything she fancied and she shes been making a purse for herself all the time and grudged me a hundred pound to get me out of quod he then fiercely and incoherently and with an agitation under which his counsellor had never before seen him labour told macmurdo the circumstances of the story  his adviser caught at some stray hints in it she may be innocent after all he said  she says so steyne has been a hundred times alone with her in the house before  it may be so rawdon answered sadly but this dont look very innocent  and he showed the captain the thousandpound note which he had found in beckys pocketbook  this is what he gave her mac and she kep it unknown to me and with this money in the house she refused to stand by me when i was locked up the captain could not but own that the secreting of the money had a very ugly look  whilst they were engaged in their conference rawdon dispatched captain macmurdos servant to curzon street with an order to the domestic there to give up a bag of clothes of which the colonel had great need and during the mans absence and with great labour and a johnsons dictionary which stood them in much stead rawdon and his second composed a letter which the latter was to send to lord steyne captain macmurdo had the honour of waiting upon the marquis of steyne on the part of colonel rawdon crawley and begged to intimate that he was empowered by the colonel to make any arrangements for the meeting which he had no doubt it was his lordships intention to demand and which the circumstances of the morning had rendered inevitable captain macmurdo begged lord steyne in the most polite manner to appoint a friend with whom he captain mm might communicate and desired that the meeting might take place with as little delay as possible  in a postscript the captain stated that he had in his possession a banknote for a large amount which colonel crawley had reason to suppose was the property of the marquis of steyne  and he was anxious on the colonels behalf to give up the note to its owner  by the time this note was composed the captains servant returned from his mission to colonel crawleys house in curzon street but without the carpetbag and portmanteau for which he had been sent and with a very puzzled and odd face  they wont give em up said the man theres a regular shinty in the house and everything at sixes and sevens  the landlords come in and took possession  the servants was a drinkin up in the drawingroom  they saidthey said you had gone off with the plate colonelthe man added after a pauseone of the servants is off already  and simpson the man as was very noisy and drunk indeed says nothing shall go out of the house until his wages is paid up  the account of this little revolution in may fair astonished and gave a little gaiety to an otherwise very triste conversation  the two officers laughed at rawdons discomfiture  im glad the little un isnt at home rawdon said biting his nails you remember him mac dont you in the riding school how he sat the kicker to be sure didnt he  that he did old boy said the goodnatured captain  little rawdon was then sitting one of fifty gown boys in the chapel of whitefriars school thinking not about the sermon but about going home next saturday when his father would certainly tip him and perhaps would take him to the play  hes a regular trump that boy the father went on still musing about his son  i say mac if anything goes wrongif i dropi should like you toto go and see him you know and say that i was very fond of him and that  anddash itold chap give him these gold sleevebuttons  its all ive got he covered his face with his black hands over which the tears rolled and made furrows of white mr macmurdo had also occasion to take off his silk nightcap and rub it across his eyes  go down and order some breakfast he said to his man in a loud cheerful voice  whatll you have crawley some devilled kidneys and a herringlets say  and clay lay out some dressing things for the colonel  we were always pretty much of a size rawdon my boy and neither of us ride so light as we did when we first entered the corps with which and leaving the colonel to dress himself macmurdo turned round towards the wall and resumed the perusal of bells life until such time as his friends toilette was complete and he was at liberty to commence his own  this as he was about to meet a lord captain macmurdo performed with particular care  he waxed his mustachios into a state of brilliant polish and put on a tight cravat and a trim buff waistcoat so that all the young officers in the messroom whither crawley had preceded his friend complimented mac on his appearance at breakfast and asked if he was going to be married that sunday    chapter lv  in which the same subject is pursued  becky did not rally from the state of stupor and confusion in which the events of the previous night had plunged her intrepid spirit until the bells of the curzon street chapels were ringing for afternoon service and rising from her bed she began to ply her own bell in order to summon the french maid who had left her some hours before  mrs rawdon crawley rang many times in vain and though on the last occasion she rang with such vehemence as to pull down the bellrope mademoiselle fifine did not make her appearanceno not though her mistress in a great pet and with the bellrope in her hand came out to the landingplace with her hair over her shoulders and screamed out repeatedly for her attendant  the truth is she had quitted the premises for many hours and upon that permission which is called french leave among us after picking up the trinkets in the drawingroom mademoiselle had ascended to her own apartments packed and corded her own boxes there tripped out and called a cab for herself brought down her trunks with her own hand and without ever so much as asking the aid of any of the other servants who would probably have refused it as they hated her cordially and without wishing any one of them goodbye had made her exit from curzon street  the game in her opinion was over in that little domestic establishment  fifine went off in a cab as we have known more exalted persons of her nation to do under similar circumstances but more provident or lucky than these she secured not only her own property but some of her mistresss if indeed that lady could be said to have any property at alland not only carried off the trinkets before alluded to and some favourite dresses on which she had long kept her eye but four richly gilt louis quatorze candlesticks six gilt albums keepsakes and books of beauty a gold enamelled snuffbox which had once belonged to madame du barri and the sweetest little inkstand and motherofpearl blotting book which becky used when she composed her charming little pink notes had vanished from the premises in curzon street together with mademoiselle fifine and all the silver laid on the table for the little festin which rawdon interrupted  the plated ware mademoiselle left behind her was too cumbrous probably for which reason no doubt she also left the fire irons the chimneyglasses and the rosewood cottage piano  a lady very like her subsequently kept a milliners shop in the rue du helder at paris where she lived with great credit and enjoyed the patronage of my lord steyne  this person always spoke of england as of the most treacherous country in the world and stated to her young pupils that she had been affreusement vole by natives of that island it was no doubt compassion for her misfortunes which induced the marquis of steyne to be so very kind to madame de saintamaranthe  may she flourish as she deservesshe appears no more in our quarter of vanity fair  hearing a buzz and a stir below and indignant at the impudence of those servants who would not answer her summons mrs crawley flung her morning robe round her and descended majestically to the drawingroom whence the noise proceeded  the cook was there with blackened face seated on the beautiful chintz sofa by the side of mrs raggles to whom she was administering maraschino  the page with the sugarloaf buttons who carried about beckys pink notes and jumped about her little carriage with such alacrity was now engaged putting his fingers into a cream dish the footman was talking to raggles who had a face full of perplexity and woeand yet though the door was open and becky had been screaming a halfdozen of times a few feet off not one of her attendants had obeyed her call  have a little drop doee now mrs raggles the cook was saying as becky entered the white cashmere dressinggown flouncing around her  simpson  trotter the mistress of the house cried in great wrath how dare you stay here when you heard me call how dare you sit down in my presence wheres my maid the page withdrew his fingers from his mouth with a momentary terror but the cook took off a glass of maraschino of which mrs raggles had had enough staring at becky over the little gilt glass as she drained its contents the liquor appeared to give the odious rebel courage  your sofy indeed mrs cook said  im a settin on mrs raggless sofy  dont you stir mrs raggles mum im a settin on mr and mrs raggless sofy which they bought with honest money and very dear it cost em too  and im thinkin if i set here until im paid my wages i shall set a precious long time mrs raggles and set i will tooha  ha and with this she filled herself another glass of the liquor and drank it with a more hideously satirical air  trotter  simpson  turn that drunken wretch out screamed mrs crawley  i shawnt said trotter the footman turn out yourself  pay our selleries and turn me out too  well go fast enough  are you all here to insult me cried becky in a fury when colonel crawley comes home ill  at this the servants burst into a horse hawhaw in which however raggles who still kept a most melancholy countenance did not join he aint a coming back mr trotter resumed  he sent for his things and i wouldnt let em go although mr raggles would and i dont blieve hes no more a colonel than i am  hes hoff and i suppose youre a goin after him  youre no better than swindlers both on you  dont be a bullyin me  i wont stand it  pay us our selleries i say  pay us our selleries it was evident from mr trotters flushed countenance and defective intonation that he too had had recourse to vinous stimulus  mr raggles said becky in a passion of vexation you will not surely let me be insulted by that drunken man hold your noise trotter do now said simpson the page  he was affected by his mistresss deplorable situation and succeeded in preventing an outrageous denial of the epithet drunken on the footmans part  oh mam said raggles i never thought to live to see this year day  ive known the crawley family ever since i was born  i lived butler with miss crawley for thirty years and i little thought one of that family was a goin to ruing meyes ruing mesaid the poor fellow with tears in his eyes  har you a goin to pay me youve lived in this ouse four year  youve ad my substance my plate and linning  you ho me a milk and butter bill of two undred pound you must ave noo laid heggs for your homlets and cream for your spanil dog  she didnt care what her own flesh and blood had interposed the cook  manys the time hed have starved but for me  hes a charatyboy now cooky said mr trotter with a drunken ha haand honest raggles continued in a lamentable tone an enumeration of his griefs  all he said was true  becky and her husband had ruined him he had bills coming due next week and no means to meet them  he would be sold up and turned out of his shop and his house because he had trusted to the crawley family  his tears and lamentations made becky more peevish than ever  you all seem to be against me she said bitterly what do you want i cant pay you on sunday  come back tomorrow and ill pay you everything  i thought colonel crawley had settled with you  he will tomorrow i declare to you upon my honour that he left home this morning with fifteen hundred pounds in his pocketbook he has left me nothing  apply to him  give me a bonnet and shawl and let me go out and find him  there was a difference between us this morning  you all seem to know it  i promise you upon my word that you shall all be paid  he has got a good appointment  let me go out and find him  this audacious statement caused raggles and the other personages present to look at one another with a wild surprise and with it rebecca left them  she went upstairs and dressed herself this time without the aid of her french maid  she went into rawdons room and there saw that a trunk and bag were packed ready for removal with a pencil direction that they should be given when called for then she went into the frenchwomans garret everything was clean and all the drawers emptied there she bethought herself of the trinkets which had been left on the ground and felt certain that the woman had fled good heavens  was ever such ill luck as mine she said to be so near and to lose all  is it all too late no there was one chance more  she dressed herself and went away unmolested this time but alone it was four oclock  she went swiftly down the streets she had no money to pay for a carriage and never stopped until she came to sir pitt crawleys door in great gaunt street  where was lady jane crawley she was at church  becky was not sorry sir pitt was in his study and had given orders not to be disturbedshe must see himshe slipped by the sentinel in livery at once and was in sir pitts room before the astonished baronet had even laid down the paper  he turned red and started back from her with a look of great alarm and horror  do not look so she said  i am not guilty pitt dear pitt you were my friend once  before god i am not guilty  i seem so everything is against me  and oh  at such a moment  just when all my hopes were about to be realized  just when happiness was in store for us  is this true what i see in the paper then sir pitt saida paragraph in which had greatly surprised him  it is true  lord steyne told me on friday night the night of that fatal ball  he has been promised an appointment any time these six months  mr martyr the colonial secretary told him yesterday that it was made out that unlucky arrest ensued that horrible meeting i was only guilty of too much devotedness to rawdons service  i have received lord steyne alone a hundred times before i confess i had money of which rawdon knew nothing dont you know how careless he is of it and could i dare to confide it to him and so she went on with a perfectly connected story which she poured into the ears of her perplexed kinsman  it was to the following effect  becky owned and with prefect frankness but deep contrition that having remarked lord steynes partiality for her at the mention of which pitt blushed and being secure of her own virtue she had determined to turn the great peers attachment to the advantage of herself and her family  i looked for a peerage for you pitt she said the brotherinlaw again turned red we have talked about it  your genius and lord steynes interest made it more than probable had not this dreadful calamity come to put an end to all our hopes  but first i own that it was my object to rescue my dear husbandhim whom i love in spite of all his ill usage and suspicions of meto remove him from the poverty and ruin which was impending over us  i saw lord steynes partiality for me she said casting down her eyes  i own that i did everything in my power to make myself pleasing to him and as far as an honest woman may to secure hishis esteem it was only on friday morning that the news arrived of the death of the governor of coventry island and my lord instantly secured the appointment for my dear husband it was intended as a surprise for himhe was to see it in the papers today  even after that horrid arrest took place the expenses of which lord steyne generously said he would settle so that i was in a manner prevented from coming to my husbands assistance my lord was laughing with me and saying that my dearest rawdon would be consoled when he read of his appointment in the paper in that shocking spunbailiffs house and thenthen he came home  his suspicions were excitedthe dreadful scene took place between my lord and my cruel cruel rawdonand o my god what will happen next pitt dear pitt  pity me and reconcile us and as she spoke she flung herself down on her knees and bursting into tears seized hold of pitts hand which she kissed passionately  it was in this very attitude that lady jane who returning from church ran to her husbands room directly she heard mrs rawdon crawley was closeted there found the baronet and his sisterinlaw  i am surprised that woman has the audacity to enter this house lady jane said trembling in every limb and turning quite pale her ladyship had sent out her maid directly after breakfast who had communicated with raggles and rawdon crawleys household who had told her all and a great deal more than they knew of that story and many others besides  how dare mrs crawley to enter the house ofof an honest family  sir pitt started back amazed at his wifes display of vigour becky still kept her kneeling posture and clung to sir pitts hand  tell her that she does not know all  tell her that i am innocent dear pitt she whimpered out  uponmy word my love i think you do mrs crawley injustice sir pitt said at which speech rebecca was vastly relieved  indeed i believe her to be  to be what cried out lady jane her clear voice thrilling and her heart beating violently as she spoke to be a wicked womana heartless mother a false wife she never loved her dear little boy who used to fly here and tell me of her cruelty to him  she never came into a family but she strove to bring misery with her and to weaken the most sacred affections with her wicked flattery and falsehoods  she has deceived her husband as she has deceived everybody her soul is black with vanity worldliness and all sorts of crime  i tremble when i touch her  i keep my children out of her sight  lady jane cried sir pitt starting up this is really language i have been a true and faithful wife to you sir pitt lady jane continued intrepidly i have kept my marriage vow as i made it to god and have been obedient and gentle as a wife should  but righteous obedience has its limits and i declare that i will not bear thatthat woman again under my roof if she enters it i and my children will leave it  she is not worthy to sit down with christian people youyou must choose sir between her and me and with this my lady swept out of the room fluttering with her own audacity and leaving rebecca and sir pitt not a little astonished at it  as for becky she was not hurt nay she was pleased it was the diamondclasp you gave me she said to sir pitt reaching him out her hand and before she left him for which event you may be sure my lady jane was looking out from her dressingroom window in the upper story the baronet had promised to go and seek out his brother and endeavour to bring about a reconciliation  rawdon found some of the young fellows of the regiment seated in the messroom at breakfast and was induced without much difficulty to partake of that meal and of the devilled legs of fowls and sodawater with which these young gentlemen fortified themselves  then they had a conversation befitting the day and their time of life about the next pigeonmatch at battersea with relative bets upon ross and osbaldiston about mademoiselle ariane of the french opera and who had left her and how she was consoled by panther carr and about the fight between the butcher and the pet and the probabilities that it was a cross  young tandyman a hero of seventeen laboriously endeavouring to get up a pair of mustachios had seen the fight and spoke in the most scientific manner about the battle and the condition of the men it was he who had driven the butcher on to the ground in his drag and passed the whole of the previous night with him  had there not been foul play he must have won it  all the old files of the ring were in it and tandyman wouldnt pay no dammy he wouldnt pay  it was but a year since the young cornet now so knowing a hand in cribbs parlour had a still lingering liking for toffy and used to be birched at eton  so they went on talking about dancers fights drinking demireps until macmurdo came down and joined the boys and the conversation he did not appear to think that any especial reverence was due to their boyhood the old fellow cut in with stories to the full as choice as any the youngest rake present had to tellnor did his own grey hairs nor their smooth faces detain him  old mac was famous for his good stories  he was not exactly a ladys man that is men asked him to dine rather at the houses of their mistresses than of their mothers there can scarcely be a life lower perhaps than his but he was quite contented with it such as it was and led it in perfect good nature simplicity and modesty of demeanour  by the time mac had finished a copious breakfast most of the others had concluded their meal  young lord varinas was smoking an immense meerschaum pipe while captain hugues was employed with a cigar that violent little devil tandyman with his little bullterrier between his legs was tossing for shillings with all his might that fellow was always at some game or other against captain deuceace and mac and rawdon walked off to the club neither of course having given any hint of the business which was occupying their minds  both on the other hand had joined pretty gaily in the conversation for why should they interrupt it feasting drinking ribaldry laughter go on alongside of all sorts of other occupations in vanity fairthe crowds were pouring out of church as rawdon and his friend passed down st jamess street and entered into their club  the old bucks and habitues who ordinarily stand gaping and grinning out of the great front window of the club had not arrived at their posts as yetthe newspaperroom was almost empty  one man was present whom rawdon did not know another to whom he owed a little score for whist and whom in consequence he did not care to meet a third was reading the royalist a periodical famous for its scandal and its attachment to church and king sunday paper at the table and looking up at crawley with some interest said crawley i congratulate you  what do you mean said the colonel  its in the observer and the royalist too said mr smith  what rawdon cried turning very red  he thought that the affair with lord steyne was already in the public prints  smith looked up wondering and smiling at the agitation which the colonel exhibited as he took up the paper and trembling began to read  mr smith and mr brown the gentleman with whom rawdon had the outstanding whist account had been talking about the colonel just before he came in  it is come just in the nick of time said smith  i suppose crawley had not a shilling in the world  its a wind that blows everybody good mr brown said  he cant go away without paying me a pony he owes me  whats the salary asked smith  two or three thousand answered the other  but the climates so infernal they dont enjoy it long liverseege died after eighteen months of it and the man before went off in six weeks i hear  some people say his brother is a very clever man  i always found him a d bore smith ejaculated  he must have good interest though he must have got the colonel the place  he said brown with a sneer  pooh  it was lord steyne got it  how do you mean  a virtuous woman is a crown to her husband answered the other enigmatically and went to read his papers  rawdon for his part read in the royalist the following astonishing paragraph  governorship of coventry islandhms yellowjack commander jaunders has brought letters and papers from coventry island  h e sir thomas liverseege had fallen a victim to the prevailing fever at swampton  his loss is deeply felt in the flourishing colony  we hear that the governorship has been offered to colonel rawdon crawley cb a distinguished waterloo officer  we need not only men of acknowledged bravery but men of administrative talents to superintend the affairs of our colonies and we have no doubt that the gentleman selected by the colonial office to fill the lamented vacancy which has occurred at coventry island is admirably calculated for the post which he is about to occupy   coventry island  where was it who had appointed him to the government you must take me out as your secretary old boy captain macmurdo said laughing and as crawley and his friend sat wondering and perplexed over the announcement the club waiter brought in to the colonel a card on which the name of mr wenham was engraved who begged to see colonel crawley  the colonel and his aidedecamp went out to meet the gentleman rightly conjecturing that he was an emissary of lord steyne  how dye do crawley i am glad to see you said mr wenham with a bland smile and grasping crawleys hand with great cordiality  you come i suppose from  exactly said mr wenham  then this is my friend captain macmurdo of the life guards green  delighted to know captain macmurdo im sure mr wenham said and tendered another smile and shake of the hand to the second as he had done to the principal mac put out one finger armed with a buckskin glove and made a very frigid bow to mr wenham over his tight cravat he was perhaps discontented at being put in communication with a pekin and thought that lord steyne should have sent him a colonel at the very least  as macmurdo acts for me and knows what i mean crawley said i had better retire and leave you together  of course said macmurdo  by no means my dear colonel mr wenham said the interview which i had the honour of requesting was with you personally though the company of captain macmurdo cannot fail to be also most pleasing  in fact captain i hope that our conversation will lead to none but the most agreeable results very different from those which my friend colonel crawley appears to anticipate  humph said captain macmurdo  be hanged to these civilians he thought to himself they are always for arranging and speechifying mr wenham took a chair which was not offered to himtook a paper from his pocket and resumed  you have seen this gratifying announcement in the papers this morning colonel government has secured a most valuable servant and you if you accept office as i presume you will an excellent appointment three thousand a year delightful climate excellent governmenthouse all your own way in the colony and a certain promotion  i congratulate you with all my heart  i presume you know gentlemen to whom my friend is indebted for this piece of patronage  hanged if i know the captain said his principal turned very red  to one of the most generous and kindest men in the world as he is one of the greatestto my excellent friend the marquis of steyne  ill see him d before i take his place growled out rawdon  you are irritated against my noble friend mr wenham calmly resumed and now in the name of common sense and justice tell me why  why cried rawdon in surprise  why dammy said the captain ringing his stick on the ground  dammy indeed said mr wenham with the most agreeable smile still look at the matter as a man of the worldas an honest manand see if you have not been in the wrong  you come home from a journey and findwhatmy lord steyne supping at your house in curzon street with mrs crawley  is the circumstance strange or novel has he not been a hundred times before in the same position upon my honour and word as a gentlemanmr wenham here put his hand on his waistcoat with a parliamentary airi declare i think that your suspicions are monstrous and utterly unfounded and that they injure an honourable gentleman who has proved his goodwill towards you by a thousand benefactionsand a most spotless and innocent lady  you dont mean to say thatthat crawleys mistaken said mr macmurdo  i believe that mrs crawley is as innocent as my wife mrs wenham mr wenham said with great energy  i believe that misled by an infernal jealousy my friend here strikes a blow against not only an infirm and old man of high station his constant friend and benefactor but against his wife his own dearest honour his sons future reputation and his own prospects in life  i will tell you what happened mr wenham continued with great solemnity i was sent for this morning by my lord steyne and found him in a pitiable state as i need hardly inform colonel crawley any man of age and infirmity would be after a personal conflict with a man of your strength  i say to your face it was a cruel advantage you took of that strength colonel crawley  it was not only the body of my noble and excellent friend which was woundedhis heart sir was bleeding  a man whom he had loaded with benefits and regarded with affection had subjected him to the foulest indignity  what was this very appointment which appears in the journals of today but a proof of his kindness to you when i saw his lordship this morning i found him in a state pitiable indeed to see and as anxious as you are to revenge the outrage committed upon him by blood  you know he has given his proofs i presume colonel crawley  he has plenty of pluck said the colonel  nobody ever said he hadnt  his first order to me was to write a letter of challenge and to carry it to colonel crawley  one or other of us he said must not survive the outrage of last night  crawley nodded  youre coming to the point wenham he said  i tried my utmost to calm lord steyne  good god sir i said how i regret that mrs wenham and myself had not accepted mrs crawleys invitation to sup with her  she asked you to sup with her captain macmurdo said  after the opera  heres the note of invitationstopno this is another paperi thought i had h but its of no consequence and i pledge you my word to the fact  if we had comeand it was only one of mrs wenhams headaches which prevented usshe suffers under them a good deal especially in the springif we had come and you had returned home there would have been no quarrel no insult no suspicionand so it is positively because my poor wife has a headache that you are to bring death down upon two men of honour and plunge two of the most excellent and ancient families in the kingdom into disgrace and sorrow  mr macmurdo looked at his principal with the air of a man profoundly puzzled and rawdon felt with a kind of rage that his prey was escaping him  he did not believe a word of the story and yet how discredit or disprove it  mr wenham continued with the same fluent oratory which in his place in parliament he had so often practisedi sat for an hour or more by lord steynes bedside beseeching imploring lord steyne to forego his intention of demanding a meeting  i pointed out to him that the circumstances were after all suspiciousthey were suspicious  i acknowledge itany man in your position might have been taken ini said that a man furious with jealousy is to all intents and purposes a madman and should be as such regardedthat a duel between you must lead to the disgrace of all parties concernedthat a man of his lordships exalted station had no right in these days when the most atrocious revolutionary principles and the most dangerous levelling doctrines are preached among the vulgar to create a public scandal and that however innocent the common people would insist that he was guilty  in fine i implored him not to send the challenge  i dont believe one word of the whole story said rawdon grinding his teeth  i believe it a d lie and that youre in it mr wenham  if the challenge dont come from him by jove it shall come from me  mr wenham turned deadly pale at this savage interruption of the colonel and looked towards the door  but he found a champion in captain macmurdo  that gentleman rose up with an oath and rebuked rawdon for his language  you put the affair into my hands and you shall act as i think fit by jove and not as you do you have no right to insult mr wenham with this sort of language and dammy mr wenham you deserve an apology  and as for a challenge to lord steyne you may get somebody else to carry it i wont  if my lord after being thrashed chooses to sit still dammy let him and as for the affair withwith mrs crawley my belief is theres nothing proved at all  that your wifes innocent as innocent as mr wenham says she is and at any rate that you would be a dfool not to take the place and hold your tongue  captain macmurdo you speak like a man of sense mr wenham cried out immensely relievedi forget any words that colonel crawley has used in the irritation of the moment  i thought you would rawdon said with a sneer  shut your mouth you old stoopid the captain said goodnaturedly mr wenham aint a fighting man and quite right too  this matter in my belief the steyne emissary cried ought to be buried in the most profound oblivion  a word concerning it should never pass these doors  i speak in the interest of my friend as well as of colonel crawley who persists in considering me his enemy  i suppose lord steyne wont talk about it very much said captain macmurdo and i dont see why our side should  the affair aint a very pretty one any way you take it and the less said about it the better its you are thrashed and not us and if you are satisfied why i think we should be  mr wenham took his hat upon this and captain macmurdo following him to the door shut it upon himself and lord steynes agent leaving rawdon chafing within  when the two were on the other side macmurdo looked hard at the other ambassador and with an expression of anything but respect on his round jolly face  you dont stick at a trifle mr wenham he said  you flatter me captain macmurdo answered the other with a smile upon my honour and conscience now mrs crawley did ask us to sup after the opera  of course and mrs wenham had one of her headaches  i say ive got a thousandpound note here which i will give you if you will give me a receipt please and i will put the note up in an envelope for lord steyne my man shant fight him  but we had rather not take his money  it was all a mistakeall a mistake my dear sir the other said with the utmost innocence of manner and was bowed down the club steps by captain macmurdo just as sir pitt crawley ascended them there was a slight acquaintance between these two gentlemen and the captain going back with the baronet to the room where the latters brother was told sir pitt in confidence that he had made the affair all right between lord steyne and the colonel  sir pitt was well pleased of course at this intelligence and congratulated his brother warmly upon the peaceful issue of the affair making appropriate moral remarks upon the evils of duelling and the unsatisfactory nature of that sort of settlement of disputes  and after this preface he tried with all his eloquence to effect a reconciliation between rawdon and his wife he recapitulated the statements which becky had made pointed out the probabilities of their truth and asserted his own firm belief in her innocence  but rawdon would not hear of it  she has kep money concealed from me these ten years he said she swore last night only she had none from steyne  she knew it was all up directly i found it  if shes not guilty pitt shes as bad as guilty and ill never see her againnever his head sank down on his chest as he spoke the words and he looked quite broken and sad  poor old boy macmurdo said shaking his head  rawdon crawley resisted for some time the idea of taking the place which had been procured for him by so odious a patron and was also for removing the boy from the school where lord steynes interest had placed him  he was induced however to acquiesce in these benefits by the entreaties of his brother and macmurdo but mainly by the latter pointing out to him what a fury steyne would be in to think that his enemys fortune was made through his means  when the marquis of steyne came abroad after his accident the colonial secretary bowed up to him and congratulated himself and the service upon having made so excellent an appointment  these congratulations were received with a degree of gratitude which may be imagined on the part of lord steyne  the secret of the rencontre between him and colonel crawley was buried in the profoundest oblivion as wenham said that is by the seconds and the principals but before that evening was over it was talked of at fifty dinnertables in vanity fair  little cackleby himself went to seven evening parties and told the story with comments and emendations at each place  how mrs washington white revelled in it  the bishopess of ealing was shocked beyond expression the bishop went and wrote his name down in the visitingbook at gaunt house that very day little southdown was sorry so you may be sure was his sister lady jane very sorry  lady southdown wrote it off to her other daughter at the cape of good hope  it was towntalk for at least three days and was only kept out of the newspapers by the exertions of mr wagg acting upon a hint from mr wenham  the bailiffs and brokers seized upon poor raggles in curzon street and the late fair tenant of that poor little mansion was in the meanwhilewhere who cared  who asked after a day or two was she guilty or not we all know how charitable the world is and how the verdict of vanity fair goes when there is a doubt  some people said she had gone to naples in pursuit of lord steyne whilst others averred that his lordship quitted that city and fled to palermo on hearing of beckys arrival some said she was living in bierstadt and had become a dame dhonneur to the queen of bulgaria some that she was at boulogne and others at a boardinghouse at cheltenham  rawdon made her a tolerable annuity and we may be sure that she was a woman who could make a little money go a great way as the saying is he would have paid his debts on leaving england could he have got any insurance office to take his life but the climate of coventry island was so bad that he could borrow no money on the strength of his salary he remitted however to his brother punctually and wrote to his little boy regularly every mail  he kept macmurdo in cigars and sent over quantities of shells cayenne pepper hot pickles guava jelly and colonial produce to lady jane he sent his brother home the swamp town gazette in which the new governor was praised with immense enthusiasm whereas the swamp town sentinel whose wife was not asked to government house declared that his excellency was a tyrant compared to whom nero was an enlightened philanthropist  little rawdon used to like to get the papers and read about his excellency  his mother never made any movement to see the child he went home to his aunt for sundays and holidays he soon knew every birds nest about queens crawley and rode out with sir huddlestones hounds which he admired so on his first wellremembered visit to hampshire    chapter lvi  georgy is made a gentleman  georgy osborne was now fairly established in his grandfathers mansion in russell square occupant of his fathers room in the house and heir apparent of all the splendours there  the good looks gallant bearing and gentlemanlike appearance of the boy won the grandsires heart for him  mr osborne was as proud of him as ever he had been of the elder george  the child had many more luxuries and indulgences than had been awarded his father  osbornes commerce had prospered greatly of late years his wealth and importance in the city had very much increased  he had been glad enough in former days to put the elder george to a good private school and a commission in the army for his son had been a source of no small pride to him for little george and his future prospects the old man looked much higher  he would make a gentleman of the little chap was mr osbornes constant saying regarding little georgy  he saw him in his minds eye a collegian a parliament man a baronet perhaps  the old man thought he would die contented if he could see his grandson in a fair way to such honours  he would have none but a tiptop college man to educate himnone of your quacks and pretendersno no  a few years before he used to be savage and inveigh against all parsons scholars and the like declaring that they were a pack of humbugs and quacks that werent fit to get their living but by grinding latin and greek and a set of supercilious dogs that pretended to look down upon british merchants and gentlemen who could buy up half a hundred of em  he would mourn now in a very solemn manner that his own education had been neglected and repeatedly point out in pompous orations to georgy the necessity and excellence of classical acquirements  when they met at dinner the grandsire used to ask the lad what he had been reading during the day and was greatly interested at the report the boy gave of his own studies pretending to understand little george when he spoke regarding them  he made a hundred blunders and showed his ignorance many a time  it did not increase the respect which the child had for his senior a quick brain and a better education elsewhere showed the boy very soon that his grandsire was a dullard and he began accordingly to command him and to look down upon him for his previous education humble and contracted as it had been had made a much better gentleman of georgy than any plans of his grandfather could make him  he had been brought up by a kind weak and tender woman who had no pride about anything but about him and whose heart was so pure and whose bearing was so meek and humble that she could not but needs be a true lady  she busied herself in gentle offices and quiet duties if she never said brilliant things she never spoke or thought unkind ones guileless and artless loving and pure indeed how could our poor little amelia be other than a real gentlewoman  young georgy lorded over this soft and yielding nature and the contrast of its simplicity and delicacy with the coarse pomposity of the dull old man with whom he next came in contact made him lord over the latter too  if he had been a prince royal he could not have been better brought up to think well of himself  whilst his mother was yearning after him at home and i do believe every hour of the day and during most hours of the sad lonely nights thinking of him this young gentleman had a number of pleasures and consolations administered to him which made him for his part bear the separation from amelia very easily  little boys who cry when they are going to school cry because they are going to a very uncomfortable place  it is only a few who weep from sheer affection  when you think that the eyes of your childhood dried at the sight of a piece of gingerbread and that a plum cake was a compensation for the agony of parting with your mamma and sisters oh my friend and brother you need not be too confident of your own fine feelings  well then master george osborne had every comfort and luxury that a wealthy and lavish old grandfather thought fit to provide  the coachman was instructed to purchase for him the handsomest pony which could be bought for money and on this george was taught to ride first at a ridingschool whence after having performed satisfactorily without stirrups and over the leapingbar he was conducted through the new road to regents park and then to hyde park where he rode in state with martin the coachman behind him old osborne who took matters more easily in the city now where he left his affairs to his junior partners would often ride out with miss o  in the same fashionable direction as little georgy came cantering up with his dandified air and his heels down his grandfather would nudge the lads aunt and say look miss o and he would laugh and his face would grow red with pleasure as he nodded out of the window to the boy as the groom saluted the carriage and the footman saluted master george here too his aunt mrs frederick bullock whose chariot might daily be seen in the ring with bullocks or emblazoned on the panels and harness and three pastyfaced little bullocks covered with cockades and feathers staring from the windows mrs frederick bullock i say flung glances of the bitterest hatred at the little upstart as he rode by with his hand on his side and his hat on one ear as proud as a lord  though he was scarcely eleven years of age master george wore straps and the most beautiful little boots like a man  he had gilt spurs and a goldheaded whip and a fine pin in his handkerchief and the neatest little kid gloves which lambs conduit street could furnish his mother had given him a couple of neckcloths and carefully hemmed and made some little shirts for him but when her eli came to see the widow they were replaced by much finer linen he had little jewelled buttons in the lawn shirt fronts  her humble presents had been put asidei believe miss osborne had given them to the coachmans boy  amelia tried to think she was pleased at the change  indeed she was happy and charmed to see the boy looking so beautiful  she had had a little black profile of him done for a shilling and this was hung up by the side of another portrait over her bed  one day the boy came on his accustomed visit galloping down the little street at brompton and bringing as usual all the inhabitants to the windows to admire his splendour and with great eagerness and a look of triumph in his face he pulled a case out of his greatcoatit was a natty white greatcoat with a cape and a velvet collarpulled out a red morocco case which he gave her  i bought it with my own money mamma he said i thought youd like it  amelia opened the case and giving a little cry of delighted affection seized the boy and embraced him a hundred times  it was a miniatureof himself very prettily done though not half handsome enough we may be sure the widow thought  his grandfather had wished to have a picture of him by an artist whose works exhibited in a shopwindow in southampton row had caught the old gentlemans eye and george who had plenty of money bethought him of asking the painter how much a copy of the little portrait would cost saying that he would pay for it out of his own money and that he wanted to give it to his mother  the pleased painter executed it for a small price and old osborne himself when he heard of the incident growled out his satisfaction and gave the boy twice as many sovereigns as he paid for the miniature  but what was the grandfathers pleasure compared to amelias ecstacy that proof of the boys affection charmed her so that she thought no child in the world was like hers for goodness  for long weeks after the thought of his love made her happy  she slept better with the picture under her pillow and how many many times did she kiss it and weep and pray over it  a small kindness from those she loved made that timid heart grateful  since her parting with george she had had no such joy and consolation  at his new home master george ruled like a lord at dinner he invited the ladies to drink wine with the utmost coolness and took off his champagne in a way which charmed his old grandfather  look at him the old man would say nudging his neighbour with a delighted purple face did you ever see such a chap lord lord hell be ordering a dressingcase next and razors to shave with im blessed if he wont  the antics of the lad did not however delight mr osbornes friends so much as they pleased the old gentleman  it gave mr justice coffin no pleasure to hear georgy cut into the conversation and spoil his stories colonel fogey was not interested in seeing the little boy half tipsy  mr sergeant toffys lady felt no particular gratitude when with a twist of his elbow he tilted a glass of portwine over her yellow satin and laughed at the disaster nor was she better pleased although old osborne was highly delighted when georgy whopped her third boy a young gentleman a year older than georgy and by chance home for the holidays from dr tickleuss at ealing school in russell square georges grandfather gave the boy a couple of sovereigns for that feat and promised to reward him further for every boy above his own size and age whom he whopped in a similar manner  it is difficult to say what good the old man saw in these combats he had a vague notion that quarrelling made boys hardy and that tyranny was a useful accomplishment for them to learn  english youth have been so educated time out of mind and we have hundreds of thousands of apologists and admirers of injustice misery and brutality as perpetrated among children  flushed with praise and victory over master toffy george wished naturally to pursue his conquests further and one day as he was strutting about in prodigiously dandified new clothes near st pancras and a young bakers boy made sarcastic comments upon his appearance the youthful patrician pulled off his dandy jacket with great spirit and giving it in charge to the friend who accompanied him master todd of great coram street russell square son of the junior partner of the house of osborne and co george tried to whop the little baker  but the chances of war were unfavourable this time and the little baker whopped georgy who came home with a rueful black eye and all his fine shirt frill dabbled with the claret drawn from his own little nose  he told his grandfather that he had been in combat with a giant and frightened his poor mother at brompton with long and by no means authentic accounts of the battle  this young todd of coram street russell square was master georges great friend and admirer  they both had a taste for painting theatrical characters for hardbake and raspberry tarts for sliding and skating in the regents park and the serpentine when the weather permitted for going to the play whither they were often conducted by mr osbornes orders by rowson master georges appointed bodyservant with whom they sat in great comfort in the pit  in the company of this gentleman they visited all the principal theatres of the metropolis knew the names of all the actors from drury lane to sadlers wells and performed indeed many of the plays to the todd family and their youthful friends with wests famous characters on their pasteboard theatre  rowson the footman who was of a generous disposition would not unfrequently when in cash treat his young master to oysters after the play and to a glass of rumshrub for a nightcap we may be pretty certain that mr rowson profited in his turn by his young masters liberality and gratitude for the pleasures to which the footman inducted him  a famous tailor from the west end of the townmr osborne would have none of your city or holborn bunglers he said for the boy though a city tailor was good enough for himwas summoned to ornament little georges person and was told to spare no expense in so doing  so mr woolsey of conduit street gave a loose to his imagination and sent the child home fancy trousers fancy waistcoats and fancy jackets enough to furnish a school of little dandies  georgy had little white waistcoats for evening parties and little cut velvet waistcoats for dinners and a dear little darling shawl dressinggown for all the world like a little man he dressed for dinner every day like a regular west end swell as his grandfather remarked one of the domestics was affected to his special service attended him at his toilette answered his bell and brought him his letters always on a silver tray  georgy after breakfast would sit in the armchair in the diningroom and read the morning post just like a grownup man  how he du dam and swear the servants would cry delighted at his precocity  those who remembered the captain his father declared master george was his pa every inch of him  he made the house lively by his activity his imperiousness his scolding and his goodnature  georges education was confided to a neighbouring scholar and private pedagogue who prepared young noblemen and gentlemen for the universities the senate and the learned professions  whose system did not embrace the degrading corporal severities still practised at the ancient places of education and in whose family the pupils would find the elegances of refined society and the confidence and affection of a home it was in this way that the reverend lawrence veal of hart street bloomsbury and domestic chaplain to the earl of bareacres strove with mrs veal his wife to entice pupils  by thus advertising and pushing sedulously the domestic chaplain and his lady generally succeeded in having one or two scholars by themwho paid a high figure and were thought to be in uncommonly comfortable quarters  there was a large west indian whom nobody came to see with a mahogany complexion a woolly head and an exceedingly dandyfied appearance there was another hulking boy of threeandtwenty whose education had been neglected and whom mr and mrs veal were to introduce into the polite world there were two sons of colonel bangles of the east india companys service  these four sat down to dinner at mrs veals genteel board when georgy was introduced to her establishment  georgy was like some dozen other pupils only a day boy he arrived in the morning under the guardianship of his friend mr rowson and if it was fine would ride away in the afternoon on his pony followed by the groom  the wealth of his grandfather was reported in the school to be prodigious  the rev mr veal used to compliment georgy upon it personally warning him that he was destined for a high station that it became him to prepare by sedulity and docility in youth for the lofty duties to which he would be called in mature age that obedience in the child was the best preparation for command in the man and that he therefore begged george would not bring toffee into the school and ruin the health of the masters bangles who had everything they wanted at the elegant and abundant table of mrs veal  with respect to learning the curriculum as mr veal loved to call it was of prodigious extent and the young gentlemen in hart street might learn a something of every known science  the rev mr veal had an orrery an electrifying machine a turning lathe a theatre in the washhouse a chemical apparatus and what he called a select library of all the works of the best authors of ancient and modern times and languages he took the boys to the british museum and descanted upon the antiquities and the specimens of natural history there so that audiences would gather round him as he spoke and all bloomsbury highly admired him as a prodigiously wellinformed man  and whenever he spoke which he did almost always he took care to produce the very finest and longest words of which the vocabulary gave him the use rightly judging that it was as cheap to employ a handsome large and sonorous epithet as to use a little stingy one  thus he would say to george in school i observed on my return home from taking the indulgence of an evenings scientific conversation with my excellent friend doctor buldersa true archaeologian gentlemen a true archaeologianthat the windows of your venerated grandfathers almost princely mansion in russell square were illuminated as if for the purposes of festivity  am i right in my conjecture that mr osborne entertained a society of chosen spirits round his sumptuous board last night  little georgy who had considerable humour and used to mimic mr veal to his face with great spirit and dexterity would reply that mr v was quite correct in his surmise  then those friends who had the honour of partaking of mr osbornes hospitality gentlemen had no reason i will lay any wager to complain of their repast  i myself have been more than once so favoured  by the way master osborne you came a little late this morning and have been a defaulter in this respect more than once i myself i say gentlemen humble as i am have been found not unworthy to share mr osbornes elegant hospitality  and though i have feasted with the great and noble of the worldfor i presume that i may call my excellent friend and patron the right honourable george earl of bareacres one of the numberyet i assure you that the board of the british merchant was to the full as richly served and his reception as gratifying and noble  mr bluck sir we will resume if you please that passage of eutropis which was interrupted by the late arrival of master osborne  to this great man georges education was for some time entrusted amelia was bewildered by his phrases but thought him a prodigy of learning  that poor widow made friends of mrs veal for reasons of her own  she liked to be in the house and see georgy coming to school there  she liked to be asked to mrs veals conversazioni which took place once a month as you were informed on pink cards with aohnh engraved on them and where the professor welcomed his pupils and their friends to weak tea and scientific conversation poor little amelia never missed one of these entertainments and thought them delicious so long as she might have georgy sitting by her and she would walk from brompton in any weather and embrace mrs veal with tearful gratitude for the delightful evening she had passed when the company having retired and georgy gone off with mr rowson his attendant poor mrs osborne put on her cloaks and her shawls preparatory to walking home  as for the learning which georgy imbibed under this valuable master of a hundred sciences to judge from the weekly reports which the lad took home to his grandfather his progress was remarkable  the names of a score or more of desirable branches of knowledge were printed in a table and the pupils progress in each was marked by the professor in greek georgy was pronounced aristos in latin optimus in french tres bien and so forth and everybody had prizes for everything at the end of the year  even mr swartz the woolyheaded young gentleman and halfbrother to the honourable mrs mac mull and mr bluck the neglected young pupil of threeandtwenty from the agricultural district and that idle young scapegrace of a master todd before mentioned received little eighteenpenny books with athene engraved on them and a pompous latin inscription from the professor to his young friends  the family of this master todd were hangerson of the house of osborne the old gentleman had advanced todd from being a clerk to be a junior partner in his establishment  mr osborne was the godfather of young master todd who in subsequent life wrote mr osborne todd on his cards and became a man of decided fashion while miss osborne had accompanied miss maria todd to the font and gave her protegee a prayerbook a collection of tracts a volume of very low church poetry or some such memento of her goodness every year  miss o  drove the todds out in her carriage now and then when they were ill her footman in large plush smalls and waistcoat brought jellies and delicacies from russell square to coram street coram street trembled and looked up to russell square indeed and mrs todd who had a pretty hand at cutting out paper trimmings for haunches of mutton and could make flowers ducks c out of turnips and carrots in a very creditable manner would go to the square as it was called and assist in the preparations incident to a great dinner without even so much as thinking of sitting down to the banquet  if any guest failed at the eleventh hour todd was asked to dine  mrs todd and maria came across in the evening slipped in with a muffled knock and were in the drawingroom by the time miss osborne and the ladies under her convoy reached that apartmentand ready to fire off duets and sing until the gentlemen came up  poor maria todd poor young lady  how she had to work and thrum at these duets and sonatas in the street before they appeared in public in the square  thus it seemed to be decreed by fate that georgy was to domineer over everybody with whom he came in contact and that friends relatives and domestics were all to bow the knee before the little fellow  it must be owned that he accommodated himself very willingly to this arrangement  most people do so  and georgy liked to play the part of master and perhaps had a natural aptitude for it  in russell square everybody was afraid of mr osborne and mr osborne was afraid of georgy  the boys dashing manners and offhand rattle about books and learning his likeness to his father dead unreconciled in brussels yonder awed the old gentleman and gave the young boy the mastery  the old man would start at some hereditary feature or tone unconsciously used by the little lad and fancy that georges father was again before him  he tried by indulgence to the grandson to make up for harshness to the elder george  people were surprised at his gentleness to the boy  he growled and swore at miss osborne as usual and would smile when george came down late for breakfast  miss osborne georges aunt was a faded old spinster broken down by more than forty years of dulness and coarse usage  it was easy for a lad of spirit to master her and whenever george wanted anything from her from the jampots in her cupboards to the cracked and dry old colours in her paintbox the old paintbox which she had had when she was a pupil of mr smee and was still almost young and blooming georgy took possession of the object of his desire which obtained he took no further notice of his aunt  for his friends and cronies he had a pompous old schoolmaster who flattered him and a toady his senior whom he could thrash  it was dear mrs todds delight to leave him with her youngest daughter rosa jemima a darling child of eight years old  the little pair looked so well together she would say but not to the folks in the square we may be sure who knows what might happen dont they make a pretty little couple the fond mother thought  the brokenspirited old maternal grandfather was likewise subject to the little tyrant  he could not help respecting a lad who had such fine clothes and rode with a groom behind him  georgy on his side was in the constant habit of hearing coarse abuse and vulgar satire levelled at john sedley by his pitiless old enemy mr osborne osborne used to call the other the old pauper the old coalman the old bankrupt and by many other such names of brutal contumely  how was little george to respect a man so prostrate a few months after he was with his paternal grandfather mrs sedley died there had been little love between her and the child he did not care to show much grief  he came down to visit his mother in a fine new suit of mourning and was very angry that he could not go to a play upon which he had set his heart  the illness of that old lady had been the occupation and perhaps the safeguard of amelia  what do men know about womens martyrdoms we should go mad had we to endure the hundredth part of those daily pains which are meekly borne by many women  ceaseless slavery meeting with no reward constant gentleness and kindness met by cruelty as constant love labour patience watchfulness without even so much as the acknowledgement of a good word all this how many of them have to bear in quiet and appear abroad with cheerful faces as if they felt nothing  tender slaves that they are they must needs be hypocrites and weak  from her chair amelias mother had taken to her bed which she had never left and from which mrs osborne herself was never absent except when she ran to see george  the old lady grudged her even those rare visits she who had been a kind smiling goodnatured mother once in the days of her prosperity but whom poverty and infirmities had broken down  her illness or estrangement did not affect amelia  they rather enabled her to support the other calamity under which she was suffering and from the thoughts of which she was kept by the ceaseless calls of the invalid  amelia bore her harshness quite gently smoothed the uneasy pillow was always ready with a soft answer to the watchful querulous voice soothed the sufferer with words of hope such as her pious simple heart could best feel and utter and closed the eyes that had once looked so tenderly upon her  then all her time and tenderness were devoted to the consolation and comfort of the bereaved old father who was stunned by the blow which had befallen him and stood utterly alone in the world  his wife his honour his fortune everything he loved best had fallen away from him there was only amelia to stand by and support with her gentle arms the tottering heartbroken old man we are not going to write the history it would be too dreary and stupid  i can see vanity fair yawning over it davance  one day as the young gentlemen were assembled in the study at the rev mr veals and the domestic chaplain to the right honourable the earl of bareacres was spouting away as usual a smart carriage drove up to the door decorated with the statue of athene and two gentlemen stepped out  the young masters bangles rushed to the window with a vague notion that their father might have arrived from bombay  the great hulking scholar of threeandtwenty who was crying secretly over a passage of eutropius flattened his neglected nose against the panes and looked at the drag as the laquais de place sprang from the box and let out the persons in the carriage  its a fat one and a thin one mr bluck said as a thundering knock came to the door  everybody was interested from the domestic chaplain himself who hoped he saw the fathers of some future pupils down to master georgy glad of any pretext for laying his book down  the boy in the shabby livery with the faded copper buttons who always thrust himself into the tight coat to open the door came into the study and said two gentlemen want to see master osborne the professor had had a trifling altercation in the morning with that young gentleman owing to a difference about the introduction of crackers in schooltime but his face resumed its habitual expression of bland courtesy as he said master osborne i give you full permission to go and see your carriage friendsto whom i beg you to convey the respectful compliments of myself and mrs veal  georgy went into the receptionroom and saw two strangers whom he looked at with his head up in his usual haughty manner  one was fat with mustachios and the other was lean and long in a blue frockcoat with a brown face and a grizzled head  my god how like he is said the long gentleman with a start can you guess who we are george  the boys face flushed up as it did usually when he was moved and his eyes brightened  i dont know the other he said but i should think you must be major dobbin  indeed it was our old friend  his voice trembled with pleasure as he greeted the boy and taking both the others hands in his own drew the lad to him  your mother has talked to you about mehas she he said  that she has georgy answered hundreds and hundreds of times    chapter lvii  eothen  it was one of the many causes for personal pride with which old osborne chose to recreate himself that sedley his ancient rival enemy and benefactor was in his last days so utterly defeated and humiliated as to be forced to accept pecuniary obligations at the hands of the man who had most injured and insulted him  the successful man of the world cursed the old pauper and relieved him from time to time  as he furnished george with money for his mother he gave the boy to understand by hints delivered in his brutal coarse way that georges maternal grandfather was but a wretched old bankrupt and dependant and that john sedley might thank the man to whom he already owed ever so much money for the aid which his generosity now chose to administer george carried the pompous supplies to his mother and the shattered old widower whom it was now the main business of her life to tend and comfort  the little fellow patronized the feeble and disappointed old man  it may have shown a want of proper pride in amelia that she chose to accept these money benefits at the hands of her fathers enemy but proper pride and this poor lady had never had much acquaintance together a disposition naturally simple and demanding protection a long course of poverty and humility of daily privations and hard words of kind offices and no returns had been her lot ever since womanhood almost or since her luckless marriage with george osborne you who see your betters bearing up under this shame every day meekly suffering under the slights of fortune gentle and unpitied poor and rather despised for their poverty do you ever step down from your prosperity and wash the feet of these poor wearied beggars the very thought of them is odious and low  there must be classesthere must be rich and poor dives says smacking his claret it is well if he even sends the broken meat out to lazarus sitting under the window very true but think how mysterious and often unaccountable it isthat lottery of life which gives to this man the purple and fine linen and sends to the other rags for garments and dogs for comforters  so i must own that without much repining on the contrary with something akin to gratitude amelia took the crumbs that her fatherinlaw let drop now and then and with them fed her own parent directly she understood it to be her duty it was this young womans nature ladies she is but thirty still and we choose to call her a young woman even at that age it was i say her nature to sacrifice herself and to fling all that she had at the feet of the beloved object  during what long thankless nights had she worked out her fingers for little georgy whilst at home with her what buffets scorns privations poverties had she endured for father and mother and in the midst of all these solitary resignations and unseen sacrifices she did not respect herself any more than the world respected her but i believe thought in her heart that she was a poorspirited despicable little creature whose luck in life was only too good for her merits  o you poor women  o you poor secret martyrs and victims whose life is a torture who are stretched on racks in your bedrooms and who lay your heads down on the block daily at the drawingroom table every man who watches your pains or peers into those dark places where the torture is administered to you must pity youandand thank god that he has a beard  i recollect seeing years ago at the prisons for idiots and madmen at bicetre near paris a poor wretch bent down under the bondage of his imprisonment and his personal infirmity to whom one of our party gave a halfpenny worth of snuff in a cornet or screw of paper  the kindness was too much for the poor epileptic creature he cried in an anguish of delight and gratitude  if anybody gave you and me a thousand a year or saved our lives we could not be so affected  and so if you properly tyrannize over a woman you will find a hporth of kindness act upon her and bring tears into her eyes as though you were an angel benefiting her  some such boons as these were the best which fortune allotted to poor little amelia  her life begun not unprosperously had come down to thisto a mean prison and a long ignoble bondage  little george visited her captivity sometimes and consoled it with feeble gleams of encouragement  russell square was the boundary of her prison  she might walk thither occasionally but was always back to sleep in her cell at night to perform cheerless duties to watch by thankless sickbeds to suffer the harassment and tyranny of querulous disappointed old age  how many thousands of people are there women for the most part who are doomed to endure this long slaverywho are hospital nurses without wagessisters of charity if you like without the romance and the sentiment of sacrificewho strive fast watch and suffer unpitied and fade away ignobly and unknown  the hidden and awful wisdom which apportions the destinies of mankind is pleased so to humiliate and cast down the tender good and wise and to set up the selfish the foolish or the wicked oh be humble my brother in your prosperity  be gentle with those who are less lucky if not more deserving  think what right have you to be scornful whose virtue is a deficiency of temptation whose success may be a chance whose rank may be an ancestors accident whose prosperity is very likely a satire  they buried amelias mother in the churchyard at brompton upon just such a rainy dark day as amelia recollected when first she had been there to marry george her little boy sat by her side in pompous new sables she remembered the old pewwoman and clerk  her thoughts were away in other times as the parson read but that she held georges hand in her own perhaps she would have liked to change places with then as usual she felt ashamed of her selfish thoughts and prayed inwardly to be strengthened to do her duty  so she determined with all her might and strength to try and make her old father happy  she slaved toiled patched and mended sang and played backgammon read out the newspaper cooked dishes for old sedley walked him out sedulously into kensington gardens or the brompton lanes listened to his stories with untiring smiles and affectionate hypocrisy or sat musing by his side and communing with her own thoughts and reminiscences as the old man feeble and querulous sunned himself on the garden benches and prattled about his wrongs or his sorrows  what sad unsatisfactory thoughts those of the widow were  the children running up and down the slopes and broad paths in the gardens reminded her of george who was taken from her the first george was taken from her her selfish guilty love in both instances had been rebuked and bitterly chastised she strove to think it was right that she should be so punished she was such a miserable wicked sinner  she was quite alone in the world  i know that the account of this kind of solitary imprisonment is insufferably tedious unless there is some cheerful or humorous incident to enliven ita tender gaoler for instance or a waggish commandant of the fortress or a mouse to come out and play about latudes beard and whiskers or a subterranean passage under the castle dug by trenck with his nails and a toothpick  the historian has no such enlivening incident to relate in the narrative of amelias captivity  fancy her if you please during this period very sad but always ready to smile when spoken to in a very mean poor not to say vulgar position of life singing songs making puddings playing cards mending stockings for her old fathers benefit  so never mind whether she be a heroine or no or you and i however old scolding and bankruptmay we have in our last days a kind soft shoulder on which to lean and a gentle hand to soothe our gouty old pillows  old sedley grew very fond of his daughter after his wifes death and amelia had her consolation in doing her duty by the old man  but we are not going to leave these two people long in such a low and ungenteel station of life  better days as far as worldly prosperity went were in store for both perhaps the ingenious reader has guessed who was the stout gentleman who called upon georgy at his school in company with our old friend major dobbin it was another old acquaintance returned to england and at a time when his presence was likely to be of great comfort to his relatives there  major dobbin having easily succeeded in getting leave from his goodnatured commandant to proceed to madras and thence probably to europe on urgent private affairs never ceased travelling night and day until he reached his journeys end and had directed his march with such celerity that he arrived at madras in a high fever  his servants who accompanied him brought him to the house of the friend with whom he had resolved to stay until his departure for europe in a state of delirium and it was thought for many many days that he would never travel farther than the buryingground of the church of st  georges where the troops should fire a salvo over his grave and where many a gallant officer lies far away from his home  here as the poor fellow lay tossing in his fever the people who watched him might have heard him raving about amelia  the idea that he should never see her again depressed him in his lucid hours  he thought his last day was come and he made his solemn preparations for departure setting his affairs in this world in order and leaving the little property of which he was possessed to those whom he most desired to benefit  the friend in whose house he was located witnessed his testament  he desired to be buried with a little brown hairchain which he wore round his neck and which if the truth must be known he had got from amelias maid at brussels when the young widows hair was cut off during the fever which prostrated her after the death of george osborne on the plateau at mount st  john  he recovered rallied relapsed again having undergone such a process of bloodletting and calomel as showed the strength of his original constitution  he was almost a skeleton when they put him on board the ramchunder east indiaman captain bragg from calcutta touching at madras and so weak and prostrate that his friend who had tended him through his illness prophesied that the honest major would never survive the voyage and that he would pass some morning shrouded in flag and hammock over the ships side and carrying down to the sea with him the relic that he wore at his heart  but whether it was the sea air or the hope which sprung up in him afresh from the day that the ship spread her canvas and stood out of the roads towards home our friend began to amend and he was quite well though as gaunt as a greyhound before they reached the cape  kirk will be disappointed of his majority this time he said with a smile he will expect to find himself gazetted by the time the regiment reaches home for it must be premised that while the major was lying ill at madras having made such prodigious haste to go thither the gallant th which had passed many years abroad which after its return from the west indies had been baulked of its stay at home by the waterloo campaign and had been ordered from flanders to india had received orders home and the major might have accompanied his comrades had he chosen to wait for their arrival at madras  perhaps he was not inclined to put himself in his exhausted state again under the guardianship of glorvina i think miss odowd would have done for me he said laughingly to a fellowpassenger if we had had her on board and when she had sunk me she would have fallen upon you depend upon it and carried you in as a prize to southampton jos my boy  for indeed it was no other than our stout friend who was also a passenger on board the ramchunder  he had passed ten years in bengal constant dinners tiffins pale ale and claret the prodigious labour of cutcherry and the refreshment of brandypawnee which he was forced to take there had their effect upon waterloo sedley a voyage to europe was pronounced necessary for himand having served his full time in india and had fine appointments which had enabled him to lay by a considerable sum of money he was free to come home and stay with a good pension or to return and resume that rank in the service to which his seniority and his vast talents entitled him  he was rather thinner than when we last saw him but had gained in majesty and solemnity of demeanour he had resumed the mustachios to which his services at waterloo entitled him and swaggered about on deck in a magnificent velvet cap with a gold band and a profuse ornamentation of pins and jewellery about his person he took breakfast in his cabin and dressed as solemnly to appear on the quarterdeck as if he were going to turn out for bond street or the course at calcutta  he brought a native servant with him who was his valet and pipebearer and who wore the sedley crest in silver on his turban that oriental menial had a wretched life under the tyranny of jos sedley  jos was as vain of his person as a woman and took as long a time at his toilette as any fading beauty  the youngsters among the passengers young chaffers of the 150th and poor little ricketts coming home after his third fever used to draw out sedley at the cuddytable and make him tell prodigious stories about himself and his exploits against tigers and napoleon he was great when he visited the emperors tomb at longwood when to these gentlemen and the young officers of the ship major dobbin not being by he described the whole battle of waterloo and all but announced that napoleon never would have gone to saint helena at all but for him jos sedley  after leaving st  helena he became very generous disposing of a great quantity of ship stores claret preserved meats and great casks packed with sodawater brought out for his private delectation  there were no ladies on board the major gave the pas of precedency to the civilian so that he was the first dignitary at table and treated by captain bragg and the officers of the ramchunder with the respect which his rank warranted  he disappeared rather in a panic during a twodays gale in which he had the portholes of his cabin battened down and remained in his cot reading the washerwoman of finchley common left on board the ramchunder by the right honourable the lady emily hornblower wife of the rev silas hornblower when on their passage out to the cape where the reverend gentleman was a missionary but for common reading he had brought a stock of novels and plays which he lent to the rest of the ship and rendered himself agreeable to all by his kindness and condescension  many and many a night as the ship was cutting through the roaring dark sea the moon and stars shining overhead and the bell singing out the watch mr sedley and the major would sit on the quarterdeck of the vessel talking about home as the major smoked his cheroot and the civilian puffed at the hookah which his servant prepared for him  in these conversations it was wonderful with what perseverance and ingenuity major dobbin would manage to bring the talk round to the subject of amelia and her little boy  jos a little testy about his fathers misfortunes and unceremonious applications to him was soothed down by the major who pointed out the elders ill fortunes and old age  he would not perhaps like to live with the old couple whose ways and hours might not agree with those of a younger man accustomed to different society jos bowed at this compliment but the major pointed out how advantageous it would be for jos sedley to have a house of his own in london and not a mere bachelors establishment as before how his sister amelia would be the very person to preside over it how elegant how gentle she was and of what refined good manners he recounted stories of the success which mrs george osborne had had in former days at brussels and in london where she was much admired by people of very great fashion and he then hinted how becoming it would be for jos to send georgy to a good school and make a man of him for his mother and her parents would be sure to spoil him  in a word this artful major made the civilian promise to take charge of amelia and her unprotected child  he did not know as yet what events had happened in the little sedley family and how death had removed the mother and riches had carried off george from amelia  but the fact is that every day and always this lovesmitten and middleaged gentleman was thinking about mrs osborne and his whole heart was bent upon doing her good  he coaxed wheedled cajoled and complimented jos sedley with a perseverance and cordiality of which he was not aware himself very likely but some men who have unmarried sisters or daughters even may remember how uncommonly agreeable gentlemen are to the male relations when they are courting the females and perhaps this rogue of a dobbin was urged by a similar hypocrisy  the truth is when major dobbin came on board the ramchumder very sick and for the three days she lay in the madras roads he did not begin to rally nor did even the appearance and recognition of his old acquaintance mr sedley on board much cheer him until after a conversation which they had one day as the major was laid languidly on the deck  he said then he thought he was doomed he had left a little something to his godson in his will and he trusted mrs osborne would remember him kindly and be happy in the marriage she was about to make married not the least jos answered he had heard from her  she made no mention of the marriage and by the way it was curious she wrote to say that major dobbin was going to be married and hoped that he would be happy what were the dates of sedleys letters from europe the civilian fetched them they were two months later than the majors and the ships surgeon congratulated himself upon the treatment adopted by him towards his new patient who had been consigned to shipboard by the madras practitioner with very small hopes indeed for from that day the very day that he changed the draught major dobbin began to mend and thus it was that deserving officer captain kirk was disappointed of his majority  after they passed st  helena major dobbins gaiety and strength was such as to astonish all his fellow passengers  he larked with the midshipmen played singlestick with the mates ran up the shrouds like a boy sang a comic song one night to the amusement of the whole party assembled over their grog after supper and rendered himself so gay lively and amiable that even captain bragg who thought there was nothing in his passenger and considered he was a poorspirited feller at first was constrained to own that the major was a reserved but wellinformed and meritorious officer  he aint got distangy manners dammy bragg observed to his first mate he wouldnt do at government house roper where his lordship and lady william was as kind to me and shook hands with me before the whole company and asking me at dinner to take beer with him before the commanderinchief himself he aint got manners but theres something about him and thus captain bragg showed that he possessed discrimination as a man as well as ability as a commander  but a calm taking place when the ramchunder was within ten days sail of england dobbin became so impatient and illhumoured as to surprise those comrades who had before admired his vivacity and good temper he did not recover until the breeze sprang up again and was in a highly excited state when the pilot came on board  good god how his heart beat as the two friendly spires of southampton came in sight    chapter lviii  our friend the major  our major had rendered himself so popular on board the ramchunder that when he and mr sedley descended into the welcome shoreboat which was to take them from the ship the whole crew men and officers the great captain bragg himself leading off gave three cheers for major dobbin who blushed very much and ducked his head in token of thanks  jos who very likely thought the cheers were for himself took off his goldlaced cap and waved it majestically to his friends and they were pulled to shore and landed with great dignity at the pier whence they proceeded to the royal george hotel  although the sight of that magnificent round of beef and the silver tankard suggestive of real british homebrewed ale and porter which perennially greet the eyes of the traveller returning from foreign parts who enters the coffeeroom of the george are so invigorating and delightful that a man entering such a comfortable snug homely english inn might well like to stop some days there yet dobbin began to talk about a postchaise instantly and was no sooner at southampton than he wished to be on the road to london  jos however would not hear of moving that evening  why was he to pass a night in a postchaise instead of a great large undulating downy featherbed which was there ready to replace the horrid little narrow crib in which the portly bengal gentleman had been confined during the voyage he could not think of moving till his baggage was cleared or of travelling until he could do so with his chillum  so the major was forced to wait over that night and dispatched a letter to his family announcing his arrival entreating from jos a promise to write to his own friends jos promised but didnt keep his promise  the captain the surgeon and one or two passengers came and dined with our two gentlemen at the inn jos exerting himself in a sumptuous way in ordering the dinner and promising to go to town the next day with the major the landlord said it did his eyes good to see mr sedley take off his first pint of porter  if i had time and dared to enter into digressions i would write a chapter about that first pint of porter drunk upon english ground ah how good it is  it is worthwhile to leave home for a year just to enjoy that one draught  major dobbin made his appearance the next morning very neatly shaved and dressed according to his wont indeed it was so early in the morning that nobody was up in the house except that wonderful boots of an inn who never seems to want sleep and the major could hear the snores of the various inmates of the house roaring through the corridors as he creaked about in those dim passages  then the sleepless boots went shirking round from door to door gathering up at each the bluchers wellingtons oxonians which stood outside then joss native servant arose and began to get ready his masters ponderous dressing apparatus and prepare his hookah then the maidservants got up and meeting the dark man in the passages shrieked and mistook him for the devil  he and dobbin stumbled over their pails in the passages as they were scouring the decks of the royal george  when the first unshorn waiter appeared and unbarred the door of the inn the major thought that the time for departure was arrived and ordered a postchaise to be fetched instantly that they might set off  he then directed his steps to mr sedleys room and opened the curtains of the great large family bed wherein mr jos was snoring come up sedley the major said its time to be off the chaise will be at the door in half an hour  jos growled from under the counterpane to know what the time was but when he at last extorted from the blushing major who never told fibs however they might be to his advantage what was the real hour of the morning he broke out into a volley of bad language which we will not repeat here but by which he gave dobbin to understand that he would jeopardy his soul if he got up at that moment that the major might go and be hanged that he would not travel with dobbin and that it was most unkind and ungentlemanlike to disturb a man out of his sleep in that way on which the discomfited major was obliged to retreat leaving jos to resume his interrupted slumbers  the chaise came up presently and the major would wait no longer  if he had been an english nobleman travelling on a pleasure tour or a newspaper courier bearing dispatches government messages are generally carried much more quietly he could not have travelled more quickly the postboys wondered at the fees he flung amongst them how happy and green the country looked as the chaise whirled rapidly from milestone to milestone through neat country towns where landlords came out to welcome him with smiles and bows by pretty roadside inns where the signs hung on the elms and horses and waggoners were drinking under the chequered shadow of the trees by old halls and parks rustic hamlets clustered round ancient grey churchesand through the charming friendly english landscape  is there any in the world like it to a traveller returning home it looks so kindit seems to shake hands with you as you pass through it well major dobbin passed through all this from southampton to london and without noting much beyond the milestones along the road  you see he was so eager to see his parents at camberwell  he grudged the time lost between piccadilly and his old haunt at the slaughters whither he drove faithfully long years had passed since he saw it last since he and george as young men had enjoyed many a feast and held many a revel there  he had now passed into the stage of oldfellowhood  his hair was grizzled and many a passion and feeling of his youth had grown grey in that interval there however stood the old waiter at the door in the same greasy black suit with the same double chin and flaccid face with the same huge bunch of seals at his fob rattling his money in his pockets as before and receiving the major as if he had gone away only a week ago  put the majors things in twentythree thats his room john said exhibiting not the least surprise  roast fowl for your dinner i suppose  you aint got married they said you was marriedthe scotch surgeon of yours was here  no it was captain humby of the thirtythird as was quartered with the th in injee like any warm water what do you come in a chay foraint the coach good enough and with this the faithful waiter who knew and remembered every officer who used the house and with whom ten years were but as yesterday led the way up to dobbins old room where stood the great moreen bed and the shabby carpet a thought more dingy and all the old black furniture covered with faded chintz just as the major recollected them in his youth  he remembered george pacing up and down the room and biting his nails and swearing that the governor must come round and that if he didnt he didnt care a straw on the day before he was married he could fancy him walking in banging the door of dobbins room and his own hard by  you aint got young john said calmly surveying his friend of former days  dobbin laughed  ten years and a fever dont make a man young john he said  it is you that are always youngno you are always old  what became of captain osbornes widow john said  fine young fellow that  lord how he used to spend his money  he never came back after that day he was marched from here  he owes me three pound at this minute  look here i have it in my book  april 10 1815 captain osborne  3 pounds i wonder whether his father would pay me and so saying john of the slaughters pulled out the very morocco pocketbook in which he had noted his loan to the captain upon a greasy faded page still extant with many other scrawled memoranda regarding the bygone frequenters of the house  having inducted his customer into the room john retired with perfect calmness and major dobbin not without a blush and a grin at his own absurdity chose out of his kit the very smartest and most becoming civil costume he possessed and laughed at his own tanned face and grey hair as he surveyed them in the dreary little toiletglass on the dressingtable  im glad old john didnt forget me he thought shell know me too i hope and he sallied out of the inn bending his steps once more in the direction of brompton  every minute incident of his last meeting with amelia was present to the constant mans mind as he walked towards her house  the arch and the achilles statue were up since he had last been in piccadilly a hundred changes had occurred which his eye and mind vaguely noted  he began to tremble as he walked up the lane from brompton that wellremembered lane leading to the street where she lived  was she going to be married or not if he were to meet her with the little boygood god what should he do he saw a woman coming to him with a child of five years oldwas that she he began to shake at the mere possibility  when he came up to the row of houses at last where she lived and to the gate he caught hold of it and paused  he might have heard the thumping of his own heart may god almighty bless her whatever has happened he thought to himself  psha  she may be gone from here he said and went in through the gate  the window of the parlour which she used to occupy was open and there were no inmates in the room  the major thought he recognized the piano though with the picture over it as it used to be in former days and his perturbations were renewed  mr clapps brass plate was still on the door at the knocker of which dobbin performed a summons  a buxomlooking lass of sixteen with bright eyes and purple cheeks came to answer the knock and looked hard at the major as he leant back against the little porch  he was as pale as a ghost and could hardly falter out the wordsdoes mrs osborne live here  she looked him hard in the face for a momentand then turning white toosaid lord bless meits major dobbin she held out both her hands shakingdont you remember me she said  i used to call you major sugarplums on which and i believe it was for the first time that he ever so conducted himself in his life the major took the girl in his arms and kissed her she began to laugh and cry hysterically and calling out ma pa with all her voice brought up those worthy people who had already been surveying the major from the casement of the ornamental kitchen and were astonished to find their daughter in the little passage in the embrace of a great tall man in a blue frockcoat and white duck trousers  im an old friend he saidnot without blushing though  dont you remember me mrs clapp and those good cakes you used to make for tea dont you recollect me clapp im georges godfather and just come back from india a great shaking of hands ensuedmrs clapp was greatly affected and delighted she called upon heaven to interpose a vast many times in that passage  the landlord and landlady of the house led the worthy major into the sedleys room whereof he remembered every single article of furniture from the old brass ornamented piano once a natty little instrument stothard maker to the screens and the alabaster miniature tombstone in the midst of which ticked mr sedleys gold watch and there as he sat down in the lodgers vacant armchair the father the mother and the daughter with a thousand ejaculatory breaks in the narrative informed major dobbin of what we know already but of particulars in amelias history of which he was not awarenamely of mrs sedleys death of georges reconcilement with his grandfather osborne of the way in which the widow took on at leaving him and of other particulars of her life twice or thrice he was going to ask about the marriage question but his heart failed him he did not care to lay it bare to these people  finally he was informed that mrs o  was gone to walk with her pa in kensington gardens whither she always went with the old gentleman who was very weak and peevish now and led her a sad life though she behaved to him like an angel to be sure of a fine afternoon after dinner  im very much pressed for time the major said and have business tonight of importance  i should like to see mrs osborne tho suppose miss polly would come with me and show me the way  miss polly was charmed and astonished at this proposal  she knew the way  she would show major dobbin  she had often been with mr sedley when mrs o was gonewas gone russell square wayand knew the bench where he liked to sit  she bounced away to her apartment and appeared presently in her best bonnet and her mammas yellow shawl and large pebble brooch of which she assumed the loan in order to make herself a worthy companion for the major  that officer then in his blue frockcoat and buckskin gloves gave the young lady his arm and they walked away very gaily  he was glad to have a friend at hand for the scene which he dreaded somehow  he asked a thousand more questions from his companion about amelia  his kind heart grieved to think that she should have had to part with her son  how did she bear it did she see him often was mr sedley pretty comfortable now in a worldly point of view polly answered all these questions of major sugarplums to the very best of her power  and in the midst of their walk an incident occurred which though very simple in its nature was productive of the greatest delight to major dobbin  a pale young man with feeble whiskers and a stiff white neckcloth came walking down the lane en sandwichhaving a lady that is on each arm  one was a tall and commanding middleaged female with features and a complexion similar to those of the clergyman of the church of england by whose side she marched and the other a stunted little woman with a dark face ornamented by a fine new bonnet and white ribbons and in a smart pelisse with a rich gold watch in the midst of her person  the gentleman pinioned as he was by these two ladies carried further a parasol shawl and basket so that his arms were entirely engaged and of course he was unable to touch his hat in acknowledgement of the curtsey with which miss mary clapp greeted him  he merely bowed his head in reply to her salutation which the two ladies returned with a patronizing air and at the same time looking severely at the individual in the blue coat and bamboo cane who accompanied miss polly  whos that asked the major amused by the group and after he had made way for the three to pass up the lane  mary looked at him rather roguishly  that is our curate the reverend mr binny a twitch from major dobbin and his sister miss b  lord bless us how she did use to worret us at sundayschool and the other lady the little one with a cast in her eye and the handsome watch is mrs binnymiss grits that was her pa was a grocer and kept the little original gold tea pot in kensington gravel pits  they were married last month and are just come back from margate  shes five thousand pound to her fortune but her and miss b who made the match have quarrelled already  if the major had twitched before he started now and slapped the bamboo on the ground with an emphasis which made miss clapp cry law and laugh too  he stood for a moment silent with open mouth looking after the retreating young couple while miss mary told their history but he did not hear beyond the announcement of the reverend gentlemans marriage his head was swimming with felicity  after this rencontre he began to walk double quick towards the place of his destinationand yet they were too soon for he was in a great tremor at the idea of a meeting for which he had been longing any time these ten yearsthrough the brompton lanes and entering at the little old portal in kensington garden wall  there they are said miss polly and she felt him again start back on her arm  she was a confidante at once of the whole business she knew the story as well as if she had read it in one of her favourite novelbooksfatherless fanny or the scottish chiefs  suppose you were to run on and tell her the major said  polly ran forward her yellow shawl streaming in the breeze  old sedley was seated on a bench his handkerchief placed over his knees prattling away according to his wont with some old story about old times to which amelia had listened and awarded a patient smile many a time before  she could of late think of her own affairs and smile or make other marks of recognition of her fathers stories scarcely hearing a word of the old mans tales as mary came bouncing along and amelia caught sight of her she started up from her bench  her first thought was that something had happened to georgy but the sight of the messengers eager and happy face dissipated that fear in the timorous mothers bosom  news  news cried the emissary of major dobbin hes come  hes come  who is come said emmy still thinking of her son  look there answered miss clapp turning round and pointing in which direction amelia looking saw dobbins lean figure and long shadow stalking across the grass  amelia started in her turn blushed up and of course began to cry  at all this simple little creatures fetes the grandes eaux were accustomed to play he looked at heroh how fondlyas she came running towards him her hands before her ready to give them to him  she wasnt changed she was a little pale a little stouter in figure  her eyes were the same the kind trustful eyes  there were scarce three lines of silver in her soft brown hair she gave him both her hands as she looked up flushing and smiling through her tears into his honest homely face  he took the two little hands between his two and held them there  he was speechless for a moment  why did he not take her in his arms and swear that he would never leave her she must have yielded  she could not but have obeyed him  iive another arrival to announce he said after a pause  mrs dobbin amelia said making a movement backwhy didnt he speak  no he said letting her hands go  who has told you those lies i mean your brother jos came in the same ship with me and is come home to make you all happy  papa papa emmy cried out here are news  my brother is in england  he is come to take care of you here is major dobbin  mr sedley started up shaking a great deal and gathering up his thoughts  then he stepped forward and made an oldfashioned bow to the major whom he called mr dobbin and hoped his worthy father sir william was quite well  he proposed to call upon sir william who had done him the honour of a visit a short time ago  sir william had not called upon the old gentleman for eight yearsit was that visit he was thinking of returning  he is very much shaken emmy whispered as dobbin went up and cordially shook hands with the old man  although he had such particular business in london that evening the major consented to forego it upon mr sedleys invitation to him to come home and partake of tea  amelia put her arm under that of her young friend with the yellow shawl and headed the party on their return homewards so that mr sedley fell to dobbins share the old man walked very slowly and told a number of ancient histories about himself and his poor bessy his former prosperity and his bankruptcy  his thoughts as is usual with failing old men were quite in former times the present with the exception of the one catastrophe which he felt he knew little about  the major was glad to let him talk on  his eyes were fixed upon the figure in front of himthe dear little figure always present to his imagination and in his prayers and visiting his dreams wakeful or slumbering  amelia was very happy smiling and active all that evening performing her duties as hostess of the little entertainment with the utmost grace and propriety as dobbin thought  his eyes followed her about as they sat in the twilight  how many a time had he longed for that moment and thought of her far away under hot winds and in weary marches gentle and happy kindly ministering to the wants of old age and decorating poverty with sweet submissionas he saw her now  i do not say that his taste was the highest or that it is the duty of great intellects to be content with a breadandbutter paradise such as sufficed our simple old friend but his desires were of this sort whether for good or bad and with amelia to help him he was as ready to drink as many cups of tea as doctor johnson  amelia seeing this propensity laughingly encouraged it and looked exceedingly roguish as she administered to him cup after cup  it is true she did not know that the major had had no dinner and that the cloth was laid for him at the slaughters and a plate laid thereon to mark that the table was retained in that very box in which the major and george had sat many a time carousing when she was a child just come home from miss pinkertons school  the first thing mrs osborne showed the major was georgys miniature for which she ran upstairs on her arrival at home  it was not half handsome enough of course for the boy but wasnt it noble of him to think of bringing it to his mother whilst her papa was awake she did not talk much about georgy  to hear about mr osborne and russell square was not agreeable to the old man who very likely was unconscious that he had been living for some months past mainly on the bounty of his richer rival and lost his temper if allusion was made to the other  dobbin told him all and a little more perhaps than all that had happened on board the ramchunder and exaggerated joss benevolent dispositions towards his father and resolution to make him comfortable in his old days  the truth is that during the voyage the major had impressed this duty most strongly upon his fellowpassenger and extorted promises from him that he would take charge of his sister and her child  he soothed joss irritation with regard to the bills which the old gentleman had drawn upon him gave a laughing account of his own sufferings on the same score and of the famous consignment of wine with which the old man had favoured him and brought mr jos who was by no means an illnatured person when wellpleased and moderately flattered to a very good state of feeling regarding his relatives in europe  and in fine i am ashamed to say that the major stretched the truth so far as to tell old mr sedley that it was mainly a desire to see his parent which brought jos once more to europe  at his accustomed hour mr sedley began to doze in his chair and then it was amelias opportunity to commence her conversation which she did with great eagernessit related exclusively to georgy  she did not talk at all about her own sufferings at breaking from him for indeed this worthy woman though she was halfkilled by the separation from the child yet thought it was very wicked in her to repine at losing him but everything concerning him his virtues talents and prospects she poured out  she described his angelic beauty narrated a hundred instances of his generosity and greatness of mind whilst living with her how a royal duchess had stopped and admired him in kensington gardens how splendidly he was cared for now and how he had a groom and a pony what quickness and cleverness he had and what a prodigiously wellread and delightful person the reverend lawrence veal was georges master  he knows everything amelia said  he has the most delightful parties  you who are so learned yourself and have read so much and are so clever and accomplisheddont shake your head and say nohe always used to say you wereyou will be charmed with mr veals parties the last tuesday in every month  he says there is no place in the bar or the senate that georgy may not aspire to  look here and she went to the pianodrawer and drew out a theme of georgys composition  this great effort of genius which is still in the possession of georges mother is as follows  on selfishnessof all the vices which degrade the human character selfishness is the most odious and contemptible  an undue love of self leads to the most monstrous crimes and occasions the greatest misfortunes both in states and families  as a selfish man will impoverish his family and often bring them to ruin so a selfish king brings ruin on his people and often plunges them into war  example  the selfishness of achilles as remarked by the poet homer occasioned a thousand woes to the greeksmuri achaiois alge ethekehom il a 2 the selfishness of the late napoleon bonaparte occasioned innumerable wars in europe and caused him to perish himself in a miserable islandthat of saint helena in the atlantic ocean  we see by these examples that we are not to consult our own interest and ambition but that we are to consider the interests of others as well as our own  george s  osborne athene house 24 april 1827  think of him writing such a hand and quoting greek too at his age the delighted mother said  oh william she added holding out her hand to the major what a treasure heaven has given me in that boy he is the comfort of my lifeand he is the image ofof him thats gone  ought i to be angry with her for being faithful to him william thought  ought i to be jealous of my friend in the grave or hurt that such a heart as amelias can love only once and for ever oh george george how little you knew the prize you had though this sentiment passed rapidly through williams mind as he was holding amelias hand whilst the handkerchief was veiling her eyes  dear friend she said pressing the hand which held hers how good how kind you always have been to me see  papa is stirring you will go and see georgy tomorrow wont you  not tomorrow said poor old dobbin  i have business he did not like to own that he had not as yet been to his parents and his dear sister annea remissness for which i am sure every wellregulated person will blame the major  and presently he took his leave leaving his address behind him for jos against the latters arrival  and so the first day was over and he had seen her  when he got back to the slaughters the roast fowl was of course cold in which condition he ate it for supper  and knowing what early hours his family kept and that it would be needless to disturb their slumbers at so late an hour it is on record that major dobbin treated himself to halfprice at the haymarket theatre that evening where let us hope he enjoyed himself    chapter lix  the old piano  the majors visit left old john sedley in a great state of agitation and excitement  his daughter could not induce him to settle down to his customary occupations or amusements that night  he passed the evening fumbling amongst his boxes and desks untying his papers with trembling hands and sorting and arranging them against joss arrival he had them in the greatest orderhis tapes and his files his receipts and his letters with lawyers and correspondents the documents relative to the wine project which failed from a most unaccountable accident after commencing with the most splendid prospects the coal project which only a want of capital prevented from becoming the most successful scheme ever put before the public the patent sawmills and sawdust consolidation project c c  all night until a very late hour he passed in the preparation of these documents trembling about from one room to another with a quivering candle and shaky hands  heres the wine papers heres the sawdust heres the coals heres my letters to calcutta and madras and replies from major dobbin cb and mr joseph sedley to the same  he shall find no irregularity about me emmy the old gentleman said  emmy smiled  i dont think jos will care about seeing those papers papa she said  you dont know anything about business my dear answered the sire shaking his head with an important air  and it must be confessed that on this point emmy was very ignorant and that is a pity some people are so knowing  all these twopenny documents arranged on a side table old sedley covered them carefully over with a clean bandanna handkerchief one out of major dobbins lot and enjoined the maid and landlady of the house in the most solemn way not to disturb those papers which were arranged for the arrival of mr joseph sedley the next morning mr joseph sedley of the honourable east india companys bengal civil service  amelia found him up very early the next morning more eager more hectic and more shaky than ever  i didnt sleep much emmy my dear he said  i was thinking of my poor bessy  i wish she was alive to ride in joss carriage once again  she kept her own and became it very well and his eyes filled with tears which trickled down his furrowed old face  amelia wiped them away and smilingly kissed him and tied the old mans neckcloth in a smart bow and put his brooch into his best shirt frill in which in his sunday suit of mourning he sat from six oclock in the morning awaiting the arrival of his son  however when the postman made his appearance the little party were put out of suspense by the receipt of a letter from jos to his sister who announced that he felt a little fatigued after his voyage and should not be able to move on that day but that he would leave southampton early the next morning and be with his father and mother at evening  amelia as she read out the letter to her father paused over the latter word her brother it was clear did not know what had happened in the family nor could he for the fact is that though the major rightly suspected that his travelling companion never would be got into motion in so short a space as twentyfour hours and would find some excuse for delaying yet dobbin had not written to jos to inform him of the calamity which had befallen the sedley family being occupied in talking with amelia until long after posthour  there are some splendid tailors shops in the high street of southampton in the fine plateglass windows of which hang gorgeous waistcoats of all sorts of silk and velvet and gold and crimson and pictures of the last new fashions in which those wonderful gentlemen with quizzing glasses and holding on to little boys with the exceeding large eyes and curly hair ogle ladies in riding habits prancing by the statue of achilles at apsley house  jos although provided with some of the most splendid vests that calcutta could furnish thought he could not go to town until he was supplied with one or two of these garments and selected a crimson satin embroidered with gold butterflies and a black and red velvet tartan with white stripes and a rolling collar with which and a rich blue satin stock and a gold pin consisting of a fivebarred gate with a horseman in pink enamel jumping over it he thought he might make his entry into london with some dignity  for joss former shyness and blundering blushing timidity had given way to a more candid and courageous selfassertion of his worth i dont care about owning it waterloo sedley would say to his friends i am a dressy man and though rather uneasy if the ladies looked at him at the government house balls and though he blushed and turned away alarmed under their glances it was chiefly from a dread lest they should make love to him that he avoided them being averse to marriage altogether  but there was no such swell in calcutta as waterloo sedley i have heard say and he had the handsomest turnout gave the best bachelor dinners and had the finest plate in the whole place  to make these waistcoats for a man of his size and dignity took at least a day part of which he employed in hiring a servant to wait upon him and his native and in instructing the agent who cleared his baggage his boxes his books which he never read his chests of mangoes chutney and currypowders his shawls for presents to people whom he didnt know as yet and the rest of his persicos apparatus  at length he drove leisurely to london on the third day and in the new waistcoat the native with chattering teeth shuddering in a shawl on the box by the side of the new european servant jos puffing his pipe at intervals within and looking so majestic that the little boys cried hooray and many people thought he must be a governorgeneral  he i promise did not decline the obsequious invitation of the landlords to alight and refresh himself in the neat country towns  having partaken of a copious breakfast with fish and rice and hard eggs at southampton he had so far rallied at winchester as to think a glass of sherry necessary  at alton he stepped out of the carriage at his servants request and imbibed some of the ale for which the place is famous  at farnham he stopped to view the bishops castle and to partake of a light dinner of stewed eels veal cutlets and french beans with a bottle of claret  he was cold over bagshot heath where the native chattered more and more and jos sahib took some brandyandwater in fact when he drove into town he was as full of wine beer meat pickles cherrybrandy and tobacco as the stewards cabin of a steampacket it was evening when his carriage thundered up to the little door in brompton whither the affectionate fellow drove first and before hieing to the apartments secured for him by mr dobbin at the slaughters  all the faces in the street were in the windows the little maidservant flew to the wicketgate the mesdames clapp looked out from the casement of the ornamented kitchen emmy in a great flutter was in the passage among the hats and coats and old sedley in the parlour inside shaking all over  jos descended from the postchaise and down the creaking swaying steps in awful state supported by the new valet from southampton and the shuddering native whose brown face was now livid with cold and of the colour of a turkeys gizzard  he created an immense sensation in the passage presently where mrs and miss clapp coming perhaps to listen at the parlour door found loll jewab shaking upon the hallbench under the coats moaning in a strange piteous way and showing his yellow eyeballs and white teeth  for you see we have adroitly shut the door upon the meeting between jos and the old father and the poor little gentle sister inside  the old man was very much affected so of course was his daughter nor was jos without feeling  in that long absence of ten years the most selfish will think about home and early ties distance sanctifies both long brooding over those lost pleasures exaggerates their charm and sweetness  jos was unaffectedly glad to see and shake the hand of his father between whom and himself there had been a coolnessglad to see his little sister whom he remembered so pretty and smiling and pained at the alteration which time grief and misfortune had made in the shattered old man  emmy had come out to the door in her black clothes and whispered to him of her mothers death and not to speak of it to their father there was no need of this caution for the elder sedley himself began immediately to speak of the event and prattled about it and wept over it plenteously it shocked the indian not a little and made him think of himself less than the poor fellow was accustomed to do  the result of the interview must have been very satisfactory for when jos had reascended his postchaise and had driven away to his hotel emmy embraced her father tenderly appealing to him with an air of triumph and asking the old man whether she did not always say that her brother had a good heart  indeed joseph sedley affected by the humble position in which he found his relations and in the expansiveness and overflowing of heart occasioned by the first meeting declared that they should never suffer want or discomfort any more that he was at home for some time at any rate during which his house and everything he had should be theirs and that amelia would look very pretty at the head of his tableuntil she would accept one of her own  she shook her head sadly and had as usual recourse to the waterworks she knew what he meant  she and her young confidante miss mary had talked over the matter most fully the very night of the majors visit beyond which time the impetuous polly could not refrain from talking of the discovery which she had made and describing the start and tremor of joy by which major dobbin betrayed himself when mr binny passed with his bride and the major learned that he had no longer a rival to fear  didnt you see how he shook all over when you asked if he was married and he said who told you those lies oh mam polly said he never kept his eyes off you and im sure hes grown grey athinking of you  but amelia looking up at her bed over which hung the portraits of her husband and son told her young protegee never never to speak on that subject again that major dobbin had been her husbands dearest friend and her own and georges most kind and affectionate guardian that she loved him as a brotherbut that a woman who had been married to such an angel as that and she pointed to the wall could never think of any other union  poor polly sighed  she thought what she should do if young mr tomkins at the surgery who always looked at her so at church and who by those mere aggressive glances had put her timorous little heart into such a flutter that she was ready to surrender at oncewhat she should do if he were to die she knew he was consumptive his cheeks were so red and he was so uncommon thin in the waist  not that emmy being made aware of the honest majors passion rebuffed him in any way or felt displeased with him  such an attachment from so true and loyal a gentleman could make no woman angry desdemona was not angry with cassio though there is very little doubt she saw the lieutenants partiality for her and i for my part believe that many more things took place in that sad affair than the worthy moorish officer ever knew of why miranda was even very kind to caliban and we may be pretty sure for the same reason not that she would encourage him in the leastthe poor uncouth monsterof course not  no more would emmy by any means encourage her admirer the major  she would give him that friendly regard which so much excellence and fidelity merited she would treat him with perfect cordiality and frankness until he made his proposals and then it would be time enough for her to speak and to put an end to hopes which never could be realized  she slept therefore very soundly that evening after the conversation with miss polly and was more than ordinarily happy in spite of joss delaying  i am glad he is not going to marry that miss odowd she thought colonel odowd never could have a sister fit for such an accomplished man as major william who was there amongst her little circle who would make him a good wife not miss binny she was too old and illtempered miss osborne too old too little polly was too young mrs osborne could not find anybody to suit the major before she went to sleep  the same morning brought major dobbin a letter to the slaughters coffeehouse from his friend at southampton begging dear dob to excuse jos for being in a rage when awakened the day before he had a confounded headache and was just in his first sleep and entreating dob to engage comfortable rooms at the slaughters for mr sedley and his servants  the major had become necessary to jos during the voyage he was attached to him and hung upon him  the other passengers were away to london young ricketts and little chaffers went away on the coach that dayricketts on the box and taking the reins from botley the doctor was off to his family at portsea bragg gone to town to his copartners and the first mate busy in the unloading of the ramchunder  mr joe was very lonely at southampton and got the landlord of the george to take a glass of wine with him that day at the very hour at which major dobbin was seated at the table of his father sir william where his sister found out for it was impossible for the major to tell fibs that he had been to see mrs george osborne  jos was so comfortably situated in st  martins lane he could enjoy his hookah there with such perfect ease and could swagger down to the theatres when minded so agreeably that perhaps he would have remained altogether at the slaughters had not his friend the major been at his elbow  that gentleman would not let the bengalee rest until he had executed his promise of having a home for amelia and his father  jos was a soft fellow in anybodys hands dobbin most active in anybodys concerns but his own the civilian was therefore an easy victim to the guileless arts of this goodnatured diplomatist and was ready to do to purchase hire or relinquish whatever his friend thought fit  loll jewab of whom the boys about st  martins lane used to make cruel fun whenever he showed his dusky countenance in the street was sent back to calcutta in the lady kicklebury east indiaman in which sir william dobbin had a share having previously taught joss european the art of preparing curries pilaus and pipes  it was a matter of great delight and occupation to jos to superintend the building of a smart chariot which he and the major ordered in the neighbouring long acre  and a pair of handsome horses were jobbed with which jos drove about in state in the park or to call upon his indian friends  amelia was not seldom by his side on these excursions when also major dobbin would be seen in the back seat of the carriage at other times old sedley and his daughter took advantage of it and miss clapp who frequently accompanied her friend had great pleasure in being recognized as she sat in the carriage dressed in the famous yellow shawl by the young gentleman at the surgery whose face might commonly be seen over the windowblinds as she passed  shortly after joss first appearance at brompton a dismal scene indeed took place at that humble cottage at which the sedleys had passed the last ten years of their life  joss carriage the temporary one not the chariot under construction arrived one day and carried off old sedley and his daughterto return no more  the tears that were shed by the landlady and the landladys daughter at that event were as genuine tears of sorrow as any that have been outpoured in the course of this history in their long acquaintanceship and intimacy they could not recall a harsh word that had been uttered by amelia she had been all sweetness and kindness always thankful always gentle even when mrs clapp lost her own temper and pressed for the rent when the kind creature was going away for good and all the landlady reproached herself bitterly for ever having used a rough expression to herhow she wept as they stuck up with wafers on the window a paper notifying that the little rooms so long occupied were to let  they never would have such lodgers again that was quite clear  afterlife proved the truth of this melancholy prophecy and mrs clapp revenged herself for the deterioration of mankind by levying the most savage contributions upon the teacaddies and legs of mutton of her locataires  most of them scolded and grumbled some of them did not pay none of them stayed the landlady might well regret those old old friends who had left her  as for miss mary her sorrow at amelias departure was such as i shall not attempt to depict  from childhood upwards she had been with her daily and had attached herself so passionately to that dear good lady that when the grand barouche came to carry her off into splendour she fainted in the arms of her friend who was indeed scarcely less affected than the goodnatured girl  amelia loved her like a daughter during eleven years the girl had been her constant friend and associate  the separation was a very painful one indeed to her  but it was of course arranged that mary was to come and stay often at the grand new house whither mrs osborne was going and where mary was sure she would never be so happy as she had been in their humble cot as miss clapp called it in the language of the novels which she loved  let us hope she was wrong in her judgement  poor emmys days of happiness had been very few in that humble cot  a gloomy fate had oppressed her there  she never liked to come back to the house after she had left it or to face the landlady who had tyrannized over her when illhumoured and unpaid or when pleased had treated her with a coarse familiarity scarcely less odious her servility and fulsome compliments when emmy was in prosperity were not more to that ladys liking  she cast about notes of admiration all over the new house extolling every article of furniture or ornament she fingered mrs osbornes dresses and calculated their price nothing could be too good for that sweet lady she vowed and protested  but in the vulgar sycophant who now paid court to her emmy always remembered the coarse tyrant who had made her miserable many a time to whom she had been forced to put up petitions for time when the rent was overdue who cried out at her extravagance if she bought delicacies for her ailing mother or father who had seen her humble and trampled upon her  nobody ever heard of these griefs which had been part of our poor little womans lot in life  she kept them secret from her father whose improvidence was the cause of much of her misery  she had to bear all the blame of his misdoings and indeed was so utterly gentle and humble as to be made by nature for a victim  i hope she is not to suffer much more of that hard usage  and as in all griefs there is said to be some consolation i may mention that poor mary when left at her friends departure in a hysterical condition was placed under the medical treatment of the young fellow from the surgery under whose care she rallied after a short period emmy when she went away from brompton endowed mary with every article of furniture that the house contained only taking away her pictures the two pictures over the bed and her pianothat little old piano which had now passed into a plaintive jingling old age but which she loved for reasons of her own  she was a child when first she played on it and her parents gave it her  it had been given to her again since as the reader may remember when her fathers house was gone to ruin and the instrument was recovered out of the wreck  major dobbin was exceedingly pleased when as he was superintending the arrangements of joss new housewhich the major insisted should be very handsome and comfortablethe cart arrived from brompton bringing the trunks and bandboxes of the emigrants from that village and with them the old piano  amelia would have it up in her sittingroom a neat little apartment on the second floor adjoining her fathers chamber and where the old gentleman sat commonly of evenings  when the men appeared then bearing this old musicbox and amelia gave orders that it should be placed in the chamber aforesaid dobbin was quite elated  im glad youve kept it he said in a very sentimental manner  i was afraid you didnt care about it  i value it more than anything i have in the world said amelia  do you amelia cried the major  the fact was as he had bought it himself though he never said anything about it it never entered into his head to suppose that emmy should think anybody else was the purchaser and as a matter of course he fancied that she knew the gift came from him  do you amelia he said and the question the great question of all was trembling on his lips when emmy replied  can i do otherwisedid not he give it me  i did not know said poor old dob and his countenance fell  emmy did not note the circumstance at the time nor take immediate heed of the very dismal expression which honest dobbins countenance assumed but she thought of it afterwards  and then it struck her with inexpressible pain and mortification too that it was william who was the giver of the piano and not george as she had fancied it was not georges gift the only one which she had received from her lover as she thoughtthe thing she had cherished beyond all othersher dearest relic and prize  she had spoken to it about george played his favourite airs upon it sat for long evening hours touching to the best of her simple art melancholy harmonies on the keys and weeping over them in silence it was not georges relic  it was valueless now the next time that old sedley asked her to play she said it was shockingly out of tune that she had a headache that she couldnt play  then according to her custom she rebuked herself for her pettishness and ingratitude and determined to make a reparation to honest william for the slight she had not expressed to him but had felt for his piano a few days afterwards as they were seated in the drawingroom where jos had fallen asleep with great comfort after dinner amelia said with rather a faltering voice to major dobbin  i have to beg your pardon for something  about what said he  aboutabout that little square piano  i never thanked you for it when you gave it me many many years ago before i was married  i thought somebody else had given it  thank you william she held out her hand but the poor little womans heart was bleeding and as for her eyes of course they were at their work  but william could hold no more  amelia amelia he said i did buy it for you  i loved you then as i do now  i must tell you  i think i loved you from the first minute that i saw you when george brought me to your house to show me the amelia whom he was engaged to  you were but a girl in white with large ringlets you came down singingdo you rememberand we went to vauxhall  since then i have thought of but one woman in the world and that was you  i think there is no hour in the day has passed for twelve years that i havent thought of you i came to tell you this before i went to india but you did not care and i hadnt the heart to speak  you did not care whether i stayed or went  i was very ungrateful amelia said  no only indifferent dobbin continued desperately i have nothing to make a woman to be otherwise  i know what you are feeling now  you are hurt in your heart at the discovery about the piano and that it came from me and not from george  i forgot or i should never have spoken of it so  it is for me to ask your pardon for being a fool for a moment and thinking that years of constancy and devotion might have pleaded with you  it is you who are cruel now amelia said with some spirit george is my husband here and in heaven  how could i love any other but him i am his now as when you first saw me dear william it was he who told me how good and generous you were and who taught me to love you as a brother  have you not been everything to me and my boy our dearest truest kindest friend and protector had you come a few months sooner perhaps you might have spared me thatthat dreadful parting  oh it nearly killed me williambut you didnt come though i wished and prayed for you to come and they took him too away from me  isnt he a noble boy william be his friend still and mineand here her voice broke and she hid her face on his shoulder  the major folded his arms round her holding her to him as if she was a child and kissed her head  i will not change dear amelia he said i ask for no more than your love  i think i would not have it otherwise only let me stay near you and see you often  yes often amelia said  and so william was at liberty to look and longas the poor boy at school who has no money may sigh after the contents of the tartwomans tray    chapter lx  returns to the genteel world  good fortune now begins to smile upon amelia  we are glad to get her out of that low sphere in which she has been creeping hitherto and introduce her into a polite circlenot so grand and refined as that in which our other female friend mrs becky has appeared but still having no small pretensions to gentility and fashion  joss friends were all from the three presidencies and his new house was in the comfortable angloindian district of which moira place is the centre minto square great clive street warren street hastings street ochterlony place plassy square assaye terrace gardens was a felicitous word not applied to stucco houses with asphalt terraces in front so early as 1827who does not know these respectable abodes of the retired indian aristocracy and the quarter which mr wenham calls the black hole in a word joss position in life was not grand enough to entitle him to a house in moira place where none can live but retired members of council and partners of indian firms who break after having settled a hundred thousand pounds on their wives and retire into comparative penury to a country place and four thousand a year he engaged a comfortable house of a second or thirdrate order in gillespie street purchasing the carpets costly mirrors and handsome and appropriate planned furniture by seddons from the assignees of mr scape lately admitted partner into the great calcutta house of fogle fake and cracksman in which poor scape had embarked seventy thousand pounds the earnings of a long and honourable life taking fakes place who retired to a princely park in sussex the fogles have been long out of the firm and sir horace fogle is about to be raised to the peerage as baron bandannaadmitted i say partner into the great agency house of fogle and fake two years before it failed for a million and plunged half the indian public into misery and ruin  scape ruined honest and brokenhearted at sixtyfive years of age went out to calcutta to wind up the affairs of the house walter scape was withdrawn from eton and put into a merchants house  florence scape fanny scape and their mother faded away to boulogne and will be heard of no more  to be brief jos stepped in and bought their carpets and sideboards and admired himself in the mirrors which had reflected their kind handsome faces  the scape tradesmen all honourably paid left their cards and were eager to supply the new household  the large men in white waistcoats who waited at scapes dinners greengrocers bankporters and milkmen in their private capacity left their addresses and ingratiated themselves with the butler  mr chummy the chimneypurifier who had swept the last three families tried to coax the butler and the boy under him whose duty it was to go out covered with buttons and with stripes down his trousers for the protection of mrs amelia whenever she chose to walk abroad  it was a modest establishment  the butler was joss valet also and never was more drunk than a butler in a small family should be who has a proper regard for his masters wine  emmy was supplied with a maid grown on sir william dobbins suburban estate a good girl whose kindness and humility disarmed mrs osborne who was at first terrified at the idea of having a servant to wait upon herself who did not in the least know how to use one and who always spoke to domestics with the most reverential politeness  but this maid was very useful in the family in dexterously tending old mr sedley who kept almost entirely to his own quarter of the house and never mixed in any of the gay doings which took place there  numbers of people came to see mrs osborne  lady dobbin and daughters were delighted at her change of fortune and waited upon her  miss osborne from russell square came in her grand chariot with the flaming hammercloth emblazoned with the leeds arms  jos was reported to be immensely rich  old osborne had no objection that georgy should inherit his uncles property as well as his own damn it we will make a man of the feller he said and ill see him in parliament before i die  you may go and see his mother miss o though ill never set eyes on her  and miss osborne came emmy you may be sure was very glad to see her and so be brought nearer to george  that young fellow was allowed to come much more frequently than before to visit his mother  he dined once or twice a week in gillespie street and bullied the servants and his relations there just as he did in russell square  he was always respectful to major dobbin however and more modest in his demeanour when that gentleman was present  he was a clever lad and afraid of the major  george could not help admiring his friends simplicity his good humour his various learning quietly imparted his general love of truth and justice  he had met no such man as yet in the course of his experience and he had an instinctive liking for a gentleman  he hung fondly by his godfathers side and it was his delight to walk in the parks and hear dobbin talk  william told george about his father about india and waterloo about everything but himself  when george was more than usually pert and conceited the major made jokes at him which mrs osborne thought very cruel  one day taking him to the play and the boy declining to go into the pit because it was vulgar the major took him to the boxes left him there and went down himself to the pit  he had not been seated there very long before he felt an arm thrust under his and a dandy little hand in a kid glove squeezing his arm  george had seen the absurdity of his ways and come down from the upper region  a tender laugh of benevolence lighted up old dobbins face and eyes as he looked at the repentant little prodigal  he loved the boy as he did everything that belonged to amelia  how charmed she was when she heard of this instance of georges goodness  her eyes looked more kindly on dobbin than they ever had done  she blushed he thought after looking at him so  georgy never tired of his praises of the major to his mother  i like him mamma because he knows such lots of things and he aint like old veal who is always bragging and using such long words dont you know the chaps call him longtail at school  i gave him the name aint it capital but dob reads latin like english and french and that and when we go out together he tells me stories about my papa and never about himself though i heard colonel buckler at grandpapas say that he was one of the bravest officers in the army and had distinguished himself ever so much  grandpapa was quite surprised and said that feller  why i didnt think he could say bo to a goosebut i know he could couldnt he mamma  emmy laughed  she thought it was very likely the major could do thus much  if there was a sincere liking between george and the major it must be confessed that between the boy and his uncle no great love existed george had got a way of blowing out his cheeks and putting his hands in his waistcoat pockets and saying god bless my soul you dont say so so exactly after the fashion of old jos that it was impossible to refrain from laughter  the servants would explode at dinner if the lad asking for something which wasnt at table put on that countenance and used that favourite phrase  even dobbin would shoot out a sudden peal at the boys mimicry  if george did not mimic his uncle to his face it was only by dobbins rebukes and amelias terrified entreaties that the little scapegrace was induced to desist and the worthy civilian being haunted by a dim consciousness that the lad thought him an ass and was inclined to turn him into ridicule used to be extremely timorous and of course doubly pompous and dignified in the presence of master georgy  when it was announced that the young gentleman was expected in gillespie street to dine with his mother mr jos commonly found that he had an engagement at the club perhaps nobody was much grieved at his absence  on those days mr sedley would commonly be induced to come out from his place of refuge in the upper stories and there would be a small family party whereof major dobbin pretty generally formed one  he was the ami de la maisonold sedleys friend emmys friend georgys friend joss counsel and adviser he might almost as well be at madras for anything we see of him miss ann dobbin remarked at camberwell  ah  miss ann did it not strike you that it was not you whom the major wanted to marry  joseph sedley then led a life of dignified otiosity such as became a person of his eminence  his very first point of course was to become a member of the oriental club where he spent his mornings in the company of his brother indians where he dined or whence he brought home men to dine  amelia had to receive and entertain these gentlemen and their ladies from these she heard how soon smith would be in council how many lacs jones had brought home with him how thomsons house in london had refused the bills drawn by thomson kibobjee and co the bombay house and how it was thought the calcutta house must go too how very imprudent to say the least of it mrs browns conduct wife of brown of the ahmednuggur irregulars had been with young swankey of the body guard sitting up with him on deck until all hours and losing themselves as they were riding out at the cape how mrs hardyman had had out her thirteen sisters daughters of a country curate the rev felix rabbits and married eleven of them seven high up in the service how hornby was wild because his wife would stay in europe and trotter was appointed collector at ummerapoora  this and similar talk took place at the grand dinners all round  they had the same conversation the same silver dishes the same saddles of mutton boiled turkeys and entrees  politics set in a short time after dessert when the ladies retired upstairs and talked about their complaints and their children  mutato nomine it is all the same  dont the barristers wives talk about circuit dont the soldiers ladies gossip about the regiment dont the clergymens ladies discourse about sundayschools and who takes whose duty dont the very greatest ladies of all talk about that small clique of persons to whom they belong and why should our indian friends not have their own conversationonly i admit it is slow for the laymen whose fate it sometimes is to sit by and listen  before long emmy had a visitingbook and was driving about regularly in a carriage calling upon lady bludyer wife of majorgeneral sir roger bludyer kcb bengal army lady huff wife of sir g  huff bombay ditto mrs pice the lady of pice the director c  we are not long in using ourselves to changes in life  that carriage came round to gillespie street every day that buttony boy sprang up and down from the box with emmys and joss visitingcards at stated hours emmy and the carriage went for jos to the club and took him an airing or putting old sedley into the vehicle she drove the old man round the regents park  the ladys maid and the chariot the visitingbook and the buttony page became soon as familiar to amelia as the humble routine of brompton  she accommodated herself to one as to the other if fate had ordained that she should be a duchess she would even have done that duty too  she was voted in joss female society rather a pleasing young personnot much in her but pleasing and that sort of thing  the men as usual liked her artless kindness and simple refined demeanour  the gallant young indian dandies at home on furloughimmense dandies thesechained and moustacheddriving in tearing cabs the pillars of the theatres living at west end hotelsnevertheless admired mrs osborne liked to bow to her carriage in the park and to be admitted to have the honour of paying her a morning visit  swankey of the body guard himself that dangerous youth and the greatest buck of all the indian army now on leave was one day discovered by major dobbin teteatete with amelia and describing the sport of pigsticking to her with great humour and eloquence and he spoke afterwards of a dd kings officer thats always hanging about the housea long thin queerlooking oldish fellowa dry fellow though that took the shine out of a man in the talking line  had the major possessed a little more personal vanity he would have been jealous of so dangerous a young buck as that fascinating bengal captain  but dobbin was of too simple and generous a nature to have any doubts about amelia  he was glad that the young men should pay her respect and that others should admire her  ever since her womanhood almost had she not been persecuted and undervalued it pleased him to see how kindness bought out her good qualities and how her spirits gently rose with her prosperity  any person who appreciated her paid a compliment to the majors good judgementthat is if a man may be said to have good judgement who is under the influence of loves delusion  after jos went to court which we may be sure he did as a loyal subject of his sovereign showing himself in his full court suit at the club whither dobbin came to fetch him in a very shabby old uniform he who had always been a staunch loyalist and admirer of george iv became such a tremendous tory and pillar of the state that he was for having amelia to go to a drawingroom too  he somehow had worked himself up to believe that he was implicated in the maintenance of the public welfare and that the sovereign would not be happy unless jos sedley and his family appeared to rally round him at st  jamess  emmy laughed  shall i wear the family diamonds jos she said  i wish you would let me buy you some thought the major  i should like to see any that were too good for you    chapter lxi  in which two lights are put out  there came a day when the round of decorous pleasures and solemn gaieties in which mr jos sedleys family indulged was interrupted by an event which happens in most houses  as you ascend the staircase of your house from the drawing towards the bedroom floors you may have remarked a little arch in the wall right before you which at once gives light to the stair which leads from the second story to the third where the nursery and servants chambers commonly are and serves for another purpose of utility of which the undertakers men can give you a notion  they rest the coffins upon that arch or pass them through it so as not to disturb in any unseemly manner the cold tenant slumbering within the black ark  that secondfloor arch in a london house looking up and down the well of the staircase and commanding the main thoroughfare by which the inhabitants are passing by which cook lurks down before daylight to scour her pots and pans in the kitchen by which young master stealthily ascends having left his boots in the hall and let himself in after dawn from a jolly night at the club down which miss comes rustling in fresh ribbons and spreading muslins brilliant and beautiful and prepared for conquest and the ball or master tommy slides preferring the banisters for a mode of conveyance and disdaining danger and the stair down which the mother is fondly carried smiling in her strong husbands arms as he steps steadily step by step and followed by the monthly nurse on the day when the medical man has pronounced that the charming patient may go downstairs up which john lurks to bed yawning with a sputtering tallow candle and to gather up before sunrise the boots which are awaiting him in the passagesthat stair up or down which babies are carried old people are helped guests are marshalled to the ball the parson walks to the christening the doctor to the sickroom and the undertakers men to the upper floorwhat a memento of life death and vanity it isthat arch and stairif you choose to consider it and sit on the landing looking up and down the well  the doctor will come up to us too for the last time there my friend in motley  the nurse will look in at the curtains and you take no noticeand then she will fling open the windows for a little and let in the air  then they will pull down all the front blinds of the house and live in the back roomsthen they will send for the lawyer and other men in black c  your comedy and mine will have been played then and we shall be removed oh how far from the trumpets and the shouting and the posturemaking  if we are gentlefolks they will put hatchments over our late domicile with gilt cherubim and mottoes stating that there is quiet in heaven your son will new furnish the house or perhaps let it and go into a more modern quarter your name will be among the members deceased in the lists of your clubs next year however much you may be mourned your widow will like to have her weeds neatly madethe cook will send or come up to ask about dinnerthe survivor will soon bear to look at your picture over the mantelpiece which will presently be deposed from the place of honour to make way for the portrait of the son who reigns  which of the dead are most tenderly and passionately deplored those who love the survivors the least i believe  the death of a child occasions a passion of grief and frantic tears such as your end brother reader will never inspire  the death of an infant which scarce knew you which a weeks absence from you would have caused to forget you will strike you down more than the loss of your closest friend or your firstborn sona man grown like yourself with children of his own  we may be harsh and stern with judah and simeonour love and pity gush out for benjamin the little one and if you are old as some reader of this may be or shall be old and rich or old and pooryou may one day be thinking for yourselfthese people are very good round about me but they wont grieve too much when i am gone  i am very rich and they want my inheritanceor very poor and they are tired of supporting me  the period of mourning for mrs sedleys death was only just concluded and jos scarcely had had time to cast off his black and appear in the splendid waistcoats which he loved when it became evident to those about mr sedley that another event was at hand and that the old man was about to go seek for his wife in the dark land whither she had preceded him  the state of my fathers health jos sedley solemnly remarked at the club prevents me from giving any large parties this season  but if you will come in quietly at halfpast six chutney my boy and fake a homely dinner with one or two of the old seti shall be always glad to see you so jos and his acquaintances dined and drank their claret among themselves in silence whilst the sands of life were running out in the old mans glass upstairs  the velvetfooted butler brought them their wine and they composed themselves to a rubber after dinner at which major dobbin would sometimes come and take a hand and mrs osborne would occasionally descend when her patient above was settled for the night and had commenced one of those lightly troubled slumbers which visit the pillow of old age  the old man clung to his daughter during this sickness  he would take his broths and medicines from scarcely any other hand  to tend him became almost the sole business of her life  her bed was placed close by the door which opened into his chamber and she was alive at the slightest noise or disturbance from the couch of the querulous invalid though to do him justice he lay awake many an hour silent and without stirring unwilling to awaken his kind and vigilant nurse  he loved his daughter with more fondness now perhaps than ever he had done since the days of her childhood  in the discharge of gentle offices and kind filial duties this simple creature shone most especially  she walks into the room as silently as a sunbeam mr dobbin thought as he saw her passing in and out from her fathers room a cheerful sweetness lighting up her face as she moved to and fro graceful and noiseless  when women are brooding over their children or busied in a sickroom who has not seen in their faces those sweet angelic beams of love and pity  a secret feud of some years standing was thus healed and with a tacit reconciliation  in these last hours and touched by her love and goodness the old man forgot all his grief against her and wrongs which he and his wife had many a long night debated  how she had given up everything for her boy how she was careless of her parents in their old age and misfortune and only thought of the child how absurdly and foolishly impiously indeed she took on when george was removed from her  old sedley forgot these charges as he was making up his last account and did justice to the gentle and uncomplaining little martyr one night when she stole into his room she found him awake when the broken old man made his confession  oh emmy ive been thinking we were very unkind and unjust to you he said and put out his cold and feeble hand to her she knelt down and prayed by his bedside as he did too having still hold of her hand  when our turn comes friend may we have such company in our prayers  perhaps as he was lying awake then his life may have passed before himhis early hopeful struggles his manly successes and prosperity his downfall in his declining years and his present helpless conditionno chance of revenge against fortune which had had the better of himneither name nor money to bequeatha spentout bootless life of defeat and disappointment and the end here which i wonder brother reader is the better lot to die prosperous and famous or poor and disappointed to have and to be forced to yield or to sink out of life having played and lost the game that must be a strange feeling when a day of our life comes and we say tomorrow success or failure wont matter much and the sun will rise and all the myriads of mankind go to their work or their pleasure as usual but i shall be out of the turmoil  so there came one morning and sunrise when all the world got up and set about its various works and pleasures with the exception of old john sedley who was not to fight with fortune or to hope or scheme any more but to go and take up a quiet and utterly unknown residence in a churchyard at brompton by the side of his old wife  major dobbin jos and georgy followed his remains to the grave in a black cloth coach  jos came on purpose from the star and garter at richmond whither he retreated after the deplorable event  he did not care to remain in the house with theunder the circumstances you understand  but emmy stayed and did her duty as usual  she was bowed down by no especial grief and rather solemn than sorrowful  she prayed that her own end might be as calm and painless and thought with trust and reverence of the words which she had heard from her father during his illness indicative of his faith his resignation and his future hope  yes i think that will be the better ending of the two after all suppose you are particularly rich and welltodo and say on that last day i am very rich i am tolerably well known i have lived all my life in the best society and thank heaven come of a most respectable family  i have served my king and country with honour i was in parliament for several years where i may say my speeches were listened to and pretty well received i dont owe any man a shilling on the contrary i lent my old college friend jack lazarus fifty pounds for which my executors will not press him  i leave my daughters with ten thousand pounds apiecevery good portions for girls i bequeath my plate and furniture my house in baker street with a handsome jointure to my widow for her life and my landed property besides money in the funds and my cellar of wellselected wine in baker street to my son  i leave twenty pound a year to my valet and i defy any man after i have gone to find anything against my character or suppose on the other hand your swan sings quite a different sort of dirge and you say i am a poor blighted disappointed old fellow and have made an utter failure through life i was not endowed either with brains or with good fortune and confess that i have committed a hundred mistakes and blunders i own to having forgotten my duty many a time  i cant pay what i owe  on my last bed i lie utterly helpless and humble and i pray forgiveness for my weakness and throw myself with a contrite heart at the feet of the divine mercy which of these two speeches think you would be the best oration for your own funeral old sedley made the last and in that humble frame of mind and holding by the hand of his daughter life and disappointment and vanity sank away from under him  you see said old osborne to george what comes of merit and industry and judicious speculations and that  look at me and my bankers account  look at your poor grandfather sedley and his failure  and yet he was a better man than i was this day twenty yearsa better man i should say by ten thousand pound  beyond these people and mr clapps family who came over from brompton to pay a visit of condolence not a single soul alive ever cared a penny piece about old john sedley or remembered the existence of such a person  when old osborne first heard from his friend colonel buckler as little georgy had already informed us how distinguished an officer major dobbin was he exhibited a great deal of scornful incredulity and expressed his surprise how ever such a feller as that should possess either brains or reputation  but he heard of the majors fame from various members of his society  sir william dobbin had a great opinion of his son and narrated many stories illustrative of the majors learning valour and estimation in the worlds opinion finally his name appeared in the lists of one or two great parties of the nobility and this circumstance had a prodigious effect upon the old aristocrat of russell square  the majors position as guardian to georgy whose possession had been ceded to his grandfather rendered some meetings between the two gentlemen inevitable and it was in one of these that old osborne a keen man of business looking into the majors accounts with his ward and the boys mother got a hint which staggered him very much and at once pained and pleased him that it was out of william dobbins own pocket that a part of the fund had been supplied upon which the poor widow and the child had subsisted  when pressed upon the point dobbin who could not tell lies blushed and stammered a good deal and finally confessed  the marriage he said at which his interlocutors face grew dark was very much my doing  i thought my poor friend had gone so far that retreat from his engagement would have been dishonour to him and death to mrs osborne and i could do no less when she was left without resources than give what money i could spare to maintain her  major d mr osborne said looking hard at him and turning very red tooyou did me a great injury but give me leave to tell you sir you are an honest feller theres my hand sir though i little thought that my flesh and blood was living on you and the pair shook hands with great confusion on major dobbins part thus found out in his act of charitable hypocrisy  he strove to soften the old man and reconcile him towards his sons memory  he was such a noble fellow he said that all of us loved him and would have done anything for him  i as a young man in those days was flattered beyond measure by his preference for me and was more pleased to be seen in his company than in that of the commanderinchief  i never saw his equal for pluck and daring and all the qualities of a soldier and dobbin told the old father as many stories as he could remember regarding the gallantry and achievements of his son  and georgy is so like him the major added  hes so like him that he makes me tremble sometimes the grandfather said  on one or two evenings the major came to dine with mr osborne it was during the time of the sickness of mr sedley and as the two sat together in the evening after dinner all their talk was about the departed hero the father boasted about him according to his wont glorifying himself in recounting his sons feats and gallantry but his mood was at any rate better and more charitable than that in which he had been disposed until now to regard the poor fellow and the christian heart of the kind major was pleased at these symptoms of returning peace and goodwill  on the second evening old osborne called dobbin william just as he used to do at the time when dobbin and george were boys together and the honest gentleman was pleased by that mark of reconciliation  on the next day at breakfast when miss osborne with the asperity of her age and character ventured to make some remark reflecting slightingly upon the majors appearance or behaviourthe master of the house interrupted her  youd have been glad enough to git him for yourself miss o  but them grapes are sour  ha  ha major william is a fine feller  that he is grandpapa said georgy approvingly and going up close to the old gentleman he took a hold of his large grey whiskers and laughed in his face goodhumouredly and kissed him  and he told the story at night to his mother who fully agreed with the boy indeed he is she said  your dear father always said so he is one of the best and most upright of men dobbin happened to drop in very soon after this conversation which made amelia blush perhaps and the young scapegrace increased the confusion by telling dobbin the other part of the story  i say dob he said theres such an uncommon nice girl wants to marry you  shes plenty of tin she wears a front and she scolds the servants from morning till night who is it asked dobbin   its aunt o the boy answered grandpapa said so  and i say dob how prime it would be to have you for my uncle old sedleys quavering voice from the next room at this moment weakly called for amelia and the laughing ended  that old osbornes mind was changing was pretty clear he asked george about his uncle sometimes and laughed at the boys imitation of the way in which jos said godblessmysoul and gobbled his soup  then he said its not respectful sir of you younkers to be imitating of your relations  miss o when you go out adriving today leave my card upon mr sedley do you hear theres no quarrel betwigst me and him anyhow  the card was returned and jos and the major were asked to dinnerto a dinner the most splendid and stupid that perhaps ever mr osborne gave every inch of the family plate was exhibited and the best company was asked  mr sedley took down miss o  to dinner and she was very gracious to him whereas she hardly spoke to the major who sat apart from her and by the side of mr osborne very timid  jos said with great solemnity it was the best turtle soup he had ever tasted in his life and asked mr osborne where he got his madeira  it is some of sedleys wine whispered the butler to his master ive had it a long time and paid a good figure for it too mr osborne said aloud to his guest and then whispered to his righthand neighbour how he had got it at the old chaps sale  more than once he asked the major aboutabout mrs george osbornea theme on which the major could be very eloquent when he chose  he told mr osborne of her sufferingsof her passionate attachment to her husband whose memory she worshipped stillof the tender and dutiful manner in which she had supported her parents and given up her boy when it seemed to her her duty to do so  you dont know what she endured sir said honest dobbin with a tremor in his voice and i hope and trust you will be reconciled to her  if she took your son away from you she gave hers to you and however much you loved your george depend on it she loved hers ten times more  by god you are a good feller sir was all mr osborne said  it had never struck him that the widow would feel any pain at parting from the boy or that his having a fine fortune could grieve her  a reconciliation was announced as speedy and inevitable and amelias heart already began to beat at the notion of the awful meeting with georges father  it was never however destined to take place  old sedleys lingering illness and death supervened after which a meeting was for some time impossible  that catastrophe and other events may have worked upon mr osborne  he was much shaken of late and aged and his mind was working inwardly  he had sent for his lawyers and probably changed something in his will  the medical man who looked in pronounced him shaky agitated and talked of a little blood and the seaside but he took neither of these remedies  one day when he should have come down to breakfast his servant missing him went into his dressingroom and found him lying at the foot of the dressingtable in a fit  miss osborne was apprised the doctors were sent for georgy stopped away from school the bleeders and cuppers came  osborne partially regained cognizance but never could speak again though he tried dreadfully once or twice and in four days he died  the doctors went down and the undertakers men went up the stairs and all the shutters were shut towards the garden in russell square  bullock rushed from the city in a hurry how much money had he left to that boy not half surely surely share and share alike between the three it was an agitating moment  what was it that poor old man tried once or twice in vain to say i hope it was that he wanted to see amelia and be reconciled before he left the world to one dear and faithful wife of his son  it was most likely that for his will showed that the hatred which he had so long cherished had gone out of his heart  they found in the pocket of his dressinggown the letter with the great red seal which george had written him from waterloo  he had looked at the other papers too relative to his son for the key of the box in which he kept them was also in his pocket and it was found the seals and envelopes had been brokenvery likely on the night before the seizurewhen the butler had taken him tea into his study and found him reading in the great red family bible  when the will was opened it was found that half the property was left to george and the remainder between the two sisters  mr bullock to continue for their joint benefit the affairs of the commercial house or to go out as he thought fit  an annuity of five hundred pounds chargeable on georges property was left to his mother the widow of my beloved son george osborne who was to resume the guardianship of the boy  major william dobbin my beloved sons friend was appointed executor and as out of his kindness and bounty and with his own private funds he maintained my grandson and my sons widow when they were otherwise without means of support the testator went on to say i hereby thank him heartily for his love and regard for them and beseech him to accept such a sum as may be sufficient to purchase his commission as a lieutenantcolonel or to be disposed of in any way he may think fit  when amelia heard that her fatherinlaw was reconciled to her her heart melted and she was grateful for the fortune left to her  but when she heard how georgy was restored to her and knew how and by whom and how it was williams bounty that supported her in poverty how it was william who gave her her husband and her sonoh then she sank on her knees and prayed for blessings on that constant and kind heart she bowed down and humbled herself and kissed the feet as it were of that beautiful and generous affection  and gratitude was all that she had to pay back for such admirable devotion and benefitsonly gratitude  if she thought of any other return the image of george stood up out of the grave and said you are mine and mine only now and forever  william knew her feelings  had he not passed his whole life in divining them  when the nature of mr osbornes will became known to the world it was edifying to remark how mrs george osborne rose in the estimation of the people forming her circle of acquaintance  the servants of joss establishment who used to question her humble orders and say they would ask master whether or not they could obey never thought now of that sort of appeal  the cook forgot to sneer at her shabby old gowns which indeed were quite eclipsed by that ladys finery when she was dressed to go to church of a sunday evening the others no longer grumbled at the sound of her bell or delayed to answer that summons the coachman who grumbled that his osses should be brought out and his carriage made into an hospital for that old feller and mrs o drove her with the utmost alacrity now and trembling lest he should be superseded by mr osbornes coachman asked what them there russell square coachmen knew about town and whether they was fit to sit on a box before a lady joss friends male and female suddenly became interested about emmy and cards of condolence multiplied on her hall table  jos himself who had looked on her as a goodnatured harmless pauper to whom it was his duty to give victuals and shelter paid her and the rich little boy his nephew the greatest respectwas anxious that she should have change and amusement after her troubles and trials poor dear girland began to appear at the breakfasttable and most particularly to ask how she would like to dispose of the day  in her capacity of guardian to georgy she with the consent of the major her fellowtrustee begged miss osborne to live in the russell square house as long as ever she chose to dwell there but that lady with thanks declared that she never could think of remaining alone in that melancholy mansion and departed in deep mourning to cheltenham with a couple of her old domestics the rest were liberally paid and dismissed the faithful old butler whom mrs osborne proposed to retain resigning and preferring to invest his savings in a publichouse where let us hope he was not unprosperous miss osborne not choosing to live in russell square mrs osborne also after consultation declined to occupy the gloomy old mansion there  the house was dismantled the rich furniture and effects the awful chandeliers and dreary blank mirrors packed away and hidden the rich rosewood drawingroom suite was muffled in straw the carpets were rolled up and corded the small select library of wellbound books was stowed into two winechests and the whole paraphernalia rolled away in several enormous vans to the pantechnicon where they were to lie until georgys majority  and the great heavy dark platechests went off to messrs  stumpy and rowdy to lie in the cellars of those eminent bankers until the same period should arrive  one day emmy with george in her hand and clad in deep sables went to visit the deserted mansion which she had not entered since she was a girl  the place in front was littered with straw where the vans had been laden and rolled off  they went into the great blank rooms the walls of which bore the marks where the pictures and mirrors had hung then they went up the great blank stone staircases into the upper rooms into that where grandpapa died as george said in a whisper and then higher still into georges own room  the boy was still clinging by her side but she thought of another besides him  she knew that it had been his fathers room as well as his own  she went up to one of the open windows one of those at which she used to gaze with a sick heart when the child was first taken from her and thence as she looked out she could see over the trees of russell square the old house in which she herself was born and where she had passed so many happy days of sacred youth they all came back to her the pleasant holidays the kind faces the careless joyful past times and the long pains and trials that had since cast her down she thought of these and of the man who had been her constant protector her good genius her sole benefactor her tender and generous friend  look here mother said georgy heres a go scratched on the glass with a diamond i never saw it before i never did it  it was your fathers room long before you were born george she said and she blushed as she kissed the boy  she was very silent as they drove back to richmond where they had taken a temporary house  where the smiling lawyers used to come bustling over to see her and we may be sure noted the visit in the bill  and where of course there was a room for major dobbin too who rode over frequently having much business to transact on behalf of his little ward  georgy at this time was removed from mr veals on an unlimited holiday and that gentleman was engaged to prepare an inscription for a fine marble slab to be placed up in the foundling under the monument of captain george osborne  the female bullock aunt of georgy although despoiled by that little monster of onehalf of the sum which she expected from her father nevertheless showed her charitableness of spirit by being reconciled to the mother and the boy  roehampton is not far from richmond and one day the chariot with the golden bullocks emblazoned on the panels and the flaccid children within drove to amelias house at richmond and the bullock family made an irruption into the garden where amelia was reading a book jos was in an arbour placidly dipping strawberries into wine and the major in one of his indian jackets was giving a back to georgy who chose to jump over him  he went over his head and bounded into the little advance of bullocks with immense black bows in their hats and huge black sashes accompanying their mourning mamma  he is just of the age for rosa the fond parent thought and glanced towards that dear child an unwholesome little miss of seven years of age  rosa go and kiss your dear cousin mrs frederick said  dont you know me george i am your aunt  i know you well enough george said but i dont like kissing please and he retreated from the obedient caresses of his cousin  take me to your dear mamma you droll child mrs frederick said and those ladies accordingly met after an absence of more than fifteen years  during emmys cares and poverty the other had never once thought about coming to see her but now that she was decently prosperous in the world her sisterinlaw came to her as a matter of course  so did numbers more  our old friend miss swartz and her husband came thundering over from hampton court with flaming yellow liveries and was as impetuously fond of amelia as ever  miss swartz would have liked her always if she could have seen her  one must do her that justice  but que voulez vousin this vast town one has not the time to go and seek ones friends if they drop out of the rank they disappear and we march on without them  who is ever missed in vanity fair  but so in a word and before the period of grief for mr osbornes death had subsided emmy found herself in the centre of a very genteel circle indeed the members of which could not conceive that anybody belonging to it was not very lucky  there was scarce one of the ladies that hadnt a relation a peer though the husband might be a drysalter in the city  some of the ladies were very blue and well informed reading mrs somerville and frequenting the royal institution others were severe and evangelical and held by exeter hall emmy it must be owned found herself entirely at a loss in the midst of their clavers and suffered woefully on the one or two occasions on which she was compelled to accept mrs frederick bullocks hospitalities  that lady persisted in patronizing her and determined most graciously to form her  she found amelias milliners for her and regulated her household and her manners  she drove over constantly from roehampton and entertained her friend with faint fashionable fiddlefaddle and feeble court slipslop jos liked to hear it but the major used to go off growling at the appearance of this woman with her twopenny gentility he went to sleep under frederick bullocks bald head after dinner at one of the bankers best parties fred was still anxious that the balance of the osborne property should be transferred from stumpy and rowdys to them and whilst amelia who did not know latin or who wrote the last crack article in the edinburgh and did not in the least deplore or otherwise mr peels late extraordinary tergiversation on the fatal catholic relief bill sat dumb amongst the ladies in the grand drawingroom looking out upon velvet lawns trim gravel walks and glistening hothouses  she seems goodnatured but insipid said mrs rowdy that major seems to be particularly epris  she wants ton sadly said mrs hollyock  my dear creature you never will be able to form her  she is dreadfully ignorant or indifferent said mrs glowry with a voice as if from the grave and a sad shake of the head and turban i asked her if she thought that it was in 1836 according to mr jowls or in 1839 according to mr wapshot that the pope was to fall and she saidpoor pope  i hope notwhat has he done  she is my brothers widow my dear friends mrs frederick replied and as such i think were all bound to give her every attention and instruction on entering into the world  you may fancy there can be no mercenary motives in those whose disappointments are well known  that poor dear mrs bullock said rowdy to hollyock as they drove away togethershe is always scheming and managing  she wants mrs osbornes account to be taken from our house to hersand the way in which she coaxes that boy and makes him sit by that bleareyed little rosa is perfectly ridiculous  i wish glowry was choked with her man of sin and her battle of armageddon cried the other and the carriage rolled away over putney bridge  but this sort of society was too cruelly genteel for emmy and all jumped for joy when a foreign tour was proposed    chapter lxii  am rhein  the above everyday events had occurred and a few weeks had passed when on one fine morning parliament being over the summer advanced and all the good company in london about to quit that city for their annual tour in search of pleasure or health the batavier steamboat left the towerstairs laden with a goodly company of english fugitives the quarterdeck awnings were up and the benches and gangways crowded with scores of rosy children bustling nursemaids ladies in the prettiest pink bonnets and summer dresses gentlemen in travelling caps and linenjackets whose mustachios had just begun to sprout for the ensuing tour and stout trim old veterans with starched neckcloths and neatbrushed hats such as have invaded europe any time since the conclusion of the war and carry the national goddem into every city of the continent  the congregation of hatboxes and bramah desks and dressingcases was prodigious  there were jaunty young cambridgemen travelling with their tutor and going for a reading excursion to nonnenwerth or konigswinter there were irish gentlemen with the most dashing whiskers and jewellery talking about horses incessantly and prodigiously polite to the young ladies on board whom on the contrary the cambridge lads and their palefaced tutor avoided with maiden coyness there were old pall mall loungers bound for ems and wiesbaden and a course of waters to clear off the dinners of the season and a little roulette and trenteetquarante to keep the excitement going there was old methuselah who had married his young wife with captain papillon of the guards holding her parasol and guidebooks there was young may who was carrying off his bride on a pleasure tour mrs winter that was and who had been at school with mays grandmother there was sir john and my lady with a dozen children and corresponding nursemaids and the great grandee bareacres family that sat by themselves near the wheel stared at everybody and spoke to no one  their carriages emblazoned with coronets and heaped with shining imperials were on the foredeck locked in with a dozen more such vehicles  it was difficult to pass in and out amongst them and the poor inmates of the forecabin had scarcely any space for locomotion  these consisted of a few magnificently attired gentlemen from houndsditch who brought their own provisions and could have bought half the gay people in the grand saloon a few honest fellows with mustachios and portfolios who set to sketching before they had been half an hour on board one or two french femmes de chambre who began to be dreadfully ill by the time the boat had passed greenwich a groom or two who lounged in the neighbourhood of the horseboxes under their charge or leaned over the side by the paddlewheels and talked about who was good for the leger and what they stood to win or lose for the goodwood cup  all the couriers when they had done plunging about the ship and had settled their various masters in the cabins or on the deck congregated together and began to chatter and smoke the hebrew gentlemen joining them and looking at the carriages  there was sir johns great carriage that would hold thirteen people my lord methuselahs carriage my lord bareacres chariot britzska and fourgon that anybody might pay for who liked it was a wonder how my lord got the ready money to pay for the expenses of the journey the hebrew gentlemen knew how he got it they knew what money his lordship had in his pocket at that instant and what interest he paid for it and who gave it him  finally there was a very neat handsome travelling carriage about which the gentlemen speculated  a qui cette voiture la said one gentlemancourier with a large morocco moneybag and earrings to another with earrings and a large morocco moneybag  cest a kirsch je benseje lai vu toute a lheurequi brenoit des sangviches dans la voiture said the courier in a fine german french  kirsch emerging presently from the neighbourhood of the hold where he had been bellowing instructions intermingled with polyglot oaths to the ships men engaged in secreting the passengers luggage came to give an account of himself to his brother interpreters  he informed them that the carriage belonged to a nabob from calcutta and jamaica enormously rich and with whom he was engaged to travel and at this moment a young gentleman who had been warned off the bridge between the paddleboxes and who had dropped thence on to the roof of lord methuselahs carriage from which he made his way over other carriages and imperials until he had clambered on to his own descended thence and through the window into the body of the carriage to the applause of the couriers looking on  nous allons avoir une belle traversee monsieur george said the courier with a grin as he lifted his goldlaced cap  d your french said the young gentleman wheres the biscuits ay whereupon kirsch answered him in the english language or in such an imitation of it as he could commandfor though he was familiar with all languages mr kirsch was not acquainted with a single one and spoke all with indifferent volubility and incorrectness  the imperious young gentleman who gobbled the biscuits and indeed it was time to refresh himself for he had breakfasted at richmond full three hours before was our young friend george osborne  uncle jos and his mamma were on the quarterdeck with a gentleman of whom they used to see a good deal and the four were about to make a summer tour  jos was seated at that moment on deck under the awning and pretty nearly opposite to the earl of bareacres and his family whose proceedings absorbed the bengalee almost entirely  both the noble couple looked rather younger than in the eventful year 15 when jos remembered to have seen them at brussels indeed he always gave out in india that he was intimately acquainted with them  lady bareacres hair which was then dark was now a beautiful golden auburn whereas lord bareacres whiskers formerly red were at present of a rich black with purple and green reflections in the light  but changed as they were the movements of the noble pair occupied joss mind entirely the presence of a lord fascinated him and he could look at nothing else  those people seem to interest you a good deal said dobbin laughing and watching him  amelia too laughed she was in a straw bonnet with black ribbons and otherwise dressed in mourning but the little bustle and holiday of the journey pleased and excited her and she looked particularly happy  what a heavenly day emmy said and added with great originality i hope we shall have a calm passage  jos waved his hand scornfully glancing at the same time under his eyelids at the great folks opposite  if you had made the voyages we have he said you wouldnt much care about the weather but nevertheless traveller as he was he passed the night direfully sick in his carriage where his courier tended him with brandyandwater and every luxury  in due time this happy party landed at the quays of rotterdam whence they were transported by another steamer to the city of cologne  here the carriage and the family took to the shore and jos was not a little gratified to see his arrival announced in the cologne newspapers as herr graf lord von sedley nebst begleitung aus london he had his court dress with him he had insisted that dobbin should bring his regimental paraphernalia he announced that it was his intention to be presented at some foreign courts and pay his respects to the sovereigns of the countries which he honoured with a visit  wherever the party stopped and an opportunity was offered mr jos left his own card and the majors upon our minister it was with great difficulty that he could be restrained from putting on his cocked hat and tights to wait upon the english consul at the free city of judenstadt when that hospitable functionary asked our travellers to dinner  he kept a journal of his voyage and noted elaborately the defects or excellences of the various inns at which he put up and of the wines and dishes of which he partook  as for emmy she was very happy and pleased  dobbin used to carry about for her her stool and sketchbook and admired the drawings of the goodnatured little artist as they never had been admired before she sat upon steamers decks and drew crags and castles or she mounted upon donkeys and ascended to ancient robbertowers attended by her two aidesdecamp georgy and dobbin  she laughed and the major did too at his droll figure on donkeyback with his long legs touching the ground  he was the interpreter for the party having a good military knowledge of the german language and he and the delighted george fought the campaigns of the rhine and the palatinate  in the course of a few weeks and by assiduously conversing with herr kirsch on the box of the carriage georgy made prodigious advance in the knowledge of high dutch and could talk to hotel waiters and postilions in a way that charmed his mother and amused his guardian  mr jos did not much engage in the afternoon excursions of his fellowtravellers  he slept a good deal after dinner or basked in the arbours of the pleasant inngardens  pleasant rhine gardens fair scenes of peace and sunshinenoble purple mountains whose crests are reflected in the magnificent streamwho has ever seen you that has not a grateful memory of those scenes of friendly repose and beauty to lay down the pen and even to think of that beautiful rhineland makes one happy  at this time of summer evening the cows are trooping down from the hills lowing and with their bells tinkling to the old town with its old moats and gates and spires and chestnuttrees with long blue shadows stretching over the grass the sky and the river below flame in crimson and gold and the moon is already out looking pale towards the sunset  the sun sinks behind the great castlecrested mountains the night falls suddenly the river grows darker and darker lights quiver in it from the windows in the old ramparts and twinkle peacefully in the villages under the hills on the opposite shore  so jos used to go to sleep a good deal with his bandanna over his face and be very comfortable and read all the english news and every word of galignanis admirable newspaper may the blessings of all englishmen who have ever been abroad rest on the founders and proprietors of that piratical print   and whether he woke or slept his friends did not very much miss him  yes they were very happy  they went to the opera often of eveningsto those snug unassuming dear old operas in the german towns where the noblesse sits and cries and knits stockings on the one side over against the bourgeoisie on the other and his transparency the duke and his transparent family all very fat and goodnatured come and occupy the great box in the middle and the pit is full of the most elegant slimwaisted officers with strawcoloured mustachios and twopence a day on full pay here it was that emmy found her delight and was introduced for the first time to the wonders of mozart and cimarosa the majors musical taste has been before alluded to and his performances on the flute commended but perhaps the chief pleasure he had in these operas was in watching emmys rapture while listening to them a new world of love and beauty broke upon her when she was introduced to those divine compositions this lady had the keenest and finest sensibility and how could she be indifferent when she heard mozart the tender parts of don juan awakened in her raptures so exquisite that she would ask herself when she went to say her prayers of a night whether it was not wicked to feel so much delight as that with which vedrai carino and batti batti filled her gentle little bosom but the major whom she consulted upon this head as her theological adviser and who himself had a pious and reverent soul said that for his part every beauty of art or nature made him thankful as well as happy and that the pleasure to be had in listening to fine music as in looking at the stars in the sky or at a beautiful landscape or picture was a benefit for which we might thank heaven as sincerely as for any other worldly blessing  and in reply to some faint objections of mrs amelias taken from certain theological works like the washerwoman of finchley common and others of that school with which mrs osborne had been furnished during her life at brompton he told her an eastern fable of the owl who thought that the sunshine was unbearable for the eyes and that the nightingale was a most overrated bird  it is ones nature to sing and the others to hoot he said laughing and with such a sweet voice as you have yourself you must belong to the bulbul faction  i like to dwell upon this period of her life and to think that she was cheerful and happy  you see she has not had too much of that sort of existence as yet and has not fallen in the way of means to educate her tastes or her intelligence  she has been domineered over hitherto by vulgar intellects  it is the lot of many a woman and as every one of the dear sex is the rival of the rest of her kind timidity passes for folly in their charitable judgments and gentleness for dulness and silencewhich is but timid denial of the unwelcome assertion of ruling folks and tacit protestantismabove all finds no mercy at the hands of the female inquisition thus my dear and civilized reader if you and i were to find ourselves this evening in a society of greengrocers let us say it is probable that our conversation would not be brilliant if on the other hand a greengrocer should find himself at your refined and polite teatable where everybody was saying witty things and everybody of fashion and repute tearing her friends to pieces in the most delightful manner it is possible that the stranger would not be very talkative and by no means interesting or interested  and it must be remembered that this poor lady had never met a gentleman in her life until this present moment  perhaps these are rarer personages than some of us think for  which of us can point out many such in his circlemen whose aims are generous whose truth is constant and not only constant in its kind but elevated in its degree whose want of meanness makes them simple who can look the world honestly in the face with an equal manly sympathy for the great and the small we all know a hundred whose coats are very well made and a score who have excellent manners and one or two happy beings who are what they call in the inner circles and have shot into the very centre and bullseye of the fashion but of gentlemen how many let us take a little scrap of paper and each make out his list  my friend the major i write without any doubt in mine  he had very long legs a yellow face and a slight lisp which at first was rather ridiculous  but his thoughts were just his brains were fairly good his life was honest and pure and his heart warm and humble  he certainly had very large hands and feet which the two george osbornes used to caricature and laugh at and their jeers and laughter perhaps led poor little emmy astray as to his worth  but have we not all been misled about our heroes and changed our opinions a hundred times emmy in this happy time found that hers underwent a very great change in respect of the merits of the major  perhaps it was the happiest time of both their lives indeed if they did but know itand who does which of us can point out and say that was the culminationthat was the summit of human joy but at all events this couple were very decently contented and enjoyed as pleasant a summer tour as any pair that left england that year georgy was always present at the play but it was the major who put emmys shawl on after the entertainment and in the walks and excursions the young lad would be on ahead and up a towerstair or a tree whilst the soberer couple were below the major smoking his cigar with great placidity and constancy whilst emmy sketched the site or the ruin  it was on this very tour that i the present writer of a history of which every word is true had the pleasure to see them first and to make their acquaintance  it was at the little comfortable ducal town of pumpernickel that very place where sir pitt crawley had been so distinguished as an attache but that was in early early days and before the news of the battle of austerlitz sent all the english diplomatists in germany to the right about that i first saw colonel dobbin and his party  they had arrived with the carriage and courier at the erbprinz hotel the best of the town and the whole party dined at the table dhote  everybody remarked the majesty of jos and the knowing way in which he sipped or rather sucked the johannisberger which he ordered for dinner  the little boy too we observed had a famous appetite and consumed schinken and braten and kartoffeln and cranberry jam and salad and pudding and roast fowls and sweetmeats with a gallantry that did honour to his nation  after about fifteen dishes he concluded the repast with dessert some of which he even carried out of doors for some young gentlemen at table amused with his coolness and gallant freeandeasy manner induced him to pocket a handful of macaroons which he discussed on his way to the theatre whither everybody went in the cheery social little german place the lady in black the boys mamma laughed and blushed and looked exceedingly pleased and shy as the dinner went on and at the various feats and instances of espieglerie on the part of her son  the colonelfor so he became very soon afterwardsi remember joked the boy with a great deal of grave fun pointing out dishes which he hadnt tried and entreating him not to baulk his appetite but to have a second supply of this or that  it was what they call a gastrolle night at the royal grand ducal pumpernickelisch hofor court theatreand madame schroeder devrient then in the bloom of her beauty and genius performed the part of the heroine in the wonderful opera of fidelio  from our places in the stalls we could see our four friends of the table dhote in the loge which schwendler of the erbprinz kept for his best guests and i could not help remarking the effect which the magnificent actress and music produced upon mrs osborne for so we heard the stout gentleman in the mustachios call her  during the astonishing chorus of the prisoners over which the delightful voice of the actress rose and soared in the most ravishing harmony the english ladys face wore such an expression of wonder and delight that it struck even little fipps the blase attache who drawled out as he fixed his glass upon her gayd it really does one good to see a woman caypable of that stayt of excaytement and in the prison scene where fidelio rushing to her husband cries nichts nichts mein florestan she fairly lost herself and covered her face with her handkerchief  every woman in the house was snivelling at the time but i suppose it was because it was predestined that i was to write this particular ladys memoirs that i remarked her  the next day they gave another piece of beethoven die schlacht bei vittoria  malbrook is introduced at the beginning of the performance as indicative of the brisk advance of the french army then come drums trumpets thunders of artillery and groans of the dying and at last in a grand triumphal swell god save the king is performed  there may have been a score of englishmen in the house but at the burst of that beloved and wellknown music every one of them we young fellows in the stalls sir john and lady bullminster who had taken a house at pumpernickel for the education of their nine children the fat gentleman with the mustachios the long major in white duck trousers and the lady with the little boy upon whom he was so sweet even kirsch the courier in the gallery stood bolt upright in their places and proclaimed themselves to be members of the dear old british nation  as for tapeworm the charge daffaires he rose up in his box and bowed and simpered as if he would represent the whole empire tapeworm was nephew and heir of old marshal tiptoff who has been introduced in this story as general tiptoff just before waterloo who was colonel of the th regiment in which major dobbin served and who died in this year full of honours and of an aspic of plovers eggs when the regiment was graciously given by his majesty to colonel sir michael odowd kcb  who had commanded it in many glorious fields  tapeworm must have met with colonel dobbin at the house of the colonels colonel the marshal for he recognized him on this night at the theatre and with the utmost condescension his majestys minister came over from his own box and publicly shook hands with his newfound friend  look at that infernal slyboots of a tapeworm fipps whispered examining his chief from the stalls wherever theres a pretty woman he always twists himself in and i wonder what were diplomatists made for but for that  have i the honour of addressing myself to mrs dobbin asked the secretary with a most insinuating grin  georgy burst out laughing and said by jove that was a good un emmy and the major blushed  we saw them from the stalls  this lady is mrs george osborne said the major and this is her brother mr sedley a distinguished officer of the bengal civil service  permit me to introduce him to your lordship  my lord nearly sent jos off his legs with the most fascinating smile are you going to stop in pumpernickel he said  it is a dull place but we want some nice people and we would try and make it so agreeable to you  mrahummrsoho  i shall do myself the honour of calling upon you tomorrow at your inn and he went away with a parthian grin and glance which he thought must finish mrs osborne completely  the performance over the young fellows lounged about the lobbies and we saw the society take its departure the duchess dowager went off in her jingling old coach attended by two faithful and withered old maids of honour and a little snuffy spindleshanked gentleman in waiting in a brown jasey and a green coat covered with ordersof which the star and the grand yellow cordon of the order of st michael of pumpernickel were most conspicuous  the drums rolled the guards saluted and the old carriage drove away  then came his transparency the duke and transparent family with his great officers of state and household  he bowed serenely to everybody and amid the saluting of the guards and the flaring of the torches of the running footmen clad in scarlet the transparent carriages drove away to the old ducal schloss with its towers and pinacles standing on the schlossberg  everybody in pumpernickel knew everybody  no sooner was a foreigner seen there than the minister of foreign affairs or some other great or small officer of state went round to the erbprinz and found out the name of the new arrival  we watched them too out of the theatre  tapeworm had just walked off enveloped in his cloak with which his gigantic chasseur was always in attendance and looking as much as possible like don juan the prime ministers lady had just squeezed herself into her sedan and her daughter the charming ida had put on her calash and clogs when the english party came out the boy yawning drearily the major taking great pains in keeping the shawl over mrs osbornes head and mr sedley looking grand with a crush operahat on one side of his head and his hand in the stomach of a voluminous white waistcoat  we took off our hats to our acquaintances of the table dhote and the lady in return presented us with a little smile and a curtsey for which everybody might be thankful  the carriage from the inn under the superintendence of the bustling mr kirsch was in waiting to convey the party but the fat man said he would walk and smoke his cigar on his way homewards so the other three with nods and smiles to us went without mr sedley kirsch with the cigar case following in his masters wake  we all walked together and talked to the stout gentleman about the agremens of the place  it was very agreeable for the english there were shootingparties and battues there was a plenty of balls and entertainments at the hospitable court the society was generally good the theatre excellent and the living cheap  and our minister seems a most delightful and affable person our new friend said  with such a representative andand a good medical man i can fancy the place to be most eligible  goodnight gentlemen and jos creaked up the stairs to bedward followed by kirsch with a flambeau  we rather hoped that nicelooking woman would be induced to stay some time in the town    chapter lxiii  in which we meet an old acquaintance  such polite behaviour as that of lord tapeworm did not fail to have the most favourable effect upon mr sedleys mind and the very next morning at breakfast he pronounced his opinion that pumpernickel was the pleasantest little place of any which he had visited on their tour joss motives and artifices were not very difficult of comprehension and dobbin laughed in his sleeve like a hypocrite as he was when he found by the knowing air of the civilian and the offhand manner in which the latter talked about tapeworm castle and the other members of the family that jos had been up already in the morning consulting his travelling peerage  yes he had seen the right honourable the earl of bagwig his lordships father he was sure he had he had met him atat the leveedidnt dob remember and when the diplomatist called on the party faithful to his promise jos received him with such a salute and honours as were seldom accorded to the little envoy  he winked at kirsch on his excellencys arrival and that emissary instructed beforehand went out and superintended an entertainment of cold meats jellies and other delicacies brought in upon trays and of which mr jos absolutely insisted that his noble guest should partake  tapeworm so long as he could have an opportunity of admiring the bright eyes of mrs osborne whose freshness of complexion bore daylight remarkably well was not ill pleased to accept any invitation to stay in mr sedleys lodgings he put one or two dexterous questions to him about india and the dancinggirls there asked amelia about that beautiful boy who had been with her and complimented the astonished little woman upon the prodigious sensation which she had made in the house and tried to fascinate dobbin by talking of the late war and the exploits of the pumpernickel contingent under the command of the hereditary prince now duke of pumpernickel  lord tapeworm inherited no little portion of the family gallantry and it was his happy belief that almost every woman upon whom he himself cast friendly eyes was in love with him  he left emmy under the persuasion that she was slain by his wit and attractions and went home to his lodgings to write a pretty little note to her  she was not fascinated only puzzled by his grinning his simpering his scented cambric handkerchief and his highheeled lacquered boots  she did not understand onehalf the compliments which he paid she had never in her small experience of mankind met a professional ladies man as yet and looked upon my lord as something curious rather than pleasant and if she did not admire certainly wondered at him  jos on the contrary was delighted how very affable his lordship is he said how very kind of his lordship to say he would send his medical man kirsch you will carry our cards to the count de schlusselback directly the major and i will have the greatest pleasure in paying our respects at court as soon as possible  put out my uniform kirschboth our uniforms  it is a mark of politeness which every english gentleman ought to show to the countries which he visits to pay his respects to the sovereigns of those countries as to the representatives of his own  when tapeworms doctor came doctor von glauber body physician to hsh  the duke he speedily convinced jos that the pumpernickel mineral springs and the doctors particular treatment would infallibly restore the bengalee to youth and slimness  dere came here last year he said sheneral bulkeley an english sheneral tvice so pic as you sir  i sent him back qvite tin after tree months and he danced vid baroness glauber at the end of two  joss mind was made up the springs the doctor the court and the charge daffaires convinced him and he proposed to spend the autumn in these delightful quarters  and punctual to his word on the next day the charge daffaires presented jos and the major to victor aurelius xvii being conducted to their audience with that sovereign by the count de schlusselback marshal of the court  they were straightway invited to dinner at court and their intention of staying in the town being announced the politest ladies of the whole town instantly called upon mrs osborne and as not one of these however poor they might be was under the rank of a baroness joss delight was beyond expression  he wrote off to chutney at the club to say that the service was highly appreciated in germany that he was going to show his friend the count de schlusselback how to stick a pig in the indian fashion and that his august friends the duke and duchess were everything that was kind and civil  emmy too was presented to the august family and as mourning is not admitted in court on certain days she appeared in a pink crape dress with a diamond ornament in the corsage presented to her by her brother and she looked so pretty in this costume that the duke and court putting out of the question the major who had scarcely ever seen her before in an evening dress and vowed that she did not look fiveandtwenty all admired her excessively  in this dress she walked a polonaise with major dobbin at a court ball in which easy dance mr jos had the honour of leading out the countess of schlusselback an old lady with a hump back but with sixteen good quarters of nobility and related to half the royal houses of germany  pumpernickel stands in the midst of a happy valley through which sparklesto mingle with the rhine somewhere but i have not the map at hand to say exactly at what pointthe fertilizing stream of the pump in some places the river is big enough to support a ferryboat in others to turn a mill in pumpernickel itself the last transparency but three the great and renowned victor aurelius xiv built a magnificent bridge on which his own statue rises surrounded by waternymphs and emblems of victory peace and plenty he has his foot on the neck of a prostrate turkhistory says he engaged and ran a janissary through the body at the relief of vienna by sobieskibut quite undisturbed by the agonies of that prostrate mahometan who writhes at his feet in the most ghastly manner the prince smiles blandly and points with his truncheon in the direction of the aurelius platz where he began to erect a new palace that would have been the wonder of his age had the greatsouled prince but had funds to complete it  but the completion of monplaisir monblaisir the honest german folks call it was stopped for lack of ready money and it and its park and garden are now in rather a faded condition and not more than ten times big enough to accommodate the court of the reigning sovereign  the gardens were arranged to emulate those of versailles and amidst the terraces and groves there are some huge allegorical waterworks still which spout and froth stupendously upon fetedays and frighten one with their enormous aquatic insurrections  there is the trophonius cave in which by some artifice the leaden tritons are made not only to spout water but to play the most dreadful groans out of their lead conchsthere is the nymphbath and the niagara cataract which the people of the neighbourhood admire beyond expression when they come to the yearly fair at the opening of the chamber or to the fetes with which the happy little nation still celebrates the birthdays and marriagedays of its princely governors  then from all the towns of the duchy which stretches for nearly ten milefrom bolkum which lies on its western frontier bidding defiance to prussia from grogwitz where the prince has a huntinglodge and where his dominions are separated by the pump river from those of the neighbouring prince of potzenthal from all the little villages which besides these three great cities dot over the happy principalityfrom the farms and the mills along the pump come troops of people in red petticoats and velvet headdresses or with threecornered hats and pipes in their mouths who flock to the residenz and share in the pleasures of the fair and the festivities there  then the theatre is open for nothing then the waters of monblaisir begin to play it is lucky that there is company to behold them for one would be afraid to see them alonethen there come mountebanks and riding troops the way in which his transparency was fascinated by one of the horseriders is well known and it is believed that la petite vivandiere as she was called was a spy in the french interest and the delighted people are permitted to march through room after room of the grand ducal palace and admire the slippery floor the rich hangings and the spittoons at the doors of all the innumerable chambers  there is one pavilion at monblaisir which aurelius victor xv had arrangeda great prince but too fond of pleasureand which i am told is a perfect wonder of licentious elegance it is painted with the story of bacchus and ariadne and the table works in and out of the room by means of a windlass so that the company was served without any intervention of domestics  but the place was shut up by barbara aurelius xvs widow a severe and devout princess of the house of bolkum and regent of the duchy during her sons glorious minority and after the death of her husband cut off in the pride of his pleasures  the theatre of pumpernickel is known and famous in that quarter of germany  it languished a little when the present duke in his youth insisted upon having his own operas played there and it is said one day in a fury from his place in the orchestra when he attended a rehearsal broke a bassoon on the head of the chapel master who was conducting and led too slow and during which time the duchess sophia wrote domestic comedies which must have been very dreary to witness but the prince executes his music in private now and the duchess only gives away her plays to the foreigners of distinction who visit her kind little court  it is conducted with no small comfort and splendour when there are balls though there may be four hundred people at supper there is a servant in scarlet and lace to attend upon every four and every one is served on silver  there are festivals and entertainments going continually on and the duke has his chamberlains and equerries and the duchess her mistress of the wardrobe and ladies of honour just like any other and more potent potentates  the constitution is or was a moderate despotism tempered by a chamber that might or might not be elected  i never certainly could hear of its sitting in my time at pumpernickel  the prime minister had lodgings in a second floor and the foreign secretary occupied the comfortable lodgings over zwiebacks conditorey  the army consisted of a magnificent band that also did duty on the stage where it was quite pleasant to see the worthy fellows marching in turkish dresses with rouge on and wooden scimitars or as roman warriors with ophicleides and trombonesto see them again i say at night after one had listened to them all the morning in the aurelius platz where they performed opposite the cafe where we breakfasted  besides the band there was a rich and numerous staff of officers and i believe a few men  besides the regular sentries three or four men habited as hussars used to do duty at the palace but i never saw them on horseback and au fait what was the use of cavalry in a time of profound peaceand whither the deuce should the hussars ride  everybodyeverybody that was noble of course for as for the bourgeois we could not quite be expected to take notice of themvisited his neighbour  h e madame de burst received once a week h e madame de schnurrbart had her nightthe theatre was open twice a week the court graciously received once so that a mans life might in fact be a perfect round of pleasure in the unpretending pumpernickel way  that there were feuds in the place no one can deny politics ran very high at pumpernickel and parties were very bitter  there was the strumpff faction and the lederlung party the one supported by our envoy and the other by the french charge daffaires m de macabau indeed it sufficed for our minister to stand up for madame strumpff who was clearly the greater singer of the two and had three more notes in her voice than madame lederlung her rivalit sufficed i say for our minister to advance any opinion to have it instantly contradicted by the french diplomatist  everybody in the town was ranged in one or other of these factions the lederlung was a prettyish little creature certainly and her voice what there was of it was very sweet and there is no doubt that the strumpff was not in her first youth and beauty and certainly too stout when she came on in the last scene of the sonnambula for instance in her nightchemise with a lamp in her hand and had to go out of the window and pass over the plank of the mill it was all she could do to squeeze out of the window and the plank used to bend and creak again under her weightbut how she poured out the finale of the opera  and with what a burst of feeling she rushed into elvinos armsalmost fit to smother him whereas the little lederlungbut a truce to this gossipthe fact is that these two women were the two flags of the french and the english party at pumpernickel and the society was divided in its allegiance to those two great nations  we had on our side the home minister the master of the horse the dukes private secretary and the princes tutor whereas of the french party were the foreign minister the commanderinchiefs lady who had served under napoleon and the hofmarschall and his wife who was glad enough to get the fashions from pans and always had them and her caps by m de macabaus courier  the secretary of his chancery was little grignac a young fellow as malicious as satan and who made caricatures of tapeworm in all thealbums of the place  their headquarters and table dhote were established at the pariser hof the other inn of the town and though of course these gentlemen were obliged to be civil in public yet they cut at each other with epigrams that were as sharp as razors as i have seen a couple of wrestlers in devonshire lashing at each others shins and never showing their agony upon a muscle of their faces  neither tapeworm nor macabau ever sent home a dispatch to his government without a most savage series of attacks upon his rival  for instance on our side we would write the interests of great britain in this place and throughout the whole of germany are perilled by the continuance in office of the present french envoy this man is of a character so infamous that he will stick at no falsehood or hesitate at no crime to attain his ends  he poisons the mind of the court against the english minister represents the conduct of great britain in the most odious and atrocious light and is unhappily backed by a minister whose ignorance and necessities are as notorious as his influence is fatal on their side they would say m de tapeworm continues his system of stupid insular arrogance and vulgar falsehood against the greatest nation in the world  yesterday he was heard to speak lightly of her royal highness madame the duchess of berri on a former occasion he insulted the heroic duke of angouleme and dared to insinuate that hrh  the duke of orleans was conspiring against the august throne of the lilies  his gold is prodigated in every direction which his stupid menaces fail to frighten by one and the other he has won over creatures of the court hereand in fine pumpernickel will not be quiet germany tranquil france respected or europe content until this poisonous viper be crushed under heel  and so on  when one side or the other had written any particularly spicy dispatch news of it was sure to slip out  before the winter was far advanced it is actually on record that emmy took a night and received company with great propriety and modesty she had a french master who complimented her upon the purity of her accent and her facility of learning the fact is she had learned long ago and grounded herself subsequently in the grammar so as to be able to teach it to george and madam strumpff came to give her lessons in singing which she performed so well and with such a true voice that the majors windows who had lodgings opposite under the prime minister were always open to hear the lesson some of the german ladies who are very sentimental and simple in their tastes fell in love with her and began to call her du at once  these are trivial details but they relate to happy times  the major made himself georges tutor and read caesar and mathematics with him and they had a german master and rode out of evenings by the side of emmys carriageshe was always too timid and made a dreadful outcry at the slightest disturbance on horseback  so she drove about with one of her dear german friends and jos asleep on the backseat of the barouche  he was becoming very sweet upon the grafinn fanny de butterbrod a very gentle tenderhearted and unassuming young creature a canoness and countess in her own right but with scarcely ten pounds per year to her fortune and fanny for her part declared that to be amelias sister was the greatest delight that heaven could bestow on her and jos might have put a countesss shield and coronet by the side of his own arms on his carriage and forks whenwhen events occurred and those grand fetes given upon the marriage of the hereditary prince of pumpernickel with the lovely princess amelia of humbourgschlippenschloppen took place  at this festival the magnificence displayed was such as had not been known in the little german place since the days of the prodigal victor xiv  all the neighbouring princes princesses and grandees were invited to the feast  beds rose to half a crown per night in pumpernickel and the army was exhausted in providing guards of honour for the highnesses serenities and excellencies who arrived from all quarters  the princess was married by proxy at her fathers residence by the count de schlusselback  snuffboxes were given away in profusion as we learned from the court jeweller who sold and afterwards bought them again and bushels of the order of saint michael of pumpernickel were sent to the nobles of the court while hampers of the cordons and decorations of the wheel of st catherine of schlippenschloppen were brought to ours  the french envoy got both he is covered with ribbons like a prize carthorse tapeworm said who was not allowed by the rules of his service to take any decorations  let him have the cordons but with whom is the victory the fact is it was a triumph of british diplomacy the french party having proposed and tried their utmost to carry a marriage with a princess of the house of potztausenddonnerwetter whom as a matter of course we opposed  everybody was asked to the fetes of the marriage garlands and triumphal arches were hung across the road to welcome the young bride the great saint michaels fountain ran with uncommonly sour wine while that in the artillery place frothed with beer  the great waters played and poles were put up in the park and gardens for the happy peasantry which they might climb at their leisure carrying off watches silver forks prize sausages hung with pink ribbon c at the top  georgy got one wrenching it off having swarmed up the pole to the delight of the spectators and sliding down with the rapidity of a fall of water  but it was for the glorys sake merely  the boy gave the sausage to a peasant who had very nearly seized it and stood at the foot of the mast blubbering because he was unsuccessful  at the french chancellerie they had six more lampions in their illumination than ours had but our transparency which represented the young couple advancing and discord flying away with the most ludicrous likeness to the french ambassador beat the french picture hollow and i have no doubt got tapeworm the advancement and the cross of the bath which he subsequently attained  crowds of foreigners arrived for the fetes and of english of course besides the court balls public balls were given at the town hall and the redoute and in the former place there was a room for trenteetquarante and roulette established for the week of the festivities only and by one of the great german companies from ems or aixlachapelle  the officers or inhabitants of the town were not allowed to play at these games but strangers peasants ladies were admitted and any one who chose to lose or win money  that little scapegrace georgy osborne amongst others whose pockets were always full of dollars and whose relations were away at the grand festival of the court came to the stadthaus ball in company of his uncles courier mr kirsch and having only peeped into a playroom at badenbaden when he hung on dobbins arm and where of course he was not permitted to gamble came eagerly to this part of the entertainment and hankered round the tables where the croupiers and the punters were at work  women were playing they were masked some of them this license was allowed in these wild times of carnival  a woman with light hair in a low dress by no means so fresh as it had been and with a black mask on through the eyelets of which her eyes twinkled strangely was seated at one of the roulettetables with a card and a pin and a couple of florins before her  as the croupier called out the colour and number she pricked on the card with great care and regularity and only ventured her money on the colours after the red or black had come up a certain number of times  it was strange to look at her  but in spite of her care and assiduity she guessed wrong and the last two florins followed each other under the croupiers rake as he cried out with his inexorable voice the winning colour and number  she gave a sigh a shrug with her shoulders which were already too much out of her gown and dashing the pin through the card on to the table sat thrumming it for a while  then she looked round her and saw georgys honest face staring at the scene  the little scamp  what business had he to be there  when she saw the boy at whose face she looked hard through her shining eyes and mask she said monsieur nest pas joueur  non madame said the boy but she must have known from his accent of what country he was for she answered him with a slight foreign tone  you have nevare playedwill you do me a littl favor  what is it said georgy blushing again  mr kirsch was at work for his part at the rouge et noir and did not see his young master  play this for me if you please put it on any number any number and she took from her bosom a purse and out of it a gold piece the only coin there and she put it into georges hand  the boy laughed and did as he was bid  the number came up sure enough  there is a power that arranges that they say for beginners  thank you said she pulling the money towards her thank you what is your name  my names osborne said georgy and was fingering in his own pockets for dollars and just about to make a trial when the major in his uniform and jos en marquis from the court ball made their appearance  other people finding the entertainment stupid and preferring the fun at the stadthaus had quitted the palace ball earlier but it is probable the major and jos had gone home and found the boys absence for the former instantly went up to him and taking him by the shoulder pulled him briskly back from the place of temptation  then looking round the room he saw kirsch employed as we have said and going up to him asked how he dared to bring mr george to such a place  laissezmoi tranquille said mr kirsch very much excited by play and wine  il faut samuser parbleu je ne suis pas au service de monsieur  seeing his condition the major did not choose to argue with the man but contented himself with drawing away george and asking jos if he would come away  he was standing close by the lady in the mask who was playing with pretty good luck now and looking on much interested at the game  hadnt you better come jos the major said with george and me  ill stop and go home with that rascal kirsch jos said and for the same reason of modesty which he thought ought to be preserved before the boy dobbin did not care to remonstrate with jos but left him and walked home with georgy  did you play asked the major when they were out and on their way home  the boy said no  give me your word of honour as a gentleman that you never will  why said the boy it seems very good fun and in a very eloquent and impressive manner the major showed him why he shouldnt and would have enforced his precepts by the example of georgys own father had he liked to say anything that should reflect on the others memory when he had housed him he went to bed and saw his light in the little room outside of amelias presently disappear  amelias followed half an hour afterwards  i dont know what made the major note it so accurately  jos however remained behind over the playtable he was no gambler but not averse to the little excitement of the sport now and then and he had some napoleons chinking in the embroidered pockets of his court waistcoat  he put down one over the fair shoulder of the little gambler before him and they won  she made a little movement to make room for him by her side and just took the skirt of her gown from a vacant chair there  come and give me good luck she said still in a foreign accent quite different from that frank and perfectly english thank you with which she had saluted georgys coup in her favour  the portly gentleman looking round to see that nobody of rank observed him sat down he mutteredah really well now god bless my soul im very fortunate im sure to give you good fortune and other words of compliment and confusion do you play much the foreign mask said  i put a nap or two down said jos with a superb air flinging down a gold piece  yes ay nap after dinner said the mask archly  but jos looking frightened she continued in her pretty french accent you do not play to win  no more do i i play to forget but i cannot  i cannot forget old times monsieur  your little nephew is the image of his father and youyou are not changedbut yes you are everybody changes everybody forgets nobody has any heart  good god who is it asked jos in a flutter  cant you guess joseph sedley said the little woman in a sad voice and undoing her mask she looked at him  you have forgotten me  good heavens  mrs crawley gasped out jos  rebecca said the other putting her hand on his but she followed the game still all the time she was looking at him  i am stopping at the elephant she continued  ask for madame de raudon  i saw my dear amelia today how pretty she looked and how happy  so do you everybody but me who am wretched joseph sedley and she put her money over from the red to the black as if by a chance movement of her hand and while she was wiping her eyes with a pockethandkerchief fringed with torn lace  the red came up again and she lost the whole of that stake come away she said  come with me a littlewe are old friends are we not dear mr sedley  and mr kirsch having lost all his money by this time followed his master out into the moonlight where the illuminations were winking out and the transparency over our mission was scarcely visible    chapter lxiv  a vagabond chapter  we must pass over a part of mrs rebecca crawleys biography with that lightness and delicacy which the world demandsthe moral world that has perhaps no particular objection to vice but an insuperable repugnance to hearing vice called by its proper name there are things we do and know perfectly well in vanity fair though we never speak of them  as the ahrimanians worship the devil but dont mention him and a polite public will no more bear to read an authentic description of vice than a truly refined english or american female will permit the word breeches to be pronounced in her chaste hearing  and yet madam both are walking the world before our faces every day without much shocking us  if you were to blush every time they went by what complexions you would have  it is only when their naughty names are called out that your modesty has any occasion to show alarm or sense of outrage and it has been the wish of the present writer all through this story deferentially to submit to the fashion at present prevailing and only to hint at the existence of wickedness in a light easy and agreeable manner so that nobodys fine feelings may be offended  i defy any one to say that our becky who has certainly some vices has not been presented to the public in a perfectly genteel and inoffensive manner  in describing this siren singing and smiling coaxing and cajoling the author with modest pride asks his readers all round has he once forgotten the laws of politeness and showed the monsters hideous tail above water no  those who like may peep down under waves that are pretty transparent and see it writhing and twirling diabolically hideous and slimy flapping amongst bones or curling round corpses but above the waterline i ask has not everything been proper agreeable and decorous and has any the most squeamish immoralist in vanity fair a right to cry fie when however the siren disappears and dives below down among the dead men the water of course grows turbid over her and it is labour lost to look into it ever so curiously  they look pretty enough when they sit upon a rock twanging their harps and combing their hair and sing and beckon to you to come and hold the lookingglass but when they sink into their native element depend on it those mermaids are about no good and we had best not examine the fiendish marine cannibals revelling and feasting on their wretched pickled victims  and so when becky is out of the way be sure that she is not particularly well employed and that the less that is said about her doings is in fact the better  if we were to give a full account of her proceedings during a couple of years that followed after the curzon street catastrophe there might be some reason for people to say this book was improper  the actions of very vain heartless pleasureseeking people are very often improper as are many of yours my friend with the grave face and spotless reputationbut that is merely by the way and what are those of a woman without faithor loveor character and i am inclined to think that there was a period in mrs beckys life when she was seized not by remorse but by a kind of despair and absolutely neglected her person and did not even care for her reputation  this abattement and degradation did not take place all at once it was brought about by degrees after her calamity and after many struggles to keep upas a man who goes overboard hangs on to a spar whilst any hope is left and then flings it away and goes down when he finds that struggling is in vain  she lingered about london whilst her husband was making preparations for his departure to his seat of government and it is believed made more than one attempt to see her brotherinlaw sir pitt crawley and to work upon his feelings which she had almost enlisted in her favour as sir pitt and mr wenham were walking down to the house of commons the latter spied mrs rawdon in a black veil and lurking near the palace of the legislature  she sneaked away when her eyes met those of wenham and indeed never succeeded in her designs upon the baronet  probably lady jane interposed  i have heard that she quite astonished her husband by the spirit which she exhibited in this quarrel and her determination to disown mrs becky  of her own movement she invited rawdon to come and stop in gaunt street until his departure for coventry island knowing that with him for a guard mrs becky would not try to force her door and she looked curiously at the superscriptions of all the letters which arrived for sir pitt lest he and his sisterinlaw should be corresponding  not but that rebecca could have written had she a mind but she did not try to see or to write to pitt at his own house and after one or two attempts consented to his demand that the correspondence regarding her conjugal differences should be carried on by lawyers only  the fact was that pitts mind had been poisoned against her  a short time after lord steynes accident wenham had been with the baronet and given him such a biography of mrs becky as had astonished the member for queens crawley  he knew everything regarding her who her father was in what year her mother danced at the opera what had been her previous history and what her conduct during her married lifeas i have no doubt that the greater part of the story was false and dictated by interested malevolence it shall not be repeated here  but becky was left with a sad sad reputation in the esteem of a country gentleman and relative who had been once rather partial to her  the revenues of the governor of coventry island are not large  a part of them were set aside by his excellency for the payment of certain outstanding debts and liabilities the charges incident on his high situation required considerable expense finally it was found that he could not spare to his wife more than three hundred pounds a year which he proposed to pay to her on an undertaking that she would never trouble him otherwise scandal separation doctors commons would ensue  but it was mr wenhams business lord steynes business rawdons everybodysto get her out of the country and hush up a most disagreeable affair  she was probably so much occupied in arranging these affairs of business with her husbands lawyers that she forgot to take any step whatever about her son the little rawdon and did not even once propose to go and see him  that young gentleman was consigned to the entire guardianship of his aunt and uncle the former of whom had always possessed a great share of the childs affection  his mamma wrote him a neat letter from boulogne when she quitted england in which she requested him to mind his book and said she was going to take a continental tour during which she would have the pleasure of writing to him again  but she never did for a year afterwards and not indeed until sir pitts only boy always sickly died of hoopingcough and measlesthen rawdons mamma wrote the most affectionate composition to her darling son who was made heir of queens crawley by this accident and drawn more closely than ever to the kind lady whose tender heart had already adopted him  rawdon crawley then grown a tall fine lad blushed when he got the letter oh aunt jane you are my mother he said and notand not that one but he wrote back a kind and respectful letter to mrs rebecca then living at a boardinghouse at florence but we are advancing matters  our darling beckys first flight was not very far  she perched upon the french coast at boulogne that refuge of so much exiled english innocence and there lived in rather a genteel widowed manner with a femme de chambre and a couple of rooms at an hotel  she dined at the table dhote where people thought her very pleasant and where she entertained her neighbours by stories of her brother sir pitt and her great london acquaintance talking that easy fashionable slipslop which has so much effect upon certain folks of small breeding  she passed with many of them for a person of importance she gave little teaparties in her private room and shared in the innocent amusements of the place in seabathing and in jaunts in open carriages in strolls on the sands and in visits to the play mrs burjoice the printers lady who was boarding with her family at the hotel for the summer and to whom her burjoice came of a saturday and sunday voted her charming until that little rogue of a burjoice began to pay her too much attention  but there was nothing in the story only that becky was always affable easy and goodnaturedand with men especially  numbers of people were going abroad as usual at the end of the season and becky had plenty of opportunities of finding out by the behaviour of her acquaintances of the great london world the opinion of society as regarded her conduct  one day it was lady partlet and her daughters whom becky confronted as she was walking modestly on boulogne pier the cliffs of albion shining in the distance across the deep blue sea lady partlet marshalled all her daughters round her with a sweep of her parasol and retreated from the pier darting savage glances at poor little becky who stood alone there  on another day the packet came in  it had been blowing fresh and it always suited beckys humour to see the droll woebegone faces of the people as they emerged from the boat  lady slingstone happened to be on board this day  her ladyship had been exceedingly ill in her carriage and was greatly exhausted and scarcely fit to walk up the plank from the ship to the pier  but all her energies rallied the instant she saw becky smiling roguishly under a pink bonnet and giving her a glance of scorn such as would have shrivelled up most women she walked into the custom house quite unsupported  becky only laughed but i dont think she liked it  she felt she was alone quite alone and the faroff shining cliffs of england were impassable to her  the behaviour of the men had undergone too i dont know what change grinstone showed his teeth and laughed in her face with a familiarity that was not pleasant little bob suckling who was cap in hand to her three months before and would walk a mile in the rain to see for her carriage in the line at gaunt house was talking to fitzoof of the guards lord heehaws son one day upon the jetty as becky took her walk there little bobby nodded to her over his shoulder without moving his hat and continued his conversation with the heir of heehaw tom raikes tried to walk into her sittingroom at the inn with a cigar in his mouth but she closed the door upon him and would have locked it only that his fingers were inside  she began to feel that she was very lonely indeed  if hed been here she said those cowards would never have dared to insult me she thought about him with great sadness and perhaps longingabout his honest stupid constant kindness and fidelity his neverceasing obedience his good humour his bravery and courage  very likely she cried for she was particularly lively and had put on a little extra rouge when she came down to dinner  she rouged regularly now andand her maid got cognac for her besides that which was charged in the hotel bill  perhaps the insults of the men were not however so intolerable to her as the sympathy of certain women mrs crackenbury and mrs washington white passed through boulogne on their way to switzerland  the party were protected by colonel horner young beaumoris and of course old crackenbury and mrs whites little girl they did not avoid her they giggled cackled tattled condoled consoled and patronized her until they drove her almost wild with rage  to be patronized by them she thought as they went away simpering after kissing her  and she heard beaumoriss laugh ringing on the stair and knew quite well how to interpret his hilarity  it was after this visit that becky who had paid her weekly bills becky who had made herself agreeable to everybody in the house who smiled at the landlady called the waiters monsieur and paid the chambermaids in politeness and apologies what far more than compensated for a little niggardliness in point of money of which becky never was free that becky we say received a notice to quit from the landlord who had been told by some one that she was quite an unfit person to have at his hotel where english ladies would not sit down with her  and she was forced to fly into lodgings of which the dulness and solitude were most wearisome to her  still she held up in spite of these rebuffs and tried to make a character for herself and conquer scandal  she went to church very regularly and sang louder than anybody there  she took up the cause of the widows of the shipwrecked fishermen and gave work and drawings for the quashyboo mission she subscribed to the assembly and wouldnt waltz  in a word she did everything that was respectable and that is why we dwell upon this part of her career with more fondness than upon subsequent parts of her history which are not so pleasant she saw people avoiding her and still laboriously smiled upon them you never could suppose from her countenance what pangs of humiliation she might be enduring inwardly  her history was after all a mystery  parties were divided about her some people who took the trouble to busy themselves in the matter said that she was the criminal whilst others vowed that she was as innocent as a lamb and that her odious husband was in fault she won over a good many by bursting into tears about her boy and exhibiting the most frantic grief when his name was mentioned or she saw anybody like him she gained good mrs alderneys heart in that way who was rather the queen of british boulogne and gave the most dinners and balls of all the residents there by weeping when master alderney came from dr swishtails academy to pass his holidays with his mother  he and her rawdon were of the same age and so like becky said in a voice choking with agony whereas there was five years difference between the boys ages and no more likeness between them than between my respected reader and his humble servant  wenham when he was going abroad on his way to kissingen to join lord steyne enlightened mrs alderney on this point and told her how he was much more able to describe little rawdon than his mamma who notoriously hated him and never saw him how he was thirteen years old while little alderney was but nine fair while the other darling was darkin a word caused the lady in question to repent of her good humour  whenever becky made a little circle for herself with incredible toils and labour somebody came and swept it down rudely and she had all her work to begin over again  it was very hard very hard lonely and disheartening  there was mrs newbright who took her up for some time attracted by the sweetness of her singing at church and by her proper views upon serious subjects concerning which in former days at queens crawley mrs becky had had a good deal of instruction  well she not only took tracts but she read them  she worked flannel petticoats for the quashybooscotton nightcaps for the cocoanut indianspainted handscreens for the conversion of the pope and the jewssat under mr rowls on wednesdays mr huggleton on thursdays attended two sunday services at church besides mr bawler the darbyite in the evening and all in vain  mrs newbright had occasion to correspond with the countess of southdown about the warmingpan fund for the fiji islanders for the management of which admirable charity both these ladies formed part of a female committee and having mentioned her sweet friend mrs rawdon crawley the dowager countess wrote back such a letter regarding becky with such particulars hints facts falsehoods and general comminations that intimacy between mrs newbright and mrs crawley ceased forthwith and all the serious world of tours where this misfortune took place immediately parted company with the reprobate  those who know the english colonies abroad know that we carry with us us our pride pills prejudices harveysauces cayennepeppers and other lares making a little britain wherever we settle down  from one colony to another becky fled uneasily  from boulogne to dieppe from dieppe to caen from caen to tourstrying with all her might to be respectable and alas  always found out some day or other and pecked out of the cage by the real daws  mrs hook eagles took her up at one of these placesa woman without a blemish in her character and a house in portman square  she was staying at the hotel at dieppe whither becky fled and they made each others acquaintance first at sea where they were swimming together and subsequently at the table dhote of the hotel  mrs eagles had heardwho indeed had notsome of the scandal of the steyne affair but after a conversation with becky she pronounced that mrs crawley was an angel her husband a ruffian lord steyne an unprincipled wretch as everybody knew and the whole case against mrs crawley an infamous and wicked conspiracy of that rascal wenham  if you were a man of any spirit mr eagles you would box the wretchs ears the next time you see him at the club she said to her husband  but eagles was only a quiet old gentleman husband to mrs eagles with a taste for geology and not tall enough to reach anybodys ears  the eagles then patronized mrs rawdon took her to live with her at her own house at paris quarrelled with the ambassadors wife because she would not receive her protegee and did all that lay in womans power to keep becky straight in the paths of virtue and good repute  becky was very respectable and orderly at first but the life of humdrum virtue grew utterly tedious to her before long  it was the same routine every day the same dulness and comfort the same drive over the same stupid bois de boulogne the same company of an evening the same blairs sermon of a sunday nightthe same opera always being acted over and over again becky was dying of weariness when luckily for her young mr eagles came from cambridge and his mother seeing the impression which her little friend made upon him straightway gave becky warning  then she tried keeping house with a female friend then the double menage began to quarrel and get into debt  then she determined upon a boardinghouse existence and lived for some time at that famous mansion kept by madame de saint amour in the rue royale at paris where she began exercising her graces and fascinations upon the shabby dandies and flyblown beauties who frequented her landladys salons  becky loved society and indeed could no more exist without it than an opiumeater without his dram and she was happy enough at the period of her boardinghouse life  the women here are as amusing as those in may fair she told an old london friend who met her only their dresses are not quite so fresh  the men wear cleaned gloves and are sad rogues certainly but they are not worse than jack this and tom that  the mistress of the house is a little vulgar but i dont think she is so vulgar as lady  and here she named the name of a great leader of fashion that i would die rather than reveal  in fact when you saw madame de saint amours rooms lighted up of a night men with plaques and cordons at the ecarte tables and the women at a little distance you might fancy yourself for a while in good society and that madame was a real countess  many people did so fancy and becky was for a while one of the most dashing ladies of the countesss salons  but it is probable that her old creditors of 1815 found her out and caused her to leave paris for the poor little woman was forced to fly from the city rather suddenly and went thence to brussels  how well she remembered the place  she grinned as she looked up at the little entresol which she had occupied and thought of the bareacres family bawling for horses and flight as their carriage stood in the portecochere of the hotel  she went to waterloo and to laeken where george osbornes monument much struck her  she made a little sketch of it  that poor cupid she said how dreadfully he was in love with me and what a fool he was  i wonder whether little emmy is alive  it was a good little creature and that fat brother of hers  i have his funny fat picture still among my papers  they were kind simple people  at brussels becky arrived recommended by madame de saint amour to her friend madame la comtesse de borodino widow of napoleons general the famous count de borodino who was left with no resource by the deceased hero but that of a table dhote and an ecarte table secondrate dandies and roues widowladies who always have a lawsuit and very simple english folks who fancy they see continental society at these houses put down their money or ate their meals at madame de borodinos tables  the gallant young fellows treated the company round to champagne at the table dhote rode out with the women or hired horses on country excursions clubbed money to take boxes at the play or the opera betted over the fair shoulders of the ladies at the ecarte tables and wrote home to their parents in devonshire about their felicitous introduction to foreign society  here as at paris becky was a boardinghouse queen and ruled in select pensions  she never refused the champagne or the bouquets or the drives into the country or the private boxes but what she preferred was the ecarte at nightand she played audaciously first she played only for a little then for fivefranc pieces then for napoleons then for notes  then she would not be able to pay her months pension  then she borrowed from the young gentlemen then she got into cash again and bullied madame de borodino whom she had coaxed and wheedled before  then she was playing for ten sous at a time and in a dire state of poverty  then her quarters allowance would come in and she would pay off madame de borodinos score and would once more take the cards against monsieur de rossignol or the chevalier de raff  when becky left brussels the sad truth is that she owed three months pension to madame de borodino of which fact and of the gambling and of the drinking and of the going down on her knees to the reverend mr muff ministre anglican and borrowing money of him and of her coaxing and flirting with milor noodle son of sir noodle pupil of the rev mr muff whom she used to take into her private room and of whom she won large sums at ecarteof which fact i say and of a hundred of her other knaveries the countess de borodino informs every english person who stops at her establishment and announces that madame rawdon was no better than a vipere  so our little wanderer went about setting up her tent in various cities of europe as restless as ulysses or bampfylde moore carew her taste for disrespectability grew more and more remarkable  she became a perfect bohemian ere long herding with people whom it would make your hair stand on end to meet  there is no town of any mark in europe but it has its little colony of english raffsmen whose names mr hemp the officer reads out periodically at the sheriffs courtyoung gentlemen of very good family often only that the latter disowns them frequenters of billiardrooms and estaminets patrons of foreign races and gamingtables  they people the debtors prisonsthey drink and swaggerthey fight and brawlthey run away without payingthey have duels with french and german officersthey cheat mr spooney at ecartethey get the money and drive off to baden in magnificent britzkasthey try their infallible martingale and lurk about the tables with empty pockets shabby bullies penniless bucks until they can swindle a jew banker with a sham bill of exchange or find another mr spooney to rob the alternations of splendour and misery which these people undergo are very queer to view  their life must be one of great excitement  beckymust it be ownedtook to this life and took to it not unkindly  she went about from town to town among these bohemians  the lucky mrs rawdon was known at every playtable in germany  she and madame de cruchecassee kept house at florence together  it is said she was ordered out of munich and my friend mr frederick pigeon avers that it was at her house at lausanne that he was hocussed at supper and lost eight hundred pounds to major loder and the honourable mr deuceace  we are bound you see to give some account of beckys biography but of this part the less perhaps that is said the better  they say that when mrs crawley was particularly down on her luck she gave concerts and lessons in music here and there  there was a madame de raudon who certainly had a matinee musicale at wildbad accompanied by herr spoff premier pianist to the hospodar of wallachia and my little friend mr eaves who knew everybody and had travelled everywhere always used to declare that he was at strasburg in the year 1830 when a certain madame rebecque made her appearance in the opera of the dame blanche giving occasion to a furious row in the theatre there  she was hissed off the stage by the audience partly from her own incompetency but chiefly from the illadvised sympathy of some persons in the parquet where the officers of the garrison had their admissions and eaves was certain that the unfortunate debutante in question was no other than mrs rawdon crawley  she was in fact no better than a vagabond upon this earth  when she got her money she gambled when she had gambled it she was put to shifts to live who knows how or by what means she succeeded it is said that she was once seen at st  petersburg but was summarily dismissed from that capital by the police so that there cannot be any possibility of truth in the report that she was a russian spy at toplitz and vienna afterwards  i have even been informed that at paris she discovered a relation of her own no less a person than her maternal grandmother who was not by any means a montmorenci but a hideous old boxopener at a theatre on the boulevards  the meeting between them of which other persons as it is hinted elsewhere seem to have been acquainted must have been a very affecting interview the present historian can give no certain details regarding the event  it happened at rome once that mrs de rawdons halfyears salary had just been paid into the principal bankers there and as everybody who had a balance of above five hundred scudi was invited to the balls which this prince of merchants gave during the winter becky had the honour of a card and appeared at one of the prince and princess polonias splendid evening entertainments the princess was of the family of pompili lineally descended from the second king of rome and egeria of the house of olympus while the princes grandfather alessandro polonia sold washballs essences tobacco and pockethandkerchiefs ran errands for gentlemen and lent money in a small way  all the great company in rome thronged to his saloonsprinces dukes ambassadors artists fiddlers monsignori young bears with their leadersevery rank and condition of man his halls blazed with light and magnificence were resplendent with gilt frames containing pictures and dubious antiques and the enormous gilt crown and arms of the princely owner a gold mushroom on a crimson field the colour of the pockethandkerchiefs which he sold and the silver fountain of the pompili family shone all over the roof doors and panels of the house and over the grand velvet baldaquins prepared to receive popes and emperors  so becky who had arrived in the diligence from florence and was lodged at an inn in a very modest way got a card for prince polonias entertainment and her maid dressed her with unusual care and she went to this fine ball leaning on the arm of major loder with whom she happened to be travelling at the timethe same man who shot prince ravoli at naples the next year and was caned by sir john buckskin for carrying four kings in his hat besides those which he used in playing at ecarte and this pair went into the rooms together and becky saw a number of old faces which she remembered in happier days when she was not innocent but not found out major loder knew a great number of foreigners keenlooking whiskered men with dirty striped ribbons in their buttonholes and a very small display of linen but his own countrymen it might be remarked eschewed the major  becky too knew some ladies here and therefrench widows dubious italian countesses whose husbands had treated them illfaughwhat shall we say we who have moved among some of the finest company of vanity fair of this refuse and sediment of rascals if we play let it be with clean cards and not with this dirty pack  but every man who has formed one of the innumerable army of travellers has seen these marauding irregulars hanging on like nym and pistol to the main force wearing the kings colours and boasting of his commission but pillaging for themselves and occasionally gibbeted by the roadside  well she was hanging on the arm of major loder and they went through the rooms together and drank a great quantity of champagne at the buffet where the people and especially the majors irregular corps struggled furiously for refreshments of which when the pair had had enough they pushed on until they reached the duchesss own pink velvet saloon at the end of the suite of apartments where the statue of the venus is and the great venice lookingglasses framed in silver and where the princely family were entertaining their most distinguished guests at a round table at supper  it was just such a little select banquet as that of which becky recollected that she had partaken at lord steynesand there he sat at polonias table and she saw him the scar cut by the diamond on his white bald shining forehead made a burning red mark his red whiskers were dyed of a purple hue which made his pale face look still paler  he wore his collar and orders his blue ribbon and garter  he was a greater prince than any there though there was a reigning duke and a royal highness with their princesses and near his lordship was seated the beautiful countess of belladonna nee de glandier whose husband the count paolo della belladonna so well known for his brilliant entomological collections had been long absent on a mission to the emperor of morocco  when becky beheld that familiar and illustrious face how vulgar all of a sudden did major loder appear to her and how that odious captain rook did smell of tobacco  in one instant she reassumed her fineladyship and tried to look and feel as if she were in may fair once more  that woman looks stupid and illhumoured she thought i am sure she cant amuse him  no he must be bored by herhe never was by me a hundred such touching hopes fears and memories palpitated in her little heart as she looked with her brightest eyes the rouge which she wore up to her eyelids made them twinkle towards the great nobleman  of a star and garter night lord steyne used also to put on his grandest manner and to look and speak like a great prince as he was becky admired him smiling sumptuously easy lofty and stately ah bon dieu what a pleasant companion he was what a brilliant wit what a rich fund of talk what a grand mannerand she had exchanged this for major loder reeking of cigars and brandyandwater and captain rook with his horsejockey jokes and prizering slang and their like  i wonder whether he will know me she thought  lord steyne was talking and laughing with a great and illustrious lady at his side when he looked up and saw becky  she was all over in a flutter as their eyes met and she put on the very best smile she could muster and dropped him a little timid imploring curtsey  he stared aghast at her for a minute as macbeth might on beholding banquos sudden appearance at his ballsupper and remained looking at her with open mouth when that horrid major loder pulled her away  come away into the supperroom mrs r was that gentlemans remark seeing these nobs grubbing away has made me peckish too lets go and try the old governors champagne becky thought the major had had a great deal too much already  the day after she went to walk on the pincian hillthe hyde park of the roman idlerspossibly in hopes to have another sight of lord steyne  but she met another acquaintance there  it was mr fiche his lordships confidential man who came up nodding to her rather familiarly and putting a finger to his hat  i knew that madame was here he said i followed her from her hotel  i have some advice to give madame  from the marquis of steyne becky asked resuming as much of her dignity as she could muster and not a little agitated by hope and expectation  no said the valet it is from me  rome is very unwholesome  not at this season monsieur fichenot till after easter  i tell madame it is unwholesome now  there is always malaria for some people  that cursed marsh wind kills many at all seasons look madame crawley you were always bon enfant and i have an interest in you parole dhonneur  be warned  go away from rome i tell youor you will be ill and die  becky laughed though in rage and fury  what assassinate poor little me she said  how romantic  does my lord carry bravos for couriers and stilettos in the fourgons bah  i will stay if but to plague him i have those who will defend me whilst i am here  it was monsieur fiches turn to laugh now  defend you he said and who the major the captain any one of those gambling men whom madame sees would take her life for a hundred louis  we know things about major loder he is no more a major than i am my lord the marquis which would send him to the galleys or worse  we know everything and have friends everywhere we know whom you saw at paris and what relations you found there  yes madame may stare but we do  how was it that no minister on the continent would receive madame she has offended somebody  who never forgiveswhose rage redoubled when he saw you he was like a madman last night when he came home  madame de belladonna made him a scene about you and fired off in one of her furies  oh it was madame de belladonna was it becky said relieved a little for the information she had just got had scared her  noshe does not mattershe is always jealous  i tell you it was monseigneur  you did wrong to show yourself to him  and if you stay here you will repent it  mark my words  go  here is my lords carriageand seizing beckys arm he rushed down an alley of the garden as lord steynes barouche blazing with heraldic devices came whirling along the avenue borne by the almost priceless horses and bearing madame de belladonna lolling on the cushions dark sulky and blooming a king charles in her lap a white parasol swaying over her head and old steyne stretched at her side with a livid face and ghastly eyes  hate or anger or desire caused them to brighten now and then still but ordinarily they gave no light and seemed tired of looking out on a world of which almost all the pleasure and all the best beauty had palled upon the wornout wicked old man  monseigneur has never recovered the shock of that night never monsieur fiche whispered to mrs crawley as the carriage flashed by and she peeped out at it from behind the shrubs that hid her  that was a consolation at any rate becky thought  whether my lord really had murderous intentions towards mrs becky as monsieur fiche said since monseigneurs death he has returned to his native country where he lives much respected and has purchased from his prince the title of baron ficci and the factotum objected to have to do with assassination or whether he simply had a commission to frighten mrs crawley out of a city where his lordship proposed to pass the winter and the sight of her would be eminently disagreeable to the great nobleman is a point which has never been ascertained  but the threat had its effect upon the little woman and she sought no more to intrude herself upon the presence of her old patron  everybody knows the melancholy end of that nobleman which befell at naples two months after the french revolution of 1830 when the most honourable george gustavus marquis of steyne earl of gaunt and of gaunt castle in the peerage of ireland viscount hellborough baron pitchley and grillsby a knight of the most noble order of the garter of the golden fleece of spain of the russian order of saint nicholas of the first class of the turkish order of the crescent first lord of the powder closet and groom of the back stairs colonel of the gaunt or regents own regiment of militia a trustee of the british museum an elder brother of the trinity house a governor of the white friars and dcldied after a series of fits brought on as the papers said by the shock occasioned to his lordships sensibilities by the downfall of the ancient french monarchy  an eloquent catalogue appeared in a weekly print describing his virtues his magnificence his talents and his good actions  his sensibility his attachment to the illustrious house of bourbon with which he claimed an alliance were such that he could not survive the misfortunes of his august kinsmen  his body was buried at naples and his heartthat heart which always beat with every generous and noble emotion was brought back to castle gaunt in a silver urn  in him mr wagg said the poor and the fine arts have lost a beneficent patron society one of its most brilliant ornaments and england one of her loftiest patriots and statesmen c c  his will was a good deal disputed and an attempt was made to force from madame de belladonna the celebrated jewel called the jewseye diamond which his lordship always wore on his forefinger and which it was said that she removed from it after his lamented demise but his confidential friend and attendant monsieur fiche proved that the ring had been presented to the said madame de belladonna two days before the marquiss death as were the banknotes jewels neapolitan and french bonds c found in his lordships secretaire and claimed by his heirs from that injured woman    chapter lxv  full of business and pleasure  the day after the meeting at the playtable jos had himself arrayed with unusual care and splendour and without thinking it necessary to say a word to any member of his family regarding the occurrences of the previous night or asking for their company in his walk he sallied forth at an early hour and was presently seen making inquiries at the door of the elephant hotel  in consequence of the fetes the house was full of company the tables in the street were already surrounded by persons smoking and drinking the national smallbeer the public rooms were in a cloud of smoke and mr jos having in his pompous way and with his clumsy german made inquiries for the person of whom he was in search was directed to the very top of the house above the firstfloor rooms where some travelling pedlars had lived and were exhibiting their jewellery and brocades above the secondfloor apartments occupied by the etat major of the gambling firm above the thirdfloor rooms tenanted by the band of renowned bohemian vaulters and tumblers and so on to the little cabins of the roof where among students bagmen small tradesmen and countryfolks come in for the festival becky had found a little nestas dirty a little refuge as ever beauty lay hid in  becky liked the life  she was at home with everybody in the place pedlars punters tumblers students and all she was of a wild roving nature inherited from father and mother who were both bohemians by taste and circumstance if a lord was not by she would talk to his courier with the greatest pleasure the din the stir the drink the smoke the tattle of the hebrew pedlars the solemn braggart ways of the poor tumblers the sournois talk of the gamblingtable officials the songs and swagger of the students and the general buzz and hum of the place had pleased and tickled the little woman even when her luck was down and she had not wherewithal to pay her bill  how pleasant was all the bustle to her now that her purse was full of the money which little georgy had won for her the night before  as jos came creaking and puffing up the final stairs and was speechless when he got to the landing and began to wipe his face and then to look for no 92 the room where he was directed to seek for the person he wanted the door of the opposite chamber no 90 was open and a student in jackboots and a dirty schlafrock was lying on the bed smoking a long pipe whilst another student in long yellow hair and a braided coat exceeding smart and dirty too was actually on his knees at no 92 bawling through the keyhole supplications to the person within  go away said a wellknown voice which made jos thrill i expect somebody i expect my grandpapa  he mustnt see you there  angel englanderinn bellowed the kneeling student with the whitybrown ringlets and the large fingerring do take compassion upon us make an appointment dine with me and fritz at the inn in the park  we will have roast pheasants and porter plumpudding and french wine  we shall die if you dont  that we will said the young nobleman on the bed and this colloquy jos overheard though he did not comprehend it for the reason that he had never studied the language in which it was carried on  newmero kattervang dooze si vous plait jos said in his grandest manner when he was able to speak  quater fang tooce said the student starting up and he bounced into his own room where he locked the door and where jos heard him laughing with his comrade on the bed  the gentleman from bengal was standing disconcerted by this incident when the door of the 92 opened of itself and beckys little head peeped out full of archness and mischief  she lighted on jos  its you she said coming out  how i have been waiting for you  stop not yetin one minute you shall come in in that instant she put a rougepot a brandy bottle and a plate of broken meat into the bed gave one smooth to her hair and finally let in her visitor  she had by way of morning robe a pink domino a trifle faded and soiled and marked here and there with pomaturn but her arms shone out from the loose sleeves of the dress very white and fair and it was tied round her little waist so as not ill to set off the trim little figure of the wearer  she led jos by the hand into her garret come in she said  come and talk to me  sit yonder on the chair and she gave the civilians hand a little squeeze and laughingly placed him upon it  as for herself she placed herself on the bednot on the bottle and plate you may be sureon which jos might have reposed had he chosen that seat and so there she sat and talked with her old admirer   how little years have changed you she said with a look of tender interest  i should have known you anywhere  what a comfort it is amongst strangers to see once more the frank honest face of an old friend  the frank honest face to tell the truth at this moment bore any expression but one of openness and honesty  it was on the contrary much perturbed and puzzled in look  jos was surveying the queer little apartment in which he found his old flame  one of her gowns hung over the bed another depending from a hook of the door her bonnet obscured half the lookingglass on which too lay the prettiest little pair of bronze boots a french novel was on the table by the bedside with a candle not of wax  becky thought of popping that into the bed too but she only put in the little paper nightcap with which she had put the candle out on going to sleep  i should have known you anywhere she continued a woman never forgets some things  and you were the first man i everi ever saw  was i really said jos  god bless my soul youyou dont say so  when i came with your sister from chiswick i was scarcely more than a child becky said  how is that dear love oh her husband was a sad wicked man and of course it was of me that the poor dear was jealous as if i cared about him heigho  when there was somebodybut nodont let us talk of old times and she passed her handkerchief with the tattered lace across her eyelids  is not this a strange place she continued for a woman who has lived in a very different world too to be found in i have had so many griefs and wrongs joseph sedley i have been made to suffer so cruelly that i am almost made mad sometimes  i cant stay still in any place but wander about always restless and unhappy all my friends have been false to meall  there is no such thing as an honest man in the world  i was the truest wife that ever lived though i married my husband out of pique because somebody elsebut never mind that  i was true and he trampled upon me and deserted me  i was the fondest mother  i had but one child one darling one hope one joy which i held to my heart with a mothers affection which was my life my prayer mymy blessing and theythey tore it from metore it from me and she put her hand to her heart with a passionate gesture of despair burying her face for a moment on the bed  the brandybottle inside clinked up against the plate which held the cold sausage  both were moved no doubt by the exhibition of so much grief  max and fritz were at the door listening with wonder to mrs beckys sobs and cries  jos too was a good deal frightened and affected at seeing his old flame in this condition and she began forthwith to tell her storya tale so neat simple and artless that it was quite evident from hearing her that if ever there was a whiterobed angel escaped from heaven to be subject to the infernal machinations and villainy of fiends here below that spotless beingthat miserable unsullied martyr was present on the bed before joson the bed sitting on the brandybottle  they had a very long amicable and confidential talk there in the course of which jos sedley was somehow made aware but in a manner that did not in the least scare or offend him that beckys heart had first learned to beat at his enchanting presence that george osborne had certainly paid an unjustifiable court to her which might account for amelias jealousy and their little rupture but that becky never gave the least encouragement to the unfortunate officer and that she had never ceased to think about jos from the very first day she had seen him though of course her duties as a married woman were paramountduties which she had always preserved and would to her dying day or until the proverbially bad climate in which colonel crawley was living should release her from a yoke which his cruelty had rendered odious to her  jos went away convinced that she was the most virtuous as she was one of the most fascinating of women and revolving in his mind all sorts of benevolent schemes for her welfare  her persecutions ought to be ended she ought to return to the society of which she was an ornament he would see what ought to be done  she must quit that place and take a quiet lodging  amelia must come and see her and befriend her  he would go and settle about it and consult with the major  she wept tears of heartfelt gratitude as she parted from him and pressed his hand as the gallant stout gentleman stooped down to kiss hers  so becky bowed jos out of her little garret with as much grace as if it was a palace of which she did the honours and that heavy gentleman having disappeared down the stairs max and fritz came out of their hole pipe in mouth and she amused herself by mimicking jos to them as she munched her cold bread and sausage and took draughts of her favourite brandyandwater  jos walked over to dobbins lodgings with great solemnity and there imparted to him the affecting history with which he had just been made acquainted without however mentioning the play business of the night before and the two gentlemen were laying their heads together and consulting as to the best means of being useful to mrs becky while she was finishing her interrupted dejeuner a la fourchette  how was it that she had come to that little town how was it that she had no friends and was wandering about alone little boys at school are taught in their earliest latin book that the path of avernus is very easy of descent  let us skip over the interval in the history of her downward progress  she was not worse now than she had been in the days of her prosperityonly a little down on her luck  as for mrs amelia she was a woman of such a soft and foolish disposition that when she heard of anybody unhappy her heart straightway melted towards the sufferer and as she had never thought or done anything mortally guilty herself she had not that abhorrence for wickedness which distinguishes moralists much more knowing  if she spoiled everybody who came near her with kindness and complimentsif she begged pardon of all her servants for troubling them to answer the bellif she apologized to a shopboy who showed her a piece of silk or made a curtsey to a streetsweeper with a complimentary remark upon the elegant state of his crossingand she was almost capable of every one of these folliesthe notion that an old acquaintance was miserable was sure to soften her heart nor would she hear of anybodys being deservedly unhappy a world under such legislation as hers would not be a very orderly place of abode but there are not many women at least not of the rulers who are of her sort  this lady i believe would have abolished all gaols punishments handcuffs whippings poverty sickness hunger in the world and was such a meanspirited creature thatwe are obliged to confess itshe could even forget a mortal injury  when the major heard from jos of the sentimental adventure which had just befallen the latter he was not it must be owned nearly as much interested as the gentleman from bengal  on the contrary his excitement was quite the reverse from a pleasurable one he made use of a brief but improper expression regarding a poor woman in distress saying in fact the little minx has she come to light again he never had had the slightest liking for her but had heartily mistrusted her from the very first moment when her green eyes had looked at and turned away from his own  that little devil brings mischief wherever she goes the major said disrespectfully  who knows what sort of life she has been leading and what business has she here abroad and alone dont tell me about persecutors and enemies an honest woman always has friends and never is separated from her family  why has she left her husband he may have been disreputable and wicked as you say  he always was  i remember the confounded blackleg and the way in which he used to cheat and hoodwink poor george  wasnt there a scandal about their separation i think i heard something cried out major dobbin who did not care much about gossip and whom jos tried in vain to convince that mrs becky was in all respects a most injured and virtuous female  well well lets ask mrs george said that archdiplomatist of a major  only let us go and consult her i suppose you will allow that she is a good judge at any rate and knows what is right in such matters  hm  emmy is very well said jos who did not happen to be in love with his sister  very well by gad sir shes the finest lady i ever met in my life bounced out the major  i say at once let us go and ask her if this woman ought to be visited or noti will be content with her verdict now this odious artful rogue of a major was thinking in his own mind that he was sure of his case  emmy he remembered was at one time cruelly and deservedly jealous of rebecca never mentioned her name but with a shrinking and terrora jealous woman never forgives thought dobbin  and so the pair went across the street to mrs georges house where she was contentedly warbling at a music lesson with madame strumpff  when that lady took her leave jos opened the business with his usual pomp of words  amelia my dear said he i have just had the most extraordinaryyesgod bless my soul  the most extraordinary adventurean old friendyes a most interesting old friend of yours and i may say in old times has just arrived here and i should like you to see her  her said amelia who is it major dobbin if you please not to break my scissors the major was twirling them round by the little chain from which they sometimes hung to their ladys waist and was thereby endangering his own eye  it is a woman whom i dislike very much said the major doggedly and whom you have no cause to love  it is rebecca im sure it is rebecca amelia said blushing and being very much agitated  you are right you always are dobbin answered brussels waterloo old old times griefs pangs remembrances rushed back into amelias gentle heart and caused a cruel agitation there  dont let me see her emmy continued  i couldnt see her  i told you so dobbin said to jos  she is very unhappy andand that sort of thing jos urged  she is very poor and unprotected and has been illexceedingly illand that scoundrel of a husband has deserted her  ah said amelia  she hasnt a friend in the world jos went on not undexterously and she said she thought she might trust in you  shes so miserable emmy  she has been almost mad with grief  her story quite affected mepon my word and honour it didnever was such a cruel persecution borne so angelically i may say  her family has been most cruel to her  poor creature amelia said  and if she can get no friend she says she thinks shell die jos proceeded in a low tremulous voice  god bless my soul  do you know that she tried to kill herself she carries laudanum with heri saw the bottle in her roomsuch a miserable little roomat a thirdrate house the elephant up in the roof at the top of all  i went there  this did not seem to affect emmy  she even smiled a little perhaps she figured jos to herself panting up the stair  shes beside herself with grief he resumed  the agonies that woman has endured are quite frightful to hear of  she had a little boy of the same age as georgy  yes yes i think i remember emmy remarked well  the most beautiful child ever seen jos said who was very fat and easily moved and had been touched by the story becky told a perfect angel who adored his mother  the ruffians tore him shrieking out of her arms and have never allowed him to see her  dear joseph emmy cried out starting up at once let us go and see her this minute and she ran into her adjoining bedchamber tied on her bonnet in a flutter came out with her shawl on her arm and ordered dobbin to follow  he went and put her shawlit was a white cashmere consigned to her by the major himself from indiaover her shoulders  he saw there was nothing for it but to obey and she put her hand into his arm and they went away  it is number 92 up four pair of stairs jos said perhaps not very willing to ascend the steps again but he placed himself in the window of his drawingroom which commands the place on which the elephant stands and saw the pair marching through the market  it was as well that becky saw them too from her garret for she and the two students were chattering and laughing there they had been joking about the appearance of beckys grandpapawhose arrival and departure they had witnessedbut she had time to dismiss them and have her little room clear before the landlord of the elephant who knew that mrs osborne was a great favourite at the serene court and respected her accordingly led the way up the stairs to the roof story encouraging miladi and the herr major as they achieved the ascent  gracious lady gracious lady said the landlord knocking at beckys door he had called her madame the day before and was by no means courteous to her  who is it becky said putting out her head and she gave a little scream  there stood emmy in a tremble and dobbin the tall major with his cane  he stood still watching and very much interested at the scene but emmy sprang forward with open arms towards rebecca and forgave her at that moment and embraced her and kissed her with all her heart ah poor wretch when was your lip pressed before by such pure kisses    chapter lxvi  amantium irae  frankness and kindness like amelias were likely to touch even such a hardened little reprobate as becky  she returned emmys caresses and kind speeches with something very like gratitude and an emotion which if it was not lasting for a moment was almost genuine  that was a lucky stroke of hers about the child torn from her arms shrieking it was by that harrowing misfortune that becky had won her friend back and it was one of the very first points we may be certain upon which our poor simple little emmy began to talk to her newfound acquaintance  and so they took your darling child from you our simpleton cried out  oh rebecca my poor dear suffering friend i know what it is to lose a boy and to feel for those who have lost one  but please heaven yours will be restored to you as a merciful merciful providence has brought me back mine  the child my child oh yes my agonies were frightful becky owned not perhaps without a twinge of conscience it jarred upon her to be obliged to commence instantly to tell lies in reply to so much confidence and simplicity  but that is the misfortune of beginning with this kind of forgery  when one fib becomes due as it were you must forge another to take up the old acceptance and so the stock of your lies in circulation inevitably multiplies and the danger of detection increases every day  my agonies becky continued were terrible i hope she wont sit down on the bottle when they took him away from me i thought i should die but i fortunately had a brain fever during which my doctor gave me up andand i recovered andand here i am poor and friendless  how old is he emmy asked  eleven said becky  eleven cried the other  why he was born the same year with georgy who is  i know i know becky cried out who had in fact quite forgotten all about little rawdons age  grief has made me forget so many things dearest amelia  i am very much changed  halfwild sometimes  he was eleven when they took him away from me  bless his sweet face i have never seen it again  was he fair or dark went on that absurd little emmy  show me his hair  becky almost laughed at her simplicity  not today lovesome other time when my trunks arrive from leipzig whence i came to this placeand a little drawing of him which i made in happy days  poor becky poor becky said emmy  how thankful how thankful i ought to be though i doubt whether that practice of piety inculcated upon us by our womankind in early youth namely to be thankful because we are better off than somebody else be a very rational religious exercise and then she began to think as usual how her son was the handsomest the best and the cleverest boy in the whole world  you will see my georgy was the best thing emmy could think of to console becky  if anything could make her comfortable that would  and so the two women continued talking for an hour or more during which becky had the opportunity of giving her new friend a full and complete version of her private history  she showed how her marriage with rawdon crawley had always been viewed by the family with feelings of the utmost hostility how her sisterinlaw an artful woman had poisoned her husbands mind against her how he had formed odious connections which had estranged his affections from her  how she had borne everythingpoverty neglect coldness from the being whom she most lovedand all for the sake of her child how finally and by the most flagrant outrage she had been driven into demanding a separation from her husband when the wretch did not scruple to ask that she should sacrifice her own fair fame so that he might procure advancement through the means of a very great and powerful but unprincipled manthe marquis of steyne indeed  the atrocious monster  this part of her eventful history becky gave with the utmost feminine delicacy and the most indignant virtue forced to fly her husbands roof by this insult the coward had pursued his revenge by taking her child from her and thus becky said she was a wanderer poor unprotected friendless and wretched  emmy received this story which was told at some length as those persons who are acquainted with her character may imagine that she would  she quivered with indignation at the account of the conduct of the miserable rawdon and the unprincipled steyne  her eyes made notes of admiration for every one of the sentences in which becky described the persecutions of her aristocratic relatives and the falling away of her husband becky did not abuse him  she spoke rather in sorrow than in anger  she had loved him only too fondly and was he not the father of her boy and as for the separation scene from the child while becky was reciting it emmy retired altogether behind her pockethandkerchief so that the consummate little tragedian must have been charmed to see the effect which her performance produced on her audience  whilst the ladies were carrying on their conversation amelias constant escort the major who of course did not wish to interrupt their conference and found himself rather tired of creaking about the narrow stair passage of which the roof brushed the nap from his hat descended to the groundfloor of the house and into the great room common to all the frequenters of the elephant out of which the stair led  this apartment is always in a fume of smoke and liberally sprinkled with beer  on a dirty table stand scores of corresponding brass candlesticks with tallow candles for the lodgers whose keys hang up in rows over the candles  emmy had passed blushing through the room anon where all sorts of people were collected tyrolese glovesellers and danubian linenmerchants with their packs students recruiting themselves with butterbrods and meat idlers playing cards or dominoes on the sloppy beery tables tumblers refreshing during the cessation of their performancesin a word all the fumum and strepitus of a german inn in fair time  the waiter brought the major a mug of beer as a matter of course and he took out a cigar and amused himself with that pernicious vegetable and a newspaper until his charge should come down to claim him  max and fritz came presently downstairs their caps on one side their spurs jingling their pipes splendid with coats of arms and fullblown tassels and they hung up the key of no 90 on the board and called for the ration of butterbrod and beer  the pair sat down by the major and fell into a conversation of which he could not help hearing somewhat it was mainly about fuchs and philister and duels and drinkingbouts at the neighbouring university of schoppenhausen from which renowned seat of learning they had just come in the eilwagen with becky as it appeared by their side and in order to be present at the bridal fetes at pumpernickel  the title englanderinn seems to be en bays de gonnoisance said max who knew the french language to fritz his comrade  after the fat grandfather went away there came a pretty little compatriot  i heard them chattering and whimpering together in the little womans chamber  we must take the tickets for her concert fritz said hast thou any money max  bah said the other the concert is a concert in nubibus  hans said that she advertised one at leipzig and the burschen took many tickets but she went off without singing  she said in the coach yesterday that her pianist had fallen ill at dresden  she cannot sing it is my belief her voice is as cracked as thine o thou beersoaking renowner  it is cracked i hear her trying out of her window a schrecklich english ballad called de rose upon de balgony  saufen and singen go not together observed fritz with the red nose who evidently preferred the former amusement  no thou shalt take none of her tickets she won money at the trente and quarante last night  i saw her  she made a little english boy play for her we will spend thy money there or at the theatre or we will treat her to french wine or cognac in the aurelius garden but the tickets we will not buy what sayest thou yet another mug of beer and one and another successively having buried their blond whiskers in the mawkish draught curled them and swaggered off into the fair  the major who had seen the key of no 90 put up on its hook and had heard the conversation of the two young university bloods was not at a loss to understand that their talk related to becky  the little devil is at her old tricks he thought and he smiled as he recalled old days when he had witnessed the desperate flirtation with jos and the ludicrous end of that adventure he and george had often laughed over it subsequently and until a few weeks after georges marriage when he also was caught in the little circes toils and had an understanding with her which his comrade certainly suspected but preferred to ignore  william was too much hurt or ashamed to ask to fathom that disgraceful mystery although once and evidently with remorse on his mind george had alluded to it it was on the morning of waterloo as the young men stood together in front of their line surveying the black masses of frenchmen who crowned the opposite heights and as the rain was coming down i have been mixing in a foolish intrigue with a woman george said i am glad we were marched away  if i drop i hope emmy will never know of that business  i wish to god it had never been begun and william was pleased to think and had more than once soothed poor georges widow with the narrative that osborne after quitting his wife and after the action of quatre bras on the first day spoke gravely and affectionately to his comrade of his father and his wife  on these facts too william had insisted very strongly in his conversations with the elder osborne and had thus been the means of reconciling the old gentleman to his sons memory just at the close of the elder mans life  and so this devil is still going on with her intrigues thought william  i wish she were a hundred miles from here  she brings mischief wherever she goes and he was pursuing these forebodings and this uncomfortable train of thought with his head between his hands and the pumpernickel gazette of last week unread under his nose when somebody tapped his shoulder with a parasol and he looked up and saw mrs amelia  this woman had a way of tyrannizing over major dobbin for the weakest of all people will domineer over somebody and she ordered him about and patted him and made him fetch and carry just as if he was a great newfoundland dog  he liked so to speak to jump into the water if she said high dobbin and to trot behind her with her reticule in his mouth  this history has been written to very little purpose if the reader has not perceived that the major was a spooney  why did you not wait for me sir to escort me downstairs she said giving a little toss of her head and a most sarcastic curtsey  i couldnt stand up in the passage he answered with a comical deprecatory look and delighted to give her his arm and to take her out of the horrid smoky place he would have walked off without even so much as remembering the waiter had not the young fellow run after him and stopped him on the threshold of the elephant to make him pay for the beer which he had not consumed  emmy laughed  she called him a naughty man who wanted to run away in debt and in fact made some jokes suitable to the occasion and the smallbeer she was in high spirits and good humour and tripped across the marketplace very briskly  she wanted to see jos that instant  the major laughed at the impetuous affection mrs amelia exhibited for in truth it was not very often that she wanted her brother that instant  they found the civilian in his saloon on the firstfloor he had been pacing the room and biting his nails and looking over the marketplace towards the elephant a hundred times at least during the past hour whilst emmy was closeted with her friend in the garret and the major was beating the tattoo on the sloppy tables of the public room below and he was on his side too very anxious to see mrs osborne  well said he  the poor dear creature how she has suffered emmy said  god bless my soul yes jos said wagging his head so that his cheeks quivered like jellies  she may have paynes room who can go upstairs emmy continued payne was a staid english maid and personal attendant upon mrs osborne to whom the courier as in duty bound paid court and whom georgy used to lark dreadfully with accounts of german robbers and ghosts  she passed her time chiefly in grumbling in ordering about her mistress and in stating her intention to return the next morning to her native village of clapham  she may have paynes room emmy said  why you dont mean to say you are going to have that woman into the house bounced out the major jumping up  of course we are said amelia in the most innocent way in the world dont be angry and break the furniture major dobbin  of course we are going to have her here  of course my dear jos said  the poor creature after all her sufferings emmy continued her horrid banker broken and run away her husbandwicked wretchhaving deserted her and taken her child away from her here she doubled her two little fists and held them in a most menacing attitude before her so that the major was charmed to see such a dauntless virago the poor dear thing  quite alone and absolutely forced to give lessons in singing to get her breadand not have her here  take lessons my dear mrs george cried the major but dont have her in the house  i implore you dont  pooh said jos  you who are always good and kindalways used to be at any rateim astonished at you major william amelia cried  why what is the moment to help her but when she is so miserable now is the time to be of service to her  the oldest friend i ever had and not  she was not always your friend amelia the major said for he was quite angry  this allusion was too much for emmy who looking the major almost fiercely in the face said for shame major dobbin and after having fired this shot she walked out of the room with a most majestic air and shut her own door briskly on herself and her outraged dignity  to allude to that she said when the door was closed  oh it was cruel of him to remind me of it and she looked up at georges picture which hung there as usual with the portrait of the boy underneath  it was cruel of him  if i had forgiven it ought he to have spoken no  and it is from his own lips that i know how wicked and groundless my jealousy was and that you were pureoh yes you were pure my saint in heaven  she paced the room trembling and indignant  she went and leaned on the chest of drawers over which the picture hung and gazed and gazed at it  its eyes seemed to look down on her with a reproach that deepened as she looked the early dear dear memories of that brief prime of love rushed back upon her  the wound which years had scarcely cicatrized bled afresh and oh how bitterly  she could not bear the reproaches of the husband there before her  it couldnt be  never never  poor dobbin poor old william  that unlucky word had undone the work of many a yearthe long laborious edifice of a life of love and constancyraised too upon what secret and hidden foundations wherein lay buried passions uncounted struggles unknown sacrificesa little word was spoken and down fell the fair palace of hopeone word and away flew the bird which he had been trying all his life to lure  william though he saw by amelias looks that a great crisis had come nevertheless continued to implore sedley in the most energetic terms to beware of rebecca and he eagerly almost frantically adjured jos not to receive her  he besought mr sedley to inquire at least regarding her told him how he had heard that she was in the company of gamblers and people of ill repute pointed out what evil she had done in former days how she and crawley had misled poor george into ruin how she was now parted from her husband by her own confession and perhaps for good reason  what a dangerous companion she would be for his sister who knew nothing of the affairs of the world  william implored jos with all the eloquence which he could bring to bear and a great deal more energy than this quiet gentleman was ordinarily in the habit of showing to keep rebecca out of his household  had he been less violent or more dexterous he might have succeeded in his supplications to jos but the civilian was not a little jealous of the airs of superiority which the major constantly exhibited towards him as he fancied indeed he had imparted his opinions to mr kirsch the courier whose bills major dobbin checked on this journey and who sided with his master and he began a blustering speech about his competency to defend his own honour his desire not to have his affairs meddled with his intention in fine to rebel against the major when the colloquyrather a long and stormy onewas put an end to in the simplest way possible namely by the arrival of mrs becky with a porter from the elephant hotel in charge of her very meagre baggage  she greeted her host with affectionate respect and made a shrinking but amicable salutation to major dobbin who as her instinct assured her at once was her enemy and had been speaking against her and the bustle and clatter consequent upon her arrival brought amelia out of her room  emmy went up and embraced her guest with the greatest warmth and took no notice of the major except to fling him an angry lookthe most unjust and scornful glance that had perhaps ever appeared in that poor little womans face since she was born  but she had private reasons of her own and was bent upon being angry with him and dobbin indignant at the injustice not at the defeat went off making her a bow quite as haughty as the killing curtsey with which the little woman chose to bid him farewell  he being gone emmy was particularly lively and affectionate to rebecca and bustled about the apartments and installed her guest in her room with an eagerness and activity seldom exhibited by our placid little friend  but when an act of injustice is to be done especially by weak people it is best that it should be done quickly and emmy thought she was displaying a great deal of firmness and proper feeling and veneration for the late captain osborne in her present behaviour  georgy came in from the fetes for dinnertime and found four covers laid as usual but one of the places was occupied by a lady instead of by major dobbin hullo  wheres dob the young gentleman asked with his usual simplicity of language  major dobbin is dining out i suppose his mother said and drawing the boy to her kissed him a great deal and put his hair off his forehead and introduced him to mrs crawley  this is my boy rebecca mrs osborne saidas much as to saycan the world produce anything like that becky looked at him with rapture and pressed his hand fondly dear boy she saidhe is just like my emotion choked her further utterance but amelia understood as well as if she had spoken that becky was thinking of her own blessed child  however the company of her friend consoled mrs crawley and she ate a very good dinner  during the repast she had occasion to speak several times when georgy eyed her and listened to her  at the desert emmy was gone out to superintend further domestic arrangements jos was in his great chair dozing over galignani georgy and the new arrival sat close to each otherhe had continued to look at her knowingly more than once and at last he laid down the nutcrackers  i say said georgy  what do you say becky said laughing  youre the lady i saw in the mask at the rouge et noir  hush  you little sly creature becky said taking up his hand and kissing it  your uncle was there too and mamma mustnt know  oh nonot by no means answered the little fellow  you see we are quite good friends already becky said to emmy who now reentered and it must be owned that mrs osborne had introduced a most judicious and amiable companion into her house  william in a state of great indignation though still unaware of all the treason that was in store for him walked about the town wildly until he fell upon the secretary of legation tapeworm who invited him to dinner  as they were discussing that meal he took occasion to ask the secretary whether he knew anything about a certain mrs rawdon crawley who had he believed made some noise in london and then tapeworm who of course knew all the london gossip and was besides a relative of lady gaunt poured out into the astonished majors ears such a history about becky and her husband as astonished the querist and supplied all the points of this narrative for it was at that very table years ago that the present writer had the pleasure of hearing the tale  tufto steyne the crawleys and their historyeverything connected with becky and her previous life passed under the record of the bitter diplomatist he knew everything and a great deal besides about all the worldin a word he made the most astounding revelations to the simplehearted major  when dobbin said that mrs osborne and mr sedley had taken her into their house tapeworm burst into a peal of laughter which shocked the major and asked if they had not better send into the prison and take in one or two of the gentlemen in shaved heads and yellow jackets who swept the streets of pumpernickel chained in pairs to board and lodge and act as tutor to that little scapegrace georgy  this information astonished and horrified the major not a little it had been agreed in the morning before meeting with rebecca that amelia should go to the court ball that night  there would be the place where he should tell her  the major went home and dressed himself in his uniform and repaired to court in hopes to see mrs osborne  she never came  when he returned to his lodgings all the lights in the sedley tenement were put out  he could not see her till the morning  i dont know what sort of a nights rest he had with this frightful secret in bed with him  at the earliest convenient hour in the morning he sent his servant across the way with a note saying that he wished very particularly to speak with her  a message came back to say that mrs osborne was exceedingly unwell and was keeping her room  she too had been awake all that night  she had been thinking of a thing which had agitated her mind a hundred times before  a hundred times on the point of yielding she had shrunk back from a sacrifice which she felt was too much for her  she couldnt in spite of his love and constancy and her own acknowledged regard respect and gratitude  what are benefits what is constancy or merit one curl of a girls ringlet one hair of a whisker will turn the scale against them all in a minute they did not weigh with emmy more than with other women  she had tried them wanted to make them pass could not and the pitiless little woman had found a pretext and determined to be free  when at length in the afternoon the major gained admission to amelia instead of the cordial and affectionate greeting to which he had been accustomed now for many a long day he received the salutation of a curtsey and of a little gloved hand retracted the moment after it was accorded to him  rebecca too was in the room and advanced to meet him with a smile and an extended hand  dobbin drew back rather confusedly ii beg your pardon mam he said but i am bound to tell you that it is not as your friend that i am come here now  pooh  damn dont let us have this sort of thing jos cried out alarmed and anxious to get rid of a scene  i wonder what major dobbin has to say against rebecca amelia said in a low clear voice with a slight quiver in it and a very determined look about the eyes  i will not have this sort of thing in my house jos again interposed i say i will not have it and dobbin i beg sir youll stop it and he looked round trembling and turning very red and gave a great puff and made for his door  dear friend rebecca said with angelic sweetness do hear what major dobbin has to say against me  i will not hear it i say squeaked out jos at the top of his voice and gathering up his dressinggown he was gone  we are only two women amelia said  you can speak now sir  this manner towards me is one which scarcely becomes you amelia the major answered haughtily nor i believe am i guilty of habitual harshness to women  it is not a pleasure to me to do the duty which i am come to do  pray proceed with it quickly if you please major dobbin said amelia who was more and more in a pet  the expression of dobbins face as she spoke in this imperious manner was not pleasant  i came to sayand as you stay mrs crawley i must say it in your presencethat i think youyou ought not to form a member of the family of my friends  a lady who is separated from her husband who travels not under her own name who frequents public gamingtables  it was to the ball i went cried out becky  is not a fit companion for mrs osborne and her son dobbin went on  and i may add that there are people here who know you and who profess to know that regarding your conduct about which i dont even wish to speak beforebefore mrs osborne  yours is a very modest and convenient sort of calumny major dobbin rebecca said  you leave me under the weight of an accusation which after all is unsaid what is it is it unfaithfulness to my husband i scorn it and defy anybody to prove iti defy you i say  my honour is as untouched as that of the bitterest enemy who ever maligned me  is it of being poor forsaken wretched that you accuse me yes i am guilty of those faults and punished for them every day  let me go emmy  it is only to suppose that i have not met you and i am no worse today than i was yesterday  it is only to suppose that the night is over and the poor wanderer is on her way  dont you remember the song we used to sing in old dear old days i have been wandering ever since thena poor castaway scorned for being miserable and insulted because i am alone  let me go  my stay here interferes with the plans of this gentleman  indeed it does madam said the major  if i have any authority in this house  authority none broke out amelia rebecca you stay with me  i wont desert you because you have been persecuted or insult you becausebecause major dobbin chooses to do so  come away dear and the two women made towards the door  william opened it  as they were going out however he took amelias hand and saidwill you stay a moment and speak to me  he wishes to speak to you away from me said becky looking like a martyr  amelia gripped her hand in reply  upon my honour it is not about you that i am going to speak dobbin said  come back amelia and she came  dobbin bowed to mrs crawley as he shut the door upon her  amelia looked at him leaning against the glass  her face and her lips were quite white  i was confused when i spoke just now the major said after a pause and i misused the word authority  you did said amelia with her teeth chattering  at least i have claims to be heard dobbin continued  it is generous to remind me of our obligations to you the woman answered  the claims i mean are those left me by georges father william said  yes and you insulted his memory  you did yesterday you know you did  and i will never forgive you  never said amelia  she shot out each little sentence in a tremor of anger and emotion  you dont mean that amelia william said sadly you dont mean that these words uttered in a hurried moment are to weigh against a whole lifes devotion i think that georges memory has not been injured by the way in which i have dealt with it and if we are come to bandying reproaches i at least merit none from his widow and the mother of his son  reflect afterwards whenwhen you are at leisure and your conscience will withdraw this accusation  it does even now amelia held down her head  it is not that speech of yesterday he continued which moves you that is but the pretext amelia or i have loved you and watched you for fifteen years in vain have i not learned in that time to read all your feelings and look into your thoughts i know what your heart is capable of  it can cling faithfully to a recollection and cherish a fancy but it cant feel such an attachment as mine deserves to mate with and such as i would have won from a woman more generous than you no you are not worthy of the love which i have devoted to you i knew all along that the prize i had set my life on was not worth the winning that i was a fool with fond fancies too bartering away my all of truth and ardour against your little feeble remnant of love  i will bargain no more  i withdraw  i find no fault with you  you are very goodnatured and have done your best but you couldntyou couldnt reach up to the height of the attachment which i bore you and which a loftier soul than yours might have been proud to share goodbye amelia i have watched your struggle  let it end  we are both weary of it  amelia stood scared and silent as william thus suddenly broke the chain by which she held him and declared his independence and superiority he had placed himself at her feet so long that the poor little woman had been accustomed to trample upon him  she didnt wish to marry him but she wished to keep him  she wished to give him nothing but that he should give her all  it is a bargain not unfrequently levied in love  williams sally had quite broken and cast her down her assault was long since over and beaten back  am i to understand then that you are goingaway william she said  he gave a sad laugh  i went once before he said and came back after twelve years  we were young then amelia  goodbye  i have spent enough of my life at this play  whilst they had been talking the door into mrs osbornes room had opened ever so little indeed becky had kept a hold of the handle and had turned it on the instant when dobbin quitted it and she heard every word of the conversation that had passed between these two what a noble heart that man has she thought and how shamefully that woman plays with it she admired dobbin she bore him no rancour for the part he had taken against her  it was an open move in the game and played fairly  ah she thought if i could have had such a husband as thata man with a heart and brains too  i would not have minded his large feet and running into her room she absolutely bethought herself of something and wrote him a note beseeching him to stop for a few daysnot to think of goingand that she could serve him with a  the parting was over  once more poor william walked to the door and was gone and the little widow the author of all this work had her will and had won her victory and was left to enjoy it as she best might  let the ladies envy her triumph  at the romantic hour of dinner mr georgy made his appearance and again remarked the absence of old dob the meal was eaten in silence by the party  joss appetite not being diminished but emmy taking nothing at all  after the meal georgy was lolling in the cushions of the old window a large window with three sides of glass abutting from the gable and commanding on one side the marketplace where the elephant is his mother being busy hard by when he remarked symptoms of movement at the majors house on the other side of the street  hullo said he theres dobs trapthey are bringing it out of the courtyard the trap in question was a carriage which the major had bought for six pounds sterling and about which they used to rally him a good deal  emmy gave a little start but said nothing  hullo georgy continued theres francis coming out with the portmanteaus and kunz the oneeyed postilion coming down the market with three schimmels look at his boots and yellow jacketaint he a rum one whytheyre putting the horses to dobs carriage is he going anywhere  yes said emmy he is going on a journey  going on a journey and when is he coming back  he isnot coming back answered emmy  not coming back cried out georgy jumping up stay here sir roared out jos  stay georgy said his mother with a very sad face the boy stopped kicked about the room jumped up and down from the windowseat with his knees and showed every symptom of uneasiness and curiosity  the horses were put to  the baggage was strapped on  francis came out with his masters sword cane and umbrella tied up together and laid them in the well and his desk and old tin cockedhat case which he placed under the seat  francis brought out the stained old blue cloak lined with red camlet which had wrapped the owner up any time these fifteen years and had manchen sturm erlebt as a favourite song of those days said  it had been new for the campaign of waterloo and had covered george and william after the night of quatre bras  old burcke the landlord of the lodgings came out then francis with more packagesfinal packagesthen major williamburcke wanted to kiss him  the major was adored by all people with whom he had to do it was with difficulty he could escape from this demonstration of attachment  by jove i will go screamed out george  give him this said becky quite interested and put a paper into the boys hand  he had rushed down the stairs and flung across the street in a minutethe yellow postilion was cracking his whip gently  william had got into the carriage released from the embraces of his landlord  george bounded in afterwards and flung his arms round the majors neck as they saw from the window and began asking him multiplied questions  then he felt in his waistcoat pocket and gave him a note  william seized at it rather eagerly he opened it trembling but instantly his countenance changed and he tore the paper in two and dropped it out of the carriage  he kissed georgy on the head and the boy got out doubling his fists into his eyes and with the aid of francis  he lingered with his hand on the panel  fort schwager  the yellow postilion cracked his whip prodigiously up sprang francis to the box away went the schimmels and dobbin with his head on his breast  he never looked up as they passed under amelias window and georgy left alone in the street burst out crying in the face of all the crowd  emmys maid heard him howling again during the night and brought him some preserved apricots to console him  she mingled her lamentations with his  all the poor all the humble all honest folks all good men who knew him loved that kindhearted and simple gentleman  as for emmy had she not done her duty she had her picture of george for a consolation    chapter lxvii  which contains births marriages and deaths  whatever beckys private plan might be by which dobbins true love was to be crowned with success the little woman thought that the secret might keep and indeed being by no means so much interested about anybodys welfare as about her own she had a great number of things pertaining to herself to consider and which concerned her a great deal more than major dobbins happiness in this life  she found herself suddenly and unexpectedly in snug comfortable quarters surrounded by friends kindness and goodnatured simple people such as she had not met with for many a long day and wanderer as she was by force and inclination there were moments when rest was pleasant to her  as the most hardened arab that ever careered across the desert over the hump of a dromedary likes to repose sometimes under the datetrees by the water or to come into the cities walk into the bazaars refresh himself in the baths and say his prayers in the mosques before he goes out again marauding so joss tents and pilau were pleasant to this little ishmaelite she picketed her steed hung up her weapons and warmed herself comfortably by his fire  the halt in that roving restless life was inexpressibly soothing and pleasant to her  so pleased herself she tried with all her might to please everybody and we know that she was eminent and successful as a practitioner in the art of giving pleasure  as for jos even in that little interview in the garret at the elephant inn she had found means to win back a great deal of his goodwill  in the course of a week the civilian was her sworn slave and frantic admirer  he didnt go to sleep after dinner as his custom was in the much less lively society of amelia he drove out with becky in his open carriage  he asked little parties and invented festivities to do her honour  tapeworm the charge daffaires who had abused her so cruelly came to dine with jos and then came every day to pay his respects to becky poor emmy who was never very talkative and more glum and silent than ever after dobbins departure was quite forgotten when this superior genius made her appearance  the french minister was as much charmed with her as his english rival the german ladies never particularly squeamish as regards morals especially in english people were delighted with the cleverness and wit of mrs osbornes charming friend and though she did not ask to go to court yet the most august and transparent personages there heard of her fascinations and were quite curious to know her  when it became known that she was noble of an ancient english family that her husband was a colonel of the guard excellenz and governor of an island only separated from his lady by one of those trifling differences which are of little account in a country where werther is still read and the wahlverwandtschaften of goethe is considered an edifying moral book nobody thought of refusing to receive her in the very highest society of the little duchy and the ladies were even more ready to call her du and to swear eternal friendship for her than they had been to bestow the same inestimable benefits upon amelia  love and liberty are interpreted by those simple germans in a way which honest folks in yorkshire and somersetshire little understand and a lady might in some philosophic and civilized towns be divorced ever so many times from her respective husbands and keep her character in society  joss house never was so pleasant since he had a house of his own as rebecca caused it to be she sang she played she laughed she talked in two or three languages she brought everybody to the house and she made jos believe that it was his own great social talents and wit which gathered the society of the place round about him  as for emmy who found herself not in the least mistress of her own house except when the bills were to be paid becky soon discovered the way to soothe and please her  she talked to her perpetually about major dobbin sent about his business and made no scruple of declaring her admiration for that excellent highminded gentleman and of telling emmy that she had behaved most cruelly regarding him emmy defended her conduct and showed that it was dictated only by the purest religious principles that a woman once c and to such an angel as him whom she had had the good fortune to marry was married forever but she had no objection to hear the major praised as much as ever becky chose to praise him and indeed brought the conversation round to the dobbin subject a score of times every day  means were easily found to win the favour of georgy and the servants amelias maid it has been said was heart and soul in favour of the generous major  having at first disliked becky for being the means of dismissing him from the presence of her mistress she was reconciled to mrs crawley subsequently because the latter became williams most ardent admirer and champion  and in those nightly conclaves in which the two ladies indulged after their parties and while miss payne was brushing their airs as she called the yellow locks of the one and the soft brown tresses of the other this girl always put in her word for that dear good gentleman major dobbin  her advocacy did not make amelia angry any more than rebeccas admiration of him  she made george write to him constantly and persisted in sending mammas kind love in a postscript  and as she looked at her husbands portrait of nights it no longer reproached herperhaps she reproached it now william was gone  emmy was not very happy after her heroic sacrifice she was very distraite nervous silent and ill to please the family had never known her so peevish  she grew pale and ill  she used to try to sing certain songs einsam bin ich nicht alleine was one of them that tender lovesong of webers which in oldfashioned days young ladies and when you were scarcely born showed that those who lived before you knew too how to love and to sing certain songs i say to which the major was partial and as she warbled them in the twilight in the drawingroom she would break off in the midst of the song and walk into her neighbouring apartment and there no doubt take refuge in the miniature of her husband  some books still subsisted after dobbins departure with his name written in them a german dictionary for instance with william dobbin th reg in the flyleaf a guidebook with his initials and one or two other volumes which belonged to the major  emmy cleared these away and put them on the drawers where she placed her workbox her desk her bible and prayerbook under the pictures of the two georges  and the major on going away having left his gloves behind him it is a fact that georgy rummaging his mothers desk some time afterwards found the gloves neatly folded up and put away in what they call the secretdrawers of the desk  not caring for society and moping there a great deal emmys chief pleasure in the summer evenings was to take long walks with georgy during which rebecca was left to the society of mr joseph and then the mother and son used to talk about the major in a way which even made the boy smile  she told him that she thought major william was the best man in all the worldthe gentlest and the kindest the bravest and the humblest  over and over again she told him how they owed everything which they possessed in the world to that kind friends benevolent care of them how he had befriended them all through their poverty and misfortunes watched over them when nobody cared for them how all his comrades admired him though he never spoke of his own gallant actions how georgys father trusted him beyond all other men and had been constantly befriended by the good william  why when your papa was a little boy she said he often told me that it was william who defended him against a tyrant at the school where they were and their friendship never ceased from that day until the last when your dear father fell  did dobbin kill the man who killed papa georgy said  im sure he did or he would if he could have caught him wouldnt he mother when im in the army wont i hate the frenchthats all  in such colloquies the mother and the child passed a great deal of their time together  the artless woman had made a confidant of the boy  he was as much williams friend as everybody else who knew him well  by the way mrs becky not to be behind hand in sentiment had got a miniature too hanging up in her room to the surprise and amusement of most people and the delight of the original who was no other than our friend jos  on her first coming to favour the sedleys with a visit the little woman who had arrived with a remarkably small shabby kit was perhaps ashamed of the meanness of her trunks and bandboxes and often spoke with great respect about her baggage left behind at leipzig which she must have from that city  when a traveller talks to you perpetually about the splendour of his luggage which he does not happen to have with him my son beware of that traveller  he is ten to one an impostor  neither jos nor emmy knew this important maxim  it seemed to them of no consequence whether becky had a quantity of very fine clothes in invisible trunks but as her present supply was exceedingly shabby emmy supplied her out of her own stores or took her to the best milliner in the town and there fitted her out  it was no more torn collars now i promise you and faded silks trailing off at the shoulder  becky changed her habits with her situation in lifethe rougepot was suspendedanother excitement to which she had accustomed herself was also put aside or at least only indulged in in privacy as when she was prevailed on by jos of a summer evening emmy and the boy being absent on their walks to take a little spiritandwater  but if she did not indulgethe courier did that rascal kirsch could not be kept from the bottle nor could he tell how much he took when he applied to it  he was sometimes surprised himself at the way in which mr sedleys cognac diminished  well well this is a painful subject becky did not very likely indulge so much as she used before she entered a decorous family  at last the muchbraggedabout boxes arrived from leipzig three of them not by any means large or splendid nor did becky appear to take out any sort of dresses or ornaments from the boxes when they did arrive  but out of one which contained a mass of her papers it was that very box which rawdon crawley had ransacked in his furious hunt for beckys concealed money she took a picture with great glee which she pinned up in her room and to which she introduced jos  it was the portrait of a gentleman in pencil his face having the advantage of being painted up in pink  he was riding on an elephant away from some cocoanut trees and a pagoda it was an eastern scene  god bless my soul it is my portrait jos cried out it was he indeed blooming in youth and beauty in a nankeen jacket of the cut of 1804  it was the old picture that used to hang up in russell square  i bought it said becky in a voice trembling with emotion i went to see if i could be of any use to my kind friends  i have never parted with that picturei never will  wont you jos cried with a look of unutterable rapture and satisfaction  did you really now value it for my sake  you know i did well enough said becky but why speakwhy thinkwhy look back  it is too late now  that evenings conversation was delicious for jos emmy only came in to go to bed very tired and unwell jos and his fair guest had a charming teteatete and his sister could hear as she lay awake in her adjoining chamber rebecca singing over to jos the old songs of 1815 he did not sleep for a wonder that night any more than amelia  it was june and by consequence high season in london jos who read the incomparable galignani the exiles best friend through every day used to favour the ladies with extracts from his paper during their breakfast  every week in this paper there is a full account of military movements in which jos as a man who had seen service was especially interested  on one occasion he read outarrival of the th regiment  gravesend june 20the ramchunder east indiaman came into the river this morning having on board 14 officers and 132 rank and file of this gallant corps  they have been absent from england fourteen years having been embarked the year after waterloo in which glorious conflict they took an active part and having subsequently distinguished themselves in the burmese war  the veteran colonel sir michael odowd kcb with his lady and sister landed here yesterday with captains posky stubble macraw malony lieutenants smith jones thompson f thomson ensigns hicks and grady the band on the pier playing the national anthem and the crowd loudly cheering the gallant veterans as they went into waytes hotel where a sumptuous banquet was provided for the defenders of old england  during the repast which we need not say was served up in waytes best style the cheering continued so enthusiastically that lady odowd and the colonel came forward to the balcony and drank the healths of their fellowcountrymen in a bumper of waytes best claret  on a second occasion jos read a brief announcementmajor dobbin had joined the th regiment at chatham and subsequently he promulgated accounts of the presentations at the drawingroom of colonel sir michael odowd kcb lady odowd by mrs malloy malony of ballymalony and miss glorvina odowd by lady odowd  almost directly after this dobbins name appeared among the lieutenantcolonels for old marshal tiptoff had died during the passage of the th from madras and the sovereign was pleased to advance colonel sir michael odowd to the rank of majorgeneral on his return to england with an intimation that he should be colonel of the distinguished regiment which he had so long commanded  amelia had been made aware of some of these movements  the correspondence between george and his guardian had not ceased by any means  william had even written once or twice to her since his departure but in a manner so unconstrainedly cold that the poor woman felt now in her turn that she had lost her power over him and that as he had said he was free  he had left her and she was wretched  the memory of his almost countless services and lofty and affectionate regard now presented itself to her and rebuked her day and night  she brooded over those recollections according to her wont saw the purity and beauty of the affection with which she had trifled and reproached herself for having flung away such a treasure  it was gone indeed  william had spent it all out  he loved her no more he thought as he had loved her he never could again  that sort of regard which he had proffered to her for so many faithful years cant be flung down and shattered and mended so as to show no scars the little heedless tyrant had so destroyed it  no william thought again and again it was myself i deluded and persisted in cajoling had she been worthy of the love i gave her she would have returned it long ago  it was a fond mistake  isnt the whole course of life made up of such and suppose i had won her should i not have been disenchanted the day after my victory why pine or be ashamed of my defeat the more he thought of this long passage of his life the more clearly he saw his deception  ill go into harness again he said and do my duty in that state of life in which it has pleased heaven to place me  i will see that the buttons of the recruits are properly bright and that the sergeants make no mistakes in their accounts  i will dine at mess and listen to the scotch surgeon telling his stories when i am old and broken i will go on halfpay and my old sisters shall scold me  i have geliebt und gelebet as the girl in wallenstein says  i am done  pay the bills and get me a cigar find out what there is at the play tonight francis tomorrow we cross by the batavier he made the above speech whereof francis only heard the last two lines pacing up and down the boompjes at rotterdam the batavier was lying in the basin  he could see the place on the quarterdeck where he and emmy had sat on the happy voyage out  what had that little mrs crawley to say to him psha tomorrow we will put to sea and return to england home and duty  after june all the little court society of pumpernickel used to separate according to the german plan and make for a hundred wateringplaces where they drank at the wells rode upon donkeys gambled at the redoutes if they had money and a mind rushed with hundreds of their kind to gourmandise at the tables dhote and idled away the summer  the english diplomatists went off to teoplitz and kissingen their french rivals shut up their chancellerie and whisked away to their darling boulevard de gand the transparent reigning family took too to the waters or retired to their hunting lodges everybody went away having any pretensions to politeness and of course with them doctor von glauber the court doctor and his baroness  the seasons for the baths were the most productive periods of the doctors practicehe united business with pleasure and his chief place of resort was ostend which is much frequented by germans and where the doctor treated himself and his spouse to what he called a dib in the sea  his interesting patient jos was a regular milchcow to the doctor and he easily persuaded the civilian both for his own healths sake and that of his charming sister which was really very much shattered to pass the summer at that hideous seaport town  emmy did not care where she went much  georgy jumped at the idea of a move  as for becky she came as a matter of course in the fourth place inside of the fine barouche mr jos had bought the two domestics being on the box in front she might have some misgivings about the friends whom she should meet at ostend and who might be likely to tell ugly storiesbut bah she was strong enough to hold her own  she had cast such an anchor in jos now as would require a strong storm to shake  that incident of the picture had finished him  becky took down her elephant and put it into the little box which she had had from amelia ever so many years ago emmy also came off with her laresher two picturesand the party finally were lodged in an exceedingly dear and uncomfortable house at ostend  there amelia began to take baths and get what good she could from them and though scores of people of beckys acquaintance passed her and cut her yet mrs osborne who walked about with her and who knew nobody was not aware of the treatment experienced by the friend whom she had chosen so judiciously as a companion indeed becky never thought fit to tell her what was passing under her innocent eyes  some of mrs rawdon crawleys acquaintances however acknowledged her readily enoughperhaps more readily than she would have desired among those were major loder unattached and captain rook late of the rifles who might be seen any day on the dike smoking and staring at the women and who speedily got an introduction to the hospitable board and select circle of mr joseph sedley  in fact they would take no denial they burst into the house whether becky was at home or not walked into mrs osbornes drawingroom which they perfumed with their coats and mustachios called jos old buck and invaded his dinnertable and laughed and drank for long hours there  what can they mean asked georgy who did not like these gentlemen i heard the major say to mrs crawley yesterday no no becky you shant keep the old buck to yourself  we must have the bones in or dammy ill split what could the major mean mamma  major  dont call him major emmy said  im sure i cant tell what he meant his presence and that of his friend inspired the little lady with intolerable terror and aversion  they paid her tipsy compliments they leered at her over the dinnertable  and the captain made her advances that filled her with sickening dismay nor would she ever see him unless she had george by her side  rebecca to do her justice never would let either of these men remain alone with amelia the major was disengaged too and swore he would be the winner of her a couple of ruffians were fighting for this innocent creature gambling for her at her own table and though she was not aware of the rascals designs upon her yet she felt a horror and uneasiness in their presence and longed to fly  she besought she entreated jos to go  not he  he was slow of movement tied to his doctor and perhaps to some other leadingstrings at least becky was not anxious to go to england  at last she took a great resolutionmade the great plunge  she wrote off a letter to a friend whom she had on the other side of the water a letter about which she did not speak a word to anybody which she carried herself to the post under her shawl nor was any remark made about it only that she looked very much flushed and agitated when georgy met her and she kissed him and hung over him a great deal that night  she did not come out of her room after her return from her walk becky thought it was major loder and the captain who frightened her  she mustnt stop here becky reasoned with herself she must go away the silly little fool  she is still whimpering after that gaby of a husbanddead and served right these fifteen years she shant marry either of these men  its too bad of loder  no she shall marry the bamboo cane ill settle it this very night  so becky took a cup of tea to amelia in her private apartment and found that lady in the company of her miniatures and in a most melancholy and nervous condition  she laid down the cup of tea  thank you said amelia  listen to me amelia said becky marching up and down the room before the other and surveying her with a sort of contemptuous kindness  i want to talk to you you must go away from here and from the impertinences of these men  i wont have you harassed by them and they will insult you if you stay  i tell you they are rascals men fit to send to the hulks  never mind how i know them i know everybody  jos cant protect you he is too weak and wants a protector himself  you are no more fit to live in the world than a baby in arms you must marry or you and your precious boy will go to ruin  you must have a husband you fool and one of the best gentlemen i ever saw has offered you a hundred times and you have rejected him you silly heartless ungrateful little creature  i triedi tried my best indeed i did rebecca said amelia deprecatingly but i couldnt forget and she finished the sentence by looking up at the portrait  couldnt forget him cried out becky that selfish humbug that lowbred cockney dandy that padded booby who had neither wit nor manners nor heart and was no more to be compared to your friend with the bamboo cane than you are to queen elizabeth  why the man was weary of you and would have jilted you but that dobbin forced him to keep his word  he owned it to me  he never cared for you he used to sneer about you to me time after time and made love to me the week after he married you  its false  its false  rebecca cried out amelia starting up  look there you fool becky said still with provoking good humour and taking a little paper out of her belt she opened it and flung it into emmys lap  you know his handwriting  he wrote that to mewanted me to run away with himgave it me under your nose the day before he was shotand served him right becky repeated  emmy did not hear her she was looking at the letter it was that which george had put into the bouquet and given to becky on the night of the duchess of richmonds ball  it was as she said  the foolish young man had asked her to fly  emmys head sank down and for almost the last time in which she shall be called upon to weep in this history she commenced that work  her head fell to her bosom and her hands went up to her eyes and there for a while she gave way to her emotions as becky stood on and regarded her  who shall analyse those tears and say whether they were sweet or bitter was she most grieved because the idol of her life was tumbled down and shivered at her feet or indignant that her love had been so despised or glad because the barrier was removed which modesty had placed between her and a new a real affection there is nothing to forbid me now she thought i may love him with all my heart now oh i will i will if he will but let me and forgive me i believe it was this feeling rushed over all the others which agitated that gentle little bosom  indeed she did not cry so much as becky expectedthe other soothed and kissed hera rare mark of sympathy with mrs becky  she treated emmy like a child and patted her head  and now let us get pen and ink and write to him to come this minute she said  ii wrote to him this morning emmy said blushing exceedingly becky screamed with laughterun biglietto she sang out with rosina eccolo quathe whole house echoed with her shrill singing  two mornings after this little scene although the day was rainy and gusty and amelia had had an exceedingly wakeful night listening to the wind roaring and pitying all travellers by land and by water yet she got up early and insisted upon taking a walk on the dike with georgy and there she paced as the rain beat into her face and she looked out westward across the dark sea line and over the swollen billows which came tumbling and frothing to the shore neither spoke much except now and then when the boy said a few words to his timid companion indicative of sympathy and protection  i hope he wont cross in such weather emmy said  i bet ten to one he does the boy answered  look mother theres the smoke of the steamer it was that signal sure enough  but though the steamer was under way he might not be on board he might not have got the letter he might not choose to come  a hundred fears poured one over the other into the little heart as fast as the waves on to the dike  the boat followed the smoke into sight  georgy had a dandy telescope and got the vessel under view in the most skilful manner and he made appropriate nautical comments upon the manner of the approach of the steamer as she came nearer and nearer dipping and rising in the water the signal of an english steamer in sight went fluttering up to the mast on the pier  i daresay mrs amelias heart was in a similar flutter  emmy tried to look through the telescope over georges shoulder but she could make nothing of it she only saw a black eclipse bobbing up and down before her eyes  george took the glass again and raked the vessel how she does pitch he said  there goes a wave slap over her bows  theres only two people on deck besides the steersman  theres a man lying down and achap in acloak with ahoorayits dob by jingo he clapped to the telescope and flung his arms round his mother  as for that lady let us say what she did in the words of a favourite poetdakruoen gelasasa she was sure it was william  it could be no other  what she had said about hoping that he would not come was all hypocrisy  of course he would come what could he do else but come she knew he would come  the ship came swiftly nearer and nearer  as they went in to meet her at the landingplace at the quay emmys knees trembled so that she scarcely could run  she would have liked to kneel down and say her prayers of thanks there  oh she thought she would be all her life saying them  it was such a bad day that as the vessel came alongside of the quay there were no idlers abroad scarcely even a commissioner on the look out for the few passengers in the steamer  that young scapegrace george had fled too and as the gentleman in the old cloak lined with red stuff stepped on to the shore there was scarcely any one present to see what took place which was briefly this  a lady in a dripping white bonnet and shawl with her two little hands out before her went up to him and in the next minute she had altogether disappeared under the folds of the old cloak and was kissing one of his hands with all her might whilst the other i suppose was engaged in holding her to his heart which her head just about reached and in preventing her from tumbling down  she was murmuring something aboutforgivedear williamdear dear dearest friendkiss kiss kiss and so forthand in fact went on under the cloak in an absurd manner  when emmy emerged from it she still kept tight hold of one of williams hands and looked up in his face  it was full of sadness and tender love and pity  she understood its reproach and hung down her head  it was time you sent for me dear amelia he said  you will never go again william  no never he answered and pressed the dear little soul once more to his heart  as they issued out of the customhouse precincts georgy broke out on them with his telescope up to his eye and a loud laugh of welcome he danced round the couple and performed many facetious antics as he led them up to the house  jos wasnt up yet becky not visible though she looked at them through the blinds georgy ran off to see about breakfast  emmy whose shawl and bonnet were off in the passage in the hands of mrs payne now went to undo the clasp of williams cloak andwe will if you please go with george and look after breakfast for the colonel  the vessel is in port he has got the prize he has been trying for all his life the bird has come in at last  there it is with its head on his shoulder billing and cooing close up to his heart with soft outstretched fluttering wings  this is what he has asked for every day and hour for eighteen years  this is what he pined after  here it isthe summit the endthe last page of the third volume goodbye colonelgod bless you honest williamfarewell dear ameliagrow green again tender little parasite round the rugged old oak to which you cling  perhaps it was compunction towards the kind and simple creature who had been the first in life to defend her perhaps it was a dislike to all such sentimental scenesbut rebecca satisfied with her part in the transaction never presented herself before colonel dobbin and the lady whom he married  particular business she said took her to bruges whither she went and only georgy and his uncle were present at the marriage ceremony when it was over and georgy had rejoined his parents mrs becky returned just for a few days to comfort the solitary bachelor joseph sedley  he preferred a continental life he said and declined to join in housekeeping with his sister and her husband  emmy was very glad in her heart to think that she had written to her husband before she read or knew of that letter of georges  i knew it all along william said but could i use that weapon against the poor fellows memory it was that which made me suffer so when you  never speak of that day again emmy cried out so contrite and humble that william turned off the conversation by his account of glorvina and dear old peggy odowd with whom he was sitting when the letter of recall reached him  if you hadnt sent for me he added with a laugh who knows what glorvinas name might be now  at present it is glorvina posky now mrs major posky she took him on the death of his first wife having resolved never to marry out of the regiment  lady odowd is also so attached to it that she says if anything were to happen to mick bedad shed come back and marry some of em  but the majorgeneral is quite well and lives in great splendour at odowdstown with a pack of beagles and with the exception of perhaps their neighbour hoggarty of castle hoggarty he is the first man of his county  her ladyship still dances jigs and insisted on standing up with the master of the horse at the lord lieutenants last ball  both she and glorvina declared that dobbin had used the latter sheamfully but posky falling in glorvina was consoled and a beautiful turban from paris appeased the wrath of lady odowd  when colonel dobbin quitted the service which he did immediately after his marriage he rented a pretty little country place in hampshire not far from queens crawley where after the passing of the reform bill sir pitt and his family constantly resided now all idea of a peerage was out of the question the baronets two seats in parliament being lost  he was both out of pocket and out of spirits by that catastrophe failed in his health and prophesied the speedy ruin of the empire  lady jane and mrs dobbin became great friendsthere was a perpetual crossing of ponychaises between the hall and the evergreens the colonels place rented of his friend major ponto who was abroad with his family  her ladyship was godmother to mrs dobbins child which bore her name and was christened by the rev james crawley who succeeded his father in the living and a pretty close friendship subsisted between the two lads george and rawdon who hunted and shot together in the vacations were both entered of the same college at cambridge and quarrelled with each other about lady janes daughter with whom they were both of course in love a match between george and that young lady was long a favourite scheme of both the matrons though i have heard that miss crawley herself inclined towards her cousin  mrs rawdon crawleys name was never mentioned by either family there were reasons why all should be silent regarding her  for wherever mr joseph sedley went she travelled likewise and that infatuated man seemed to be entirely her slave  the colonels lawyers informed him that his brotherinlaw had effected a heavy insurance upon his life whence it was probable that he had been raising money to discharge debts  he procured prolonged leave of absence from the east india house and indeed his infirmities were daily increasing  on hearing the news about the insurance amelia in a good deal of alarm entreated her husband to go to brussels where jos then was and inquire into the state of his affairs  the colonel quitted home with reluctance for he was deeply immersed in his history of the punjaub which still occupies him and much alarmed about his little daughter whom he idolizes and who was just recovering from the chickenpox and went to brussels and found jos living at one of the enormous hotels in that city  mrs crawley who had her carriage gave entertainments and lived in a very genteel manner occupied another suite of apartments in the same hotel  the colonel of course did not desire to see that lady or even think proper to notify his arrival at brussels except privately to jos by a message through his valet  jos begged the colonel to come and see him that night when mrs crawley would be at a soiree and when they could meet alone  he found his brotherinlaw in a condition of pitiable infirmityand dreadfully afraid of rebecca though eager in his praises of her  she tended him through a series of unheardof illnesses with a fidelity most admirable  she had been a daughter to him  butbutoh for gods sake do come and live near me andandsee me sometimes whimpered out the unfortunate man  the colonels brow darkened at this  we cant jos he said considering the circumstances amelia cant visit you  i swear to youi swear to you on the bible gasped out joseph wanting to kiss the book that she is as innocent as a child as spotless as your own wife  it may be so said the colonel gloomily but emmy cant come to you be a man jos  break off this disreputable connection  come home to your family  we hear your affairs are involved  involved cried jos  who has told such calumnies all my money is placed out most advantageously  mrs crawleythat isi meanit is laid out to

intend to leave all my money to youand i can spare it out of my income indeed i can cried out williams weak brotherinlaw  the colonel besought jos to fly at onceto go back to india whither mrs crawley could not follow him to do anything to break off a connection which might have the most fatal consequences to him  jos clasped his hands and cried he would go back to india  he would do anything only he must have time they mustnt say anything to mrs crawleyshedshed kill me if she knew it  you dont know what a terrible woman she is the poor wretch said  then why not come away with me said dobbin in reply but jos had not the courage  he would see dobbin again in the morning he must on no account say that he had been there  he must go now  becky might come in and dobbin quitted him full of forebodings  he never saw jos more  three months afterwards joseph sedley died at aixlachapelle  it was found that all his property had been muddled away in speculations and was represented by valueless shares in different bubble companies  all his available assets were the two thousand pounds for which his life was insured and which were left equally between his beloved sister amelia wife of c and his friend and invaluable attendant during sickness rebecca wife of lieutenantcolonel rawdon crawley cb who was appointed administratrix  the solicitor of the insurance company swore it was the blackest case that ever had come before him talked of sending a commission to aix to examine into the death and the company refused payment of the policy but mrs or lady crawley as she styled herself came to town at once attended with her solicitors messrs  burke thurtell and hayes of thavies inn and dared the company to refuse the payment  they invited examination they declared that she was the object of an infamous conspiracy which had been pursuing her all through life and triumphed finally  the money was paid and her character established but colonel dobbin sent back his share of the legacy to the insurance office and rigidly declined to hold any communication with rebecca  she never was lady crawley though she continued so to call herself his excellency colonel rawdon crawley died of yellow fever at coventry island most deeply beloved and deplored and six weeks before the demise of his brother sir pitt  the estate consequently devolved upon the present sir rawdon crawley bart  he too has declined to see his mother to whom he makes a liberal allowance and who besides appears to be very wealthy  the baronet lives entirely at queens crawley with lady jane and her daughter whilst rebecca lady crawley chiefly hangs about bath and cheltenham where a very strong party of excellent people consider her to be a most injured woman  she has her enemies  who has not her life is her answer to them she busies herself in works of piety  she goes to church and never without a footman  her name is in all the charity lists  the destitute orangegirl the neglected washerwoman the distressed muffinman find in her a fast and generous friend  she is always having stalls at fancy fairs for the benefit of these hapless beings  emmy her children and the colonel coming to london some time back found themselves suddenly before her at one of these fairs she cast down her eyes demurely and smiled as they started away from her emmy scurrying off on the arm of george now grown a dashing young gentleman and the colonel seizing up his little janey of whom he is fonder than of anything in the worldfonder even than of his history of the punjaub  fonder than he is of me emmy thinks with a sigh but he never said a word to amelia that was not kind and gentle or thought of a want of hers that he did not try to gratify  ah  vanitas vanitatum  which of us is happy in this world which of us has his desire or having it is satisfiedcome children let us shut up the box and the puppets for our play is played out
