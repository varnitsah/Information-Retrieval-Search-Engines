and there is the clock that is always rightexcept when you rely upon it and then it is more wrong than you would think a clock could be in a civilized country  i remember a clock of this latter type that we had in the house when i was a boy routing us all up at three oclock one winters morning we had finished breakfast at ten minutes to four and i got to school a little after five and sat down on the step outside and cried because i thought the world had come to an end everything was so deathlike  the man who can live in the same house with one of these clocks and not endanger his chance of heaven about once a month by standing up and telling it what he thinks of it is either a dangerous rival to that old established firm job or else he does not know enough bad language to make it worth his while to start saying anything at all  the great dream of its life is to lure you on into trying to catch a train by it for weeks and weeks it will keep the most perfect time if there were any difference in time between that clock and the sun you would be convinced it was the sun not the clock that wanted seeing to you feel that if that clock happened to get a quarter of a second fast or the eighth of an instant slow it would break its heart and die  it is in this spirit of childlike faith in its integrity that one morning you gather your family around you in the passage kiss your children and afterward wipe your jammy mouth poke your finger in the babys eye promise not to forget to order the coals wave at last fond adieu with the umbrella and depart for the railwaystation  i never have been quite able to decide myself which is the more irritating to run two miles at the top of your speed and then to find when you reach the station that you are threequarters of an hour too early or to stroll along leisurely the whole way and dawdle about outside the bookingoffice talking to some local idiot and then to swagger carelessly on to the platform just in time to see the train go out  as for the other class of clocksthe common or alwayswrong clocksthey are harmless enough you wind them up at the proper intervals and once or twice a week you put them right and regulate them as you call it and you might just as well try to regulate a london tomcat but you do all this not from any selfish motives but from a sense of duty to the clock itself you want to feel that whatever may happen you have done the right thing by it and that no blame can attach to you  so far as looking to it for any return is concerned that you never dream of doing and consequently you are not disappointed you ask what the time is and the girl replies  well the clock in the diningroom says a quarter past two  but you are not deceived by this you know that as a matter of fact it must be somewhere between nine and ten in the evening and remembering that you noticed as a curious circumstance that the clock was only forty minutes past four hours ago you mildly admire its energies and resources and wonder how it does it  i myself possess a clock that for complicated unconventionality and lighthearted independence could i should think give points to anything yet discovered in the chronometrical line as a mere timepiece it leaves much to be desired but considered as a selfacting conundrum it is full of interest and variety  i heard of a man once who had a clock that he used to say was of no good to any one except himself because he was the only man who understood it he said it was an excellent clock and one that you could thoroughly depend upon but you wanted to know itto have studied its system an outsider might be easily misled by it  for instance he would say when it strikes fifteen and the hands point to twenty minutes past eleven i know it is a quarter to eight  his acquaintanceship with that clock must certainly have given him an advantage over the cursory observer  but the great charm about my clock is its reliable uncertainty it works on no method whatever it is a pure emotionalist one day it will be quite frolicsome and gain three hours in the course of the morning and think nothing of it and the next day it will wish it were dead and be hardly able to drag itself along and lose two hours out of every four and stop altogether in the afternoon too miserable to do anything and then getting cheerful once more toward evening will start off again of its own accord  i do not care to talk much about this clock because when i tell the simple truth concerning it people think i am exaggerating  it is very discouraging to find when you are straining every nerve to tell the truth that people do not believe you and fancy that you are exaggerating it makes you feel inclined to go and exaggerate on purpose just to show them the difference i know i often feel tempted to do so myselfit is my early training that saves me  we should always be very careful never to give way to exaggeration it is a habit that grows upon one  and it is such a vulgar habit too in the old times when poets and drygoods salesmen were the only people who exaggerated there was something clever and distingue about a reputation for a tendency to over rather than to underestimate the mere bald facts but everybody exaggerates nowadays the art of exaggeration is no longer regarded as an extra in the modern bill of education it is an essential requirement held to be most needful for the battle of life  the whole world exaggerates it exaggerates everything from the yearly number of bicycles sold to the yearly number of heathens convertedinto the hope of salvation and more whiskey exaggeration is the basis of our trade the fallowfield of our art and literature the groundwork of our social life the foundation of our political existence as schoolboys we exaggerate our fights and our marks and our fathers debts as men we exaggerate our wares we exaggerate our feelings we exaggerate our incomesexcept to the taxcollector and to him we exaggerate our outgoings we exaggerate our virtues we even exaggerate our vices and being in reality the mildest of men pretend we are daredevil scamps  we have sunk so low now that we try to act our exaggerations and to live up to our lies we call it keeping up appearances and no more bitter phrase could perhaps have been invented to describe our childish folly  if we possess a hundred pounds a year do we not call it two our larder may be low and our grates be chill but we are happy if the world six acquaintances and a prying neighbor gives us credit for one hundred and fifty and when we have five hundred we talk of a thousand and the allimportant and beloved world sixteen friends now and two of them carriagefolks agree that we really must be spending seven hundred or at all events running into debt up to that figure but the butcher and baker who have gone into the matter with the housemaid know better  after awhile having learned the trick we launch out boldly and spend like indian princesor rather seem to spend for we know by this time how to purchase the seeming with the seeming how to buy the appearance of wealth with the appearance of cash and the dear old worldbeelzebub bless it for it is his own child sure enough there is no mistaking the likeness it has all his funny little waysgathers round applauding and laughing at the lie and sharing in the cheat and gloating over the thought of the blow that it knows must sooner or later fall on us from the thorlike hammer of truth  and all goes merry as a witches frolicuntil the gray morning dawns  truth and fact are oldfashioned and outofdate my friends fit only for the dull and vulgar to live by appearance not reality is what the clever dog grasps at in these clever days we spurn the dullbrown solid earth we build our lives and homes in the fairseeming rainbowland of shadow and chimera  to ourselves sleeping and waking there behind the rainbow there is no beauty in the house only a chill damp mist in every room and over all a haunting fear of the hour when the gilded clouds will melt away and let us fallsomewhat heavily no doubtupon the hard world underneath  but there of what matter is our misery our terror to the stranger our home appears fair and bright the workers in the fields below look up and envy us our abode of glory and delight if they think it pleasant surely we should be content have we not been taught to live for others and not for ourselves and are we not acting up bravely to the teachingin this most curious method  ah yes we are selfsacrificing enough and loyal enough in our devotion to this newcrowned king the child of prince imposture and princess pretense never before was despot so blindly worshiped never had earthly sovereign yet such worldwide sway  man if he would live must worship he looks around and what to him within the vision of his life is the greatest and the best that he falls down and does reverence to to him whose eyes have opened on the nineteenth century what nobler image can the universe produce than the figure of falsehood in stolen robes it is cunning and brazen and hollowhearted and it realizes his souls ideal and he falls and kisses its feet and clings to its skinny knees swearing fealty to it for evermore  ah he is a mighty monarch bladderbodied king humbug come let us build up temples of hewn shadows wherein we may adore him safe from the light let us raise him aloft upon our brummagem shields long live our coward falsehearted chieffit leader for such soldiers as we long live the lordoflies anointed long live poor king appearances to whom all mankind bows the knee  but we must hold him aloft very carefully oh my brother warriors he needs much keeping up he has no bones and sinews of his own the poor old flimsy fellow if we take our hands from him he will fall a heap of wornout rags and the angry wind will whirl him away and leave us forlorn oh let us spend our lives keeping him up and serving him and making him greatthat is evermore puffed out with air and nothingnessuntil he burst and we along with him  burst one day he must as it is in the nature of bubbles to burst especially when they grow big meanwhile he still reigns over us and the world grows more and more a world of pretense and exaggeration and lies and he who pretends and exaggerates and lies the most successfully is the greatest of us all  the world is a gingerbread fair and we all stand outside our booths and point to the gorgeouscolored pictures and beat the big drum and brag brag brag life is one great game of brag  buy my soap oh ye people and ye will never look old and the hair will grow again on your bald places and ye will never be poor or unhappy again and mine is the only true soap oh beware of spurious imitations  buy my lotion all ye that suffer from pains in the head or the stomach or the feet or that have broken arms or broken hearts or objectionable mothersinlaw and drink one bottle a day and all your troubles will be

way  oh vote for me my noble and intelligent electors and send our party into power and the world shall be a new place and there shall be no sin or sorrow any more and each free and independent voter shall have a bran new utopia made on purpose for him according to his own ideas with a goodsized extraunpleasant purgatory attached to which he can send everybody he does not like oh do not miss this

greatest cheesemonger i am the greatest soldier i am the greatest statesman i am the greatest poet i am the greatest showman i am the greatest mountebank i am the greatest editor and i am the greatest patriot we are the greatest nation we are the only good people ours is the only true religion bah how we all yell  how we all brag and bounce and beat the drum and shout and nobody believes a word we utter and the people ask one another saying  how can we tell who is the greatest and the cleverest among all these shrieking braggarts  and they answer  there is none great or clever the great and clever men are not here there is no place for them in this pandemonium of charlatans and quacks the men you see here are crowing cocks we suppose the greatest and the best of them are they who crow the loudest and the longest that is the only test of their merits  therefore what is left for us to do but to crow and the best and greatest of us all is he who crows the loudest and the longest on this little dunghill that we call our world  well i was going to tell you about our clock  it was my wifes idea getting it in the first instance we had been to dinner at the buggles and buggles had just bought a clockpicked it up in essex was the way he described the transaction buggles is always going about picking up things he will stand before an old carved bedstead weighing about three tons and say  yespretty little thing i picked it up in holland as though he had found it by the roadside and slipped it into his umbrella when nobody was looking  buggles was rather full of this clock it was of the good oldfashioned grandfather type it stood eight feet high in a carvedoak case and had a deep sonorous solemn tick that made a pleasant accompaniment to the afterdinner chat and seemed to fill the room with an air of homely dignity  we discussed the clock and buggles said how he loved the sound of its slow grave tick and how when all the house was still and he and it were sitting up alone together it seemed like some wise old friend talking to him and telling him about the old days and the old ways of thought and the old life and the old people  the clock impressed my wife very much she was very thoughtful all the way home and as we went upstairs to our flat she said why could not we have a clock like that she said it would seem like having some one in the house to take care of us allshe should fancy it was looking after baby  i have a man in northamptonshire from whom i buy old furniture now and then and to him i applied he answered by return to say that he had got exactly the very thing i wanted he always has i am very lucky in this respect it was the quaintest and most oldfashioned clock he had come across for a long while and he enclosed photograph and full particulars should he send it up  from the photograph and the particulars it seemed as he said the very thing and i told him yes send it up at once  three days afterward there came a knock at the doorthere had been other knocks at the door before this of course but i am dealing merely with the history of the clock the girl said a couple of men were outside and wanted to see me and i went to them  i found they were pickfords carriers and glancing at the waybill i saw that it was my clock that they had brought and i said airily oh yes its quite right bring it up  they said they were very sorry but that was just the difficulty they could not get it up  i went down with them and wedged securely across the second landing of the staircase i found a box which i should have judged to be the original case in which cleopatras needle came over  they said that was my clock  i brought down a chopper and a crowbar and we sent out and collected in two extra hired ruffians and the five of us worked away for half an hour and got the clock out after which the traffic up and down the staircase was resumed much to the satisfaction of the other tenants  we then got the clock upstairs and put it together and i fixed it in the corner of the diningroom  at first it exhibited a strong desire to topple over and fall on people but by the liberal use of nails and screws and bits of firewood i made life in the same room with it possible and then being exhausted i had my wounds dressed and went to bed  in the middle of the night my wife woke me up in a great state of alarm to say that the clock had just struck thirteen and who did i think was going to die  i said i did not know but hoped it might be the nextdoor dog  my wife said she had a presentiment it meant baby there was no comforting her she cried herself to sleep again  during the course of the morning i succeeded in persuading her that she must have made a mistake and she consented to smile once more in the afternoon the clock struck thirteen again  this renewed all her fears she was convinced now that both baby and i were doomed and that she would be left a childless widow i tried to treat the matter as a joke and this only made her more wretched she said that she could see i really felt as she did and was only pretending to be lighthearted for her sake and she said she would try and bear it bravely  the person she chiefly blamed was buggles  in the night the clock gave us another warning and my wife accepted it for her aunt maria and seemed resigned she wished however that i had never had the clock and wondered when if ever i should get cured of my absurd craze for filling the house with tomfoolery  the next day the clock struck thirteen four times and this cheered her up she said that if we were all going to die it did not so much matter most likely there was a fever or a plague coming and we should all be taken together  she was quite lighthearted over it  after that the clock went on and killed every friend and relation we had and then it started on the neighbors  it struck thirteen all day long for months until we were sick of slaughter and there could not have been a human being left alive for miles around  then it turned over a new leaf and gave up murdering folks and took to striking mere harmless thirtynines and fortyones its favorite number now is thirtytwo but once a day it strikes fortynine it never strikes more than fortynine i dont know whyi have never been able to understand whybut it doesnt  it does not strike at regular intervals but when it feels it wants to and would be better for it sometimes it strikes three or four times within the same hour and at other times it will go for halfaday without striking at all  he is an odd old fellow  i have thought now and then of having him seen to and made to keep regular hours and be respectable but somehow i seem to have grown to love him as he is with his daring mockery of time  he certainly has not much respect for it he seems to go out of his way almost to openly insult it he calls halfpast two thirtyeight oclock and in twenty minutes from then he says it is one  is it that he really has grown to feel contempt for his master and wishes to show it they say no man is a hero to his valet may it be that even stonyface time himself is but a shortlived puny mortala little greater than some others that is allto the dim eyes of this old servant of his has he ticking ticking all these years come at last to see into the littleness of that time that looms so great to our awed human eyes  is he saying as he grimly laughs and strikes his thirtyfives and forties bah i know you time godlike and dread though you seem what are you but a phantoma dreamlike the rest of us here ay less for you will pass away and be no more fear him not immortal men time is but the shadow of the world upon the background of eternity
