waterwitch   the middle of august is come at last and with it the solemn day on which frederick viscount scoutbush may be expected to revisit the home of his ancestors elsley has gradually made up his mind to the inevitable with a stately sulkiness and comforts himself as the time draws near with the thought that after all his brotherinlaw is not a very formidable personage  but to the population of aberalva in general the coming event is one of awful jubilation the shipping is all decked with flags all the sunday clothes have been looked out and many a yard of new ribbon and pound of bad powder bought there have been arrangements for a procession which could not be got up for a speech which nobody would undertake to pronounce and lastly for a dinner about which last there was no hanging back yea also they have hired from carcarrow churchtown sackbut psaltery dulcimer and all kinds of music for frank has put down the old choir band at aberalvaanother of his mistakesand there is but one fiddle and a clarionet now left in all the town so the said town waits all the day on tiptoe ready to worship till out of the soft brown haze the stately waterwitch comes sliding in like a white ghost to fold her wings in aberalva bay  and at that sight the town is all astir fishermen shake themselves up out of their midday snooze to admire the beauty as she slips on and on through water smooth as glass her hull hidden by the vast curve of the balloonjib and her broad wings boomed out alow and aloft till it seems marvellous how that vast screen does not topple headlong instead of floating as it seems selfsupporting above its image in the mirror women hurry to put on their best bonnets the sexton toddles up with the church key in his hand and the ringers at his heels the coastguard lieutenant bustles down to the manbys mortar which he has hauled out in readiness on the pebbles old willis hoists a flag before his house and halfadozen merchant skippers do the same bang goes the harmless mortar burning the british nations powder without leave or licence and all the rocks and woods catch up the echo and kick it from cliff to cliff playing at football with it till its breath is beaten out a rolling fire of old muskets and birdpieces crackles along the shore and in five minutes a poor lad has blown a ramrod through his hand never mind lords do not visit penalva every day out burst the bells above with merry peal lord scoutbush and the waterwitch are duly rung in to the home of his lordships ancestors and he is received as he scrambles up the pier steps from his boat by the curate the churchwardens the lieutenant and old tardrew backed by halfadozen ancient sons of anak lineal descendants of the free fishermen to whom six hundred years before st just of penalva did grant privileges hard to spell and harder to understand on the condition of receiving whensoever he should land at the quay head three brass farthings from the free fishermen of aberalva  scoutbush shakes hands with curate lieutenant tardrew churchwardens and then come forward the three farthings in an ancient leather purse  hope your lordship will do us the honour to shake hands with us too we are your lordships free fishermen as we have been your forefathers says a magnificent old man gracefully acknowledging the feudal tie while he claims the exemption  little scoutbush who is the kindesthearted of men clasps the great brown fist in his little white one and shakes hands heartily with every one of them sayingif your forefathers were as much taller than mine as you are than me gentlemen i shouldnt wonder if they took their own freedom without asking his leave for it  a lord who begins his progress with a jest that is the sort of aristocrat to rule in aberalva and all agree that evening at the mariners rest that his lordship is as nice a young gentleman as ever trod deal board and deserves such a yacht as hes got and long may he sail her  how easy it is to buy the love of men gold will not do it but there is a little angel may be in the corner of every mans eye who is worth more than gold and can do it free of all charges unless a man drives him out and hates his brother and so walks in darkness not knowing whither he goeth but running full butt against mens prejudices and treading on their corns till they knock him down in despairand all just because he will not open his eyes and use the light which comes by common human goodnature  presently tom hurries up having been originally one of the deputation but kept by the necessity of binding up the three fingers which the ramrod had spared to poor jem burmans hand he bows and the lieutenantwho frank being a little shy acts as her majestys representativeintroduces him as deputy medical man to our district of the union sir mr thurnall  dr heale was to have been hero by the by where is dr heale says some one  very sorry my lord i can answer for himprofessional calls i dont doubtnobody more devoted to your lordship  one need not inquire where dr heale was but if elderly men will drink much brandyandwater in hot summer days after a heavy early dinner then will those men be too late for deputations and for more important employments  never mind the doctor daresay hes asleep after dinner do him good says the viscount hitting the mark with a random shot and thereby raising his repute for sagacity immensely with his audience who laugh outright  ah is it so then butmr thurnall i think you saidi am glad to make your acquaintance sir i have heard your name often you are my friend mellots old friend are you not  i am a very old friend of claude mellots  well and there he is on board and will be delighted to do the honours of my yacht to you whenever you like to visit her you and i must know each other better sir  tom bows lowhis lordship does him too much honour the cunning fellow knows that his fortune is made in aberalva if he chooses to work it out but he humbly slips into the rear for frank has to be supported not being over popular and the lieutenant may turn crusty unless he has his lordship to himself before the gaze of assembled aberalva  scoutbush progresses up the street bowing right and left and stopped halfadozen times by redcloaked old women who curtsey under his nose and will needs inform him how they knew his grandfather or nursed his uncle or how his dear mother god rest her soul gave me this very cloak as i have on and so forth till scoutbush comes to the conclusion that they are a very loving and lovable set of peopleas indeed they areand his heart smites him somewhat for not having seen more of them in past years  no sooner is thurnall released than he is off to the yacht as fast as oars can take him and in claudes arms  now after all salutations and inquiries have been gone through let me introduce you to major campbell and tom was presented to a tall and thin personage who sat at the cabin table bending over a microscope  excuse my rising said he holding out a left hand for the right was busy a single jar will give me ten minutes work to do again i am delighted to meet you mellot has often spoken to me of you as a man who has seen more and faced death more carelessly than most men  mellot flatters sir whatsoever i have done i have given up being careless about death for i have some one beside myself to live for  married at last has diogenes found his aspasia cried claude  tom did not laugh  since my brothers died claude the old gentleman has only me to look to you seem to be a naturalist sir  a dabbler said the major with eye and hand still busy  i ought not to begin our acquaintance by doubting your word but these things are no dabblers work and tom pointed to some exquisite photographs of minute corallines evidently taken under the microscope  they are mellots  mellot turned man of science impossible  no only photographer i am tired of painting nature clumsily and then seeing a sunpicture outdo all my effortsso i am turned photographer and have made a vow against painting for three years and a day  why the photographs only give you light and shade  they will give you colour too before seven years are overand that is more than i can do or any one else no i yield to the new dynasty the artists occupation is gone henceforth and the painters studio like all charms must fly at the mere touch of cold philosophy so major campbell prepares the charming little cockyoly birds and i call in the sun to immortalise them  and perfectly you are succeeding they are quite new to me recollect when i left melbourne the art had hardly risen there above guinea portraits of bearded desperadoes a nugget in one hand and a £50 note in the other but this is a new and what a forward step for science  you are a naturalist then said campbell looking up with interest  all my profession are more or less said tom carelessly and i have been lucky enough here to fall on untrodden ground and have hunted up a few seamonsters this summer  really you can tell one where to search then and where to dredge i hope i have set my heart on a fortnights work here and have been dreaming at night like a child before a twelfthnight party of all sorts of impossible hydras gorgons and chimaeras dire fished up from your western deeps  i have none of them but i can give you turbinolia milletiana and zoanthus couchii i have a party of the last gentlemen alive on shore  the majors face worked with almost childish delight  but i shall be robbing you  they cost me nothing my dear sir i did very well moreover without them for fiveandthirty years and i may do equally well for fiveandthirty more  i ought to be able to say the same surely answered the major composing his face again and rising carefully i have to thank you exceedingly my dear sir for your prompt generosity but it is better discipline for a man in many ways to find things for himself than to have them put into his hands so with a thousand thanks you shall let me see if i can dredge a turbinolia for myself  this was spoken with so sweet and polished a modulation and yet so sadly and severely withal that tom looked at the speaker with interest he was a very tall and powerful man and would have been a very handsome man both in face and figure but for the high cheekbone long neck and narrow shoulders so often seen north of tweed his brow was very high and full his eyesgrave but very gentle with large drooping eyelids were buried under shaggy grey eyebrows his mouth was gentle as his eyes but compressed perhaps by the habit of command perhaps by secret sorrow for of that too as well as of intellect and magnanimity thurnall thought he could discern the traces his face was bronzed by long exposure to the sun his closecut curls which had once been auburn were fast turning white though his features looked those of a man under fiveandforty his cheeks were as smooth shaven as his chin a right selfpossessed valiant soldier he looked one who could be very loving to little innocents and very terrible to fullgrown knaves  you are practising at selfdenial as usual said claude  because i may at any moment have to exercise it in earnest mr thurnall can you tell me the name of this little glass arrow which i just found shooting about in the sweeping net  tom did know the wonderful little link between the fish and the insect and the two chatted over its strange form till the boat returned to take them ashore  do you make any stay here  i purpose to spend a fortnight here in my favourite pursuit i must draw on your kindness and knowledge of the place to point me out lodgings  lodgings as it befell were to be found and good ones close to the beach and away from the noise of the harbour on mrs harveys first floor for the local preacher who generally occupied them was away  but major campbell might dislike the noise of the school  the school what better music for a lonely old bachelor than childrens voices  so by sunset the major was fairly established over mrs harveys shop it was not the place which tom would have chosen he was afraid of running over poor grace if he came in and out as often as he could have wished nevertheless he accepted the majors invitation to visit him that very evening  i cannot ask you to dinner yet sir for my ménage will be hardly settled but a cup of coffee and an exceedingly good cigar i think my establishment may furnish you by seven oclock tonightif you think them worth walking down for  tom of course said something civil and made his appearance in due time he found the coffee ready and the cigars also but the major was busy in his shirt sleeves unpacking and arranging jars nets microscopes and what not of scientific lumber and tom proffered his help  i am ashamed to make use of you the first moment that you become my guest  i shall enjoy the mere handling of your tackle said tom and began breaking the tenth commandment over almost every article he touched for everything was firstrate of its kind  you seem to have devoted money as well as thought plentifully to the pursuit  i have little else to which to devote either and more of both than is perhaps safe for me  i should hardly complain of a superfluity of thought if superfluity of money was the condition of it  pray understand me i am no dives but i have learned to want so little that i hardly know how to spend the little which i have  i should hardly have called that an unsafe state  the penniless faquir who lives on chance handfuls of rice has his dangers as well as the rich parsee who has his ventures out from madagascar to canton yes i have often envied the schemer the man of business almost the man of pleasure their many wants at least absorb them in outward objects instead of leaving them too easily satisfied to sink in upon themselves and waste away in useless dreams  you found out the best cure for that malady when you took up the microscope and the collectingbox  so i fancied once i took up natural history in india years ago to drive away thought as other men might take to opium or to brandypawnee but like them it has become a passion now and a tyranny and i go on hunting discovering wondering craving for more knowledge andcui bono i sometimes ask  why this at least sir that without such men as you who work for mere love science would be now fifty years behind her present standingpoint and we doctors should not know a thousand important facts which you have been kind enough to tell us while we have not time to find them out for ourselves  sic vos non vobis  yes you have the work and we have the pay which is a very fair division of labour considering the world we live in  and have you been skilful enough to make science pay you here in such an outoftheway little world as that of aberalva must be  she is a good stalkinghorse anywhere and tom detailed with plenty of humour the effect of his microscope and his lecture on the drops of water but his wit seemed so much lost on campbell that he at last stopped almost short not quite sure that he had not taken a liberty  no go on i beg you and do not fancy that i am not interested and amused too because my laughing muscles are a little stiff from want of use perhaps too i am apt to take things too much au grand sérieux but i could not help thinking while you were speaking how sad it was that people were utterly ignorant of matters so vitally necessary to health  and i perhaps ought not to jest over the subject but indeed with cholera staring us in the face here i must indulge in some emotion and as it is unprofessional to weep i must laugh as long as i dare  the major dropped his coffeecup upon the floor and looked at thurnall with so horrified a gaze that tom could hardly believe him to be the same man then recollecting himself he darted down upon the remains of his cup and looking up againa thousand pardons butdid i hear you aright cholera staring us in the face  how can it be otherwise it is drawing steadily on from the eastward week by week and in the present state of the town nothing but some miraculous caprice of dame fortunes can deliver us  dont talk of fortune sir at such a moment talk of god said the major rising from his chair and pacing the room it is too horrible intolerable when do you expect it here  within the month perhapshardly before i should have warned you of the danger i assure you had i not understood from you that you were only going to stay a fortnight  the major made an impatient gesture  do you fancy that i am afraid for myself no but the thought of its coming toto the poor people in the town you know it is too dreadful i have seen it in indiaamong my own menamong the natives good heavens i never shall forgetand to meet the fiend again here of all places in the world i fancied it so clean and healthy swept by fresh seabreezes  and by nothing else a halfhours walk round would convince you sir i only wish that you could persuade his lordship to accompany you  scoutbush of course he willhe shallhe must good heavens whose concern is it more than his you think then that there is a chance of staving it offby cleansing i mean  if we have heavy rains during the next week or two yes if this drought last better leave ill alone we shall only provoke the devil by stirring him up  you speak confidently said the major gradually regaining his own selfpossession as he saw tom so selfpossessed have youallow me to ask so important a questionhave you seen much of cholera  i have worked through three at paris at st petersburgh and in the west indies and i have been thinking up my old experience for the last six weeks foreseeing what would come  i am satisfied sir perhaps i ought to ask your pardon for the question  not at all how can you trust a man unless you know him and you expect it within the month you shall go with me to lord scoutbush tomorrow andand now we will talk of something more pleasant and he began again upon the zoophites  tom as they chatted on could not help wondering at the majors unexpected passion and could not help remarking also that in spite of his desire to be agreeable and to interest his guest in his scientific discoveries he was yet distraught and full of other thoughts what could be the meaning of it was it mere excess of human sympathy the countenance hardly betokened that but still who can trust altogether the expression of a weatherhardened visage of fortyfive so the doctor set it down to tenderness of heart till a fresh vista opened on him  major campbell he soon found was as fond of insects as of seamonsters and he began inquiring about the woods the heaths the climate which seemed to the doctor for a long time to mean nothing more than the question which he put plainly where have i a chance of rare insects but he seemed after a while to be trying to learn the geography of the parish in detail and especially of the ground round vavasours house however its no business of mine thought thurnall and told him all he wanted till  then the house lies quite in the bottom of the glen is there a good fall to the streamfor a stream i suppose there is  thurnall shook his head cold boggy stewponds in the garden such as our ancestors loved damming up the stream they must needs have fish in lent we know and paid the penalty of it by ague and fever  stewponds damming up the stream scoutbush ought to drain them instantly said the major half to himself but still the house lies highwith regard to the town i mean no chance of malaria coming up  upon my word sir as a professional man that is a thing that i dare not say the chances are not greatthe house is two hundred yards from the nearest cottage but if there be an east wind  i cannot bear this any longer it is perfect madness  i trust sir that you do not think that i have neglected the matter i have pointed it all out i assure you to mr vavasour  and it is not altered  i believe it is to be alteredthat isthe truth is sir that mr vavasour shrinks so much from the very notion of cholera that  that he does not like to do anything which may look like believing in its possibility  he says quoth tom parrying the question but in a somewhat dry tone that he is afraid of alarming mrs vavasour and the servants  the major said something under his breath which tom did not catch and then in an appeased tone of voice  well that is at least a fault on the right side mrs vavasours brother as owner of the place is of course the proper person to make the house fit for habitation and he relapsed into silence while thurnall who suspected more than met the ear rose to depart  are you going it is not late not ten oclock yet  a medical man who may be called up at any moment must make sure of his beauty sleep  i will walk with you and smoke my last cigar so they went out and up to heales tom went in but he observed that his companion after standing awhile in the street irresolutely went on up the hill and as far as he could see turned up the lane to vavasours  a mystery here thought he as he put matters to rights in the surgery ere going upstairs a mystery which i may as well fathom it may be of use to poor tom as most other mysteries are that is though if i can do it honourably for the man is a gallant gentleman i like him and i am inclined to trust him whatsoever his secret is i dont think that it is one which he need be ashamed of still theres a deal of human natur in man and there may be in himand what matter if there is  half an hour afterwards the major returned took the candle from grace who was sitting up for him and went upstairs with a gentle good night but without looking at her  he sat down at the open window and looked out leaning on the sill  well i was too late i daresay there was some purpose in it when shall i learn to believe that god takes better care of his own than i can do i was faithless and impatient tonight i am afraid i betrayed myself before that man he looks like one certainly who could be trusted with a secret yet i had rather that he had not mine it is my own fault like everything else foolish old fellow that you are fretting and fussing to the end is not that scene a message from above saying be still and know that i am god  and the major looked out upon the summer sea lit by a million globes of living fire and then upon the waves which broke in flame upon the beach and then up to the spangled stars above  what do i know of these with all my knowing not even a twentieth part of those medusae or one in each thousand of those sparks among the foam perhaps i need not know and yet why was the thirst awakened in me save to be satisfied at last perhaps to become more intense with every fresh delicious draught of knowledge death beautiful wise kind death when will you come and tell me what i want to know i courted you once and many a time brave old death only to give rest to the weary that was a cowards wish and so you would not come i ran you close in afghanistan old death and at sobraon too i was not far behind you and i thought i had you safe among that jungle grass at aliwal but you slipped through my handi was not worthy of you and now i will not hunt you any more old death do you bide your time and i mine though who knows if i may not meet you here only when you come give me not rest but work give work to the idle freedom to the chained sight to the blindtell me a little about finer things than zoophytesperhaps about the zoophytes as welland you shall still be brave old death my good campcomrade now for many a year  was major campbell mad that depends upon the way in which the reader may choose to define the adjective  meanwhile scoutbush had walked into penalva courtwhere an affecting scene of reconciliation took place  not in the least scoutbush kissed lucia shook hands with elsley hugged the children and then settled himself in an armchair and talked about the weather exactly as if he had been running in and out of the house every week for the last three years and so the matter was done and for the first time a partie carrée was assembled in the diningroom  the evening passed off at first as uncomfortably as it could where three out of the four were wellbred people elsley was of course shy before lord scoutbush and scoutbush was equally shy before elsley though as civil as possible to him for the little fellow stood in extreme awe of elsleys talents and was afraid of opening his lips before a poet lucia was nervous for both their sakes as well she might be and valencia had to make all the talking and succeeded capitally in drawing out both her brother and her brotherinlaw till both of them found the other on the whole more like other people than he had expected the next mornings breakfast therefore was easy and gracious enough and when it was over and lucia fled to household matters  you smoke vavasour asked scoutbush  vavasour did not smoke  really i thought poets always smoked you will not forbid my having a cigar in your garden nevertheless i suppose do walk round with me too and show me the place unless you are going to be busy  oh no elsley was at lord scoutbushs service of course and had really nothing to do so out they went  charming old pigeonhole it is said its owner i have not seen it since i went into the guards campbell says its a shame of me and so it is one i suppose but how beautiful you have made the garden look  lucia is very fond of gardening said elsley who was very fond of it also and had great taste therein but he was afraid to confess any such tastes before a man who he thought would not understand him  and that fine old woodfull of cocks it used to bei hope you worked it well last year  elsley did not shoot but he had heard there was plenty of game there  plenty of cocks said his guest correcting him but for game the less we say about that the better i really wonder you do not shoot it fills up time so in the winter  there is really no winter to fill up here thanks to this delicious climate and i have my books  ah i wish i had i wish heartily said he in a confidential tone you or campbell or some of your clever men would sell me a little of their booklearning as valencia says to me brains are so common in the world i wonder how none fell to your share  i do not think that they are an article which is for sale if solomon is to be believed  and if they were i couldnt afford to buy with this irish encumbered estates bill but now this is one thing i wanted to say is everything here just as you would wish of course no one could wish a better tenant but any repairs you know or improvements which i ought to do of course only tell me what you think should be done for of course you know more about these things than i docant know less  nothing i assure you lord scoutbush i have always left those matters to mr tardrew  ah my dear fellow you shouldnt do that he is such a screw as all honest stewards are screws me i know and i dare say has screwed you too  never i assure you i never gave him the opportunity and he has been most civil  well in future just order him to do what you like and just as if you were landlord in fact and if the old man haggles write to me and ill blow him up delighted to have a man of taste like you here who can improve the place for me  i assure you lord scoutbush i need nothing nor does the place i am a man of very few wants  i wish i were sighed scoutbush pulling out another of hudsons highestpriced cigars  and i am bound to sayand here elsley choked a little but the viscounts frankness and humility had softened him and he determined to be very magnanimousi am bound in honour after owing to your kindness such an exquisite retreatall that either i or lucia could have fancied for ourselves and morenot to trouble you by asking for little matters which we really do not need  and so elsley instead of simply asking to have the housedrains set right which lord scoutbush would have done upon the spot chose to be loftyminded at the risk of killing his wife and children  my dear follow you really must not lord me any more i hate it i must be plain scoutbush here among my own people just as i am in the guards messroom and as for owing me anyreally it is we that are in your debtto see my sister so happy and such beautiful children and so well tooand altogetherand valencia so delighted with your poemsand and altogether and there lord scoutbush stopped having hoisted as he considered the flag of peace once and for all and very glad that the thing was over  elsley was going to say something in return but his guest turned the conversation as fast as he could and now i know you want to be busy though you are too civil to confess it and i must be with that old fool tardrew at ten to settle accounts hell scold me if i do notthe precise old pedantjust as if i was his own child goodbye  where are you going frederick called lucia from the window she had been watching the interview anxiously enough and could see that it had ended well  to old stotandkye at the farm do you want anything  no only i thought you might be going to the yacht and valencia would have walked down with you she wants to find major campbell  i want to scold major campbell said valencia tripping out on the lawn in her walking dress why has he not been here an hour ago i will undertake to say that he was up at four this morning  he waits to be invited i suppose said scoutbush  i suppose i must do it said elsley to himself sighing  just like his primness said valencia i shall go down and bring him up myself this minute and mr vavasour shall come with me of course you will you do not know what a delightful person he is when once you can break the ice  elsley like most vain men was of a jealous temper and valencias eagerness to see major campbell jarred on him he wanted to keep the exquisite creature to himself and headley was quite enough of an intruder already beside the accounts of the new comer his learning his military prowess the reverence with which all even scoutbush evidently regarded him made him prepared to dislike the major and all the more now he heard that there was an icecrust to crack impulsive men like elsley especially when their selfrespect and certainty of their own position is not very strong have instinctively a defiant fear of the strong calm selfcontained man especially if he has seen the world and elsley set down major campbell as a proud sarcastic fellow before whom he must be at the pains of being continually on his guard he wished him a hundred miles away however there was no refusing valencia anything so he got his hat but with so bad a grace that valencia saw his chagrin and from mere naughtiness of heart amused herself with it by talking all the way of nothing but major campbell  and lucia she said at last will be so glad to see him again we knew him so well you know in eaton square years ago  really said elsley wincing i never met him there he recollected that lucia had expressed more pleasure at major campbells coming than even at that of her brother and a dark undefined phantom entered his heart which though he would have been too proud to confess it to himself was none other than jealousy  ohdid you not no it was the year before we first knew you and we used to laugh at him together behind his back and christened him the wild indian because he was so gauche and shy he was a major in the indian army then but a few months afterwards he sold out went into the lineno one could tell why for he threw away very brilliant prospects they say and might have been a general by now instead of a mere major still but he is so improved since then he is like an elder brother to scoutbush guides him in everything i call him the blind man and the major his dog  so much the worse thought elsley who disliked the notion of campbells having power over a man to whom he was indebted for his houseroom but by this time they were at mrs harveys door  mrs harvey opened it curtseying to the very ground and valencia ran upstairs and knocked at the sittingroom door herself  come in shouted a preoccupied voice inside  is that a proper way in which to address a lady sir answered she putting in her beautiful head  major campbell was sitting elsley could see in his shirt sleeves cigar in mouth bent over his microscope but instead of the unexpected prim voice he heard a very gay and arch one answer is that a proper way in which to come peeping into an old bachelors sanctuary maam go away this moment till i make myself fit to be seen  valencia shut the door again laughing  you seem very intimate with major campbell said elsley  intimate i look on him as my father almost now may we come in said she knocking again in pretty petulance i want to introduce mr vavasour  i shall be only too happy said the major opening his door this time with his coat on there are few persons in the world whom i have more wished to know than mr vavasour and he held out his hand and quite led elsley in he spoke in a tone of grave interest looking intently at elsley as he spoke valencia remarked the interestelsley only the compliment  it is a great kindness of you to call on me so soon said he i met mrs vavasour several times in years past and though i saw very little of her i saw enough to long much for the acquaintance of the man who has been worthy to become her husband  elsley blushed for his conscience smote him a little at that word worthy and muttered some commonplace civility in return valencia saw it and attributing it to his usual awkwardness drew off the conversation to herself  really major campbell you bring in mr vavasour and let me walk behind as i can and then let me sit three whole minutes in your house without deigning to speak to me  ah my dear queen whims answered he returning suddenly to his gay tone and how have you been misbehaving yourself since we met last  i have not been misbehaving myself at all mon cher saint père as mr vavasour will answer for me during the most delightful fortnight i ever spent  delightful indeed said elsley as he was bound to say but he said it with an earnestness which made the major fix his eyes on him why should he not find any and every fortnight as delightful as his last said he to himself but now valencia began bantering him about his books and his animals wanting to look through his microscope pulling off her hat for the purpose laughing when her curls blinded her letting them blind her in order to toss them back in the prettiest way jesting at him about his old fogies at the linnaean society clapping her hands in ecstasy when he answered that they were not old fogies at all but the most charming set of men in england and that with no offence to the name of scoutbush he was prouder of being an fls than if he were a peer of the realmand so forth all which harmless pleasantry made elsley cross and more crossfirst because he did not mix in it next because he could not mix in it if he tried he liked to be always in the seventh heaven and if other people were anywhere else he thought them bores  at lastnow if you will be good for five minutes said the major i will show you something really beautiful  i can see that answered she with the most charming impudence in another glass besides your magnifying one  be it so but look here and see what an exquisite world there is of which you never dream and which behaves a great deal better in its station than the world of which you do dream  when campbell spoke in that way valencia was good at once and as she went obediently to the microscope she whispered dont be angry with me mon saint père  dont be naughty then ma chère enfant whispered he for he saw something about elsleys face which gave him a painful suspicion  she looked long and then lifted up her head suddenlydo come and look mr vavasour at this exquisite little glass fairy likei cannot tell what like but a pure spirit hovering in some nuns dream come  elsley came and looked and when he looked he started for it was the very same zoophyte which thurnall had shown him on a certain memorable day  where did you find the fairy mon saint père  i had no such good fortune mr thurnall the doctor gave it me  thurnall said she while elsley kept still looking to hide cheeks which were growing very red he is such a clever man they say where did you meet him i have often thought of asking mr vavasour to invite him up for an evening with his microscope he seems so superior to the people round him it would be a charity really mr vavasour  vavasour kept his eyes fixed on the zoophyte and said  i shall be only too delighted if you wish it  you will wish it yourself a second time chimed in campbell if you try it once perhaps you know nothing of him but professionally unfortunately for professional men that too often happens  know anything of himi i assure you not save that he attends mrs vavasour and the children said vavasour looking up at last but with an expression of anger which astonished both valencia and campbell  campbell thought that he was too proud to allow rank as a gentleman to a country doctor and despised him from that moment though as it happened unjustly but he answered quietly  i assure you that whatever some country practitioners may be the average of them as far as i have seen are cleverer men and even of higher tone than their neighbours and thurnall is beyond the average he is a man of the worldeven too much of oneand a man of science and i fairly confess that what with his wit his savoir vivre and his genial good temper i have quite fallen in love with him in a single evening we began last night on the microscope and ended on all heaven and earth  how i should like to make a third  my dear queen whims would hear a good deal of sober sense then at least on one side but i shall not ask her for mr thurnall and i have our deep secrets together  so spoke the major in the simple wish to exalt tom in a quarter where he hoped to get him practice and his secret was a mere jest unnecessary perhaps as he thought afterwards to pass off toms want of orthodoxy  i was a babbler then said he to himself the next moment how much better to have simply held my tongue  ah yes i know men have their secrets as well as women said valencia for the mere love of saying something but as she looked at vavasour she saw an expression in his face which she had never seen before what was itall that one can picture for oneself branded into the countenance of a man unable to repress the least emotion who had worked himself into the belief that thurnall had betrayed his secret  my dear mr vavasour cried campbell of course unable to guess the truth and supposing vaguely that he was ill i am sure thatthat the sun has overpowered you the only possible thing he could think of lie down on the sofa a minute vavasour was actually reeling with rage and terror and i will run up to thurnalls for salvolatile  elsley who thought him the most consummate of hypocrites cast on him a look which he intended to have been withering and rushed out of the room leaving the two staring at each other  valencia was half inclined to laugh knowing elsleys petulance and vanity but the impossibility of guessing a cause kept her quiet  major campbell stood for full five minutes not as one astounded but as one in deep and anxious thought  what can be the matter mon saint père asked she at last to break the silence  that there are more whims in the world than yours dear queen whims and i fear darker ones let us walk up together after this man i have offended him  nonsense i dare say he wanted to get home to write poetry as you did not praise what he had written i know his vanity and flightiness  you do asked he quickly in a painful tone however i have offended him i can see and deeply i must go up and make things right for the sake offor everybodys sake  then do not ask me anything lucia loves him intensely and let that be enough for us  the major saw the truth of the last sentence no more than valencia herself did for valencia would have been glad enough to pour out to him with every exaggeration her sisters woes and wrongs real and fancied had not the sense of her own folly with vavasour kept her silent and consciencestricken  valencia remarked the majors pained look as they walked up the street  you dear conscientious saint père why will you fret yourself about this foolish matter he will have forgotten it all in an hour i know him well enough  major campbell was not the sort of person to admire elsley the more for throwing away capriciously such deep passion as he had seen him show any more than for showing the same  he must be of a very volatile temperament  oh all geniuses are  i have no respect for genius miss st just i do not even acknowledge its existence when there is no strength and steadiness of character if any one pretends to be more than a man he must begin by proving himself a man at all genius give me common sense and common decency does he give mrs vavasour pray the benefit of any of these pretty flights of genius  valencia was frightened she had never heard her saint père speak so severely and sarcastically and she feared that if he knew the truth he would be terribly angry she had never seen him angry but she knew well enough that that passion when it rose in him in a righteous cause would be very awful to see and she was one of those women who always grow angry when they are frightened so she was angry at his calling her miss st just she was angry because she chose to think he was talking at her though she reasonably might have guessed it seeing that he had scolded her a hundred times for want of steadiness of character she was more angry than all because she knew that her own vanity had causedat least disagreementbetween lucia and elsley all which combined with her natural wish not to confess an unpleasant truth about her sister justified her of course in answering  miss st just does not intrude into the secrets of her sisters married life and if she did she would not repeat them  major campbell sighed and walked on a few moments in silence then  pardon miss st just i asked a rude question and i am sorry for it  pardon you my dear saint père cried she almost catching at his hand never i must either believe you infallible or hate you eternally it is i that was naughty i always am but you will forgive queen whims  who could help it said the major in a sad sweet tone but here is the postman may i open my letters  you may do as you like now you have forgiven me why what is it mon saint père  a sudden shock of horror had passed over the majors face as he read his letter but it had soon subsided into stately calm  a gallant officer whom we and all the world knew well is dead of cholera at his post where a man should die and my dear miss st just we are going to the crimea  weyou  yes the expedition will really sail i find  but not you  i shall offer my services my leave of absence will in any case end on the first of september and even if it did not my health is quite enough restored to enable me to walk up to a cannons mouth  ah mon saint père what words are these  the words of an old soldier queen whims who has been so long at his trade that he has got to take a strange pleasure in it  in killing  no only in the chance of but i will not cast an unnecessary shadow over your bright soul there will be shadows enough over it soon without my help  what do you mean  that you and thousands more as delicate if not as fair as you will see ere long what the realities of human life are and in a way of which you have never dreamed  and he murmured half to himself the words of the prophetthou saidst i shall sit as a lady for ever but these two things shall come upon thee in one day widowhood and the loss of children they shall even come upon theeno not in their fulness there are noble elements beneath the crust which will come out all the purer from the fire and we shall have heroes and heroines rising up among us as of old sincere and earnest ready to face their work and to do it and to call all things by their right names once more and queen whims herself will become what queen whims might be  valencia was awed as well she might have been for there was a very deep sadness about campbells voice  you think there will be defdisasters said she at last  how can i tell that we are what we always were i doubt not scoutbush will fight as merrily as i but we owe the penalty of many sins and we shall pay it  it would be as unfair perhaps as easy to make major campbell a prophet after the fact by attributing to him any distinct expectation of those mistakes which have been but too notorious since much of the sadness in his tone may have been due to his habitual melancholy his strong belief that the world was deeply diseased and that some terrible purgation would surely come when it was needed but it is difficult again to conceive that those errors were altogether unforeseen by many an officer of campbells experience and thoughtfulness  we will talk no more of it just now and they walked up to penalva court seriously enough  well scoutbush any letters from town said the major  yes  you have heard what has happened at d barracks  yes  you had better take care then that the like of it does not happen here  here  yes ill tell you all presently have you heard from headquarters  yes all right said scoutbush who did not like to let out the truth before valencia  campbell saw it and signed to him to speak out  a11 right asked valencia then you are not going  ay but i am orders to join my regiment by the first of october and to be shot as soon afterwards as is fitting for the honour of my country so miss val you must be quick in making good friends with the heiratlaw or else you wont get your bills paid any more  oh dear dear and valencia began to cry bitterly it was her first real sorrow  strangely enough major campbell instead of trying to comfort her took scoutbush out with him and left her alone with her tears he could not rest till he had opened the whole cholera question  scoutbush was honestly shocked who would have dreamed it no one had ever told him that the cholera had really been there before what could he do send for thurnall  tom was sent for and scoutbush found to his horror that what little he could have ever done ought to have been done three months ago with lord minchampsteads improvements at pentremochyn  the little man walked up and down and wrung his hands he cursed tardrew for not telling him the truth he cursed himself for letting the cottages go out of his power he cursed a b and c for taking the said cottages off his hands he cursed up he cursed down he cursed all around things which ought to have been cursed and things which really ought notfor half of the worst sanatory sinners in this blessed age of ignorance yclept of progress and science how our grandchildren will laugh at the epithets are utterly unconscious and guiltless ones  but cursing leaves him as it leaves other men very much where he had started  to do him justice he was in one thing a true nobleman for he was above all pride as are most men of rank who know what their own rank means it is only the upstart unaccustomed to his new eminence who stands on his dignity and asserts his power  so scoutbush begged humbly of thurnall only to tell him what he could do  you might use your moral influence my lord  moral influence in a tone which implied naively enough id better get a little morals myself before i talk of using the same  your position in the parish  my good sir quoth scoutbush in his shrewd way do you not know yourself what these fine fellows who were ready yesterday to kiss the dust off my feet would say if i asked leave to touch a single hair of their rightstell you what my lord we pays you your rent and you takes it you mind your business and well mind ourn you forget that times are changed since my seventeenth progenitor was lord of life and limb over man and maid in aberalva  and since your seventeenth progenitor took the trouble to live at penalva court said campbell instead of throwing away what little moral influence he had by going into the guards and spending his time between rotten row and cowes  hardly fair major campbell quoth tom you forget that in the old times if the lord of aberalva was responsible for his people he had also by law the power of making them obey him  the long and the short of it is then said scoutbush a little tartly that i can do nothing  you can put to rights the cottages which are still in your hands my lord for the rest my only remaining hope lies in the last person whom one would usually depute on such an errand  who is that  the schoolmistress  the who asked scoutbush  the schoolmistress at whose house major campbell lodges  and tom told them succinctly enough to justify his strange assertion  if you doubt me my lord i advise you to ask mr headley he is no friend of hers being a high churchman while she is a little inclined to be schismatic but an enemys opinion will be all the more honest  she must be a wonderful woman said scoutbush i should like to see her  and i too said campbell i passed a lovely girl on the stairs last night and thought no more of it lovely girls are common enough in west country ports  well go and see her quoth his lordship  meanwhile aberalva pier was astonished by a strange phenomenon a boat from the yacht landed at the pierhead not only claude mellot whose beard was an object of wonder to the fishermen but a tall threelegged box and a little black tent which being set upon the pier became the scene of various mysterious operations carried on by claude and a sailor lad  i say quoth one of the fishing elders after long suspicious silence i say lads this wont do we cant have no outlandish foreigners taking observations here  and then dropped out one wild suspicion after another  maybe hes surveying for a railroad  maybe hes from the trinity house going to make a new harbour or maybe a lighthouse and then wed better not meddle wi him  ill tell you what he be hes that here government chap as the doctor said hed bring down to set our drains right  if he goes meddling with our drains and knocking of our backyards about hell find himself over quay before hes done  steady steady he come with my loord mind  he might a taken in his loordship and be a roossian spy to the bottom of him after all they mak munselves up into all manner of disguisements specially beards ive seed the roossians with their beards many a time  maybe tis witchcraft look to mun putting muns head under that black bag now hem after no good ill warrant if they bent works of darkness what be  leastwise hem no right to go spying here on our quay and never ax with your leave or by your leave ill just goo mak mun out  and claude who had just retreated into his tent had the pleasure of finding the curtain suddenly withdrawn and as a flood of light rushed in spoiling his daguerreotype plate hearing a voice as of a sleepy bear  ax your pardon sir but what be you arter here  murder shut the screen but it was too late and claude came out while the eldestborn of anak stood sternly inquiring  i say what be you arter here mak so boold  taking sunpictures my good sir and you have spoilt one for me  sunpicturs saith a in a very incredulous tone  daguerreotypes of the place for lord scoutbush  ohif its his lordships wish of course only things is very well as they are and needs no mending thank god only ax pardon sir you see we dont generally allow no interfering on our pier without lave sir the pier being ourn we pays for the repairing so if his lordship intends making of alterations hed better to have spoken to us first  alterations said claude laughing the place is far too pretty to need any improvement  glad you think so sir but whatever be you arter here  taking views im a painter an artist ill take your portrait if you like said claude laughing more and more  bless my heart what vules we be tis a paainter gentleman lads roared he  what on earth did you take me for a russian spy  the elder shook his head grinned solemnly and peace was concluded wem oldfashioned folks here you see sir and dont like no newfangled meddlecomes youll excuse us youm very welcome to do what you like and glad to see you here and the old fellow made a stately bow and moved away  no no you must stay and have your portrait taken youll make a fine picture  hum might ha they used to say thirty years agone im over old now still my old woman might like it make so bold sir but whats your charge  i charge nothing five minutes talk with an honest man will pay me  hum if youd a let me pay you sir well and good but i maunt take up your time for nought thats not fair  however claude prevailed and in ten minutes he had all the sailors on the quay round him and one after another came forward blushing and grinning to be taken off soon the children gathered round and when valencia and major campbell came on the pier they found claude in the midst of a ring of little darkhaired angels while a dozen honest fellows grinned when their own visages appeared and chaffed each other about the sweethearts who were to keep them while they were out at sea and in the midst little claude laughed and joked and told good stories and gave himself up the simple the sunnyhearted fellow to the pleasure of pleasing till he earned from one and all the character of the pleasantestspokenest gentleman that was ever into the town  heres her ladyship make room for her ladyship but claude held up a warning hand he had just arranged a masterpiecehalfadozen of the prettiest children sitting beneath a broken boat on spars sails blocks lobsterpots and what not arranged in picturesque confusion while the blackbearded seakings round were promising them rock and bullseyes if they would only sit still like gude maids  but at valencias coming the children all looked round and jumped up and curtsied and then were afraid to sit down again  you have spoilt my group miss st just and you must mend it  valencia caught the humour regrouped them all forthwith and then placed herself in front of them by claudes side  now be good children look straight at me and listen and lifting up her finger she began to sing the first song of which she could think the landing of the pilgrim fathers  she had no need to bid the children look at her and listen for not only they but every face upon the pier was fixed upon her breathless spellbound at once by her magnificent beauty and her magnificent voice as up rose leaping into the clear summer air and rolling away over the still blue sea that glorious melody which has now become the national anthem to the nobler half of the new world honour to woman and honour to old england that from felicia hemans came the song which will last perhaps when modern europe shall have shared the fate of ancient rome and greece  valencias singing was the reflex of her own character and therefore perhaps all the more fitted to the song the place and the audience it was no modest cooing voice tender suggestive trembling with suppressed emotion such as even though narrow in compass and dull in quality will touch the deepest fibres of the heart and as delicate scents will sometimes do wake up longforgotten dreams which seem memories of some antenatal life  it was clear rich massive of extraordinary compass and yet full of all the graceful ease the audacious frolic of perfect physical health and strength and beauty had there been a trace of effort in it it might have been accused of bravura but there was no need of effort where nature had bestowed already an all but perfect organ and all that was left for science was to teach not power but control above all it was a voice which you trusted after the first three notes you felt that that perfect ear that perfect throat could never even by the thousandth part of a note fall short of melody and you gave your soul up to it and cast yourself upon it to bear you up and away like a fairy steed whither it would down into the abysses of sadness and up to the highest heaven of joy as did those wild and rough and yet tenderhearted and imaginative men that day while every face spoke new delight and hung upon those glorious notes    as one who drinks from a charmed cup   of sparkling and foaming and murmuring wine  and not one of them had he had the gift of words but might have said with the poet   i have no life constantia now but thee   while like the worldsurrounding air thy song flows on and fills all things with melody   now is thy voice tempest swift and strong on which like one in a trance upborne   secure oer rocks and waves i sweep rejoicing like a cloud of morn   now tis the breath of summer night which when the starry waters sleep   round western isles with incenseblossoms bright   lingering suspends my soul in its voluptuous flight  at last it ceased and all men drew their breaths once more while a low murmur of admiration ran through the crowd too wellbred to applaud openly as they longed to do  did you ever hear the like of that gentleman jan  or see i used to say no one could hold a candle to our grace but she she looked like a born queen all the time  well she belongs to us too so weve a right to be proud of her why heres our grace all the while  true enough grace had been standing among the crowd all the while rapt like them her eyes fixed on valencia and full too of tears they had been called up first by the melody itself and then by a chain of thought peculiar to grace by the faces round her  ah if grace had been here cried one wed have had her draed off in the midst of the children  ah that would ha been as natral as life  silence you says gentleman jan who generally feels a mission to teach the rest of the quay good manners tis the gentlemans pleasure to settle who hell dra off and not wern  to which abnormal possessive pronoun claude rejoined  not a bit whatever you like i could not have a better figure for the centre ill begin again  oh do come and sit among the children grace says valencia  no thank your ladyship  valencia began urging her and many a voice round old as well as young backed the entreaty  excuse me my lady and she slipped into the crowd but as she went she spoke low but clear enough to be heard by all no it will be time enough to flatter me and ask for my picture when you do what i tell youwhat god tells you  whats that then grace dear  you know ive asked you to save your own lives from cholera and you have not the common sense to do it let me go home and pray for you  there was an awkward silence among the men till some fellow said  shem gone mad after that doctor i think with his muckhunting notions  and grace went home to await the hour of afternoon school  what a face said mellot  is it not come and see her in her school when the children go in at two oclock ah there are scoutbush and st père  we are going to the school my lord dont you think that as patron of things in general here it would look well if you walked in and signified your full approbation of what you know nothing about  so much so that i was just on my way there with campbell but i must just speak to that limeburning fellow he wants a new lease of the kiln and i suppose he must have it at least here he comes running at me openmouthed and as dry as his own waistband it makes one thirsty to look at him ill catch you up in five minutes  so the three went off to the school                                       grace was telling in her own sweet way that charming story of the three trouts which by the by has been lately pirated as many things are by a religious author whose book differs sufficiently from the liberal and wholesome morality of the true author of the tale  what a beautiful story grace said valencia you will surpass hans anderssen some day  grace blushed and was silent a moment  it is not my own my lady  not your own i should have thought that no one but you and anderssen could have made such an ending to it  grace gave her one of those beseeching halfreproachful looks with which she always answered praise and thenwould you like to hear the children repeat a hymn my lady  no i want to know where that story came from  grace blushed and stammered  i know where said campbell you need not be ashamed of having read the book miss harvey i doubt not that you took all the good from it and none of the harm if harm there be  grace looked at him at once surprised and relieved  it was a foolish romancebook sir as you seem to know it was the only one which i ever read except hans anderssenswhich are not romances after all but the beginning was so full of gods truth sir romance though it wasand gave me such precious new light about educating children that i was led on unawares i hope i was not wrong  this schoolroom proves that you were not said campbell to the pure all things are pure  what is this mysterious book i must know said valencia  a very noble romance which i made mellot read once containing the ideal education of an english nobleman in the middle of the last century  the fool of quality said mellot of course i thought i had heard the story before what a wellwritten book it is too in spite of all extravagance and prolixity and how wonderfully ahead of his generation the man who wrote it in politics as well as in religion  i must read it said valencia you must lend it me saint père  not yet i think  why whispered she pouting i suppose i am not as pure as grace harvey  she has the children to educate who are in daily contact with coarse sins of which you know nothingof which she cannot help knowing it was written in an age when the morals of our class more shame to us were on the same level with the morals of her class now let it alone i often have fancied i should edit a corrected edition of it when i do you shall read that  now miss harvey said mellot who had never taken his eyes off her face i want to turn schoolmaster and give your children a drawing lesson get your slates all of you  and taking possession of the black board and a piece of chalk claude began sketching them imps and angels dogs and horses till the school rang with shrieks of delight  now said he wiping the board ill draw something and you shall copy it  and without taking off his hand he drew a single line and a profile head sprang up as if by magic under his firm unerring touch  somebody a lady no taint tis schoolmistress  you cant copy that ill draw you another face and he sketched a full face on the board  thats my lady no its schoolmistress again no its not  not quite sure my dears said claude half to himself then here and wiping the board once more he drew a threequarters face which elicited a shout of approbation  thats schoolmistress her very self  then you cannot do anything better than try and draw it ill show you how and going over the lines again one by one the crafty claude pretended to be giving a drawing lesson while he was really studying every feature of his model  if you please my lady whispered grace to valencia i wish the gentleman would not  why not  oh madam i do not judge any one else but why should this poor perishing flesh be put into a picture we wear it but for a little while and are blessed when we are rid of its burden why wish to keep a copy of what we long to be delivered from  it will please the children grace said valencia puzzled see how they are all trying to copy it from love of you  who am i i want them to do things from love of god no madam i was pained and no offence to you when i was asked to have my likeness taken on the quay theres no sin in it of course but let those who are going away to sea and have friends at home have their pictures taken not one who wishes to leave behind her no likeness of her own only christs likeness in these children and to paint him to other people not to be painted herself do ask him to rub it out my lady  why grace we were all just wishing to have a likeness of you every one has their picture taken for a remembrance  the saints and martyrs never had theirs as far as i ever heard and yet they are not forgotten yet i know it is the way of great people like you i saw your picture once in a book miss heale had and did not wonder when i saw it that people wished to remember such a face as yours and since i have seen you i wonder still less  my picture where  in a bookthe book of beauty i believe they called it  my dear grace said valencia laughing and blushing if you ever looked in your glass you must know that you are quite as worthy of a place in the book of beauty as i am  grace shook her head with a serious smile every one in their place madam i cannot help knowing that god has given me a gift but why i cannot tell certainly not for the same purpose as he gave it to you fora simple country girl like me if he have any use for it he will use it as he does all his creatures without my help at all events it will not last long a few years more perhaps a few months and it will be food for worms and then people will care as little about my looks as i care now i wish my lady you would stop the gentleman  mr mellot draw the children something simpler pleasea dog or a cat and she gave claude a look which he obeyed  valencia felt in a more solemn mood than usual as she walked home that day  well said claude i have here every line and shade and she cannot escape me ill go on board and paint her right off from memory while it is fresh why here come scoutbush and the major  miss harvey said scoutbush trying as he said to campbell to look as grand as a sheepdog among a pack of foxhounds and very thankful all the while he had no tail to be bitten offmiss harvey iwe have heard a great deal in praise of your school and so i thought i should like to come and see it  would your lordship like to examine the children says grace curtseying to the ground  nothanksthat isi have no doubt you teach them all thats right and we are exceedingly gratified with the way in which you conduct the schooli say val cried scoutbush who could support the part of patron no longer what pretty little ducks they are i wish i had a dozen of them come you here and down he sat on a bench and gathered a group round him  now are you all good children im sure you look so said he looking round into the bright pure faces fresh from leaven and feeling himself the nearer heaven as he did so ah i see mr mellots been drawing you pictures hes a clever man a wonderful man isnt he i cant draw you pictures nor tell you stories like your schoolmistress what shall i do  sing to them fred said valencia  and he began warbling a funny song with a child on each knee and his arms round three or four more while the little faces looked up into his half awestruck at the presence of a live lord half longing to laugh but not sure whether it would be right  valencia and campbell stood close together exchanging looks  dear fellow whispered she so simple and good when he is himself and he must go to that dreadful war  never mind perhaps by this very act he is earning permission to come back again a wiser and a more useful man  how then  is he not making friends with angels who always behold our fathers face at least he is showing capabilities of good which god gave and which therefore god will never waste  now shall i sing you another song  oh yes please rose from a dozen little mouths  you must not be troublesome to his lordship says grace  oh no i like it ill sing them one more song and theni want to speak to you miss harvey  grace curtsied blushed and shook all over what could lord scoutbush want to say to her  that indeed was not very easy to discover at first for scoutbush felt so strongly the oddity of taking a pretty young woman into his counsel on a question of sanitary reform that he felt mightily inclined to laugh and began beating about the bush in a sufficiently confused fashion  well miss harvey i am exceedingly pleased withwith what i have seen of the schoolthat is what my sister tells and the clergyman  the clergyman thought grace surprised as she well might be at what was entirely an impromptu invention of his lordships  andandthere is ten pounds toward the school andand i will give an annual subscription the same amount  mr headley receives the subscriptions my lord said grace drawing back from the proffered note  of course quoth scoutbush trusting again to an impromptu but this is for yourselfa small mark of our sense of youryour usefulness  if any one has expected that grace is about to conduct herself during this interview in any wise like a prophetess tragedy queen or other exalted personage to stand upon her native independence and scorning the bounty of an aristocrat to read the said aristocrat a lecture on his duties and responsibilities as landlord of aberalva town then will that person be altogether disappointed it would have looked very well doubtless but it would have been equally untrue to graces womanhood and to her notions of christianity whether all men were or were not equal in the sight of heaven was a notion which had never crossed her mind she knew that they would all be equal in heaven and that was enough for her meanwhile she found lords and ladies on earth and seeing no open sin in the fact of their being richer and more powerful than she was she supposed that god had put them where they were and she accepted them simply as facts of his kingdom of course they had their duties as every one has but what they were she did not know or care to know to their own master they stood or fell her business was with her own duties and with her own class whose good and evil she understood by practical experience so when a live lord made his appearance in her school she looked at him with vague wonder and admiration as a being out of some other planet for whom she had no gauge or measure she only believed that he had vast powers of doing good unknown to her and was delighted by seeing him condescend to play with her children the truth may be degrading but it must be told people of course who know the hollowness of the world and the vanity of human wealth and honour and are accustomed to live with lords and ladies see through all that just as clearly as any american republican does and care no more about walking down pallmall with the marquis of carabas who can get them a place or a living than with mr twoshoes who can only borrow ten pounds of them but grace was a poor simple westcountry girl and as such we must excuse her if curtseying to the very ground with tears of gratitude in her eyes she took the tenpound note saying to herself thank the good lord this will just pay mothers account at the mill  likewise we must excuse her if she trembled a little being a young womanthough being also a lady she lost no jot of selfpossession when his lordship went on in as important a tone as he could  andand i hear miss harvey that you have a great influence over these childrens parents  i am afraid some one has misinformed your lordship said grace in a low voice  ah quoth scoutbush in a tone meant to be reassuring it is quite proper in you to say so what eyes she has and what hair and what hands too this was of course spoken mentally but we know better and we want you to speak to them whenever you can about keeping their houses clean and all that in case the cholera should come and scoutbush stopped it was a quaint errand enough and besides as he told mellot frankly i could think of nothing but those wonderful eyes of hers and how like they were to la signoras  grace had been looking at the ground all the while now she threw upon him one of her sudden startled looks and answered slowly as her eyes dropped again  i have my lord but they will not listen to me  wont listen to you then to whom will they listen  to god when he speaks himself said she still looking on the ground scoutbush winced uneasily he was not accustomed to solemn words spoken so solemnly  do you hear this campbell miss harvey has been talking to these people already and they wont hear her  miss harvey i dare say is not astonished at that it is the usual fate of those who try to put a little common sense into their fellowmen  well and i shall at all events go off and give them my mind on the matter though i suppose with a glance at grace i cant expect to be heard where miss harvey has not been  oh my lord cried grace if you would but speak and there she stopped for was it her place to tell him his duty no doubt he had wiser people than her to counsel him  but the moment the party left the school grace dropped into her chair her head fell on the table and she burst into an agony of weeping which brought the whole school round her  oh my darlings my darlings cried she at last looking up and clasping them to her by twos and threes is there no way of saving you no way then we must make the more haste to be good and be all ready when jesus comes to take us and shaking off her passion with one strong effort she began teaching those children as she had never taught them before with a voice a look as of stephen himself when he saw the heavens opened  for that burst of weeping was the one single overflow of long pent passion disappointment and shame  she had tried indeed ever since toms conversation and franks sermon had poured in a flood of new light on the meaning of epidemics and bodily misery and death itself she had been working as only she could work exhorting explaining coaxing warning entreating with tears offering to perform with her own hands the most sickening offices to become if no one else would the common scavenger of the town there was no depth to which in her noble enthusiasm she would not have gone down and behold it had been utterly in vain ah the bitter disappointment of finding her influence fail her utterly the first time that it was required for a great practical work they would let her talk to them about their souls thenthey would even amend a few sins here and there of which they had been all along as well aware as she but to be convinced of a new sin to have their laziness pride covetousness touched that she found was what they would not bear and where she had expected if not thanks at least a fair hearing she had been met with peevishness ridicule even anger and insult  her mother had turned against her why would she go getting a bad name from every one and driving away customers the preachers who were as is too common in westcountry villages narrow ignorant and somewhat unscrupulous men turned against her they had considered the cholera if it was to come as so much spiritual capital for themselves an occasion which they could improve into a sensation perhaps a revival and to explain it upon mere physical causes was to rob them of their harvest coarse viragos went even farther still and dared to ask her whether it was the curate or the doctor she was setting her cap at for she never had anything in her mouth now but what they had said and those words went through her heart like a sword was she disinterested was not love for thurnall the wish to please him mingling with all her earnestness and again was not selflove mingling with it and mingling too with the disappointment even indignation which she felt at having failed ahwhat hitherto hidden spots of selfconceit vanity pharisaic pride that bitter trial laid bare or seemed to lay till she learned to thank her unseen guide even for it  perhaps she had more reason to be thankful for her humiliation than she could suspect with her narrow knowledge of the world perhaps that sudden downfall of her fancied queenship was needed to shut her out once and for all from that downward path of spiritual intoxication followed by spiritual knavery which as has been hinted was but too easy for her  but meanwhile the whole thing was but a fresh misery to bear the burden of cassandra day and night seeing in fancywhich yet was truththe black shadow of death hanging over that doomed place to dream of whom it might sweep offperhaps worst of all her mother unconfessed and impenitent  too dreadful and dreadful too the private troubles which were thickening fast and which seemed instead of drawing her mother to her side to estrange her more and more for some mysterious reason her mother was heavily in debt this ten pounds of lord scoutbushs would certainly clear off the millers bill her scanty quarters salary which was just due would clear off a little more but there was a longstanding account of the wholesale grocers for fiveandtwenty pounds for which mrs harvey had given a two months bill that bill would become due early in september and how to meet it neither mother nor daughter knew it lay like a black plaguespot on the future only surpassed in horror by the cholera itself  it might have been three or four days after that claude lounging after breakfast on deck was hailed from a dingy which contained captain willis and gentleman jan  might we take the liberty of coming aboard to speak with your honour  by all means and up the side they came their faces evidently big with some great purpose and each desirous that the other should begin  you speak captain says jan youm oldest and then he began himself if you please sir wem come on a sort of deputationwhy dont you tell the gentleman captain willis seemed either doubtful of the success of his deputation or not over desirous thereof for after trying to put john beer forward as spokesman he began  im sorry to trouble you sir but these young men will have it soand no shame to themon a matter which i think will come to nothing but the truth is they have heard that you are a great painter and they have taken it into their heads to ask you to paint a picture for them  not to ask you a favour sir mind interrupted jan wed scorn to be so forward well subscribe and pay for it in course any price in reason theres forty and more promised already  you must tell me first what the picture is to be about said claude puzzled and amused  why didnt you tell the gentleman captain  because i think it is no use and i told them all so from the first the truth is sir they want a picture of myof our schoolmistress to hang up in the school or somewhere  thats it draed out all natural in paints and her bonnet and her shawl and all just like life we was a going to ax you to do one of they garrytypes but she would haven noo price besides tant cheerful looking they sort with your leave too much blackamoor wise you see and over thick about the nozzes most times to my liking so well pay you and welcome all you ask  too much blackamoor wise indeed said claude amused and how much do you think i should ask  no answer  well settle that presently come down into the cabin with me  why sir we couldnt make so hold his lordship  oh his lordships on shore and i am skipper for the time and if not hed be delighted to see two good seamen here so come along  and down they went  bowie bring these gentlemen some sherry cried claude turning over his portfolio now then my worthy friends is that the sort of thing you want  and he spread on the table a watercolour sketch of grace  the two worthies gazed in silent delight and then looked at each other and then at claude and then at the picture  why sir said willis i couldnt have believed it youve got the very smile of her and the sadness of her too as if youd known her a hundred year  tis beautiful sighed jan half to himself poor fellow he had cherished perhaps hopes of winning grace after all  well will that suit you  why sir make so boldbut what we thought on was to have her drawn from head to foot and a child standing by her like holding to her hand for a token as she was schoolmistress and the pier behind maybe to signify as she was our maid and belonged to aberalva  a capital thought upon my word youre men of taste here in the west but what do you think i should charge for such a picture as that  name your price sir said jan who was in high good humour at claudes approbation  two hundred guineas  jan gave a long whistle  i told you so captain beer said willis or ever we got into the boat  now said claude laughing ive two prices ores two hundred and the other is just nothing and if you wont agree to the one you must take the other  but we wants to pay wed take it an honour to pay if we could afford it  then wait till next christmas  christmas  my good friend pictures are not painted in a day next christmas if i live ill send you what you shall not be ashamed of or she either and do you club your money and put it into a handsome gold frame  but sir said willis this will give you a sight of trouble and all for our fancy  i like it and i like you youre fine fellows who know a noble creature when god sends her to you and i should be ashamed to ask a farthing of your money there no more words  well you are a gentleman sir said gentleman jan  and so are you said claude now ill show you some more sketches  i should like to know sir asked willis how you got at that likeness she would not hear of the thing and thats why i had no liking to come troubling you about nothing  claude told them and jan laughed heartily while willis said  do you know sir thats a relief to my mind there is no sin in being drawn of course but i didnt like to think my maid had changed her mind when once shed made it up  so the deputation retired in high glee after willis had entreated claude and beer to keep the thing a secret from grace  it befell that claude knowing no reason why he should not tell frank headley told him the whole story as a proof of the chivalry of his parishioners in which he would take delight  frank smiled but said little his opinion of grace was altering fast a circumstance which occurred a few days after altered it still more  scoutbush had gone forth as he threatened and exploded in every direction with such effect as was to be supposed everybody promised his lordship to do everything but when his lordships back was turned everybody did just nothing they knew very well that he could not make them do anything and what was more in some of the very worst cases the evil was past remedy now and better left alone for the drought went on pitiless a copper sun a sea of glass a brown easterly blight day after day while thurnall looked grimly aloft and mystified the sailors with  fine weather for the flying dutchman this  coffins sail fastest in a calm  youd best all out to the quayhead and whistle for a wind it would be an ill one that would blow nobody good just now  but the wind came not nor the rain and the cholera crept nearer and nearer while the hearts of all in aberalva were hardened and out of very spite against the agitators they did less than they would have done otherwise even the inhabitants of the halfadozen cottages which scoutbush finding that they were in his own hands whitewashed by main force filled the town with lamentations over his lordships tyranny truetheir pigstyes were either under their front windows or within two feet of the wall but to pull down a poor mans pigstyethey might ever so well be rooshian slavesand all the town was on their side for pigs were the normal inhabitants of aberalva backyards  tardrews wrath of course knew no bounds and meeting thurnall standing at williss door with frank and mellot he fell upon him openmouthed  well sir ive a crow to pick with you  pick away quoth tom  what business have you meddling between his lordship and me  that is my concern quoth tom who evidently was not disinclined to quarrel i am not here to give an account to you of what i choose to do  ill tell you what sir ever since youve been in this parish youve been meddling you and mr headley tooill say it to your faces ill speak the truth to any man gentle or simple and that aint enough for you but you must come over that poor halfcrazed girl to set her plaguing honest people with telling em theyll all be dead in a month till nobody can eat their suppers in peace and that again aint enough for you but you must go to my lord with your  hold hard quoth tom dont start two hares at once lets hear that about miss harvey again  miss harvey why you should know better than i  lets hear what you know  why ever since that night trebooze caught you and her together  stop said tom thats a lie  everybody says so  then everybody lies thats all and you may say i said so and take care you dont say it again yourself but what ever since that night  why i suppose you come over the poor thing somehow as you seem minded to do over every one as you can but shes been running up and down the town ever since preaching to em about windilation and drains and smells and cholera and its being a judgment of the lord against dirt till shes frightened all the women so that manys the man as has had to forbid her his housebut you know that as well as i  i never heard a word of it before but now i have ill give you my opinion on it that she is a noble sensible girl and that you are all a set of fools who are not worthy of her and that the greatest fool of the whole is you mr tardrew and when the cholera comes it will serve you exactly right if you are the first man carried off by it now sir you have given me your mind and i have given you mine and i do not wish to hear anything more of you good morning  you hold your head mighty high to be sure since youve had the run of his lordships yacht  if you are impertinent sir you will repent it i shall take care to inform his lordship of this conversation  my dear thurnall said headley as tardrew withdrew muttering curses the old fellow is certainly right on one point  what then  that you have wonderfully changed your tone who was to eat any amount of dirt if he could but save his influence thereby  i have altered my plans i shant stay here long i shall just see this cholera over and then vanish  no  yes i cannot sit here quietly listening to the warnews it makes me mad to be up and doing i must eastwardho and see if trumps will not turn up for me at last why i know the whole country halfadozen of the languagesoh if i could get some secretservice work go i must at worst i can turn my hand to doctoring bashibazouks  my dear tom when will you settle down like other men cries claude  i would now if there was an opening at whitbury and low as life would be id face it for my fathers sake but here i cannot stay  both claude and headley saw that tom had reasons which he did not choose to reveal however claude was taken into his confidence that very afternoon  i shall make a fool of myself with that schoolmistress i have been near enough to it a dozen times already and this magnificent conduct of hers about the cholera has given the finishing stroke to my brains if i stay on here i shall marry her i know i shall and i wontid go tomorrow if it were not that im bound for my own credit to see the cholera safe into the town and out again  tom did not hint a word of the lost money or of the months delay which grace had asked of him the month was drawing fast to a close now however but no sign of the belt still tom had honour enough in him to be silent on the point even to claude  by the by have you heard from the wanderers this week  i heard from sabina this morning marie is very poorly i fear they have been at kissingen bathing and are going to bertrich somebody has recommended the baths there  bertrich wheres bertrich  the most delicious little nest of a place half way up the moselle among the volcano craters  dont know it have they found that yankee  no  why i thought sabina had a whole detective force of pets and protégés from boulogne to rome  well she has at least heard of him at baden and then again at stuttgard but he has escaped them as yet  and poor marie is breaking her heart all the while ill tell you what claude it will be well for him if he escapes me as well as them  what do you mean  i certainly shant go to the east without shaking hands once more with marie and sabina and if in so doing i pass that fellow its a pity if i dont have a snap shot at him  tom tom i had hoped your duelling days were over  they will be over when one can get the law to punish such puppies but not till then hang the fellow what business had he with her at all if he didnt intend to marry her  i tell you as i told you before it is she who will not marry him  and yet shes breaking her heart for him i can see it all plain enough claude she has found him out only too late i know him luxurious selfish blazé would give a thousand dollars tomorrow i believe like the old roman for a new pleasure and then amuses himself with her till he breaks her heart of course she wont many him because she knows that if he found out her quadroon bloodah thats it ill lay my life he has found it out already and that is why he has bolted  claude had no answer to give that talk at the exhibition made it only too probable  you think so yourself i see very well you know that whatever i have been to others that girl has nothing against me  nothing against you why she owes you honour life everything  never mind that only when i take a fancy to begin ill carry it through i took to that girl for poor wyses sake and ill behave by her to the last as he would wish and he who insults her insults me i wont go out of my way to find stangrave but if i do ill have it out  then you will certainly fight my dearest tom do look into your own heart and see whether you have not a grain or two of spite against him left i assure you you judge him too harshly  humthat must take its chance at least if we fight we fight fairly and equally he is a brave mani will do him that justiceand a cool one and used to be a sweet shot so he has just as good a chance of shooting me if i am in the wrong as i have of shooting him if he is  but your father  i know that is very disagreeable and all the more so because i am going to insure my lifea pretty premium they will make me payand if im killed in a duel it will be forfeited however the only answer to that is that either i shant fight or if i do i shant be killed you know i dont believe in being killed claude  tom tom the same as ever said claude sadly  well old man and what else would you have me nobody could ever alter me you know and why should i alter myself here i am after all alive and jolly and there is old daddy as comfortable as he ever can be on earth and so it will be to the end of the chapter there lets talk of something else     chapter xvi  come at last   now as if in all things tom thurnall and john briggs were fated to take opposite sides campbell lost ground with elsley as fast as he gained it with thurnall elsley had never forgiven himself for his passion that first morning he had shown campbell his weak side and feared and disliked him accordingly beside what might not thurnall have told campbell about him and what use might not the major make of his secret besides elsleys dread and suspicion increased rapidly when he discovered that campbell was one of those men who live on terms of peculiar intimacy with many women whether for his own good or not still for the good of the women concerned for only by honest purity and moral courage superior to that of the many is that dangerous post earned and women will listen to the man who will tell them the truth however sternly and will bow as before a guardian angel to the strong insight of him whom they have once learned to trust but it is a dangerous office after all for layman as well as for priest that of fatherconfessor the experience of centuries has shown that they must needs exist wherever fathers neglect their daughters husbands their wives wherever the average of the women cannot respect the average of the men but the experience of centuries should likewise have taught men that the said fatherconfessors are no objects of envy that their temptations to become spiritual coxcombs the worst species of all coxcombs if not intriguers bullies and worse are so extreme that the soul which is proof against them must be either very great or very small indeed whether campbell was altogether proof will be seen hereafter but one day elsley found out that such was campbells influence and did not love him the more for the discovery  they were walking round the garden after dinner scoutbush was licking his foolish lips over some commonplace tale of scandal  i tell you my dear fellow shes booked and mellot knows it as well as i he saw her that night at lady as  we saw the third act of the comitragedy the fourth is playing out now we shall see the fifth before the winter  non sine sanguine said the major  serve the wretched stick right at least said scoutbush what right had he to marry such a pretty woman  what right had they to marry her up to him said claude i dont blame poor january i suppose none of us gentlemen would have refused such a pretty toy if we could have afforded it as he could  whom do you blame then asked elsley  fathers and mothers who prate hypocritically about keeping their daughters minds pure and then abuse a girls ignorance in order to sell her to ruin let them keep her mind pure in heavens name but let them consider themselves all the more bound in honour to use on her behalf the experience in which she must not share  well drawled scoutbush i dont complain of her bolting shes a very sweet creature and always was but as longreach saysand a very witty fellow he is though you laugh at himif shed kept to us i shouldnt have minded but as guardsmen we must throw her over its an insult to the whole guards my dear fellow after refusing two of us to marry an attorney and after all to bolt with a plunger  what bolting with a plunger might signify elsley knew not but ere he could ask the major rejoined in an abstracted voice  god help us all and this is the girl i recollect two years ago singing there in cavendish square as innocent as a nestling thrush  poor child said mellot sold at firstperhaps sold again now the plunger has bills out and she has ready money i know her settlements  she shant do it said the major quietly ill write to her tonight  elsley looked at him keenly you think then sir that you can by simply writing stop this intrigue  the major did not answer he was deep in thought  i shouldnt wonder if he did said scoutbush two to one on his baulking the plunger  she is at lord s now at those silly private theatricals is he there  no said mellot he tried hard for an invitationstooped to work me and sabina i believe she told him that she would sooner see him in the morgue than help him and he is gone to the moors now i believe  there is time then i will write to her tonight and campbell took up his hat and went home to do it  ah said scoutbush taking his cigar meditatively from his mouth i wonder how he does it its a gift i always say a wonderful gift before he has been a week in a house hell have the confidence of every woman in itand gad he does it by saying the rudest thingsand the confidence of all the youngsters the week after  a somewhat dangerous gift said elsley drily  ah yes he might play tricks if he chose but theres the wonder that he dont id answer for him with my own sister i do every day of my lifefor i believe he knows how many pins she puts into her dressand yet there he is as i said once in the messroomthere was a youngster there who took on himself to be witty and talked about the still sow supping the milkthe snob you recollect him mellot the attorneys son from brompton who sold outwe shaved his mustachios put a bear in his bed and sent him home to his maand he said that major campbell might be very pious and all that but hed warrantthey were the fellows own wordsthat he took his lark on the sly like other men the snob so i told him i was no better than the rest and no more i am but if any man dared to say that the major was not as honest as his own sister i was his man at fifteen paces and so i am claude  all which did not increase elsleys love to the major conscious as he was that lucias confidence was a thing which he had not wholly and which it would be very dangerous to him for any other man to have at all  into the drawingroom they went frank headley had been asked up to tea and he stood at the piano listening to valencias singing  as they came in the maid came in also mr thurnall wished to speak to major campbell  campbell went out and returned in two minutes somewhat hurriedly  mr thurnall wishes lord scoutbush to be informed at once and i think it is better that you should all know itthatit is a painful surprisebut there is a man ill in the street whose symptoms he does not like he says  cholera said elsley  call him in said scoutbush  he had rather not come in he says  what is it infectious  certainly not if it be cholera but  he dont wish to frighten people quite right with a half glance at elsley but is it cholera honestly  i fear so  oh my children said poor mrs vavasour  will five pounds help the poor fellow said scoutbush  how far off is it asked elsley  unpleasantly near i was going to advise you to move at once  you hear what they are saying asked valencia of frank  yes i hear it said frank in a quiet meaning tone  valencia thought that he was half pleased with the news then she thought him afraid for he did not stir  you will go instantly of course  of course i shall goodbye do not be afraid it is not infectious  afraid and a soldiers sister said valencia with a toss of her beautiful head by way of giving force to her somewhat weak logic  frank left the room instantly and met thurnall in the passage  well headley its here before we sent for it as bad luck usually is  i know let me go where is it whose house asked frank in an excited tone  humph said thurnall looking intently at him that is just what i shall not tell you  not tell me  no you are too pale headley go back and get two or three glasses of wine and then we will talk of it  what do you mean i must go instantly it is my dutymy parishioner  look here headley are you and i to work together in this business or are we not  why not in heavens name  then i want you not for cure but for prevention you can do them no good when they have once got it you may prevent dozens from having it in the next fourandtwenty hours if you will be guided by me  but my business is with their souls thurnall  exactlyto give them the consolations of religion as they call it you will give them to the people who have not taken it you may bring them safe through it by simply keeping up their spirits while if you waste your time on poor dying wretches  thurnall you must not talk so i will do all you ask but my place is at the deathbed as well as elsewhere these perishing souls are in my care  and how do you know pray that they are perishing answered tom with something very like a sneer and if they were do you honestly believe that any talk of yours can change in five minutes a character which has been forming for years or prevent a mans going where he ought to go which i suppose is the place to which he deserves to go  i do said frank firmly  well it is a charitable and hopeful creed my great dread was lest you should kill the poor wretches before their time by adding to the fear of cholera the fear of hell i caught the methodist parson at that work an hour ago took him by the shoulders and shot him out into the street but my dear headley and tom lowered his voice to a whisper wherever poor tom beer deserved to go to he is gone to it already he has been dead this twenty minutes  tom beer dead one of the finest fellows in the town and i never sent for  dont speak so loud or they will hear you i had no time to send for you and if i had i should not have sent for he was past attending to you from the first he brought it with him i suppose from c had had warnings for a week and neglected them now listen to me that man was but two hours ill as sharp a case as i ever saw even in the west indies you must summon up all your good sense and play the man for a fortnight for its coming on the poor souls like hell said tom between his teeth and stamped his foot upon the ground frank had never seen him show so much feeling he fancied he could see tears glistening in his eyes  i will so help me god said frank  tom held out his hand and grasped franks  i know you will youre all right at heart only mind three things dont frighten them dont tire yourself dont go about on an empty stomach and then we can face the worst like men and now go in and say nothing to these people if they take a panic we shall have some of them down tonight as sure as fate go in keep quiet persuade them to bolt anywhere on earth by daylight tomorrow then go home eat a good supper and come across to me and if im out ill leave word where  frank went back again he found campbell who had had his cue from tom urging immediate removal as strongly as he could without declaring the extent of the danger valencia was for sending instantly for a fly to the nearest town and going to stay at a wateringplace some forty miles off elsley was willing enough at heart but hesitated he knew not at the moment poor fellow where to find the money his wife knew that she could borrow of valencia but she too was against the place the cholera would be in the air for miles round the journey in the hot sun would make the children sick and ill and wateringplace lodgings were such horrid holes never ventilated and full of smellspeople caught fevers at them so often valencia was inclined to treat this as mothers nonsense but major campbell said gravely that mrs vavasour was perfectly right as to fact and her arguments full of sound reason whereon valencia said that of course if lucia thought it major campbell would prove it and there was no arguing with such solons as he  which elsley heard and ground his teeth whereon little scoutbush cried joyfully  i have it why not go by sea take the yacht and go where of course i have it again pon my word im growing clever valencia in spite of all your prophecies go up the welsh coast nothing so healthy and airy as a seavoyage sea as smooth as a millpond too and likely to be and then land if you like at port madoc as i meant to do and there are my rooms at beddgelert lying empty engaged them a week ago thinking i should be there by now so you may as well keep them aired for me come valencia pack up your millinery lucia get the cradles ready and well have them all on board by twelve capital plan vavasour isnt if and by jove what stunning poetry you will write there under snowdon  but will you not want your rooms yourself lord scoutbush said elsley  my dear fellow never mind me i shall go across the country i think see an old friend and get some otterhunting dont think of me till youre there and then send the yacht back for me she must be doing something you know and the men are only getting drunk every day here comeno arguing about it or i shall turn you all out of doors into the lane eh  and the little fellow laughed so goodnaturedly that elsley could not help liking him and feeling that he would be both a fool and cruel to his family if he refused so good an offer he gave in to the scheme and went out to arrange matters while scoutbush went out into the hall with campbell and scrambled into his peajacket to go off to the yacht that moment  youll see to them theres a good fellow as they lighted their cigars at the door that vavasour is greener than grass you know tant pis for my poor sister  i am not going  not going  certainly not so my rooms will be at their service and you had much better escort them yourself it will be much less disagreeable for vavasour who knows nothing of commanding sailors or himself thought the major than finding himself master of your yacht in your absence and you will get your fishing as you intended  but why are you going to stay  oh i have not half done with the seabeasts here i found too new ones yesterday  quaint old beetlehunter you are for a man who has fought in halfadozen battles and scoutbush walked on silently for five minutes  suddenly he broke out  i cannot by george i cannot and whats more i wont  what  run away it will look soso cowardly and theres the truth of it before those fine fellows down there and just as i am come among them too the commanderinchief to turn tail at the first shot though i cant be of any use i know and i should have liked a fortnights fishing so said he in a dolorous voice before going to be eaten up with flies at varnafor this crimean expedition is all moonshine  dont be too sure of that said campbell we shall go and some of us who go will never come back freddy i know those russians better than many and i have been talking them over lately with thurnall who has been in their service  has he been at sevastopol  no almost the only place on earth where he has not been but from all he says and from all i know we are undervaluing our foes as usual and shall smart for it  well lick them never fear  yes but not at the first round scoutbush your life has been childs play as yet you are going now to see life in earnestthe sort of life which average people have been living in every age and country since adams fall a life of sorrow and danger tears and blood mistake confusion and perplexity and you will find it a very new sensation and at first a very ugly one all the more reason for doing what good deeds you can before you go for you may have no time left to do any on the other side of the sea  scoutbush was silent awhile  well im afraid of nothing i hope only i wish one could meet this cholera face to face as one will those russians with a good sword in ones hand and a good horse between ones knees and have a chance of giving him what he brings instead of being kicked off by the cowardly rockite no one knows how and not even from behind a turf dyke but out of the very clouds  so we all say in every battle scoutbush who ever sees the man who sent the bullet through him and yet we fight on do you not think the greatest terror the only real terror in any battle is the chance shot which come from no one knows where and hit no man can guess whom if you go to the crimea as you will you will feel what i felt at the cape and cabul and the punjab twenty timesthe fear of dying like a dog one knew not how  and yet ill fight campbell  of course you will and take your chance do so now  by jove campbelli always say ityoure the most sensible man i ever met and by jove the doctor comes the next my sister shall have the yacht and ill go up to penalva  you will do two good deeds at once then said the major you will do what is right and you will give heart to many a poor wretch here believe me scoutbush you will never repent of this  by jove it always does one good to hear you talk in that way campbell one feelsi dont knowso much of a man when one is with you not that i shant take uncommonly good care of myself old fellow that is but fair but as for running away as i said whywhywhy i cant and so i wont  by the by said the major there is one thing which i have forgotten and which they will never recollect is the yacht victualledwith fresh meat and green stuff i mean  wheww  i will go back borrow a lantern and forage in the garden like an old campaigner i have cut a salad with my sword before now  and made it in your helmet with macassar sauce and the two went their ways  meanwhile before they had left the room a notable conversation had been going on between valencia and headley  headley had reentered the room so much paler than he went out that everybody noticed his altered looks valencia chose to attribute them to fear  so are you returned from the sick man already mr headley asked she in a marked tone  i have been forbidden by the doctor to go near him at present miss st just said he quietly but in a sort of undervoice which hinted that he wished her to ask no more questions a shade passed over her forehead and she began chatting rather noisily to the rest of the party till elsley her brother and campbell went out  valencia looked up at him expecting him to go too mrs vavasour began bustling about the room collecting little valuables and looking over her shoulders at the now unwelcome guest but frank leaned back in a cosy armchair and did not stir his hands were clasped on his knees he seemed lost in thought very pale but there was a firm set look about his lips which attracted valencias attention once he looked up in valencias face and saw that she was looking at him a flush came over his cheeks for a moment and then he seemed as impassive as ever what could he want there how very gauche and rude of him so unlike him too and she said civilly enough to him i fear mr headley we must begin packing up now  i fear you must indeed answered he as if starting from a dream he spoke in a tone and with a look which made both the women start for what they meant it was impossible to doubt  i fear you must i have foreseen it a long time and so i fear and he rose from his seat must i unless i mean to be very rude you will at least take away with you the knowledge that you have given to one persons existence at least for a few weeks pleasure more intense than he thought earth could hold  i trust that pretty compliment was meant for me said lucia half playful half reproving  i am sure that it ought not to have been meant for me said valencia more downright than her sister both could see for whom it was meant by the look of passionate worship which frank fixed on a face which after all seemed made to be worshipped  i trust that neither of you answered he quietly think me impertinent enough to pretend to make love as it is called to miss st just i know who she is and who i am gentleman as i am and the descendant of gentlemen and frank looked a little proud as he spoke and very handsome i see clearly enough the great gulf fixed between us and i like it for it enables me to say truth which i otherwise dare not have spoken as a brother might say to a sister or a subject to a queen either analogy will do equally well and equally ill  frank without the least intending it had taken up the very strongest military position let a man once make a woman understand or fancy that he knows that he is nothing to her and confess boldly that there is a great gulf fixed between them which he has no mind to bridge over and then there is little that he may not see or do for good or for evil  and therefore it was that lucia answered gently i am sure you are not well mr headley the excitement of the night has been too much for you  do i look excited my dear madam he answered quietly i assure you that i am as calm as a man must be who believes that he has but a few days to live and trusts too that when he dies he will be infinitely happier than he ever has been on earth and lay down an office which he has never discharged otherwise than ill which has been to him a constant source of shame and sorrow  do not speak so said valencia with her irish impetuous generosity you are unjust to yourself we have watched you felt for you honoured you even when we differed from youwhat more she would have said i know not but at that moment elsleys peevish voice was heard calling over the stairs lucia lucia  oh dear he will wake the children cried lucia looking at her sister as much as to say how can i leave you  run run my dear creature said valencia with a selfconfident smile and the two were left alone  the moment that mrs vavasour left the room there vanished from franks face that intense look of admiration which had made even valencia uneasy he dropped his eyes and his voice faltered as he spoke again he acknowledged the change in their position and valencia saw that he did so and liked him the better for it  i shall not repeat miss st just now that we are alone what i said just now of the pleasure which i have had during the last month i am not poetical or given to string metaphors together and i could only go over the same dull words once more but i could ask if i were not asking too much leave to prolong at least a shadow of that pleasure to the last moment that i shall die shortly and of this cholera is with me a fixed idea which nothing can remove no madamit is useless to combat it but had i anything by which to the last moment i could bring back to my fancy what has been its sunlight for so long even if it were a scrap of the hem of your garment aye a grain of dust off your feet god forgive me he and his mercy ought to be enough to keep me up but ones weakness may be excused for clinging to such slight floating straws of comfort  valencia paused startled and yet affected how she had played with this deep pure heart and yet was it pure did he wish by exciting her pity to trick her into giving him what he might choose to consider a token of affection  and she answered coldly enough  i should be sorry after what you have just said to chance hurting you by refusing i put it to your own good feelinghave you not asked somewhat too much  certainly too much madam in any common case said he quite unmoved certainly too much if i asked you for it as i do not as the token of an affection which i know well you do not cannot feel buttake my words as they standwere you toit would be returned if i die in a few weeks and returned still sooner if i live and madam said he lowering his voice i vow to you before him who sees us both that as far as i am concerned no human being shall ever know of the fact  frank had at last touched the wrong chord  what mr headley can you think that i am to have secrets in common with you or with any other man no sir if i granted your request i should avow it as openly as i shall refuse it  and she turned sharply toward the door  frank headley was naturally a shy man but extreme need sometimes bestows on shyness a miraculous readinesselse why in the long run do the shy men win the best wives which is a fact and may be proved by statistics at least as well as anything else can so he quietly stepped to valencias side and said in a low voice  you cannot avow the refusal half as proudly as i shall avow the request if you will but wait till your sisters return both are unnecessary i think but it will only be an honour to me to confess that poor curate as i am  hush and valencia walked quietly up to the table and began turning over the leaves of a book to gain time for her softened heart and puzzled brain  in five minutes frank was beside her again the book was tennysons princess she had wanderedwho can tell whyto that last exquisite scene which all know and as valencia read frank quietly laid a finger on the book and arrested her eyes at last    if you be what i think you some sweet dream   stoop down and seem to kiss me ere i die  valencia shut the book up hurriedly and angrily a moment after she had made up her mind what to do and with the slightest gesture in the world motioned frank proudly and coldly to follow her back into the window had she been a country girl she would have avoided the ugly matter but she was a woman of the world enough to see that she must for her own sake and his talk it out reasonably  what do you mean mr headley i must ask you told me just now that you had no intention of making love to me  i told you the truth said he in his quiet impassive voice i fixed on these lines as a pis aller and they have done all and more than i wished by bringing you back here for at least a moment  and do you supposeyou speak like a rational man therefore i must treat you as onethat i can grant your request  why not it is an uncommon one if i have guessed your character aright you are able to do uncommon things had i thought you enslaved by etiquette and by the fear of a world which you can make bow at your feet if you will i should not have asked you butand here his voice took a tone of deepest earnestnessgrant itonly grant it and you shall never repent it never never never will i cast one shadow over a light which has been so glorious so lifegiving which i watched with delight and yet lose without regret go your way and god be with you i go mine grant me but a fortnights happiness and then let what will come  he had conquered the quiet earnestness of the voice the childlike simplicity of the manner of which every word conveyed the most delicate flatteryyet she could see without intending to flatter without an afterthoughtall these had won the impulsive irish nature for all the dukes and marquises in belgravia she would not have done it for they would have meant more than they said even when they spoke more clumsily but for the plain country curate she hesitated and asked herself what shall i give him  the rose from her bosom no that was too significant at once and too commonplace besides it might wither and he find an excuse for not restoring it it must be something valuable stately formal which he must needs return and she drew off a diamond hoop and put it quietly into his hand  you promise to return if  i promised long ago  he took it and lifted itshe thought that he was going to press it to his lips instead he put it to his forehead bowing forward and moved it slightly she saw that he made with it the sign of the cross  i thank you he said with a look of quiet gratitude i expected as much when you came to understand my request again thank you and he drew back humbly and left her there alone while her heart smote her bitterly for all the foolish encouragement which she had given to one so tender and humble and delicate and true  and so did frank headley get what he wanted by that plain earnest simplicity which has more power let worldlings pride themselves as they will on their knowledge of women than all the cunning wiles of the most experienced rake and only by aping which after all can the rake conquer it was a strange thing for valencia to do no doubt but the strange things which are done in the world which are some millions daily are just what keep the world alive     chapter xvii  baalzebubs banquet   the next day there were three cholera cases the day after there were thirteen  he had come at last baalzebub god of flies and of what flies are bred from to visit his selfblinded worshippers and bestow on them his own cross of the legion of dishonour he had come suddenly capriciously sportively as he sometimes comes as he had come to newcastle the summer before while yet the rest of england was untouched he had wandered all but harmless about the west country that summer as if his maw had been full glutted five years before when he sat for many a week upon the dartmoor hills amid the dull brown haze and sunburnt bents and driedup watercourses of white dusty granite looking far and wide over the plaguestruck land and listening to the deadbell booming all day long in tavistock churchyard but he was come at last with appetite more fierce than ever and had darted aside to seize on aberalva and not to let it go till he had sucked his fill  and all men moved about the streets slowly fearfully conscious of some awful unseen presence which might spring on them from round every corner some dreadful inevitable spell which lay upon them like a nightmare weight and walked to and fro warily looking anxiously into each others faces not to ask how are you but how am i do i look as if and glanced up ever and anon restlessly as if they expected to see like the greeks in their tainted camp by troy the pitiless sungod shooting his keen arrows down on beast and man  all night long the curdled cloud lay low upon the hills wrapping in its hot blanket the sweltering breathless town and rolled off sullenly when the sun rose high to let him pour down his glare and quicken into evil life all evil things for baalzebub is a sunny fiend and loves not storm and tempest thunder and lashing rains but the broad bright sun and broad blue sky under which he can take his pastime merrily and laugh at all the shame and agony below and as he did at his great banquet in new orleans once madden all hearts the more by the contrast between the pure heaven above and the foul hell below  and up and down the town the foul fiend sported now here now there snapping daintily at unexpected victims as if to make confusion worse confounded to belie thurnalls theories and prognostics and harden the hearts of fools by fresh excuses for believing that he had nothing to do with drains and water that he was onlysuch an onlythe visitation of god  he has taken old beers second son and now he clutches at the old man himself then across the street to gentleman jan his eldest but he is driven out from both houses by chloride of lime and peat dust and the colony of the beers has peace awhile  alas there are victims enough and to spare beside them too ready for the sacrifice and up the main street he goes unabashed springing in at one door and at another on either side of the street but fondest of the western side where the hill slopes steeply down to the housebacks  he fleshes his teeth on every kind of prey the drunken cobbler dies of course but spotless cleanliness and sobriety does not save the mother of seven children who has been soaking her brick floor daily with water from a poisoned well defiling where she meant to clean youth does not save the buxom lass who has been filling herself as girls will do with unripe fruit nor innocence the two fair children who were sailing their featherboats yesterday in the quaypools as they have sailed them for three years past and found no hurt piety does not save the bedridden old dame bedridden in the leanto garret who moans it is the lord and dies it is the lord to her though baalzebub himself be the angel of release  and yet all the while sots and fools escape where wise men fall weakly women living amid all wretchedness nurse unharmed strong men who have breathed fresh air all day of one word of scripture at least baalzebub is mindful for one is taken and another left  still there is a method in his seeming madness his eye falls on a blind alley running back from the main street backed at the upper end by a high wall of rock there is a godsend for hima devilssend rather to speak plain truth and in he dashes and never leaves that court let brave tom wrestle with him as he may till he has taken one from every house  that court belonged to treluddra the old fishjowder he must do something thurnall attacks him major campbell headley the neighbours join in the cry for there is no mistaking cause and effect there and no one bears a great love to him besides terrified and consciencestricken men are glad of a scapegoat and some of those who were his stoutest backers in the vestry are now in their terror the loudest against him ready to impute the whole cholera to him indeed old beer is ready to declare that it was treluddras fishheaps which poisoned him and his so all but mobbed the old sinner goes upto set the houses to rights no to curse the whole lot for a set of pigs and order them to clean the place out themselves or he will turn them into the street he is one of those base natures whom fact only lashes into greater furya pharaoh whose heart the lord himself can only harden such men there are and women too grown grey in lies to reap at last the fruit of lies but he carries back with him to his fishheaps a little invisible somewhat which he did not bring and ere nightfall he is dead hideously he his wife his sonand now the beers are down again and the whole neighbourhood of treluddras house is wild with disgusting agony  now the fiend is hovering round the fishcuring houses but turns back disgusted with the pure scent of the tanyard where not hides but nets are barked skips on board of a brig in the quaypool and a poor colliers prentice dies and goes to his own place what harm has he done is it his sin that illfed and wellbeaten daily he has been left to sleep on board just opposite the sewers mouth in a berth some four feet long by two feet high and broad  or is it that poor girls sin who was just now in heales shop talking to miss heale safe and sound that she is carried back into it in halfanhours time fainting shrieking one must draw a veil over the too hideous details  no not her fault but there at least the curse has not come without a cause for she is tardrews daughter  but whither have we got how long has the cholera been in aberalva five days five minutes or five years how many suns have risen and set since frank headley put into his bosom valencias pledge  it would be hard for him to tell and hard for many more for all the days have passed as in a fever dream to cowards the time has seemed endless and every moment ere their term shall come an age of terror of selfreproach of superstitious prayers and cries which are not repentance and to some cowards too the days have seemed but as a moment for they have been drunk day and night  strange and hideous yet true  it has now become a mere commonplace the strange power which great crises pestilences famines revolutions invasions have to call out in their highest power for evil and for good alike the passions and virtues of man how during their stay the most desperate recklessness the most ferocious crime side by side with the most heroic and unexpected virtue are followed generally by a collapse and a moral death alike of virtue and of vice we should explain this nowadays and not ill by saying that these crises put the human mind into a state of exaltation but the truest explanation after all lies in the old bible belief that in these times there goes abroad the unquenchable fire of god literally kindling up all mens hearts to the highest activity and showing by the light of their own strange deeds the inmost recesses of their spirits till those spirits burn down again selfconsumed while the chaff and stubble are left as ashes not valueless after all as manure for some future crop and the pure gold if gold there be alone remains behind  even so it was in aberalva during that fearful week the drunkards drank more the swearers swore more than ever the unjust shopkeeper clutched more greedily than ever at the last few scraps of mean gain which remained for him this side the grave the selfish wrapped themselves up more brutally than ever in selfishness the shameless woman mingled desperate debauchery with fits of frantic superstition and all base souls cried out together let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die  but many a brave man and many a weary woman possessed their souls in patience and worked on and found that as their day their strength should be and to them the days seemed short indeed for there was too much to be done in them for any note of time  headley and campbell grace and old willis and last but not least tom thurnallthese and three or four brave women organised themselves into a rightgallant and welldisciplined band and commenced at once a visitation from house to house saving thereby doubtless many a life but ere eightandforty hours were passed the house visitation languished it was as much as they could do to attend to the acute cases  and little scoutbush he could not nurse nor doctor but what he could he did he bought and fetched all that money could procure he galloped over to the justices and obtained such summary powers as he could and then like a true irishman exceeded them recklessly breaking into premises right and left in an utterly burglarious fashion he organised his fatigueparty as he called them of scavengers and paid the cowardly clods five shillings a day each to work at removing all removable nuisances he walked up and down the streets for hours giving the sailors cigars from his own case just to show them that he was not afraid and therefore they need not be and if it was somewhat his fault that the horse was stolen he at least did his best after the event to shut the stabledoor the five real workers toiled on meanwhile in perfect harmony and implicit obedience to the allknowing tom but with the most different inward feelings four of them seemed to forget death and danger but each remembered them in his own fashion  major campbell longed to die and courted death frank believed that he should die and was ready for death grace longed to die but knew that she should not die till she had found toms belt and was content to wait willis was of opinion that an old man must die some day and somehowas good one way as another and all his concern was to run about after his maid seeing that she did not tire herself and obeying all her orders with sailorlike precision and cleverness  and tom he just thought nothing about death and danger atall always smiling always cheerful always busy yet never in a hurry he went up and down seemingly ubiquitous sleep he got when he could and food as often as he could into the sea he leapt morning and night and came out fresher every time the only person in the town who seemed to grow healthier and actually happier as the work went on  you really must be careful of yourself said campbell at last you carry no charmed life  my dear sir i am the most cautious and selfish man in the town i am living by rule i have gotand what greater pleasurea good standup fight with an old enemy and be sure i shall keep myself in condition for it i have written off for help to the board of health and i shall not be shoved against the ropes till the government man comes down  and then  i shall go to bed and sleep for a month never mind me but mind yourself and mind that curate hes a noble brickif all parsons in england were like him idwhats here now  miss heale came shrieking down the street  oh mr thurnall miss tardrew miss tardrew  screaming will only make you ill too miss where is miss tardrew  in the surgeryand my mother  i expected this said tom the old man will go next  he went into the surgery the poor girl was in collapse already mrs heale was lying on the sofa stricken the old man hanging over her brandy bottle in hand  put away that trash cried tom youve had too much already  oh mr thurnall shes dying and i shall die too  you you were all right this morning  but i shall die i know i shall and go to hell  youll go where you ought and if you give way to this miserable cowardice youll go soon enough walk out sir make yourself of some use and forget your fear leave mrs heale to me  the wretched old man obeyed him utterly cowed and went out but not to be of use he had been hopelessly boozy from the firsthalf to fortify his body against infection half to fortify his heart against conscience tom had never reproached him for his share in the public folly indeed tom had never reproached a single soul poor wretches who had insulted him had sent for him with abject shrieks oh doctor doctor save me oh forgive me oh if id minded what you said oh dont think of what i said and tom had answered cheerfully tuttut never mind what might have been lets feel your pulse  but though tom did not reproach heale heale reproached himself he had just conscience enough left to feel the whole weight of his abused responsibility exaggerated and defiled by superstitious horror and maudlin tipsy he wandered about the street moaning that he had murdered his wife and all the town and asking pardon of every one he met till seeing one of the meetinghouses open he staggered in in the vain hope of comfort which he knew he did not deserve  in halfanhour tom was down the street again to headleys where is miss harvey  at the beers  she must go up to heales instantly the mother will die those cases of panic seldom recover and miss heale may very likely follow her she has shrieked and sobbed herself into it poor fool and grace must go to her at once she may bring her to common sense and courage and that is the only chance  grace went and literally talked and prayed miss heale into life again  you are an angel said tom to her that very evening when he found the girl past danger  mr thurnall said grace in a tone of sad and most meaning reproof  but you are and these owls are not worthy of you  this is no time for such language sir after all what am i doing more than you and grace went upstairs again with a cold hard countenance which belied utterly the heart within  that was the critical night of all the disease seemed to have done its worst in the likeliest spots but cases of panic increased all the afternoon and the gross number was greater than ever  tom did not delay inquiring into the cause and he discovered it headley coming out the next morning after two hours fitful sleep met him at the gate his usual businesslike trot was exchanged for a fierce and hurried stamp when he saw frank he stopped short and burst out into a story which was hardly intelligible so interlarded was it with oaths  for heavens sake thurnall calm yourself and do not swear so frightfully it is so unlike you what can have upset you thus  why should i not curse and swear in the street gasped he while every fellow who calls himself a preacher is allowed to do it in the pulpit with impunity fine him five shillings for every curse as you might if people had courage and common sense and then complain of me i am a fool i know though but i cannot stand it to have all my work undone by a brutal ignorant fanaticit is too much here if you will believe it are those preaching fellows getting up a revival or some such invention just to make money out of the cholera they have got down a great gun from the county town twice aday they are preaching at them telling them that it is all gods wrath against their sins that it is impious to interfere and that i am fighting against god and the end of the world is coming and they and the devil only know what if i meet one of them ill wring his neck and be hanged for it oh you parsons you parsons and tom ground his teeth with rage  is it possible how did you find this out  mrs heale had been in listening to their howling just before she was taken heale went in when i turned him out of doors came home raving mad and is all but blue now three cases of women have i had this morning all frightened into cholera by their own confession by last nights tomfoolerycame home howling fainted and were taken before morning one is dead the other two will die you must stop it or i shall have halfadozen more tonight go into the meeting and curse the cur to his face  i cannot cried frank with a gesture of despair i cannot  ah your cloth forbids you i suppose to enter the nonconformist opposition shop  you are unjust thurnall what are such rules at a moment like this id break them and the bishop would hold me guiltless but i cannot speak to these people i have no eloquenceno readinessthey do not trust mewould not believe megod help me and frank covered his face with his hands and burst into tears  not that for heavens sake said tom or we shall have you blue next my good fellow id go myself but theyd not hear me for certain i am no christian i suppose at least i cant talk their slangbut i know who can well send campbell  frank hailed the suggestion with rapture and away they went but they had an hours good search from sufferer to sufferer before they found the major  he heard them quietly a severe gloom settled over his face i will go said he  at six oclock that evening the meetinghouse was filling with terrified women and halfcurious halfsneering men and among them the tall figure of major campbell in his undress uniform which he had put on wisely to give a certain dignity to his mission stalked in and took his seat in the back benches  the sermon was what he expected there is no need to transcribe it such discourses may be heard often enough in churches as well as chapels the preachers object seemed to befor some purpose or other which we have no right to judgeto excite in his hearers the utmost intensity of selfish fear by language which certainly as tom had said came under the law against profane cursing and swearing he described the next world in language which seemed a strange jumble of virgils aeneid the koran the dreams of those rabbis who crucified our lord and of those mediaeval inquisitors who tried to convert sinners and on their own ground neither illogically nor overharshly by making this world for a few hours as like as possible to what so they held god was going to make the world to come for ever  at last he stopped suddenly when he saw that the animal excitement was at the very highest and called on all who felt convinced to come forward and confess their sins  in another minute there would have been as there have been ere now four or five young girls raving and tossing upon the floor in mad terror and excitement or possibly half the congregation might have rushed out as a congregation has rushed out ere now headed by the preacher himself and ran headlong down to the quaypool with shrieks and shouts declaring that they had cast the devil out of betsey pennington and were hunting him into the sea but campbell saw that the madness must be stopped at once and rising he thundered in a voice which brought all to their senses in a moment  stop i too have a sermon to preach to you i trust i am a christian man and that not of last years making or the year before follow me outside if you be rational beings and let me tell you the truthgods truth men he said with an emphasis on the word you at least will give me a fair hearing and you too modest married women leave that fellow with the shameless hussies who like to go into fits at his feet  the appeal was not in vain the soberer majority followed him out the insane minority soon followed in the mere hope of fresh excitement while the preacher was fain to come also to guard his flock from the wolf campbell sprang upon a large block of stone and taking off his cap opened his mouth and spake unto them                                       readers will doubtless desire to hear what major campbell said but they will be disappointed and perhaps it is better for them that they should be let each of them if they think it worth while write for themselves a discourse fitting for a christian man who loved and honoured his bible too much to find in a few scattered texts all misinterpreted and some mistranslated excuses for denying fact reason common justice the voice of god in his own moral sense and the whole remainder of the bible from beginning to end  whatsoever words he spoke they came home to those wild hearts with power and when he paused and looked intently into the faces of his auditory to see what effect he was producing a murmur of assent and admiration rose from the crowd which had now swelled to half the population of the town and no wonder no wonder that as the men were enchained by the matter so were the women by the manner the grand head like a grey granite peak against the clear blue sky the tall figure with all its martial stateliness and ease the gesture of his long arm so graceful and yet so selfrestrained the tones of his voice which poured from beneath that proud moustache now tender as a girls now ringing like a trumpet over roof and sea there were old men there old beyond the years of man who said they had never seen nor heard the like but it must be like what their fathers had told them of when john wesley on the cliffs of st ives outthundered the thunder of the gale to grace he seemed one of the old scotch covenanters of whom she had read risen from the dead to preach there from his rock beneath the great temple of gods air a wider and a juster creed than theirs frank drew thurnalls arm through his and whispered i shall thank you for this to my dying day but thurnall held down his head he seemed deeply moved at last half to himself  humph i believe that between this man and that girl you will make a christian even of me some day  but the lull was only for a moment for major campbell looking round discerned among the crowd the preacher whispering and scowling amid a knot of women and a sudden fit of righteous wrath came over him  stand out there sir you preacher and look me in the face if you can thundered he we are here on common ground as free men beneath gods heaven and gods eye stand out sir and answer me if you can or be for ever silent  half in unconscious obedience to the soldierlike word of command half in jealous rage the preacher stepped forward gasping for breath dont listen to him he is a messenger of satan sent to damn youa lying prophet let the lord judge between me and him stop your earsa messenger of satana jesuit in disguise  you lie and you know that you lie answered campbell twirling slowly his long moustache as he always did when choking down indignation but you have called on the lord to judge so do i listen to me sir dare you in the presence of god answer for the words which you have spoken this day  a strange smile came over the preachers face  i read my title clear sir to mansions in the skies well for you if you could do the same  was it only the setting sun or was it some inner light from the depths of that great spirit which shone out in all his countenance and filled his eyes with awful inspiration as he spoke in a voice calm and sweet sad and regretful and yet terrible from the slow distinctness of every vowel and consonant  mansions in the skies you need not wait till then sir for the presence of god now here you and i are before gods judgmentseat now here i call on you to answer to him for the innocent lives which you have endangered and destroyed for the innocent souls to whom you have slandered their heavenly father by your devils doctrines this day you have said it let the lord judge between you and me he knows best how to make his judgment manifest  he bowed his head awhile as if overcome by the awful words which he had uttered almost in spite of himself and then stepped slowly down from the stone and passed through the crowd which reverently made way for him while many voices cried thank you sir thank you and old captain willis stepping forward held out his hand to him a quiet pride in his grey eye  you will not refuse an old fighting mans thanks sir this has been like elijahs day with baals priests on carmel  campbell shook his hand in silence but turned suddenly for another and a coarser voice caught his ear it was jones the lieutenants  and now my lads take the methodist parson neck and heels and heave him into the quay pool to think over his summons  campbell went back instantly no my dear sir let me entreat you for my sake what has passed has been too terrible to me already if it has done any good do not let us break it by spoiling the law  i believe youre right sir but my blood is up and no wonder why where is the preacher  he had stood quite still for several minutes after campbells adjuration he had often perhaps himself hurled forth such words in the excitement of preaching but never before had he heard them pronounced in spirit and in truth and as he stood thurnall who had his doctors eye on him saw him turn paler and more pale suddenly he clenched his teeth and stooped slightly forwards for a moment drawing his breath thurnall walked quickly and steadily up to him  gentleman jan and two other riotous fellows had already laid hold of him more with the intention of frightening than of really ducking him  dont dont cried he looking round with eyes wildbut not with terror  hands off my good lads said tom quietly this is my business now not yours i can tell you  and passing the preachers arm through his own with a serious face tom led him off into the house at the back of the chapel  in two hours more he was blue in four he was a corpse the judgment as usual had needed no miracle to enforce it  tom went to campbell that night and apprised him of the fact those words of yours went through him sir like a minié bullet i was afraid of what would happen when i heard them  so was i the moment after they were spoken but sir i felt a power upon meyou may think it a fancythat there was no resisting  i dare impute no fancies when i hear such truth and reason as you spoke upon that stone sir  then you do not blame me asked campbell with a subdued almost deprecatory voice such as thurnall had never heard in him before  the man deserved to die and he died sir it is well that there are some means left on earth of punishing offenders whom the law cannot touch  it is an awful responsibility  not more awful than killing a man in battle which we both have done sir and yet have felt no sting of conscience  an awful responsibility still yet what else is life made up of from morn to night but of deeds which may earn heaven or hell well as he did to others so was it done to him god forgive him at least our cause will be soon tried and judged there is little fear of my not meeting him againsoon enough and campbell with a sad smile lay back in his chair and was silent  my dear sir said tom allow me to remind you after this excitement comes a collapse and that is not to be trifled with just now medicine i dare not give you food i must  campbell shook his head  you must go now my dear fellow it is now halfpast ten and i will be at penningtons at one oclock to see how he goes on so you need not go there and meanwhile i must take a little medicine  major you are not going to doctor yourself cried tom  there is a certain medicine called prayer mr thurnallan old specific for the heartache as you will find one daywhich i have been neglecting much of late and which i must return to in earnest before midnight goodbye god bless and keep you and the major retired to his bedroom and did not stir off his knees for two full hours after which he went to penningtons and thence somewhere else and tom met him at four oclock that morning musing amid unspeakable horrors quiet genial almost cheerful  you are a man said tom to himself and i fancy at times something more than a man more than me at least  tom was right in his fear that after excitement would come collapse but wrong as to the person to whom it would come when he arrived at the surgery door headley stood waiting for him  anything fresh have you seen the heales  i have been praying with them dont be frightened i am not likely to forget the lesson of this afternoon  then go to bed it is full twelve oclock  not yet i fear i want you to see old willis all is not right  ah i thought the poor dear old man would kill himself he has been working too hard and presuming on his sailors power of tumbling in and taking a dogs nap whenever he chose  i have warned him again and again but he was working so magnificently that one had hardly heart to stop him and beside nothing would part him from his maid  i dont wonder at that quoth tom to himself is she with him  no he found himself ill slipped home on some pretence and will not hear of our telling her  noble old fellow caring for every one but himself to the last and they went in  it was one of those rare cases fatal yet merciful withal in which the poison seems to seize the very centre of the life and to preclude the chance of lingering torture by one deadening blow  the old man lay paralysed cold pulseless but quite collected and cheerful tom looked inquired shook his head and called for a hot bath of salt and water  warmth we must have somehow anything to keep the fire alight  why so sir asked the old man the fires been flickering down this many a year why not let it go out quietly at threescore years and ten youre sure my maid dont know  they put him into his bath and he revived a little  no i am not going to get well so dont you waste your time on me sirs im taken while doing my duty as i hoped to be and ive lived to see my maid do hers as i knew she would when the lord called on her i havebut dont tell her shes well employed and has sorrows enough already some that youll know of some day  you must not talk quoth tom who guessed his meaning and wished to avoid the subject  yes but i must sir ive no time to lose if youd but go and see after those poor heales and come again id like to have one word with mr headley and my time runs short  a hundred if you will said frank  and now sir when they were alone only one thing if youll excuse an old sailor and willis tried vainly to make his usual salutation but the cramped hand refused to obeyand a dying one too  what is it  only dont be hard on the people sir the people here theyre goodhearted souls with all their sins if youll only take them as you find them and consider that theyve had no chance  willis willis dont talk of that i shall be a wiser man henceforth i trust at least i shall not trouble aberalva long  oh sir dont talk so and you just getting a hold of them  i  yes you sir theyve found you out at last thank god i always knew what you were and said it theyve found you out in the last week and theres not a man in the town but what would die for you i believe  this announcement staggered frank some men it would have only hardened in their pedantry and have emboldened them to say ah then these men see that a high churchman can work like any one else when there is a practical sacrifice to be made now i have a standing ground which no one can dispute from which to go on and enforce my idea of what he ought to be  but rightly or wrongly no such thought crossed franks mind he was just as good a churchman as everwhy not just as fond of his own ideal of what a parish and a church service ought to bewhy not but the only thought which did rise in his mind was one of utter selfabasement  oh how blind i have been how i have wasted my time in laying down the law to these people fancying myself infallible as if god were not as near to them as he is to mecertainly nearer than to any book on my shelvesoffending their little prejudices little superstitions in my own cruel selfconceit and selfwill and now the first time that i forget my own rules the first time that i forget almost that i am a priest even a christian at all that moment they acknowledge me as a priest as a christian the moment i meet them upon the commonest human ground helping them as one heathen would help another simply because he was his own flesh and blood that moment they soften to me and show me how much i might have done with them twelve months ago had i had but common sense  he knelt down and prayed by the old man for him and for himself  would it be troubling you sir said the old man at last but id like to take the sacrament before i go  of course whom shall i ask in  the old man paused awhile i fear its selfish but it seems to me i would not ask it but that i know im going i should like to take it with my maid once more before i die  ill go for her said frank the moment thurnall comes back to watch you  what need to go yourself sir old sarah will go and willing  thurnall came in at that moment  i am going to fetch miss harvey where is she captain  at janey headons along with her two poor children  stay said tom thats a bad quarter just at the fishhouse back have some brandy before you start  no no dutch courage and frank was gone he had a word to say to grace harvey and it must be said at once  he turned down the silent street and turned up over stone stairs through quaint stone galleries and balconies such as are often huddled together on the cliff sides in fishing towns into a stifling cottage the door of which had been set wide open in the vain hope of fresh air a woman met him and clasped both his hands with tears of joy  theyre mending sir theyre mending else id have sent to tell you i never looked for you so late  there was a gentle voice in the next room it was graces  ah shes praying by them now shem giving them all their medicines all along whatever i should have done without herand in and out all day long too till one fancies at whiles the lord must have changed her into five or six at once to be everywhere to the same minute  frank went in and listened to her prayer her face was as pale and calm as the pale calm faces of the two wornout babes whose heads lay on the pillow close to hers but her eyes were lit up with an intense glory which seemed to fill the room with love and light  frank listened but would not break the spell  at last she rose looked round and blushed  i beg your pardon sir for taking the liberty if i had known that you were about i would have sent but hearing that you were gone home i thought you would not be offended if i gave thanks for them myself they are my own sir as it were  oh miss harvey do not talk so while you can pray as you were praying then he who would silence you might be silencing unawares the lord himself  she made no answer though the change in franks tone moved her and when he told her his errand that thought also passed from her mind  at last happy happy man she said calmly and putting on her bonnet followed frank out of the house  miss harvey said frank as they hurried up the street i must say one word to you before we take that sacrament together  sir  it is well to confess all sins before the eucharist and i will confess mine i have been unjust to you i know that you hate to be praised so i will not tell you what has altered my opinion but heaven forbid that i should ever do so base a thing as to take the school away from one who is far more fit to rule in it than ever i shall be  grace burst into tears  thank god and i thank you sir oh theres never a storm but what some gleam breaks through it and now sir i would not have told you it before lest you should fancy that i changed for the sake of gain though perhaps that is pride as too much else has been but you will never hear of me inside either of those chapels again  what has altered your opinion of them then  it would take long to tell sir but what happened this morning filled the cup i begin to think sir that their god and mine are not the same though why should i judge them who worshipped that other god myself till no such long time since and never knew poor fool that the lords name was love  i have found out that too in these last days more shame to me than to you that i did not know it before  well for us both that we do know it now sir for if we believed him now sir to be aught but perfect love how could we look round here tonight and not go mad  amen said frank  and how had the pestilence of all things on earth revealed to those two noble souls that god is love  let the reader if he have supplied campbells sermon answer the question for himself  they went in and upstairs to willis  grace bent over the old man tenderly but with no sign of sorrow dryeyed she kissed the old mans forehead arranged his bedclothes womanlike before she knelt down and then the three received the sacrament together  dont turn me out whispered tom its no concern of mine of course but you are all good creatures and somehow i should like to be with you  so tom stayed and what thoughts passed through his heart are no concern of ours  frank put the cup to the old mans lips the lips closed sippedthen opened  the jaw had fallen  gone said grace quietly  frank paused awestruck  go on sir said she in a low voice he hears it all more clearly than he ever did before and by the dead mans side frank finished the communion service  grace rose when it was over kissed the calm forehead and went out without a word  tom said frank in a whisper come into the next room with me  tom hardly heard the tone in which the words were spoken or he would perhaps have answered otherwise than he did  my father takes the communion said he half to himself at least it is a beautiful old  howsoever the sentence would have been finished tom stopped short  heywhat does that mean  at last gasped frank gently enough excuse me he was bowed almost double crushing thurnalls arm in the fierce gripe of pain pish hang itimpossiblethere you are all right now  for the time i can understand many things now curious sensation it is though can you conceive a sword put in on one side of the waist just above the hipbone and drawn through handle and all till it passes out at the opposite point  i have felt it twice and therefore you will be pleased to hold your tongue and go to bed have you had any warnings  yesnothat isthis morning but i forgot never mindwhat matter a hundred years hence i there it is againgod help me  humph growled thurnall to himself id sooner have lost a dozen of these herringhogs whom nobody misses and who are well out of their lifescrape but the parson just as he was making a man  there is no use in complaints in half an hour frank is screaming like a woman though he has bitten his tongue half through to stop his screams     chapter xviii  the black hound   pah let us escape anywhere for a breath of fresh air for even the scent of a clean turf we have been watching saints and martyrsperhaps not long enough for the good of our souls but surely too long for the comfort of our bodies let us away up the valley where we shall find it not indeed a fresh healthful breeze for the drought lasts on at least a cool refreshing downdraught from carcarrow moor before the sun gets up it is just halfpast four oclock on a glorious august morning we shall have three hours at least before the heavens become one great dutchoven again  we shall have good company too in our walk for here comes campbell fresh from his mornings swim swinging up the silent street toward frank headleys lodging  he stops and tosses a pebble against the windowpane in a minute or two thurnall opens the streetdoor and slips out to him  ah major overslept myself at last that sofa is wonderfully comfortable no time to go down and bathe ill get my header somewhere up the stream  how is he  he sleeping like a babe and getting well as fast as his soul will allow his body he has something on his mind nothing to be ashamed of though i will warrant for a purer nobler fellow i never met  when can we move him  oh tomorrow if he will agree you may all depart and leave me and the government man to make out the returns of killed and wounded we shall have no more cholera eight days without a new case we shall do now im glad you are coming up with us  i will just see the hounds throw off and then go back and get headleys breakfast  no no you mustnt sir you want a days play  not half as much as you and i am in no hunting mood just now do you take your fill of the woods and the streams and let me see our patient i suppose you will be back by noon  certainly and the two swing up the street and out of the town along the vale toward trebooze  for trebooze of trebooze has invited them and lord scoutbush and certain others to come out otterhunting and otterhunting they will go  trebooze has been sorely exercised during the last fortnight between fear of the cholera and desire of calling upon lord scoutbushas i ought to do of course as one of the gentry round hes a whig of course and no more to me than anybody else but one dont like to let politics interfere by which trebooze glosses over to himself and friends the deep hunkeydom with which he lusteth after a live lords acquaintance and one especially in whom he hopes to find even such a one as himself good fellow i hear he is toogood sportsman smokes like a chimney and so forth  so at last when the cholera has all but disappeared he comes down to penalva and introduces himself half swaggering half servile begins by a string of apologies for not having called beforemrs trebooze so afraid of infection you see my lordwhich is a lie then blunders out a few fulsome compliments to scoutbushs courage in staying then takes heart at a little joke of scoutbushs and tries the free and easy style fingers his lordships highpriced hudsons and gives a broad hint that he would like to smoke one on the spot which hint is not taken any more than the bet of a pony which he offers five minutes afterwards that he will jump his irish mare in and out of aberalva pound is utterly thrown on his haunches as he informs his friend mr creed afterwards by scoutbushs praise of tom thurnall as an invaluable man a treasure in such an outoftheway place and really better company than ninetynine men out of a hundred recovers himself again when scoutbush asks after his otterhounds of which he has heard much praise from tardrew and launches out once more into sporting conversation of that graceful and lofty stamp which may be perused and perpended in the pages of handley cross and mr sponges sporting tour books painfully true to that uglier and baser side of sporting life which their clever author has chosen so wilfully to portray  so at least said scoutbush to himself when his visitor had departed  hes just like a page out of sponges tour though hes not half as good a fellow as sponge himself for sponge knew he was a snob and lived up to his calling honestly but this fellow wants all the while to play at being a gentleman andugh how the fellow smelt of brandy and worse his hand too shook as if he had the palsy and he chattered and fidgetted like a man with st vituss dance  did he my lord quoth tom thurnall when he heard the same in a very meaning tone  and trebooze for his part couldnt make out that lorduncommonly agreeable and easy and all that but shoves a fellow off and sets him down somehow and in such a  civil way that you dont know where to have him  however trebooze departed in high spirits for lord scoutbush has deigned to say that he will be delighted to see the otterhounds work any morning that trebooze likes and anyhowno time too early for him he will bring his friend major campbell  by all means  expect two or three sporting gentlemen from the neighbourhood too regular good ones my lordthough they are county bucksvery much honoured to make your lordships acquaintance  scoutbush expresses himself equally honoured by making their acquaintance in a tone of bland simplicity which utterly puzzles trebooze who goes a step further  your lordshipll honour us by taking pot luck afterwards cant show you french cookery you know and your souffleys and glacys and all that honest saddle o mutton and the grounds of old portmy father laid it down and i take it up eh and trebooze gave a wink and a nudge of his elbow meaning to be witty  his lordship was exceedingly sorry it was the most unfortunate accident but he had the most particular engagement that very afternoon and must return early from the otterhunt and probably sail the next day for wales but says the little man who knows all about treboozes household i shall not fail to do myself the honour of calling on mrs trebooze and expressing my regret etc  so to the otterhunt is scoutbush gone and campbell and thurnall after him for trebooze has said to himself must ask that blackguard of a doctorhang him i wish he were an otter himself but if hes so thick with his lordship it wont do to quarrel for indeed thurnall might tell tales so trebooze swallows his spite and shameas do many folk who call themselves his betters when they have to deal with a great mans hangeronand sends down a note to tom  mr trebooze requests the pleasure of mr thurnalls company with his hounds at  and tom acceptswhy not and chats with campbell as they go on many things and among other things on this  by the by said he i got an hours shorework yesterday afternoon and refreshing enough it was and i got a prize too the sucking barnacle which you asked for i was certain i should get one or two if i could have a look at the pools this week jolly little dog he was paddling and spinning about last night and enjoying himself ere age with creepingwhat is ithath clawed him in his clutch that fellows destiny is not a hopeful analogy for you sir who believe that we shall rise after we die into some higher and freer state  why not  why which is better off the free swimming larva or the perfect cirrhipod rooted for ever motionless to the rock  which is better off the roving young fellow who is sowing his wild oats or the man who has settled down and become a respectable landowner with a good house over his head  and begun to propagate his species well you have me there sir as far as this life is concerned but you will confess that the barnacles history proves that all crawling grubs dont turn into butterflies  i daresay the barnacle turns into what is best for him at all events what he deserves that rule of yours will apply to him to whomsoever it will not  and so does penance for the sins of his youth as some of us are to do in the next world  perhaps yes perhaps no perhaps neither  do you speak of us or the barnacle  of both  i am glad of that for on the popular notion of our being punished a million years hence for what we did when we were lads i never could see anything but a misery and injustice in our having come into the world at all  i can said the major quietly  of course i meant nothing rude but i had to buy my experience and paid for it dearly enough in folly  so had i to buy mine  then why be punished over and above why have to pay for the folly which was itself only the necessary price of experience  for being perhaps so foolish as not to use the experience after it has cost you so dear  and will punishment cure me of the foolishness  that depends on yourself if it does it must needs be so much the better for you but perhaps you will not be punished but forgiven  let off that would be a very bad thing for me unless i become a very different man from what i have been as yet i am always right glad now to get a fall whenever i make a stumble i should have gone to sleep in my tracks long ago else as one to do in the back woods on a long elk hunt  perhaps you may become a very different man  i should be sorry for that even if it were possible  why do you consider yourself perfect  no but somehow thomas thurnall is an old friend of mine the first i ever had and i should be sorry to lose his company  i dont think you need fear doing so you have seen an insect go through strange metamorphoses and yet remain the same individual why should not you and i do so likewise  well  wellthere are some points about you i suppose which you would not be sorry to have altered  a few quoth tom laughing i do not consider myself quite perfect yet  what if those points were not really any part of your character but mere excrescences of disease or if that be too degrading a notion mere scars of old wounds and of the wear and tear of life and what if in some future life all those disappeared and the true mr thomas thurnall pure and simple were alone left  it is a very hopeful notion only my dear sir one is quite selfconceited enough in this imperfect state what intolerable coxcombs we should all be if we were perfect and could sit admiring ourselves for ever and ever  but what if that selfconceit and selfdependence were the very root of all the disease the cause of all the scars the very thing which will have to be got rid of before our true character and true manhood can be developed  yes i understand faith and humility you will forgive me major campbell i shall learn to respect those virtues when good people have defined them a little more exactly and can show me somewhat more clearly in what faith differs from superstition and humility from hypocrisy  i do not think any man will ever define them for you but you may go through a course of experiences more severe probably than pleasant which may enable you at last to define them for yourself  have you defined them asked tom bluntly glancing round at his companion  faithyes i trust humilityno i fear  i should like to hear your definition of the former at least  did i not say that you must discover it for yourself  yes well when the lesson comes if it does come i suppose it will come in some learnable shape and till then i must shift for myself and if selfdependence he a punishable sin i shall at all events have plenty of company whithersoever i go there is lord scoutbush and trebooze  why did not campbell speak his mind more clearly to thurnall  because he knew that with such men words are of little avail the disease was entrenched too strongly in the very centre of the mans being it seemed at moments as if all his strange adventures and hairbreadth escapes had been sent to do him harm and not good to pamper and harden his selfconfidence not to crush it therefore campbell seldom argued with him but he prayed for him often for he had begun as all did who saw much of tom thurnall to admire and respect him in spite of all his faults  and now turning through a woodland path they descend toward the river till they can hear voices below them scoutbush laughing quietly trebooze laying down the law at the top of his voice  how noisy the fellow is and how he is hopping about says campbell  no wonder he has been soaking i hear for the last fortnight with some worthy compeers by way of keeping off cholera i must have my eye on him today  scrambling down through the brushwood they found themselves in such a scene as creswick alone knows how to paint though one element of beauty which creswick uses full well was wanting and the whole place was seen not by slant sunrays gleaming through the boughs and dappling all the pebbles with a lacework of leaf shadows but in the uniform and sober grey of dawn  a broad bed of shingle looking just now more like an illmade turnpike road than the bed of alva stream above it a long shallow pool which showed every stone through the transparent water on the right a craggy bank bedded with deep wood sedge and orangetipped king ferns clustering beneath sallow and maple bushes already tinged with gold on the left a long bar of gravel covered with giant butterbur leaves in and out of which the hounds are brushingbeautiful blackandtan dogs of which poor trebooze may be pardonably proud while round the burleafbed dances a rough white irish terrier seeming by his frantic selfimportance to consider himself the master of the hounds  scoutbush is standing with trebooze beyond the bar upon a little lawn set thick with alders trebooze is fussing and fidgetting about wiping his forehead perpetually telling everybody to get out of the way and not to interfere then catching hold of scoutbushs button to chatter in his face then starting aside to put some part of his dress to rights his usual lazy drawl is exchanged for foolish excitement two or three more gentlemen tired of treboozes absurdities are scrambling over the rocks above in search of spraints old tardrew waddles stooping along the line where grass and shingle meet his bulldog visage bent to his very knees  tardrew out hunting says campbell why it is but a week since his daughter was buried  and why not i like him better for it would he bring her back again by throwing away a good days sport better turn out as he has done and forget his feelings if he has any  he has feelings enough dont doubt but you are right there is something very characteristic in the way in which the english countryman never shows grief never lets it interfere with business even with pleasure  hillo mr trebooze says the old fellow looking up here it is  spraintspraintspraintwhere ehwhat cries trebooze  no but whats as good here on this alder stump not an hour old i thought they beauties starns werent flemishing for nowt  here here here here musical musical sweetlips get out of the wayand trebooze runs down  musical examines throws her nose into the air and answers by the rich belllike note of the true otter hound and all the woodlands ring as the pack dashes down the shingle to her call  over shouts tom heres the fresh spraint our side  through the water splash squire viscount steward and hounds to the horror of a shoal of par the only visible tenants of a pool which after a shower of rain would be alive with trout where those trout are in the meanwhile is a mystery yet unsolved  over dances the little terrier yapping furiously and expending his superfluous energy by snapping right and left at the par  hark to musical hark to sweetlips down the streamno the old girl has it right up the bank  how do doctor how do major campbell forwardforwardforward shouts trebooze glad to escape a longer parley as with his spear in his left hand he clutches at the overhanging boughs with his right and swings himself up with peter the huntsman after him tom follows him and why  because he does not like his looks that bulleye is red and almost bursting his cheeks are flushed his lips blue his hand shakes and toms quick eye has already remarked from a distance over and above his new fussiness a sudden shudder a quick halffrightened glance behind him and perceived too that the moment musical gave tongue he put the spiritflask to his mouth  away go the hounds at score through tangled cover their merry peal ringing from brake and brier clashing against the rocks moaning musically away through distant glens aloft  scoutbush and tardrew take down the riverbed followed by campbell it is in his way home and though the major has stuck many a pig shot many a gaur rhinoceros and elephant he disdains not like a true sportsman the less dangerous but more scientific excitement of an otterhunt  hark to the merry merry christchurch bells shes up by this time that dont sound like a drag now cries tom bursting desperately with elbowguarded visage through the tangled scrub  whats the matter trebooze no thanks modest quenchers wont improve the wind just now  for trebooze has halted panting and bathed in perspiration has been at the brandy flask again and now offers tom a quencher as he calls it  as you like says trebooze sulkily having meant it as a token of reconciliation and pushes on  they are now upon a little open meadow girdled by green walls of wood and along the riverbank the hounds are fairly racing tom and peter hold on trebooze slackens  your master dont look right this morning peter  peter lifts his hand to his mouth to signify the habit of drinking and then shakes it in a melancholy fashion to signify that the said habit has reached a lamentable and desperate point  tom looks back trebooze has pulled up and is walking wiping still at his face the hounds have overrun the scent and are back again flemishing about the plashed fence on the river brink  over over over shouts peter tumbling over the fence into the stream and staggering across  trebooze comes up to it tries to scramble over mutters something and sits down astride of a bough  you are not well squire  well as ever i was in my life only a little sickhave been several times lately couldnt sleep eitherhavent slept an hour this week dont know what it is  what ducks of hounds those are says tom trying for ulterior purposes to ingratiate himself how they are working there all by themselves like so many human beings perfect  yesdont want usmay as well sit here a minute awfully hot eh what a splendid creature that miss st just is i say peter  yes sir shouts peter from the other side  those hounds aint right with an oath  not right sir  didnt i tell youfive couple and a halfno five coupleno six hang it i cant see i think how many hounds did i tell you to bring out  five couple sir  then  why did you bring out that other  which other shouts peter while thurnall eyes trebooze keenly  why that hes none o mine nasty black cur how did he get here  where theres never no cur here  you lie you oafnowhydoctorhow many hounds are there here  i cant see says tom among those bushes  cant see eh why dont those brutes hit it off says trebooze drawling as if he had forgotten the matter and lounging over the fence drops into the stream followed by tom and wades across  the hounds are all round him and he is couraging them on fussing again more than ever but without success  gone to hole somewhere here says peter   cries trebooze looking round with a sudden shudder and face of terror theres that black brute again there behind me hang it hell bite me next and he caught up his leg and struck behind him with his spear  there was no dog there  peter was about to speak but tom silenced him by a look and shouted  here we are gone to holt in this alder root  now then little carlingford out of the way puppies cries trebooze righted again for the moment by the excitement and thrusting the hounds right and left he stoops down to put in the little terrier  suddenly he springs up with something like a scream and then bursts out on peter with a volley of oaths  didnt i tell you to drive that cur away  which cur sir cries peter trembling and utterly confounded  that cur cant i believe my own eyes will you tell me that the beggar didnt bolt between my legs this moment and went into the hole before the terrier  neither answered peter with utter astonishment tom because he saw what was the matter  dont stoop squire youll make the blood fly to your head let me  but trebooze thrust him back with curses  ill have the brute out and send the spear through him and flinging himself on his knees again trebooze began tearing madly at the roots and stones shouting to the halfburied terrier to tear the intruder  peter looked at tom and then wrung his hands in despair  dirty workbeastly work muttered trebooze nothing but slugs and evatstoads toohang the toads what a plague brings all this vermin curse it shrieked he springing back theres an adder and hes gone up my sleeve help me doctor thurnall or im a dead man  tom caught the arm thrust his hand up the sleeve and seemed to snatch out the snake and hurl it back into the river  all right nowa near chance though  peter stood open mouthed  i never saw no snake cried he  tom caught him a buffet which sent him reeling look after your hounds you blind ass how are you now trebooze and he caught the squire round the waist for he was reeling  the world the world upside down rocking and swinging whos put me feet upwards like a fly on a ceiling im falling falling off into the cloudsinto hellfirehold metoads and adders and waspsto go to holt in a wasps nest drive em awayget me a green bough i shall be stung to death  and tearing off a green bough the wretched man rushed into the river beating wildly right and left at his fancied tormentors  what is it cry campbell and scoutbush who have run up breathless  delirium tremens campbell get home as fast as you can and send me up a bottle of morphine peter take the hounds home i must go after him  ill go home with campbell and send the bottle up by a man and horse cries scoutbush and away the two trot at a gallant pace for a crosscountry run home  mr tardrew come with me theres a good mani shall want help  tardrew made no reply but dashed through the river at his heels  trebooze had already climbed the plashed fence and was running wildly across the meadow tom dragged tardrew up it after him  thank ee sir but nothing more the two had not met since the cholera  trebooze fell and lay rolling trying in vain to shield his face from the phantom wasps  they lifted him up and spoke gently to him  better get home to mrs trebooze sir said tardrew with as much tenderness as his gruff voice could convey  yes home home to molly my mollys always kind she wont let me be eaten up alive molly molly  and shrieking for his wife the wretched man started to run again  molly im in hell only help me youre always right only forgive me and ill never never again  and then came out hideous confessions then fresh hideous delusions                                       three weary uphill miles lay between them and the house but home they got at last  trebooze dashed at the housedoor tore it open slammed and bolted it behind him to shut out the pursuing fiends  quick round by the backdoor said tom who had not opposed him for fear of making him furious but dreaded some tragedy if he were left alone  but his fear was needless trebooze looked into the breakfastroom it was empty she was not out of bed yet he rushed upstairs into her bedroom shrieking her name she leaped up to meet him and the poor wretch buried his head in that faithful bosom screaming to her to save him from he knew not what  she put her arms round him soothed him wept over him sacred tears my william my own william yes i will take care of you nothing shall hurt youmy own own  vain drunken brutal unfaithful yes but her husband still  there was a knock at the door  who is that she cried with her usual fierceness terrified for his character not terrified for herself  mr thurnall madam have you any laudanum in the house  yes here oh come in thank god you are come what is to be done  tom looked for the laudanum bottle and poured out a heavy dose  make him take that madam and put him to bed i will wait downstairs awhile  thurnall thurnall calls trebooze dont leave me old fellow you are a good fellow i say forgive and forget dont leave me only dont leave me for the room is as full of devils as                                       an hour after tom and tardrew were walking home together  he is quite quiet now and fast asleep  will he mend sir asks tardrew  of course he will and perhaps in more ways than one best thing that could have happenedwill bring him to his senses and hell start fresh  well hope sohes been mad i think ever since he heard of that cholera  so have others but not with brandy thought tom but he said nothing  i say sir quoth tardrew after a while hows parson headley  getting well im happy to say  glad to hear it sir hes a good man after all though we did have our differences but hes a good man and worked like one  he did  silence again  never heard such beautiful prayers in all my life as he made over my poor maid  i dont doubt it said tom he understands his business at heart though he may have his fancies  and so do some others said tardrew in a gruff tone as if half to himself who have no fancies tell you what it is sir you was right this time and thats plain truth im sorry to hear talk of your going  my good sir quoth tom i shall be very sorry to go i have found place and people here as pleasant as man could wish but go i must  glad youre satisfied sir wish you was going to stay says tardrew seen miss harvey this last day or two sir  yes you know shes to keep her school  i know it nursed my girl like an angel  like what she is said tom  you said one true word once that she was too good for us  for this world said tom and fell into a great musing  by those curt and surly utterances did tardrew in true british bulldog fashion express a repentance too deep for words too deep for all confessionals penances and emotions or acts of contrition the repentance not of the excitable and theatric southern unstable as water even in his most violent remorse but of the still deephearted northern whose pride breaks slowly and silently but breaks once for all who tells to god what he will never tell to man and having told it is a new creature from that day forth for ever     chapter xix  beddgelert   the pleasant summer voyage is over the waterwitch is lounging off port madoc waiting for her crew the said crow are busy on shore drinking the ladies healths with a couple of sovereigns which valencia has given them in her sisters name and her own the ladies under the care of elsley and the far more practical care of mr bowie are rattling along among children maids and boxes over the sandy flats of the traeth mawr beside the long reaches of the lazy stream with the blue surges of the hills in front and the silver sea behind soon they begin to pass wooded knolls islets of rock in the alluvial plain the higher peaks of snowdon sink down behind the lower spurs in front the plain narrows closes in walled round with woodlands clinging to the steep hillsides and at last they enter the narrow gorge of pontaberglaslynpretty enough no doubt but much overpraised for there are in devon alone a dozen passes far grander both for form and size  soon they emerge again on flat meadows mountaincradled and the grave of the mythic greyhound and the fair old church shrouded in tall trees and last but not least at the famous leek hotel where ruleth mrs lewis great and wise over the four months babylon of guides cars chambermaids tourists artists and readingparties campstools telescopes poetrybooks blue uglies red petticoats and parasols of every hue  there they settle down in the best rooms in the house and all goes as merrily as it can while the horrors which they have left behind them hang like a black background to all their thoughts however both scoutbush and campbell send as cheerful reports as they honestly can and gradually the exceeding beauty of the scenery and the amusing bustle of the village make them forget perhaps a good deal which they ought to have remembered  as for poor lucia no one will complain of her for being happy for feeling that she has got a holiday the first for now four years and trying to enjoy it to the utmost she has no household cares mr bowie manages everything and does so in order to keep up the honour of the family on a somewhat magnificent scale the children in that bracing air are better than she has ever seen them she has valencia all to herself and elsley in spite of the dark fancies over which he has been brooding is better behaved on the whole than usual  he has escapedso he considersescaped from campbell above all from thurnall from himself indeed he has not escaped but the company of self is on the whole more pleasant to him than otherwise just now for though he may turn up his nose at tourists and readingparties and long for contemplative solitude yet there is a certain pleasure to some people and often strongest in those who pretend most shyness in the digito monstrari et diceri hic est in taking for granted that everybody has read his poems that everybody is saying in their hearts there goes mr vavasour the distinguished poet i wonder what he is writing now i wonder where he has been today and what he has been thinking of  so elsley went up hebog and looked over the glorious vista of the vale over the twin lakes and the rich sheets of woodland with aran and moel meirch guarding them right and left and the greystone glaciers of the glyder walling up the valley miles above and they went up snowdon too and saw little beside fifty fogblinded tourists fiveandtwenty dripping ponies and five hundred empty porterbottles wherefrom they returned as do many disgusted and with great colds in their heads but most they loved to scramble up the crags of dinas emrys and muse over the ruins of the old tower where merlin taught vortigern the courses of the stars till the stars set and rose as they had done for merlin and his pupil behind the four great peaks of aran siabod cnicht and hebog which point to the four quarters of the heavens or to lie by the side of the boggy spring which once was the magic well of the magic castle till they saw in fancy the white dragon and the red rise from its depths once more and fight high in air the battle which foretold the fall of the cymry before the sassenach invader  one thing indeed troubled elsleythat claude was his only companion for valencia avoided carefully any more têteàtête walks with him she had found out her mistake and devoted herself now to lucia she had a fair excuse enough for lucia was not just then in a state for rambles and scrambles and of that elsley certainly had no right to complain so that he was forced to leave them both at home with as good grace as he could muster and to wander by himself scribbling his fancies while they lounged and worked in the pleasant garden of the hotel with bowie fetching and carrying for them all day long and intimating pretty roundly to miss clara his opeeenion that he was very proud and thankful of the office but he did think that he had to do a great many things for mrs vavasour every day which would come with a much better grace from mr vavasour himself and that when he married he should not leave his wife to be nursed by other men which last words were spoken with an ulterior object well understood by the hearer for between clara and bowie there was one of those patient and honourable attachments so common between worthy servants they had both kept company though only by letter for the most part for now five years they had both saved a fair sum of money and clara might have married bowie when she chose had she not thought it her duty to take care of her mistress while bowie considered himself equally indispensable to the welfare of that puir feckless laddie his master  so they waited patiently amusing the time by little squabbles of jealousy real or pretended and bowie was faithful though clara was past thirty now and losing her good looks  so yell see your lassie mr bowie said sergeant macarthur his intimate when he started for aberalva that summer im thinking yed better put her out of her pain soon five years is ower lang courting and shes na pullet by now saving your pardon  hoooo says bowie leave the green gooseberries to the lads and gi me the ripe fruit sergeant  however he found lovemaking in his own fashion so pleasant that not content with carrying mrs vavasours babies about all day long he had several times to be gently turned out of the nursery where he wanted to assist in washing and dressing them on the ground that an old soldier could turn his hand to anything  so slipped away a fortnight and more during which valencia was the cynosure of all eyes and knew it also for claude mellot half to amuse her and half to tease elsley made her laugh many a time by retailing little sayings and doings in her praise and dispraise picked up from rich manchester gentlemen who would fain have married her without a penny and from strongminded manchester ladies who envied her beauty a little and set her down of course as an emptyminded worldling and a proud aristocrat the majority of the readingparties meanwhile thought a great deal more about valencia than about their books the oxford men it seemed though of the same mind as the cambridge men in considering her the model of all perfection were divided as to their method of testifying the same two or three of them who were given to that simpering and flirting tone with young ladies to which oxford wouldbefine gentlemen are so pitiably prone hung about the inndoor to ogle her contrived always to be walking in the garden when she was there dressed out as if for high street at four oclock on a may afternoon tormented claude by fruitless attempts to get from him an introduction which he had neither the right nor the mind to give and at last so bowie told claude one night and claude told the whole party next morning tried to bribe and flatter valencias maid into giving them a bit of ribbon or a castoff glove which had belonged to the idol whereon that maiden in virtuous indignation told mr bowie and complained moreover as maids are bound to do to valets for whom they have a penchant of their having dared to compliment her on her own good looks by which act she succeeded of course in making mr bowie understand that other people still thought her pretty if he did not and also in arousing in him that jealousy which is often the best helpmate of sweet love so mr bowie went forth in his might that very evening and finding two of the oxford men informed them in plain scotch that gin he caught them or any ither such skellums philandering after his leddies or his leddies maids hed jist knock their empty pows togither to which there was no reply but silence for mr bowie stood six feet four without his shoes and had but the week before performed for the edification of the cambridge men who held him in high honour a few old guards feats such as cutting in two at one swordblow a suspended shoulder of mutton lifting a long table by his teeth squeezing a quart pewter pot flat between his fingers and other little recreations of those who are born unto rapha  but the cantabs and a couple of gallant oxford boating men who had fraternised with them testified their admiration in their simple honest way by putting down their pipes whenever they saw valencia coming and just lifting their hats when they met her close it was taking a liberty no doubt but i tell you mellot said wynd as brave and pureminded a fellow as ever pulled in the university eight the arabs when they see such a creature say praise allah for beautiful women and quite right they may remind some fellows of worse things but they always remind me of heaven and the angels and my hat goes off to her by instinct just as it does when i go into a church  that was all simple chivalrous admiration and delight in her loveliness as in that of a lake or a mountain sunset but nothing more the good fellows had no time indeed to fancy themselves in love with her or her with them for every day was too short for them what with reading all the morning and starting out in the afternoon in strange garments which became shabbier and more ragged very rapidly as the weeks slipped on upon all manner of desperate errands walking unheardofdistances and losing their way upon the mountains scrambling cliffs and now and then falling down them camping all night by unpronounceable lakes in the hope of catching mythical trout trying in all ways how hungry thirsty dirty and tired a man could make himself and how far he could go without breaking his neck any approach to which catastrophe was hailed as were all other mishaps as all in the days work and the finest fun in the world by that unconquerable english lebensglückseligkeit which is a perpetual wonder to our sober german cousins ah glorious twentyone with your inexhaustible powers of doing and enjoying eating and hungering sleeping and sitting up reading and playing happy are those who still possess you and can take their fill of your golden cup steadied but not saddened by the remembrance that for all things a good and loving god will bring them into judgment happier still those who like a few retain in body and soul the health and buoyancy of twentyone on to the very verge of forty and seeming to grow youngerhearted as they grow olderheaded can cast off care and work at a moments warning laugh and frolic now as they did twenty years ago and say with wordsworth    so was it when i was a boy   so let it be when i am old   or let me die  unfortunately as will appear hereafter elsleys especial bêtes noirs were this very wynd and his inseparable companion naylor who happened to be not only the best men of the set but mellots especial friends both were rugby men now reading for their degree wynd was a shropshire squires son a lissom fairhaired man the handiest of boxers rowers riders shots fishermen with a noisy superabundance of animal spirits which maddened elsley yet wynd had sentiment in his way though he took good care never to show it elsley could repeat tennyson from end to end spouted the mort darthur up hill and down dale and chaunted rapturously come into the garden maud while he expressed his opinion of mauds lover in terms more forcible than delicate naylor fidus achates was a gloucestershire parsons son a huge heavylooking man with a thick curling lip and a sleepy eye but he had brains enough to become a firstrate classic and in that same sleepy eye and heavy lip lay an infinity of quiet humour racy old country stories quaint scraps of outoftheway learning jovial old ballads which he sang with the mellowest of voices and a slang vocabulary which made him the dread of all bargees from newnham pool to upware him also elsley hated because naylor looked always as if he was laughing at him which indeed he was  and the worst was that elsley had always to face them both at once if wynd vaulted over a gate into his very face with a how de do mr vavasour had any verses this morning in the same tone as if he had asked had any sport naylors round face was sure to look over the stonewall pipe in mouth with a dont disturb the gentleman tom dont you see hes a composing of his rhymes in a strong provincial dialect put on for the nonce in fact the two young rogues having no respect whatsoever for genius perhaps because they had each of them a little genius of their own made a butt of the poet as soon as they found out that he was afraid of them  but worse bêtes noirs than either wynd or naylor were on their way to fill up the cup of elsleys discomfort and at last without a note of warning appeared in beddgelert a phenomenon which rejoiced some hearts but perturbed also the spirits not only of the oxford philanderers but those of elsley vavasour and what is more of valencia herself  she was sitting one evening at the window with lucia looking out into the village and the pleasuregrounds before the hotel they were both laughing and chatting over the groups of tourists in their pretty irish way just as they had done when they were girls for lucias heart was expanding under the quiet beauty of the place the freedom from household care and what was more from money anxieties for valencia had slipped into her hand a cheque for fifty pounds from scoutbush and assured her that he would be quite angry if she spoke of paying the rent of the rooms elsley was mooning down the river by himself claude was entertaining his cambridge acquaintances as he did every night with his endless fun and sentiment gradually the tourists slipt in one by one as the last rays of the sun faded off the peaks of aran and the mist settled down upon the dark valley beneath and darkness fell upon that rockgirdled paradise when up to the door below there drove a car at sight whereof out rushed not waiters only and landlady but mr bowie himself who helped out a very short figure in a peajacket and a shining boating hat and then a very tall one in a wild shootingcoat and a military cap  my brother and mon saint père lucia too delightful this is why they did not write and valencia sprang up and was going to run down stairs to them when she paused at lucias call  who have they with them valcome and look who can it be  campbell and bowie were helping out carefully a tall man covered up in many wrappers it was too dark to see the face but a fancy crossed valencias mind which made her look grave in spite of her pleasure  he was evidently weak as from recent illness for his two supporters led him up the steps and scoutbush seemed full of directions and inquiries and fussed about with the landlady till she was tired of curtseying to my lord  a minute afterwards bowie threw open the door grandly my lord my ladies and in trotted scoutbush and began kissing them fiercely and then dancing about  oh my dears here at lastout of that horrid city of the plague such sights as i have seen and then he paused do you know val and lucia im glad ive seen it i dont know but i feel as if i should be a better man all my life and those poor people how well they did behave and the major hes an angel and sos that brick of a doctor and the mad schoolmistress and the curate everybody i think but me hang it val but your words shant come true i will be of some use yet before i die but ive and valencia went up to him and kissed him while he ran on and lucia said  you have been of use already dear fred you have sent me and the dear children to this sweet place where we have been safer and happier than she checked herself and your generous present too i feel quite a girl again thanks to you val and i have done nothing but laugh all day long and she began kissing him too    how happy could i be with either   were tother dear charmer away  broke out scoutbush what a pity it is now that i should have two such sweet creatures making love to me and cant marry either of them why did ye go and be my fathers daughters mavourneen id have made a peeress of the one of ye if yed had the sense to be anybody elses sisters  at which they all laughed and laughed and chattered broad irish together as they used to do for fun in old kilanbaggan castle before lucia was a weary wife and valencia a worldly fine lady and scoutbush a rackety guardsman breaking half of the ten commandments every week rather from ignorance than vice  well im glad yere pleased with me asthore said he at last to lucia but ive done another little good deed i flatter myself for ive brought away the poor spalpeen of a priest and have got him safe in the house  valencia stopped short in her fun  why what have ye to say against that miss val  why wont he be a little in the way said valencia not knowing what to say  faith he neednt trouble you and i shall take very good carei wonder when the supper is comingthat neither he nor any else troubles me but really said he in his natural voice and with some feeling i was ashamed to go away and leave him there he would have died if we had he worked day and night talk of saints and martyrs campbell himself said he was an idler by the side of him  oh i hope major campbell has not overexerted himself  he nothing hurts him hes as hard as his own sword but the poor curate worked on till he got the cholera himself he always expected it longed for it campbell saidwanted to die some love affair i suppose poor fellowand a terrible bout he had for eightandforty hours thurnall thought him gone again and again but he pulled the poor fellow through after all and we got some one that is campbell did to take his duty and brought him away after a good deal of persuasion for he would not move as long as there was a fresh case in the town that is why we never wrote we did not know till the last hour when we should start and we expected to be with you in two days and give you a pleasant surprise he was half dead when we got him on board but the weeks seaair helped him through so i must not grumble at these northerly breezes its an ill wind that blows nobody good they say  valencia heard all this as in a dream and watched her chattering brother with a stupefied air she comprehended all now and bitterly she blamed herself he had really loved her then set himself manfully to die at his post that he might forget her in a better world how shamefully she had trifled with that noble heart how should she ever meethow have courage to look him in the face and not love or anything like love but sacred pity and selfabasement filled her heart as his fair delicate face rose up before her all wan and shrunken with sad upbraiding eyes and round it such a halo pure and pale as crowns in some old german picture a martyrs head  he has had the cholera he has been actually dying asked she at last with that strange wish to hear over again bad news which one knows too well already  of course he has why you are not going away valencia you need not be afraid of infection campbell and thurnall too says thats all nonsense and they must know having seen it so often here comes bowie at last with supper  has mr headley had anything to eat asked valencia who longed to run away to her own room but dared not  he is eating now like any ged maam and major campbells making him eat too  he must be very ill thought she for mon saint père never to have come near us yet and then she thought with terror that her saint père might have guessed the truth and be angry with her and yet she trusted in franks secrecy he would not betray her  take care valencia when a woman has to trust a man not to betray her and does trust him she may soon find it not only easy but necessary to do more than trust him  however in five minutes campbell came in valencia saw at once that there was no change in his feelings to her but he could talk of nothing but headley his selfdevotion courage angelic gentleness and humility and every word of his praise was a fresh arrow in valencias conscience at last  one knows well enough what is the matter said he almost bitterly what is the matter i sometimes think with half the noblest men in the world and ninetenths of the noblest women and with many a one too god help them who is none of the noblest and therefore does not know how to take the bitter cup as he knows  what does the philosopher mean now asked scoutbush looking up from the cold lamb valencia knew but too well what he meant  he has a history my dear lord  a history what is he writing a book  campbell laughed a quiet underlaugh half sad half humorous  i am very tired said valencia i really think i shall go to bed  she went to her room but to bed she did not go she sat down and cried till she could cry no more and lay awake the greater part of the night tossing miserably she would have done better if she had prayed but prayer about such a matter was what valencia knew nothing of she was regular enough at church of course and said her prayers and confessed her sins in a general way and prayed about her soul as she had been taught to dounless she was too tired but to pray really about a real sorrow a real sin like this was a thought which never entered her mind and if it had she would have driven it away again just because the anxiety was so real practical human it was a matter which had nothing to do with religion which it seemed impertinentalmost wrong to lay before the throne of god  so she came downstairs next morning pale restless unrefreshed in body or mind and her peace of mind was not improved by seeing seated at the breakfasttable frank headley whom lucia and scoutbush were stuffing with all manner of good things  she blushed scarletdo what she would she could not help itwhen he rose and bowed to her half choked she came forward and offered her hand she was so shocked to hear that he had been so dangerously ill no one had even told them of itit had come upon them so suddenly and so forth  she spoke kindly but avoided the least tone of tenderness for she felt that if she gave way she might be only too tender and to reawaken hope in his heart would be only cruelty and therefore and for other reasons also she did not look him in the face as she spoke  he answered so cheerfully that she was half disappointed in spite of her remorse at his not being as miserable as she had expected still if he had overcome the passion it was so much better for him but yet valencia hardly wished that he should have overcome it so selfcontradictory is womans heart and her pity had sunk to halfebb and her selfcomplacency was rising with a flowing tide as he chatted on quietly but genially about the voyage and the scenery and snowdon which he had never seen and which he would ascend that very day  you will do nothing of the kind mr headley cried lucia is he not mad major campbell quite mad  i know i am mad my dear mrs vavasour i have been so a long time but snowdon ponies are in their sober sensesand i shall take one of them  fulfil the old punbegin beside yourself and end beside your horse i am sure he is not strong enough to sit over those rocks no you shall stay at home comfortably here valencia and i will take care of you  and mon saint père too i have a thousand things to say to him  and so has he to queen whims  so scoutbush sent bowie for john jones clerk the fisherman may his days be as many as his salmon and as good as his flies and the four stayed at home and talked over the aberalva tragedies till as it befell both lucia and campbell left the room awhile  immediately frank rose and walking across to valencia laid the fatal ring on the arm of her chair and returned to his seat without a word  you are very i hope that it stammered valencia  you hope that it was a comfort to me it was and i shall be always grateful to you for it  valencia heard an emphasis on the was it checked the impulse foolish enough which rose in her to bid him keep the ring  so prim and dignified she slipped it into its place on her finger and went on with her work merely saying  i need not say that i am happy that anything which i could do should have been of use to you in such a fearful time  it was a fearful time but for myself i cannot be too glad of it god grant that it may have been as useful to others as to me it cured me of a great folly now i look back i am astonished at my own absurdity rudeness presumptionyou must let me say iti do not know how to thank you enough i cannot trust myself with the fit words they would be so strong but i owe this confession to you and to your exceeding goodness and kindness when you would have been justified in treating me as a madman i was mad i believe but i am in my right mind now i assure you said he gaily had i not been i need hardly say you would not have seen me here what a prospect this is and he rose and looked out of the window  valencia had heard all this with downcast eyes and unmoved face was she pleased at it not in the least the naughty child that she was and more she grew quite angry with herself ashamed of herself for having thought and felt so much about him the night before how silly of me he is very well and does not care for me and who is he pray that i should even look at him  and as if in order to put her words into practice she looked at him there and then he was gazing out of the window leaning gracefully and yet feebly against the shutter with the full glory of the forenoon sun upon his sharpcut profile and rich chestnut locks and after all having looked at him once she could not help looking at him again he was certainly a most gentlemanlike man elegant from head to foot there was not an ungraceful line about him to his very boots and the white nails of his slender fingers even the defects of his figurethe too great length of the neck and slope of the shouldersincreased his likeness to those saintly pictures with which he had been mixed up in her mind the night before he was at one extreme pole of the different types of manhood and that burly doctor who had saved his life at the other but her saint père alone perfectly combined the two there was nobody like him after all perhaps her wisest plan as headley had forgotten his fancy was to confess all to the saint père as she usually did her little sins and get some sort of absolution from him  however she must say something in answer  yes it is a very lovely view but really i must say one more word about this matter i have to thank you you know for the good faith which you have kept with me  he looked round seemingly amused cela va sans dire and he bowed pray do not say any more about the matter and he looked at her with such humble and thankful eyes that valencia was sorry not to hear more from him than  pray tell mefor of course you knowthe name of this exquisite valley up which i am looking  gwynnant you must go up it when you are well enough and see the lakes they are the only ones in snowdon from the banks of which the primaeval forest has not disappeared  indeed i must make shift to go there this very afternoon fordo not laugh at mebut i never saw a lake in my life  never saw a lake  no i am a true lowlander born and bred among bleak norfolk sands and fensso much the worse for this chest of mine and this is my first sight of mountains it is all like a dream to me and a dream which i never expected to be realised  ah you should see our irish lakes and mountainsyou should see killarney  i am content with these i suppose it is as wrong to break the tenth commandment about scenery as about anything else  ah but it seems so hard that you who i am sure would appreciate fine scenery should have been debarred from it while hundreds of stupid people run over the alps and italy every summer and come home as far as i can see rather more stupid than they went having made confusion worse confounded by filling their poor brains with hard names out of murray  not quite so hard as that thousands every day who would enjoy a meat dinner should have nothing but dry bread and not enough of that i fancy sometimes that in some mysterious way that want will be made up to them in the next life and so with all the beautiful things which travelled people talk ofi comfort myself with the fancy that i see as much as is good for me here and that if i make good use of that i shall see the alps and the andes in the world to come or something much more worth seeing tell me now how far may that range of crags be from us i am sure that i could walk there after luncheon this mountain air is strengthening me so  walk thither i assure you they are at least four miles off  four and i thought them one so clear and sharp as they stand out against the sky one fancies that one could almost stretch out a hand and touch those knolls and slabs of rock as distinct as in a photograph and yet so soft and rich withal dappled with pearlygrey stone and purple heath ahso it must be i suppose the first time that one sees a glorious thing ones heart is lifted up towards it in love and awe till it seems near to oneground on which one may freely tread because one appreciates and admires and so one forgets the distance between its grandeur and ones own littleness  the allusion was palpable but did he intend it surely not after what he had just said and yet there was a sadness in the tone which made valencia fancy that some feeling for her might still linger but he evidently had been speaking to himself forgetful for the moment of her presence for he turned to her with a start and a blushbut nowi have been troubling you too long with this stupid têteàtête sentimentality of mine i will make my bow and find the major i am afraid if it be possible for him to forget any one he has forgotten me in some new moss or other  he went out and to valencias chagrin she saw him no more that day he spent the forenoon in the garden and the afternoon in lying down and at night complained of fatigue and stayed in his own room the whole evening while campbell read him to sleep next morning however he made his appearance at breakfast well and cheerful  i must play at sick man no more or i shall rob you i see of major campbells company and i owe you all for too much already  unless you are better than you were last night you must play at sick man said the major i cannot conceive what exhausted you so unless you ladies are better nurses i must let no one come near him but myself if you had been scolding him the whole morning instead of praising him as he deserves he could not have been more tired last night  pray do not cried frank evidently much pained i had such a delightful morning and every one is so kindyou only make me wretched when i feel all the trouble i am giving  my dear fellow said scoutbush en grand sérieux after all that you have done for our people at aberalva i should be very much shocked if any of my family thought any service shown to you a trouble  pray do not speak so said frank i am fallen among angels when i least expected  scoutbush as an angel shrieked lucia clapping her hands elsley dont you see the wings sprouting already under his shooting jacket  they are my braces i suppose of course said scoutbush who never understood a joke about himself though he liked one about other people while elsley who hated all jokes made no answerat least none worth recording in fact as the reader may have discovered elsley save têteàtête with some one who took his fancy was somewhat of a silent and morose animal and as little scoutbush confided to mellot there was no getting a rise out of him all which lucia saw as keenly as any one and tried to pass off by chattering nervously and fussily for him as well as for herself whereby she only made him the more cross for he could not the least understand her argumentwhy my dear if you dont talk to people i must  but why should people be talked to  because they like it and expect it  the more foolish they much better to hold their tongues and think  or read your poetry i suppose and then would begin a squabble  meanwhile there was one at least of the party who was watching lucia with most deep and painful interest lord scoutbush was too busy with his own comforts especially with his fishing to think much of this moroseness of elsleys if he suited lucia very well his taste and hers differed but it was her concern not hiswas a very easy way of freeing himself from all anxiety on the matter but not so with major campbell he saw all this and knew enough of human nature to suspect that the selfseeking which showed as moroseness in company might show as downright bad temper in private longing to know more of elsley if possible to guide and help him he tried to be intimate with him as he had tried at aberalva paid him court asked his opinion talked to him on all subjects which he thought would interest him his conclusion was more favourable to elsleys head than to his heart he saw that elsley was vain and liked his attentions and that lowered him in his eyes but he saw too that elsley shrank from him at first he thought it pride but he soon found that it was fear and that lowered him still more in his eyes  perhaps campbell was too hard on the poet but his own purity itself told against elsley who am i that any one should be afraid of me unless they have done something wrong so with his dark suspicions roused he watched intently every word and every tone of elsleys to his wife and here he came to a more unpleasant conclusion still he saw that they were sometimes at least not happy together and from this he took for granted too hastily that they were never happy together that lucia was an utterly illused person that elsley was a bad fellow who illtreated her and a black and awful indignation against the man grew up within him all the more fierce because it seemed utterly righteous and because too it had under heavy penalties to be utterly concealed beneath a courteous and genial manner till many a time he felt inclined to knock elsley down for little roughnesses to her which were really the fruit of mere gaucherie and then accused himself for a hypocrite because he was keeping up the courtesies of life with such a man for campbell like most men of his temperament was overstern and sometimes a little cruel and unjust in demanding of others the same lofty code which he had laid down for himself and in demanding it too of some more than of others by a very questionable exercise of private judgment on the whole he was right no doubt in being as indulgent as he dared to the publicans and sinners like scoutbush and in being as severe as he dared on all pharisees and pretentious persons whatsoever but he was too much inclined to draw between the two classes one of those strong lines of demarcation which exist only in the fancies of the human brain for sins like all diseased matters are complicated and confused matters many a seeming pharisee is at heart a selfcondemned publican and ought to be comforted and not cursed while many a publican is in the midst of all his foul sins a thorough exclusive and selfcomplacent pharisee and needs not the right hand of mercy but the strong arm of punishment  campbell like other men had his faults and his were those of a man wrapped up in a pure and stately but an austere and lonely creed distrusted with the world in all its forms and looking down upon men in general nearly as much as thurnall did so he set down elsley for a bad man to whom he was forced by hard circumstances to behave as if he were a good one  the only way therefore in which he could vent his feeling was by showing to lucia that studied attention which sympathy and chivalry demand of a man toward an injured woman not that he dared or wished to conduct himself with her as he did with valencia even had she not been a married woman he did not know her as intimately as he did her sister but still he had a right to behave as the most intimate friend of her family and he asserted that right and all the more determinedly because elsley seemed now and then not to like it i will teach him how to behave to a charming woman said he to himself and perhaps he had been wiser if he had not said it but every man has his weak point and chivalry was major campbells  what do you think of that poet mellot said he once on returning from a picnic during which elsley had never noticed his wife and at last finding valencia engaged with headley had actually gone off pour pis aller to watch lord scoutbush fishing  oh clever enough and to spare and as well read a man as i know one of the sturmunddrang party of coursethe express locomotive school screamandgohead and thinks me with my classicism a benighted pagan still every man has a right to his opinion live and let live  i dont care about his taste said the major impatiently what sort of man is heman claude  ahem humph irritabile genus poetarum but one is so accustomed to that among literary men one never expects them to be like anybody else and so takes their whims and oddities for granted  and their sins too eh  sins i know of none on his part  dont you call temper a sin  no i call it a determination of blood to the head or of animal spirits to the wrong place ormy dear major i am no moralist i take people you know as i find them but he is a bore and i should not wonder if that sweet little woman had found it out ere now  campbell ground something between his teeth he fancied himself full of righteous wrath he was really in a very unchristian temper be it so perhaps there were excuses for him as there are for many men of which we know nothing  elsley meanwhile watched campbell with fast lowering brow losing a womans affections he who does so deserves his fate had he been in the habit of paying proper attention to lucia he would have liked campbell all the more for his conduct there are few greater pleasures to a man who is what he should be to his wife than to see other men admiring what he admires and trying to rival him where he knows that he can have no rival let them worship as much as they will let her make herself as charming to them as she can what matter he smiles at them in his heart for has he not over and above all the pretty things which he can say and do ten times as well as they a talismana dozen talismans which are beyond their reachin the strength of which he will go home and laugh over with her amid sacred caresses all which makes mean men mad but elsley alas for him had neglected lucia himself and therefore dreaded comparison with any other man and the suspicions which had taken root in him at aberalva grew into ugly shape and strength however he was silent and contented himself with coldness and all but rudeness  there were excuses for him in the first place it would have been an ugly thing to take notice of any mans attentions to a wife it could not be done but upon the strongest grounds and done in a way which would make a complete rupture necessary so breaking up the party in a sufficiently unpleasant way besides to move in the matter at all would be to implicate lucia for of whatsoever kind campbells attentions were she evidently liked them and a quarrel with her on that score was more than elsley dared face he was not a man of strong moral courage he hated a scene of any kind and he was afraid of being worsted in any really serious quarrel not merely by campbell but by lucia it may seem strange that he should be afraid of her though not so that he should be afraid of campbell but the truth is that the man who bullies his wife very often does soas elsley had done more than oncesimply to prove to himself his own strength and hide his fear of her he knew well that womans tongue when once the fair beast is brought to bay is a weapon far too trenchant to be faced by any shield but that of a very clear conscience toward her which was more than elsley had  besideand it is an honour to elsley vavasour amid all his weakness that he had justice and chivalry enough left to know what nine men out of ten ignorebehind all let the worst come to the worst lay one just and terrible rejoinder which he though he had been no worse than the average of men could only answer by silent shame  at least sir i was pure when i came to you you best know whether you were so likewise  and yet even that so allforgiving is woman might have been faced by some means but the miserable complication about the false name still remained elsley believed that he was in his wifes power that she could if she chose turn upon him and proclaim him to the world as a scoundrel and an impostor and as it is of the nature of man to hate those whom he fears elsley began to have dark and ugly feelings toward lucia instead of throwing them away as a strong man would have done he pampered them almost without meaning to do so for he let them run riot through his too vivid imagination in the form of possible speeches possible scenes till he had looked and looked through a hundred thoughts which no man has a right to entertain for a moment true he had entertained them with horror but he ought not to have entertained them at all he ought to have kicked them contemptuously out and back to the devil from whence they came it may be again that this is impossible to man that prayer is the only refuge against that walpurgisdance of the witches and the fiends which will at hapless moments whirl unbidden through a mortal brain but elsley did not pray  so leaving these fancies in his head too long he soon became accustomed to them and accustomed too to the nemesis which they bring with them of chronic moodiness and concealed rage day by day he was lashing himself up into fresh fury and yet day by day he was becoming more careful to conceal that fury he had many reasons moral cowardice which made him shrink from the tremendous consequences of an explosion equally tremendous were he right or wrong then the secret hope perhaps the secret consciousness that he was wrong and was only saying to god like the selfdeceiving prophet i do well to be angry then the honest fear of going too far of being surprised at last into some hideous and irreparable speech or deed which he might find out too late was utterly unjust then at moments for even that would cross him the devilish notion that by concealment he might lure lucia on to give him a safe ground for attack all these and more tormented him for a wretched fortnight during which he became at such an expense of selfcontrol as he had not exercised for years courteous to campbell more than courteous to lucia hiding under a smiling face wrath which increased with the pressure brought to bear upon it  campbell and lucia mellot valencia and frank utterly deceived went on more merrily than ever little dreaming that they walked and talked daily with a man who was fast becoming glad to flee to the pit of hell but for the fear that god would be there also they meanwhile chatted on enjoying as human souls are allowed to do at rare and precious moments the mere sensation of being of which they would talk at times in a way which led them down into deep matters for instance  how pleasant to sit here for ever said claude one afternoon in the inn garden at beddgelert and say not with descartes i think therefore i exist but simply i enjoy therefore i exist i almost think those emersonians are right at times when they crave the life of plants and stones and rain stangrave said to me once that his ideal of perfect bliss was that of an oyster in the indian seas drinking the warm salt water motionless and troubling himself about nothing while nothing troubled itself about him  till a diver came and tore him up for the sake of his pearls said valencia  he did not intend to contain any pearls a pearl you know is a disease of the oyster the product of some irritation he wished to be the oyster pure and simple a part of nature  and to be of no use asked frank  of none whatsoever nature had made him what he was and all beside was her business and not his i dont deny that i laughed at him and made him wroth by telling him that his doctrine was the apotheosis of loafing but my heart went with him and the jolly oyster too it is very beautiful after all that careless nymph and shepherd life of the old greeks and that marquesas romance of herman melvillesto enjoy the simple fact of living like a neapolitan lazzaroni or a fly upon a wall  but the old greek heroes fought and laboured to till the land and rid it of giants and monsters said frank and as for the marquesas mr melville found out did he notas you did oncethat they were only petting and fattening him for the purpose of eating him there is a dark side to that pretty picture mr mellot  tant pis pour eux but that is an unnecessary appendage to the idea purely it must be possible to realise such a simple rich healthy life without wickedness if not without human sorrow it is no dream and no one shall rob me of it i have seen fragments of it scattered up and down the world and i believe they will all meet in paradisewhere and when i care not but they will meet i was very happy in the south sea islands after that when nobody meant to eat me and i am very happy here and do not intend to be eaten unless it will be any pleasure to miss st just no let man enjoy himself when he can and take his fill of those flaming red geraniums and glossy rhododendrons and feathered crownferns and the gold green lace of those acacias tossing and whispering overhead and the purple mountains sleeping there aloft and the murmur of the brook over the stones and drink in scents with every breathwhat was his nose made for save to smell i used to torment myself once by asking them all what they meant now i am content to have done with symbolisms and say what you all mean i care not all i know is that i can draw pleasure from the mere sight of you as perhaps you do from the mere sight of me so let us sit together nature and i and stare into each others eyes like two young lovers careless of the morrow and its griefs i will not even take the trouble to paint her why make ugly copies of perfect pictures let those who wish to see her take a railway ticket and save us academicians colours and canvas quant à moi the public must go to the mountains as mahomet had to do for the mountains shall not come to the public  one of your wilful paradoxes mr mellot why you are photographing them all day long  not quite all day long madam and after all il faut vivre i want a few luxuries i have no capacity for keeping a shop photographing pays better than painting considering the time it takes and it is only nature reproducing herself not caricaturing her but if any one will ensure me a poor two thousand a year i will promise to photograph no more but vanish to sicily or calabria and sit with sabina in an orchard all my days twining rose garlands for her pretty head like theocritus and his friends while the pears drop on our shoulders and the apples by our side  what do you think of all this asked valencia of frank  that i am too like the emersonian oyster here very happy and very useless and therefore very anxious to be gone  surely you have earned the right to be idle awhile  no one has a right to be idle  oh groaned claude where did you find that eleventh commandment  i have done with all eleventh commandments for i find it quite hard work enough to keep the ancient ten but i find it mellot in the deepest abyss of all in the very depth from which the commandments sprang but we will not talk about it here  why not asked valencia looking up are we so very naughty as to be unworthy to listen  and are these mountains asked claude so ugly and illmade that they are an unfit pulpit for a sermon no tell me what you mean after all i am half in jest  do not courtesy pity chivalry generosity selfsacrificein short being of usedo not our hearts tell us that they are the most beautiful noble lovely things in the world  i suppose it is so said valencia  why does one admire a soldier not for his epaulettes and red coat but because one knows that coxcomb though he be at home here there is the power in him of that same selfsacrifice that when he is called he will go and die that he may be of use to his country and yetit may seem invidious to say so just nowbut there are other sorts of selfsacrifice less showy but even more beautiful  oh mr headley what can a man do more than die for his countrymen  live for them it is a longer work and therefore a more difficult and a nobler one  frank spoke in a somewhat sad and abstracted tone  but tell me she said what all this has to do withwith the deep matter of which you spoke  simply that it is the law of all earth and heaven and him who made themthat god is perfectly powerful because he is perfectly and infinitely of use and perfectly good because he delights utterly and always in being of use and that therefore we can become like godas the very heathens felt that we can and ought to becomeonly in proportion as we become of use i did not see it once i tried to be good not knowing what good meant i tried to be good because i thought it would pay me in the world to come but at last i saw that all life all devotion all piety were only worth anything only divine and godlike and godbeloved as they were means to that one endto be of use  it is a noble thought headley said claude but valencia was silent  it is a noble thought mellot and all thoughts become clear in the light of it even that most difficult thought of all which so often torments good people when they feel i ought to love god and yet i do not love him easy to love him if one can once think of him as the concentration the ideal perfection of all which is most noble admirable lovely in human character and easy to work too when one once feels that one is working for such a being and with such a being as that the whole world round us and the future of the world too seem full of light even down to its murkiest and foulest depths when we can but remember that great ideaan infinitely useful god over all who is trying to make each of us useful in his place if that be not the beatific vision of which old mystics spoke so rapturously one glimpse of which was perfect bliss i at least know none nobler desire none more blessed pray forgive me miss st just i ought not to intrude thus  go on said valencia  ii really have no more to say i have said too much i do not know how i have been betrayed so far stammered frank who had the just dislike of his school of anything like display on such solemn matters  can you tell us too much truth mr headley is right mr mellot and you are wrong  it will not be the first time miss st just but what i spoke in jest he has answered in earnest  he was quite right we are none of us half earnest enough there is lucia with the children and she rose and walked across the garden  you have moved the fair trifler somewhat said claude  god grant it but i cannot think what made me  why think you spoke out nobly and i shall not forget your sermon  i was not preaching at you most affectionate and kindly of men  and laziest of men likewise what can i do now at this moment to be of use to any one set me my task  but frank was following with his eyes valencia as she went hurriedly across to lucia he saw her take two of the children at once off her sisters hands and carry them away down a walk a few minutes afterwards he could hear her romping with them but he could not have guessed from the silver din of those merry voices that valencias heart was heavy within her  for her conscience was really smitten of what use was she in the world major campbell had talked to her often about her duties to this person and to that of this same necessity of being useful but she had escaped from the thought as we have seen her in laughing at poor little scoutbush on the very same score but why had not major campbells sermons touched her heart as this one had who can tell who is there among us to whom an oftheard truth has not become a tiresome and superfluous commonplace till one day it has flashed before us utterly new indubitable not to be disobeyed written in letters of fire across the whole vault of heaven all one can say is that her time was not come besides she looked on major campbell as a being utterly superior to herself and that very superiority while it allowed her to be as familiar with him as she chose excused her in her own eyes from opening to him her real heart she could safely jest with him let him pet her play at being his daughter while she felt that between him and her lay a gulf as wide as between earth and heaven and that very notion comforted her in her naughtiness for in that case of course his code of morals was not meant for her and while she took his warnings as many of them at least as she chose she thought herself by no means bound to follow his examples she all but worshipped him as her guardian angel but she was not meant for an angel herself so she could indulge freely in those little escapades and frivolities for which she was born and then whenever frightened run for shelter under his wings but to hear the same and even loftier words from the lips of the curate whom she had made her toy almost her butt was to have them brought down unexpectedly and painfully to her own level if this was his ideal why ought it not to be hers was she not his equal perhaps his superior and so her very pride humbled her as she said to herselfthen i ought to be useful i can bewill be  lucia asked she that very afternoon will you let me take the children off your hands while clara is busy in the morning  oh you dear good creature but it would be such a gêne they are really stupid i am afraid sometimes or else i am they make me so miserably cross at times  i will take them it would be a relief to you would it not  my clear said poor lucia with a doleful smile which seemed to valencias selfaccusing heart to say have you only now discovered that fact  from that day valencia courted headleys company more and more to fall in love with him was of course absurd and he had cured himself of his passing fancy for her there could be no harm then in her making the most of conversation so different from what she heard in the world and which in her heart of hearts she liked so much better for it was with valencia as with all women in this common fault of frivolity as in most others the men rather than they are to blame valencia had cultivated in herself those qualities which she saw admired by the men whom she met and some one of whom of course she meant to marry and as their female ideal was a butterfly ideal a butterfly she became but beneath all lay deep and strong the womans love of nobleness and wisdom the womans longing to learn and to be led which has shown itself in every age in so many a fantastic and even ugly shape and which is their real excuse for the flirting with geniuses casting themselves at the feet of directors which had tempted her to coquette with elsley and was now bringing her into undesirable intimacy with the poor curate  she had heard that day with some sorrow his announcement that he wished to be gone but as he did not refer to it again she left the thought alone and all but forgot it the subject however was renewed about a week afterwards when you return to aberalva she had said in reference to some commission  i shall never return to aberalva  not return  no i have already resigned the curacy i believe your uncle has appointed to it the man whom campbell found for me and an excellent man i hear he is at least he will do better there than i  but what could have induced you how sorry all the people will be  i am not sure of that said he with a smile i did what i could at last to win back at least their respect and to leave at least not hatred behind me but i am unfit for them i did not understand them i meantno matter what i meant but i failed god forgive me i shall now go somewhere where i shall have simpler work to do where i shall at least have a chance of practising the lesson which i learnt there i learnt it all strange to say from the two people in the parish from whom i expected to learn least  whom do you mean  the doctor and the schoolmistress  why from them less than from any in the parish she so good and he so clever  that i shall never tell to any one now suffice it that i was mistaken  valencia could obtain no further answer and so the days ran on every one becoming more and more intimate till a certain afternoon on which they were all to go and picnic under claudes pilotage above the lake of gwynnant scoutbush was to have been with them but a heavy days rain in the meanwhile swelled the streams into fishing order so the little man ordered a car and started at three in the morning for bettws with mr bowie who however loth to give up the arrangement of plates and the extraction of champagne corks considered his presence by the riverside a natural necessity  my dear miss clara ye see therell be nobody to see that his lordship pits on dry stockings and hes always getting over the tops of his waterboots being young and daft as weve all been and no offence to you and to tell you truth i can stand all temptationsin moderation that is save an except the chance o cleiking a fish     chapter xx  both sides of the moon at once   the spot which claude had chosen for the picnic was on one of the lower spurs of that great mountain of the maidens peak which bounds the vale of gwynnant to the south above a wilderness of gnarled volcanic dykes and purple heather ledges below broken into glens in which still linger pale green ashwoods relics of that great primaeval forest in which in besss days great leicester used to rouse the hart with hound and horn  among these claude had found a little lawn guarded by great rocks out of every cranny of which the ashes grew as freely as on flat ground their feet were bedded deep in sweet fern and wild raspberries and goldenrod and purple scabious and tall blue campanulas above them and before them and below them the ashes shook their green filigree in the bright sunshine and through them glimpses were seen of the purple cliffs above and right in front of the great cataract of nant gwynnant a long snowwhite line zigzagging down coalblack cliffs for many a hundred feet and above it depth beyond depth of purple shadow away into the very heart of snowdon up the long valley of cwmdyli to the great amphitheatre of clogwynygarnedd while over all the cone of snowdon rose in perfect symmetry between his attendant peaks of lliwedd and crib coch  there they sat and laughed and talked the pleasant summer afternoon in their pleasant summer bower and never regretted the silence of the birds so sweetly did valencias song go up in many a rich sad irish melody while the lowing of the milch kine and the wild cooing of the herdboys came softly up from the vale below and all the air was filled with pleasant noise of waters  then claude must needs photograph them all as they sat and group them first according to his fancy and among his fancies was one that valencia should sit as queen with headley and the major at her feet and headley lounged there and looked into the grass and thought it well for him could he lie there for ever  then claude must photograph the mountain itself and all began to talk of it  see the breadth of light and shadow said claude how the purple depth of the great lap of the mountain is thrown back by the sheet of green light on lliwedd and the red glory on the cliffs of crib coch till you seem to look away into the bosom of the hill mile after mile  and so you do said headley i have learnt to distinguish mountain distances since i have been here that peak is four miles from us now and yet the shadowed cliffs at its foot seem double that distance  and look look said valencia at the long line of glory with which the western sun is gilding the edge of the left hand slope bringing it nearer and nearer to us every moment against the deep blue sky  but what a form perfect lightness perfect symmetry said claude curve sweeping over curve peak towering over peak to the highest point and then sinking down again as gracefully as they rose one can hardly help fancying that the mountain moves that those dancing lines are not instinct with life  at least said headley that the mountain is a leaping wave frozen just ere it fell  perfect said valencia that is the very expression so concise and yet so complete  and headley poor fool felt as happy as if he had found a gold mine  to me said elsley the fancy rises of some great eastern monarch sitting in royal state with ample shoulders sloping right and left he lays his purplemantled arms upon the heads of two of those titan guards who stand on either side his footstool  while from beneath his throne said headley as eastern poets would say flow everlasting streams lifegiving to fertilise broad lands below  i did not know that you too were a poet said valencia nor i madam but if such scenes as these and in such company cannot inspire the fancy of even a poor country curate to something of exaltation he must be dull indeed  why not put some of these thoughts into poetry  what use answered he in so low sad and meaning a tone meant only for her ear that valencia looked down at him but he was gazing intently upon the glorious scene was he hinting at the vanity and vexation of poor elsleys versifying or did he mean that he had now no purpose in lifeno prize for which it was worth while to win honour  she did not answer him but he answered himselfperhaps to explain away his own speech  no madam god has written the poetry already and there it is before me my business is not to rewrite it clumsily but to read it humbly and give him thanks for it  more and more had valencia been attracted by headley during the last few weeks accustomed to men who tried to make the greatest possible show of what small wits they possessed she was surprised to find one who seemed to think it a duty to keep his knowledge and taste in the background she gave him credit for more talent than appeared for more perhaps than he really had she was piqued too at his very modesty and selfrestraint why did not he like the rest who dangled about her spread out his peacocks train for her eyes and try to show his worship of her by setting himself off in his brightest colours and yet this modesty awed her into respect of him for she could not forget that whether he had sentiment much or little sentiment was not the staple of his manhood she could not forget his cholera work and she knew that under that delicate and bashful outside lay virtue and heroism enough and to spare  but if you put these thoughts into words you would teach others to read that poetry  my business is to teach people to do right and if i cannot to pray god to find some one who can  right headley said major campbell laying his hand on the curates shoulder god dwells no more in books written with pens than in temples made with hands and the sacrifice which pleases him is not verse but righteousness do you recollect queen whims what i wrote once in your album    be good sweet maid and let who will be clever   do noble things not dream them all day long   so making life death and that vast for ever   one grand sweet song  but you naughty hypocritical saint père you write poetry yourself and beautifully  yes as i smoke my cigar to comfort my poor rheumatic old soul but if i lived only to write poetry i should think myself as wise as if i lived only to smoke tobacco  valencias eyes could not help glancing at elsley who had wandered away to the neighbouring brook and was gazing with all his eyes upon a ferny rock having left lucia to help claude with his photographing  frank saw her look and read its meaning and answered her thoughts perhaps too hastily  and what a really wellread and agreeable man he is all the while what a mine of quaint learning and beautiful old legendif he would but bring it into the common stock for every ones amusement instead of hoarding it up for himself why what else does he do but bring it into the common stock when he publishes a book which every one can read said valencia half out of the spirit of contradiction  and few understand said headley quietly  you are very unjust he is a very discerning and agreeable person and i shall go and talk to him and away went valencia to elsley somewhat cross womanlike she allowed for the sake of her sisters honour no one but herself to depreciate vavasour and chose to think it impertinent on headleys part  headley began quietly talking to major campbell about botany while valencia a little ashamed of herself all the while took her revenge on elsley by scolding him for his unsocial ways in the very terms which headley had been using  at last claude having finished his photographing departed downward to get some new view from the road below and lucia returned to the rest of the party valencia joined them at once bringing up elsley who was not in the best of humours after her diatribes and the whole party wandered about the woodland and scrambled down beside the torrent beds  at last they came to a point where they could descend no further for the stream falling over a cliff had worn itself a narrow chasm in the rock and thundered down it into a deep narrow pool  lucia who was basking in the sunshine and the flowers as simple as a child would needs peep over the brink and made elsley hold her while she looked down a quiet happiness as of old recollections came into her eyes as she watched the sparkling and foaming water    and beauty born of murmuring sound   did pass into her face  campbell started the lucia of seven years ago seemed to bloom out again in that pale face and wrinkled forehead and a smile came over his face too as he looked  just like the dear old waterfall at kilanbaggan you recollect it major campbell  elsley always disliked recollections of kilanbaggan recollections of her life before he knew her recollections of pleasures in which he had not shared especially recollections of her old acquaintance with the major  i do not i am ashamed to say replied the major  why you were there a whole summer ah i suppose you thought about nothing but your salmon fishing if elsley had been there he would not have forgotten a rock or a pool would you elsley  really in spite of all salmon i have not forgotten a rock or a pool about the place which i ever saw but at the waterfall i never was  so he has not forgotten what cause had he to remember so carefully thought elsley  oh elsley look what is that exquisite flower like a ball of gold hanging just over the water  if elsley had not had the evil spirit haunting about him he would have joined in lucias admiration of the beautiful creature as it dropped into the foam from its narrow ledge with its fan of palmate leaves bright green against the black mosses of the rock and its golden petals glowing like a tiny sun in the darkness of the chasm as it was he answered  only a buttercup  i am sure its not a buttercup it is three times as large and a so much paler yellow is it a buttercup now major campbell  campbell looked down  very nearly one after all but its real name is the globe flower it is common enough here in spring you may see the leaves in every pasture but i suppose this plant hidden from the light has kept its flowers till the autumn  and till i came to see it darling that it is i should like to reward it by wearing it home  i daresay it would be very proud of the honour especially if mr vavasour would embalm it in verse after it had done service to you  it is doing good enough service where it is said elsley why pluck out the very eye of that perfect picture  strange said lucia that such a beautiful thing should be born there all alone upon these rocks with no one to look at it  it enjoys itself sufficiently without us no doubt said elsley  yes but i want to enjoy it oh if you could but get it for me  elsley looked down there were fifteen feet of somewhat slippery rock then a ragged ledge a foot broad in a crack of which the flower grew then the dark boiling pool elsley shrugged his shoulders and said smiling as if it were a fine thing to sayreally my dear all men are not knight errants enough to endanger their necks for a bit of weed and i cannot say that such rough tours de force are at all to my fancy  lucia turned away but she was vexed campbell could see that a strange fancy for the plant had seized her as she walked from the spot he could hear her talking about its beauty to valencia  campbells blood boiled to be asked by that womanby any womanto get her that flower and to be afraid it was bad enough to be illtempered but to be a coward and to be proud thereof he yielded to a temptation which he had much better have left alone seeing that lucia had not asked him swung himself easily enough down the ledge got the flower and put it quietly bowing into mrs vavasours hand  he was frightened when he had done it for he saw to his surprise that she was frightened she took the flower smiling thanks and expressing a little commonplace horror and astonishment at his having gone down such a dangerous cliff but she took it to elsley drew his arm through hers and seemed determined to make as much of him as possible for the rest of the afternoon the fellow was jealous then in addition to his other sins and campbell who felt that he had put himself unnecessarily forward between husband and wife grew more and more angry and somehow unlike his usual wont refused to confess himself in the wrong because he was in the wrong certainly it was not pleasant for poor elsley and so lucia felt and bore with him when he refused to be comforted and rendered blessing for railing when he said to her more than one angry word but she had been accustomed to angry words by this time  all might have passed off but for that careless valencia who had not seen the details of what had passed and so advised herself to ask where lucia got that beautiful plant  major campbell picked it up for her from the cliff said elsley drily  ah at the risk of his neck i dont doubt he is the most matchless cavalier servente  i shall leave mrs vavasour to his care thenthat is for the present said elsley drawing his arm from lucias  i assure you answered she roused in her turn by his determined bad temper i am not the least afraid of being left in the charge of so old a friend  elsley made no answer but sprang down through the thickets calling loudly to claude mellot  it was very naughty of lucia no doubt but even a worm will turn and there are times when people who have not courage to hold their peace must say something or other and do not always in the hurry get out what they ought but only what they have time to think of and she forgot what she had said the next minute in major campbells question  am i then so old a friend mrs vavasour  of course who older  campbell was silent a moment if he was inclined to choke at least lucia did not see it  i trust i have not offended yourmr vavasour  oh she said with a forced gaiety only one of his poetic fancies he wanted so much to see mr mellot photograph the waterfall i hope he will be in time to find him  i am a plain soldier mrs vavasour and i only ask because i do not understand what are poetic fancies  lucia looked up in his face puzzled and saw there an expression so grave pitying tender that her heart leaped up toward him and then sank back again  why do you ask why need you know you are no poet  and for that very cause i ask you  oh but said she guessing at what was in his mind and trying womanlike to play purposely at cross purposes and to defend her husband at all risks he has an extraordinary poetic faculty all the world agrees to that major campbell  what matter said he lucia would have been very angry and perhaps ought to have been so for what business of campbells was it whether her husband were kind to her or not but there was a deep sadness almost despair in the tone which disarmed her  oh major campbell is it not a glorious thing to be a poet and is it not a glorious thing to be a poets wife oh for the sake of thatif i could but see him honoured appreciated famous as he will be some day though i think and she spoke with all a womans pride he is somewhat famous now is he not  famous yes answered campbell with an abstracted voice and then rejoined quickly if you could but see that what then  why then said she with a half smile for she had nearly entrapped herself into an admission of what she was determined to concealwhy then i should be still more what i am now his devoted little wife who cares for nobody and nothing but putting his study to rights and bringing up his children  happy children said he after a pause and half to himself who have such a mother to bring them up  do you really think so but flattery used not to be one of your sins ah i wish you could give me some advice about how i am to teach them  so it is she who has the work of education not he thought campbell to himself and then answered gaily  my dear madam what can a confirmed old bachelor like me know about children  oh dont you know and she gave one of her pretty irish laughs that it is the old maids who always write the childrens books for the benefit of us poor ignorant married women but and she spoke earnestly again we all know how wise and good you are i did not know it in old times i am afraid i used to torment you when i was young and foolish  where on earth can mellot and mr vavasour be asked campbell  oh never mind mr mellot has gone wandering down the glen with his apparatus and my elsley has gone wandering after him and will find him in due time with his head in a black bag and a great bull just going to charge him from behind like that hapless man in punch i always tell mr mellot that will be his end  campbell was deeply shocked to hear the light tone in which she talked of the passionate temper of a man whom she so surely loved how many outbursts of it there must have been how many paroxysms of astonishment shame and griefperhaps alas counterbursts of anger ere that heart could have become thus proof against the everlowering thunderstorm  well he said all we can do is to walk down to the car and let them follow and meanwhile i will give you my wise opinion about this education question whereof i know nothing  it will be all oracular to me for i know nothing either and she put her arm through his and walked on  did you hurt yourself then i am sure you are in pain  i never less free from it with many thanks to you what made you think so  i heard you breathe so hard and quite stamp your feet i thought i suppose it was fancy  it was not fancy nevertheless major campbell was stamping down something and succeeded too in crushing it  they walked on toward the car valencia and headley following them ere they arrived at the place where they were to meet it it was quite dark but what was more important the car was not there  the stupid man must have mistaken his orders and gone home  or let his horse go home of itself while he was asleep inside he was more than half tipsy when we started  so spoke the major divining the exact truth there was nothing to be done but to walk the four miles home and let the two truants follow as they could  we shall have plenty of time for our educational lecture said lucia  plenty of time to waste then my clear lady  oh i never talk with you five minutesi do not know whywithout feeling wiser and happier i envy valencia for having seen so much of you of late  little thought poor lucia as she spoke those innocent words that within four yards of her crouched behind the wall his face and every limb writhing with mingled curiosity and rage was none other but her husband  he had given place to the devil and the devil for the superstitious and oldworld notion which attributes such frenzies to the devil has not yet been superseded by a better one had entered into him and concentrated all the evil habits and passions which he had indulged for years into one flaming hell within him  miserable man his torments were sevenfold and if he had sinned he was at least punished not merely by all which a husband has a right to feel in such a case or fancies that he has a right not merely by tortured vanity and selfconceit by the agony of seeing any man preferred to him which to a man of elsleys character was of itself unbearablenot merely by the loss of trust in one whom he hail once trusted utterly but over and above all and worst of all by the feeling of shame selfreproach selfhatred which haunts a jealous man and which ought to haunt him for few men lose the love of women who have once loved them save by their own folly or basenessby the recollection that he had traded on her trust that he had drugged his own conscience with the fancy that she must love him always let him do what he would and had neglected and insulted her affection because he fancied in his conceit that it was inalienable and with the loss of selfrespect came recklessness of it and drove him on as it has jealous men in all ages to meannesses unspeakable which have made them for centuries poor wretches the butts of worthless playwrights and the scorn of their fellowmen  elsley had wandered he hardly knew how or whither for his calling to mellot was the merest blindstumbling over rocks bruising himself against treetrunks to this wall he knew they must pass it he waited for them and had his reward blind with rage he hardly waited for the sound of their footsteps to die away before he had sprung into the road and hurried up in the opposite directionanywhere everywhere to escape from them and from self whipt by the furies he fled along the road and up the vale he cared not whither  and what were headley and valencia who of necessity had paired off together doing all the while they walked on silently side by side for ten minutes then frank said  i have been impertinent miss st just and i beg your pardon  no you have not said she quite hastily you were right too righthas it not been proved within the last five minutes my poor sister what can be done to mend mr vavasours temper i wish you could talk to him mr headley  he is beyond my art his age and his talents and hishis consciousness of them said frank using the mildest term he could find would prevent so insignificant a person as me having any influence but what i cannot do gods grace may  can it change a mans character mr headley it may make good men betterbut can it cure temper  major campbell must have told you that it can do anything  ah yes with men as wise and strong and noble as he is but with such a weak vain man  miss st just i know one who is neither wise nor strong nor noble but as weak and vain as any man in whom god has conqueredas he may conquer yet in mr vavasourall which makes man cling to life  what all asked she suspecting and not wrongly that he spoke of himself  all i suppose which it is good for them to have crushed there are feelings which last on in spite of all struggles to quench themi suppose because they ought to last because while they torture they still ennoble death will quench them or if not satisfy them or if not set them at rest somehow  death answered she in a startled tone  yes our friend major campbells friend death we have been seeing a good deal of him together lately and have come to the conclusion that he is the most useful pleasant and instructive of all friends  oh mr headley do not speak so are you in earnest  so much in earnest that i have resolved to go out as an army chaplain to see in the war somewhat more of my new friend  impossible mr headley it will kill youall that horrible fever and cholera  and what possible harm can it do me if it does kill me miss st just  mr headley this is madness iwe cannot allow you to throw away your life thusso young andand such prospects before you and there is nothing that my brother would not do for you were it only for your heroism at aberalva there is not one of the family who does not love and respect you and long to see all the world appreciating you as we do and your poor mother  i have told my mother all miss st just and she has said go it is your only hope she has other sons to comfort her let us say no more of it had i thought that you would have disapproved of it i would never have mentioned the thing  disapprove ofyour going to die you shall not and for me too for i guess allall is my fault  all is mine said he quietly who was fool enough to fancy that i could forget youconquer my love for and at these words his whole voice and manner changed in an instant into wildest passion i must speaknow and never morei love you still fool that i am would god i had never seen you no not that thank god for that to the last but would god i had died of that cholera that i had never come here conceited fool that i was fancying that it was possible after having onceno let me go go anywhere where i may burden you no more with my absurd dreamsyou who have had the same thing said to you and in finer words a hundred times by men who would not deign to speak to me and covering his face in his hands he strode on as if to escape  i never had the same thing said to me  never how often have fine gentlemen noblemen sworn that they were dying for you  they never have said to me what you have done  noi am clumsy i suppose  mr headley indeed you are unjust to yourselfunjust to me  ito you never i know you better than you know yourselfsee in you what no one else sees oh what fools they are who say that love is blind blind he sees souls in gods own light not as they have become but as they ought to becomecan becomeare already in the sight of him who made them  and what might i become asked she halffrightened by the new earnestness of his utterance  how can i tell something infinitely too high for me at least who even now am not worthy to kiss the dust off your feet  oh do not speak so little do you know no mr headley it is you who are too good for me too noble singleeyed selfsacrificing to endure my vanity and meanness for a day  madam do not speak thus give me no word which my folly can distort into a ray of hope unless you wish to drive me mad no it is impossible and were it possible what but ruin to my soul i should live for you and not for my work i should become a schemer ambitious intriguing in the vain hope of proving myself to the world worthy of you no let it be let the dead bury their dead and follow thou me  she made no answerwhat answer was there to make and he strode on by her side in silence for full ten minutes at last she was forced to speak  mr headley recollect that this conversation has gone too far for us to avoid coming to some definite understanding  then it shall miss st just then it shall once and for all formally and deliberately it shall end now supposei only say supposethat i could without failing in my own honour my duty to my calling make myself such a name among good men that poor parson though i be your family need be ashamed of nothing about me save my poverty tell me now and for ever could it be possible  he stopped she walked on silent in her turn  say no as a matter of course and end it said he bitterly  she drew a long breath as if heaving off a weight  i cannotdare not say it  it which of the two yes or no  she was silent  he stopped and spoke calmly and slowly say that again and tell me that i am not dreaming you the admired the worshipped the luxuriousand no blame to you that you are what you were borncould you endure a little parsonage the teaching village schoolchildren tending dirty old women and petty cares the whole year round  mr headley answered she slowly and calmly in her turn i could endure a cottagea prison i fancy at momentsto escape from this world of which i am tired which will soon be tired of me from women who envy me impute to me ambitions as base as their own from men who admirenot me for they do not know me and never willbut what in me i hate themwill give them pleasure i hate it all despise it all despise myself for it all every morning when i wake what does it do for me but rouse in me the very parts of my own character which are most despicable most tormenting if it goes on i feel i could become as frivolous as mean aye as wicked as the worst you do not knowyou do not know i have envied the nuns their convents i have envied selkirk his desert island i envy now the milkmaids there below anything to escape and be in earnest anything for some one to teach me to be of use yes this choleraand this warthough only only its coming shadow has passed over meand your words too cried she and stopped and hesitated as if afraid to tell too muchthey have wakened meto a new lifeat least to the dream of a new life  have you not major campbell said headley with a terrible effort of will  yesbut has he taught me he is dear and good and wise but he is too wise too great for me he plays with me as a lion might with a mouse he is like a grand angel far above in another planet who can pity and advise but who cannotwhat am i saying and she covered her face with her hand  she dropped her glove as she did so headley picked it up and gave it to her as he did so their hands met and their hands did not part again  you know that i love you valencia st just  too well too well  but you know too that you do not love me  who told you so what do you know what do i know only that i long for some one to make meto make me as good as you are and she burst into tears  valencia will you trust me  yes cried she looking up at him suddenly if you will not go to the war  nonono would you have me turn traitor and coward to god and now of all moments in my life  noble creature said she you will make me love you whether i wish or not  what was it after all by which frank headley won valencias love i cannot tell can you tell sir how you won the love of your wife as little as you can tell of that still greater miraclehow you have kept her love since she found out what manner of man you were  so they paced homeward hand in hand beside the shining ripples along the dinas shore the birches breathed fragrance on them the nighthawk churred softly round their path the stately mountains smiled above them in the moonlight and seemed to keep watch and ward over their love and to shut out the noisy world and the harsh babble and vain fashions of the town the summer lightning flickered to the westward but round them the rich soft night seemed full of loveas full of love as their own hearts were and like them brooding silently upon its joy at last the walk was over the kind moon sank low behind the hills and the darkness hid their blushes as they paced into the sleeping village and their hands parted unwillingly at last  when they came into the hall through the group of lounging gownsmen and tourists they found bowie arguing with mrs lewis in his dogmatic scotch way  so ye see madam theres no use defending the drunken loon anymore at all and here will my leddies have just walked their bonny legs off all through that carnal sin of drunkenness which is the curse of your welsh populaaation  and not quite unknown north of tweed either bowie said valencia laughing there now say no more about it we have had a delightful walk and nobody is the least tired dont say any more mrs lewis but tell them to get us some supper bowie so my lord has come in  this halfhour good  has he had any sport  sport aye troth five fish in the day thats a river indeed at bettws not a pawky wee burn like this aberglaslyn thing  only five fish said valencia in a frightened tone  fish my leddy not trouts i said i thought ye knew better than that by this time  oh salmon cried valencia relieved delightful ill go to him this moment  and upstairs to scoutbushs room she went  he was sitting in dressinggown and slippers sipping his claret and fondling his flybook the only one he ever studied con amore with a most complacent face she came in and stood demurely before him holding her broad hat in both hands before her knees like a schoolgirl her face halfhidden in the black curls scoutbush looked up and smiled affectionately as he caught the light of her eyes and the arch play of her lips  ah there you are at a pretty time of night how beautiful you look val i wish my wife may be half as pretty  valencia made him a prim curtsey  i am delighted to hear of my lords good sport he will choose to be in a good humour i suppose  good humour ça va sans dire three stone of fish in three hours  then his little sister is going to do a very foolish thing and wants his leave to do it which if he will grant she will let him do as many foolish things as he likes without scolding him as long as they both shall live  do it then i beg what is it do you want to go up snowdon with headley tomorrow to see the sun rise youll kill yourself  no said valencia very quietly i only want to marry him  marry him cried scoutbush starting up  dont try to look majestic my dear little brother for you are really not tall enough as it is you have only hooked all your flies into your dressinggown  scoutbush dashed himself down into his chair again  ill be shot if you shall  you may be shot just as surely whether i do or not said she softly and she knelt down before him and put her arms round him and laid her head upon his lap there you cant run away now so you must hear me quietly and you know it may not be often that we shall be together again thus and oh scoutbush brother if anything was to happen to youi only say ifin this horrid war you would not like to think that you had refused the last thing your little val asked for and that she was miserable and lonely at home  ill be shot if you shall was all the poor viscount could get out  yes miserable and lonely you gone away and mon saint père too and lucia she has her childrenand i am so wild and weaki must have some one to guide me and protect meindeed i must  why that was what i always said that was why i wanted you so to marry this season why did not you take chalkclere or halfadozen good matches who were dying for you and not this confounded black parson of all birds in the air  i did not take lord chalkclere for the very reason that i do take mr headley i want a husband who will guide me not one whom i must guide  guide said scoutbush bitterly with one of those little sparks of practical shrewdness which sometimes fell from him aye i see how it is these intriguing rascals of parsonsthey begin as father confessors like so many popish priests and one fine morning they blossom out into lovers and so they get all the pretty women and all the good fortunesthe sneaking ambitious lowbred  he is neither you are unjust scoutbush cried valencia looking up he is the very soul of honour he might be rich now and have had a fine living if he had not been too conscientious to let his uncle buy him one and that offended his uncle and he would allow him nothing and as for being lowbred he is a gentleman as you know and if his uncle be in business his mother is a lady and he will be well enough off one day  you seem to know a great deal about his affairs  he told me all months agobefore there was any dream of this and my dear she went on relapsing into her usual arch tone there is no fear but his uncle will be glad enough to patronise him again when he finds that he has married a viscounts sister  scoutbush laughed you scheming little irish rogue but i wont ive said it and i wont its enough to have one sister married to a poor poet without having another married to a poor parson oh what have i done that i should be bothered in this way isnt it bad enough to be a landlord and to have an estate and be responsible for a lot of people that will die of the cholera and have to vote in the house about a lot of things i dont understand or anybody else i believe but that over and above i must be the head of the family and answerable to all the world for whom my mad sisters many i wont i say  then i shall just go and marry without your leave im of age you know and my fortunes my own and then we shall come in as the runaway couples do in a play while you sit there in your dressinggown as the stern fatherwont you borrow a white wig for the occasion my lord and we shall fall down on our knees soand she put herself in the prettiest attitude in the worldand beg your blessingplease forgive us this time and well never do so any more and then you will turn your face away like the baron in the ballad    and brushed away the springing tear   he proudly strove to hide  et cetera et ceterafinish the scene for yourself with a bless ye my children bless ye  go along and marry the cat if you like you are mad and i am mad and all the worlds mad i think  there she said i knew that he would be a good boy at last and she sprang up threw her arms round his neck and to his great astonishment burst into the most violent fit of crying  good gracious valencia do be reasonable youll go into a fit or somebody will hear you you know how i hate a scene do be good theres a darling why didnt you tell me at first how much you wished for it and i would have said yes in a moment  because i didnt know myself cried she passionately there i will be good and love you better than all the world except one and if you let those horrid russians hurt you i will hate you as long as i live and be miserable all my life afterwards  why valencia do you know that sounds very like a bull  am i not a wild irish girl said she and hurried out leaving scoutbush to return to his flies  she bounded into lucias room there to pour out a bursting heartand stopped short  lucia was sitting on the bed her shawl and bonnet tossed upon the floor her head sunk on her bosom her arms sunk by her side  lucia what is it speak to me lucia  she pointed faintly to a letter on the floorvalencia caught it up lucia made a gesture as if to stop her  no you must not read it too dreadful  but valencia read it while lucia covered her face in her hands and uttered a long low shuddering moan of bitter agony  valencia read with flashing eyes and bursting brow it was a hideous letter the words of a man trying to supply the place of strength by virulence a hideous letter unfit to be written here  valencia valencia it is falsea mistakehe is dreaming you know it is false you will not leave me too  valencia dashed it on the ground clasped her sister in her arms and covered her head with kisses  my lucia my own sweet good sister base cowardly sobbed she in her rage while lucias agony began to find a vent in words and she moaned on  what have i done all that flower that horrid flower but who would have dreamedand major campbell too of all men upon earth valencia it is some horrid delusion of the devil why he was there all the whileand you too could he think that i should before his very face what must he fancy me oh it is a delusion of the devil and nothing else  he is a wretch i will take the letter to my brother he shall right you  ah no no never let me tear it to atomshide it it is all a mistake he did not mean it he will recollect himself tomorrow and come back  let him come back if he dare cried valencia in a tone which said i could kill him with my own hands  oh he will come back he cannot have the heart to leave his poor little lucia oh cruel cowardly not to have said one wordnot one word to explain allbut it was all my fault my wicked odious temper and after i had seen how vexed he was toooh elsley elsley come back only come back and i will beg your pardon on my knees anything scold me beat me if you will i deserve it all only come back and let me see your face and hear your voice instead of leaving me here all alone and the poor children too oh what shall i say to them tomorrow when they wake and find no father  valencias indignation had no words she could only sit on the bed with lucia in her arms looking defiance at all the world above that fair head which one moment dropped on her bosom and the next gazed up into her face in pitiful childlike pleading  oh if i but knew where he was gone if i could but find him one word one word would set all right it always did valencia always he was so kind so dear in a moment when i put away my naughty naughty temper and smiled in his face like a good wife wicked creature that i was and this is my punishment oh elsley one word one word i must find him if i went barefoot over the mountainsi must go i must  and she tried to rise but valencia held her down while she entreated piteously  i will go and see about finding him she said at last as her only resource promise me to be quiet here and i will  quiet yes quiet here and she threw herself upon her face on the floor  she looked up eagerly you will not tell scoutbush  why not  he is soso hasty he will kill him valencia he will kill him promise me not to tell him or i shall go mad and she sat up again pressing her hands upon her head and rocking from side to side  oh valencia if i dared only scream but keeping it in kills me it is like a sword through my brain now  let me call clara  no no not clara do not tell her i will be quiet indeed i will only come back soon soon for i am all alone alone and she threw herself down again upon her face  valencia went out certain as she was of her sisters innocence there was one terrible question in her heart which must be answered or her belief in all truth goodness religion would reel and rock to its very foundations and till she had an answer to that she could not sit still by lucia  she walked hurriedly with compressed lips but quivering limbs down stairs and into the sittingroom scoutbush was gone to bed campbell and mellot sat chatting still  where is my brother  gone to bed as some one else ought to be for it is past twelve is vavasour come in yet  no  very odd said claude i never saw him after i left you  he said certainly that he was going to find you said campbell  there is no need for speculating said valencia quietly my sister has a note from mr vavasour at penygwryd  penygwryd cried both men at once  yes major campbell i wish to show it to you  valencias tone and manner was significant enough to make claude mellot bid them both goodnight  when he had shut the door behind him valencia put the letter into the majors hand  he was too much absorbed in it to look up at her but if he had done so he would have been startled by the fearful capacity of passion which changed for the moment that gay queen whims into a terrible roxana as she stood leaning against the mantelpiece but drawn up to her full height her lips tight shut eyes which gazed through and through him in awful scrutiny holding her very breath while a nervous clutching of the little hand said if you have tampered with my sisters heart better for you that you were dead  he read it through once twice with livid face then clashed it on the floor  foolcurliarshe is as pure as gods sunlight  you need not tell me that said valencia through her closed teeth  foolfool and then in a moment his voice changed from indignation to the bitterest selfreproach  and fool i thrice fool who am i to rail on him oh god what have i done and he covered his face with his hands  what have you done literally shrieked valencia  nothing that you or man can blame miss st just can you dream that sinful as i am i could ever harbour a thought toward her of which i should be ashamed before the angels of god  he looked up as he spoke with an utter humility and an intense honesty which unnerved her at once  oh my saint père and she held out both her hands forgive me if only for a moment  i am not your saint père nor any ones i am a poor weak conceited miserable man who by his accursed impertinence has broken the heart of the being whom he loves best on earth  valencia started but ere she could ask for an explanation he rejoined wildly  how is she tell me only that this once has it killed her does she hate him  adores him more than ever oh major campbell it is too piteous too piteous  he covered his face with his hands shuddering thank god yes thank god so it should be let her love him to the last and win her martyrs crown now valencia st just sit down if but for five minutes and listen once for all to the last words perhaps you will ever hear me speak unless she wants you  no no tell me all saint père said valencia for i am walking in a dreama double dream as the new thought of headley and that walk came over her tell me all at once while i have wits left to comprehend  miss st just said he in a clear calm voice it is fit for her honour and for mine that you should know all the first day that i ever saw your sister i loved her as a man loves who can never cease to love or love a second time i was a raw awkward scotchman then and she used to laugh at me why not i kept my secret and determined to become a man at whom no one would wish to laugh i was in the companys service then you recollect her jesting once about the indian army and my commanding black people and saying that the line only was fit forsome girls jest  no i recollect nothing of it  i never forgot it i threw up all my prospects and went into the line whether i won honour there or not i need not tell you i came back to england years after not unworthy as i fancied to look your sister in the face as an equal i found her married  he paused a little and then went on in a quiet businesslike tone  good her choice was sure to be a worthy one and that was enough for me you need not doubt that i kept my secret then more sacredly than ever i returned to india and tried to die i dared not kill myself for i was a soldier and a christian and belonged to god and my queen the sikhs would not kill me do what i would to help them then i threw myself into science that i might stifle passion and i stifled it i fancied myself cured and i was cured and i returned to england again i loved your brother for her sake i loved you at first for her sake then for your own but i presumed upon my cure i accepted your brothers invitation i caught at the opportunity of seeing her again happyas i fancied and of proving to myself my own soundness i considered myself a sort of melchisedek neither young nor old without passions without purpose on eartha fakeer who had licence to do and to dare what others might not but i kept my secret proudly inviolate i do not believe at this moment she dreams thatdo you  she does not  thank god i was a most conceited fool puffed up with spiritual pride tempting god needlessly i went i saw her heaven is my witness that as far as passion goes my heart is as pure as yours but i found that i still cared more for her than for any being on earth and i found too the sort of man upon whomgod forgive me i must not talk of thati despised him hated him pretended to teach him his duty by behaving better to her than he didthe spiritual coxcomb that i was what business had i with it why not have left all to god and her good sense the devil tempted me today in the shape of an angel of courtesy and chivalry and here the end is come i must find that man miss st just if i travel the world in search of him i must ask his pardon frankly humbly for my impertinence perhaps so i may bring him back to her and not die with a curse on my head for having parted those whom god has joined and then to the old fightingtrade once morethe only one i believe i really understand and see whether a russian bullet will not fly straighter than a clumsy sikhs  valencia listened awestricken and all the more so because this was spoken in a calm halfabstracted voice without a note of feeling save where he alluded to his own mistakes when it was over she rose without a word and took both his hands in her own sobbing bitterly  you forgive me then all the misery which i have caused  do not talk so only forgive me having fancied for one moment that you were anything but what you are an angel out of heaven  campbell hung down his head  angel truly azraël the angel of death then go to her nowgo and leave a humbled penitent man alone with god  oh my saint père cried she bursting into tears this is too wretchedall a horrid dreamand when toowhen i had been counting on telling you something so differenti cannot now i have not the heart  what more misery  oh no no no you will know all tomorrow ask scoutbush  i shall be gone in search of that man long before scoutbush is awake  impossible you do not know whither he is gone  if i employ every detective in bow street i will find him  wait only wait till the post comes in tomorrow he will surely write if not to herwretch that he isat least to some of us  if he be alive no i must go up to penygwryd where he was last seen and find out what i can  they will be all in bed at this hour of the night and ifif anything has happened it will be over by now added she with a shudder  god forgive me it will indeed but he may writeperhaps to me he is no coward i believe and he may send me a challenge yes i will wait for the post  shall you accept it if he does  major campbell smiled sadly  no miss st just you may set your mind at rest upon that point i have done quite enough harm already to your family now goodbye i will wait for the post tomorrow do you go to your sister  valencia went utterly bewildered she had forgotten frank but frank had not forgotten her he had hurried to his room lay till morning sleepless with delight and pouring out his pure spirit in thanks for this great and unexpected blessing a new life had begun for him even in the jaws of death he would still go to the east it seemed easy to him to go there in search of a grave how much more now when he felt so full of magic life that fever cholera the chances of war could not harm him after this proof of gods love how could he doubt how fear  little he thought that three doors off from him valencia was sitting up the whole night through vainly trying to quiet lucia who refused to undress and paced up and down her room hour after hour in wild misery which i have no skill to detail     chapter xxi  natures melodrama   what then had become of elsley and whence had he written the fatal letter he had hurried up the high road for half an hour and more till the valley on the left sloped upward more rapidly in dark dreary bogs the moonlight shining on their runnels while the mountain on his right sloped downwards more rapidly in dark dreary down strewn with rocks which stood out black against the sky he was nearing the head of the watershed soon he saw slate roofs glittering in the moonlight and found himself at the little inn of penygwryd at the meeting of the three great valleys the central heart of the mountains  and a genial jovial little heart it is and an honest kindly little heart too with warm lifeblood within so it looked that night with every window red with comfortable light and a long stream of glare pouring across the road from the open door gilding the firtree tops in front but its geniality only made him shudder he had been there more than once and knew the place and the people and knew too that of all people in the world they were the least like him he hurried past the doorway and caught one glimpse of the bright kitchen a sudden thought struck him he would go in and write his letter there but not yethe could not go in yet for through the open door came some sweet welsh air so sweet that even he paused to listen men were singing in three parts in that rich metallic temper of voice and that perfect time and tune which is the one gift still left to that strange cymry race worn out with the long burden of so many thousand years he knew the air it was the rising of the lark heavens what a bitter contrast to his own thoughts but he stood rooted as if spellbound to hear it to the end the larks upward flight was over and elsley heard him come quivering down from heavens gate fluttering sinking trilling selfcomplacently springing aloft in one bar only to sink lower in the next and call more softly to his brooding mate below till worn out with his ecstasy he murmured one last sigh of joy and sank into the nest the picture flashed through elsleys brain as swiftly as the notes did through his ears he breathed more freely when it vanished with the sounds he strode hastily in and down the little passage to the kitchen  it was a low room ceiled with dark beams from which hung bacon and fishingrods harness and drying stockings and all the miscellanea of a fishing inn kept by a farmer and beneath it the usual happy hearty honest group there was harry owen bland and stalwart his baby in his arms smiling upon the world in general old mrs pritchard bending over the fire putting the last touch to one of those miraculous soufflets compact of clouds and nectar which transport alike palate and fancy at the first mouthful from snowdon to belgrave square a sturdy fairhaired saxon gourbannelig sat with his back to the door and two of the beautiful children on his knee their long locks flowing over the elbows of his shooting jacket as with both arms round them he made punch for them with his handkerchief and his fingers and chattered to them in english while they chattered in welsh by him sat another englishman to whom the three tuneful snowdon guides their musicscore upon their knees sat listening approvingly as he rolled out with voice as of a jolly blackbird or jollier monk of old the good old wessex song    my dog he has his masters nose   to smell a knave through silken hose   if friends or honest men go by   welcome quoth my dog and i    of foreign tongues let scholars brag   with fifteen names for a puddingbag   two tongues i know neer told a lie   and their wearers be my dog and i  that ought to be harrys song and the collys too eh said he pointing to the dear old dog who sat with his head on owens kneeeh my men heres a health to the honest man and his dog  and all laughed and drank while elsleys dark face looked in at the doorway and half turned to escape handsome ladylike mrs owen bustling out of the kitchen with a suppertray ran full against him and uttered a welsh scream  show me a room and bring me a pen and paper said he and then started in his turn as all had started at him for the two englishmen looked round and behold to his disgust the singer was none other than naylor the actor of punch was wynd  to have found his bêtes noires even here and at such a moment and what was worse to hear mrs owen saywe have no room sir unless these gentlemen  of course said wynd jumping up a child under each arm mr vavasour we shall be most happy to have your companyfor a week if you will  ten minutes solitude is all i ask sir if i am not intruding too far  two hours if you like well stay here mrs owenthe thicker the merrier but elsley had vanished into a chamber bestrewn with plaids pipes hobnail boots fishingtackle mathematical books scraps of ore and the wild confusion of a gownsmans den  the party is taken ill with a poem said wynd  naylor stuck out his heavy underlip and glanced sidelong at his friend  with something worse ned that mans eye and voice had something uncanny in them mellot said he would go crazed some day and be hanged if i dont think he is so now  another five minutes and elsley rang the bell violently for hot brandyandwater  mrs owen came back looking a little startled a letter in her hand  the gentleman had drunk the liquor off at one draught and ran out of the house like a wild man harry owen must go down to beddgelert instantly with the letter and there was five shillings to pay for all  harry owen rises like a strong and patient beast of burden ready for any amount of walking at any hour in the twentyfour he has been up snowdon once today already he is going up again at twelve tonight with a german who wants to see the sun rise he deputes that office to john roberts and strides out  which way did the gentleman go mrs owen asks naylor  capel curig road  naylor whispers to wynd who sets the two little girls on the table and hurries out with him they look up the road and see no one run a couple of hundred yards where they catch a sight of the next turn clear in the moonlight there is no one on the road  run to the bridge wynd whispers naylor he may have thrown himself over  tally ho whispers wynd in return laying his hand on naylors arm and pointing to the left of the road  a hundred yards from them over the boggy upland among scattered boulders a dark figure is moving now he stops short gesticulating turns right and left irresolutely at last he hurries on and upward he is running springing from stone to stone  there is but one thing wynd after him or hell drown himself in llyn cwn fynnon  no hes striking to the right can he be going up the glyder  well see that in five minutes all in the days work my boy i could go up mont blanc with such a dinner in me  the two gallant men run in struggle into their wet boots again and provisioned with meat and bread whiskey tobacco and plaids are away upon elsleys tracks having left mrs owen disconsolate by their announcement that a sudden fancy to sleep on the glyder has seized them nothing more will they tell her or any one being gentlemen however much slang they may talk in private  elsley left the door of penygwryd careless whither he went if he went only far enough  in front of him rose the glyder vawr its head shrouded in soft mist through which the moonlight gleamed upon the chequered quarries of that enormous desolation the dead bones of the eldestborn of time a wild longing seized him he would escape up thither up into those clouds up anywhere to be alonealone with his miserable self that was dreadful enough but less dreadful than having a companionay even a stone by himwhich could remind him of the scene which he had left even remind him that there was another human being on earth beside himself yesto put that cliff between him and all the world away he plunged from the high road splashing over boggy uplands scrambling among scattered boulders across a stony torrent bed and then across another and anotherwhen would he reach that dark marbled wall which rose into the infinite blanklooking within a stonethrow of him and yet no nearer after he had walked a mile  he reached it at last and rushed up the talus of boulders springing from stone to stone till his breath failed him and he was forced to settle into a less frantic pace but upward he would go and upward he went with a strength which he never had felt before strong how should he not be strong while every vein felt filled with molten lead while some unseen power seemed not so much to attract him upwards as to drive him by magical repulsion from all that he had left below  so upward and upward ever driven on by the terrible gadfly like io of old he went stumbling upwards along torrent beds of slippery slate writhing himself upward through crannies where the waterfall splashed cold upon his chest and face yet could not cool the inward fire climbing hand and knee up cliffs of sharpedged rock striding over downs where huge rocks lay crouched in the grass like fossil monsters of some ancient world and seemed to stare at him with still and angry brows upward still to black terraces of lava standing out hard and black against the grey cloud gleaming like iron in the moonlight stair above stair like those over which vathek and the princess climbed up to the halls of eblis over their crumbling steps up through their cracks and crannies out upon a dreary slope of broken stones and then before he dives upward into the cloud ten yards above his headone breathless look back upon the world  the horizontal curtain of mist gauzy below fringed with white tufts and streamers deepening above into the blackness of utter night below it a long gulf of soft yellow haze in which as in a bath of gold lie delicate bars of faroff western cloud and the faint glimmer of the western sea above long knotted spurs of hill in deepest shades like a bunch of purple grapes flecked here and there from behind with gleams of golden light and beneath them again the dark woods sleeping over gwynnant and their dark double sleeping in the bright lake below  on the right hand snowdon rises vast sheets of utter blacknessvast sheets of shining light he can see every crag which juts from the green walls of galtywennalt and far past it into the great valley of cwn dyli and then the red peak now as black as night shuts out the world with its huge misttopped cone but on the left hand all is deepest shade from the highest sawedges where moel meirch cuts the golden sky down to the very depth of the abyss all is lustrous darkness sooty and yet golden still let the darkness lie upon it for ever hidden be those woods where she stood an hour ago hidden that road down which even now they may be pacing home togethercurse the thought he covers his face in his hands and shudders in every limb  he lifts his hands from his eyes at lastwhat has befallen  before the golden haze a white veil is falling fast sea mountain lake are vanishing fading as in a dream soon he can see nothing but the twinkle of a light in penygwryd a thousand feet below happy children are nestling there in innocent sleep jovial voices are chatting round the fire what has he to do with youth and health and joy lower lower ye cloudsshut out that insolent and intruding spark till nothing be seen but the silver sheet of cwm fynnon and the silver zigzag lines which wander into it among black morass while down the mountain side go softly sliding troops of white mistangels softly they slide swift and yet motionless as if by some inner will which needs no force of limbs gliding gently round the crags diving gently off into the abyss their long white robes trailing about their feet in upwardfloating folds let us go hence they seem to whisper to the godforsaken as legends say they whispered when they left their doomed shrine in old jerusalem let the white fringe fall between him and the last of that fair troop let the grey curtain follow the black pall above descend till he is alone in darkness that may be felt and in the shadow of death  now he is safe at last hidden from all living thingshidden it may be from god for at least god is hidden from him he has desired to be alone and he is alone the centre of the universe if universe there be all created things suns and planets seem to revolve round him and he a point of darkness not of light he seems to float selfpoised in the centre of the boundless nothing upon an ellbroad slab of stone and yet not even on that for the very ground on which he stands he does not feel he does not feel the mist which wets his cheek the blood which throbs within his veins he only is and there is none beside  horrible thought permitted but to few and to themthank godbut rarely for two minutes of that absolute selfisolation would bring madness if indeed it be not the very essence of madness itself  there he stood he knew not how long without motion without thought without even rage or hate nowin one blank paralysis of his whole nature conscious only of self and of a dull inward fire as if his soul were a dark vault lighted with lurid smoke                                       what was that he started shudderedas well he might had he seen heaven opened or another place so momentary was the vision that he scarce knew what he saw there it was again lasting but for a moment but long enough to let him see the whole western heaven transfigured into one sheet of pale blue gauze and before it snowdon towering black as ink with every saw and crest cut out hard and terrible against the lightningglareand then the blank of darkness  again the awful black giant towering high in air before the gates of that blue abyss of flame but a black crown of cloud has settled upon his head and out of it the lightning sparks leap to and fro ringing his brows with a coronet of fire  another moment and the roar of that great battle between earth and heaven crashed full on elsleys ears  he heard it leap from snowdon sharp and rattling across the gulf toward him till it crashed full upon the glyder overhead and rolled and flapped from crag to crag and died away along the dreary downs no there it boomed out again thundering full against siabod on the left and siabod tossed it on to moel meirch who answered from all her clefts and peaks with a long confused battlegrowl and then tossed it across to aran and aran with one dull bluff report from her flat cliff to nearer lliwedd till worn out with the long bufferings of that giant ring it sank and died on gwynnant far belowbut ere it died another and another thundercrash burst sharper and nearer every time to hurry round the hills after the one which roared before it  another minute and the blue glare filled the sky once more but no black titan towered before it now the storm had leapt llanberris pass and all around elsley was one howling chaos of cloud and rain and blinding flame he turned and fled again  by the sensation of his feet he knew that he was going up hill and if he but went upward he cared not whither he went the rain gushed through where the lightning pierced the cloud in drops like musket balls he was drenched to the skin in a moment dazzled and giddy from the flashes stunned by the everlasting roar peal overrushing peal echo outshooting echo till rocks and air quivered alike beneath the continuous battlecannonadewhat matter what fitter guide for such a path as mine than the blue lightning flashes  poor wretch he had gone out of his way for many a year to give himself up a willing captive to the melodramatic view of nature and had let sights and sounds not principles and duties mould his feelings for him and now in his utter need and utter weakness he had met her in a mood which was too awful for such as he was to resist the nemesis had come and swept away helplessly without faith and hope by those outward impressions of things on which he had feasted his soul so long he was the puppet of his own eyes and ears the slave of glare and noise  breathless but still untired he toiled up a steep incline where he could feel beneath him neither moss nor herb now and then his feet brushed through a soft tuft of parsley fern but soon even that sign of vegetation ceased his feet only rasped over rough bare rock and he was alone in a desert of stone  what was that sudden apparition above him seen for a moment dim and gigantic through the mist hid the next in darkness the next flash showed him a line of obelisks like giants crouching side by side staring down on him from the clouds another five minutes he was at their feet and past them to see above them again another line of awful watchers through the storms and rains of many a thousand years waiting grim and silent like those doomed senators in the capitol of rome till their own turn should come and the last lightning stroke hurl them too down to lie for ever by their fallen brothers whose mighty bones bestrewed the screes below  he groped his way between them saw some fifty yards beyond a higher peak gained it by fierce struggles and many falls saw another beyond that and rushing down and up two slopes of moss reached a region where the upright lavaledges had been split asunder into chasms crushed together again into caves toppled over each other hurled up into spires in such chaotic confusion that progress seemed impossible  a flash of lightning revealed a lofty cairn above his head there was yet then a higher point he would reach it if he broke every limb in the attempt and madly he hurried on feeling his way from ledge to ledge squeezing himself through crannies crawling on hands and knees along the sharp chines of the rocks till he reached the foot of the cairn climbed it and threw himself at full length on the summit of the glyder vawr  an awful place it always is and elsley saw it at an awful time as the glare unveiled below him a sea of rockwaves all sharp on edge pointing toward him on every side or rather one wavecrest of a sea for twenty yards beyond all sloped away into the abysmal dark  terrible were those rocks below and ten times more terrible as seen through the lurid glow of his distempered brain all the weird peaks and slabs seemed pointing up at him sharptoothed jaws gaped upward tongues hissed upwardarms pointed upwardhounds leaped upward monstrous snakeheads peered upward out of cracks and caves did he not see them move writhe or was it the evershifting light of the flashes did he not hear them howl yell at him or was it but the wind tortured in their labyrinthine caverns  the next moment and all was dark again but the images which had been called up remained and fastened on his brain and grew there and when in the light of the next flash the scene returned he could see the red lips of the phantom hounds the bright eyes of the phantom snakes the tongues wagged in mockery the hands brandished great stones to hurl at him the mountaintop was instinct with fiendish lifea very blocksberg of all hideous shapes and sins  and yet he did not shrink horrible it was he was going mad before it and yet he took a strange and fierce delight in making it more horrible in maddening himself yet more and more in clothing those fantastic stones with every fancy which could inspire another man with dread but he had no dread perfect rage like perfect love casts out fear he rejoiced in his own misery in his own danger his life hung on a thread any instant might hurl him from that cairn a blackened corpse  what better end let it come he was prometheus on the peak of caucasus hurling defiance at the unjust jove his hopes his love his very honourcurse itruined let the lightning stroke come he were a coward to shrink from it let him face the worst unprotected bareheaded naked and do battle himself and nothing but himself against the universe and as men at such moments will do in the mad desire to free the selftortured spirit from some unseen and choking bond he began wildly tearing off his clothes  but merciful nature brought relief and stopped him in his mad efforts or he had been a frozen corpse long ere the dawn his hands stiff with cold refused to obey him as he delayed he was saved after the paroxysm came the collapse he sank upon the top of the cairn half senseless he felt himself falling over its edge and the animal instinct of selfpreservation unconsciously to him made him slide down gently till he sank into a crack between two rocks sheltered somewhat as it befell happily from the lashing of the rain  another minute and he slept a dreamless sleep  but there are two men upon that mountain whom neither rock nor rain storm nor thunder have conquered because they are simply brave honest men and who are perhaps far more poetic characters at this moment than elsley vavasour or any dozen of mere versewriters because they are hazarding their lives on an errand of mercy and all the while have so little notion that they are hazarding their lives or doing anything dangerous or heroic that instead of being touched for a moment by natures melodrama they are jesting at each others troubles greeting each interval of darkness with mock shouts of misery and despair likening the crags to various fogies of their acquaintance male and female and only pulling the cutty pipes out of their mouths to chant snatches of jovial songs they are wynd and naylor the two cambridge boatingmen in bedrabbled flannel trousers and shootingjackets pocketful of water who are both fully agreed that hunting a mad poet over the mountains in a thunderstorm is on the whole the jolliest lark they ever had in their lives  he must have gone up here somewhere i saw the poor beggar against the sky as plain as i see youwhich i dont for darkness cut the speech short  where be you william says the keeper  here i be sir says the beater with my eels above my ed  wery well william when you get your ed above your eels gae on  but im stuck fast between two stones hang the stones and naylor bursts into an old seventeenth century ditty of the days of threeman glees    they stoans they stoans they stoans they stoans   they stoans that built george riddlers oven   o they was fetched from blakeney quarr   and george he was a jolly old man   and his head did grow above his har    one thing in george riddler i must commend   and i hold it for a valiant thing   with any three brothers in gloucestershire   he swore that his three sons should sing    there was dick the tribble and tom the mane   let every man sing in his own place   and william he was the eldest brother   and therefore he should sing the base  im down again this is my thirteenth fall  so am i i shall just lie and light a pipe  come on now and look round the lee side of this crag we shall find him bundled up under the lee of one of them  he dont know lee from windward i dare say hell soon find out the difference by his skinif its half as wet at least as mine is  ill tell you what naylor if the poor fellow has crossed the ridge and tried to go down on the twll du hes a dead man by this time  hell have funked it when he comes to the edge and sees nothing but mist below but if he has wandered on to the cliffs above trifaen hes a dead man then at all events get out of the way of that flash a close shave that i believe my whiskers are singed  pon my honour wynd we ought to be saying our prayers rather than joking in this way  we may do both and be none the worse as for coming to grief old boy were on a good errand i suppose and the devil himself cant harm us still shame to him whos ashamed of saying his prayers as arnold used to say  and all the while these two brave lads have been thrusting their lanthorn into every crack and cranny and beating round every crag carefully and cunningly till long past two in the morning  heres the ordnance cairn at last andhere am i astride of a carvingknife i think come and help me off or i shall be split to the chin  im coming whats this soft under my feet whooooop run him to earth at last  and diving down into a crack wynd drags out by the collar the unconscious elsley  what a swab like a piece of wet blottingpaper lucky hes not made of salt  hes dead says naylor  not a bit i can feel his heart theres life in the old dog yet  and they begin under the lee of a rock chafing him wrapping him in their plaids and pouring whiskey down his throat  it was some time before vavasour recovered his consciousness the first use which he made of it was to bid his preservers leave him querulously at first and then fiercely when he found out who they were  leave me i say cannot i be alone if i choose what right have you to dog me in this way  my dear sir we have as much right here as any one else and if we find a man dying here of cold and fatigue  what business of yours if i choose to die  there is no harm in your dying sir says naylor the harm is in our letting you die i assure you it is entirely to satisfy our own consciences we are troubling you thus and he begins pressing him to take food  no sir nothing from you you have shown me impertinence enough in the last few weeks without pressing on me benefits for which i do not wish let me go if you will not leave me i shall leave you  and he tried to rise but stiffened with cold sank back again upon the rock  in vain they tried to reason with him begged his pardon for all past jests he made effort after effort to get up and at last his limbs regaining strength by the fierceness of his passion supported him and he struggled onward toward the northern slope of the mountain  you must not go down till it is light it is as much as your life is worth  i am going to bangor sir and go i will  i tell you there is fifteen hundred feet of slippery screes below you  as steep as a houseroof and with every tile on it loose you will roll from top to bottom before you have gone a hundred yards  what care i let me go i say curse you sir do you mean to use force  i do said wynd quietly as he took him round arms and body and set him down on the rock like a child  you have assaulted me sir the law shall avenge this insult if there be law in england  i know nothing about law but i suppose it will justify me in saving any mans life who is rushing to certain death  look here sir said naylor go down if you will when it grows light but from this place you do not stir yet whatever you may think of our conduct tonight you will thank us for it tomorrow morning when you see where you are  the unhappy man stamped with rage the red glare of the lanthorn showed him his two powerful warders standing right and left he felt that there was no escape from them but in darkness and suddenly he dashed at the lanthorn and tried to tear it out of wynds hands  steady sir said wynd springing back and parrying his outstretched hand if you wish us to consider you in your senses you will be quiet  and if you dont choose to appear sane said naylor you must not be surprised if we treat you as men are treated whoyou understand me  elsley was silent awhile his rage finding itself impotent subsided into dark cunning really gentlemen he said at length i believe you are right i have been very foolish and you very kind but you would excuse my absurdities if you knew their provocation  my dear sir said naylor we are bound to believe that you have good cause enough for what you are doing we have no wish to interfere impertinently only wait till daylight and wrap yourself in one of our plaids as the only possible method of carrying out your own intentions for dead men cant go to bangor whithersoever else they may go  you really are too kind but i believe i must accept your offer under penalty of being called mad and elsley laughed a hollow laugh for he was by no means sure that he was not mad he took the proffered wrapper lay down and seemed to sleep  wynd and naylor congratulating themselves on his better mind lay down also beneath the other plaid intending to watch him but worn out with fatigue they were both fast asleep ere ten minutes had passed  elsley had determined to keep himself awake at all risks and he paid a bitter penalty for so doing for now that the fury had passed away his brain began to work freely again and inflicted torture so exquisite that he looked back with regret on the unreasoning madness of last night as a less fearful hell than that of thought of deliberate acute recollections suspicions trains of argument which he tried to thrust from him and yet could not who has not known in the still sleepless hours of night how dark thoughts will possess the mind with terrors which seem logical irrefragable inevitable  so it was then with the wretched elsley within his mind a whole train of devils advocates seemed arguing with triumphant subtlety the certainty of lucias treason and justifying to him his rage his hatred his flight his desertion of his own childrenif indeed so far had the devil led him astray they were his own at last he could bear it no longer he would escape to bangor and then to london cross to france to italy and there bury himself amid the forests of the apennines or the sunny glens of calabria and for a moment the vision of a poets life in that glorious land brightened his dark imagination yes he would escape thither and be at peace and if the world heard of him again it should be in such a thundervoice as those with which shelley and byron from their southern seclusion had shaken the ungrateful motherland which cast them out he would escape and now was the time to do it for the rain had long since ceased the dawn was approaching fast the cloud was thinning from black to pearly grey now was his timewere it not for those two men to be kept guarded stopped by them or by any man shameful intolerable he had fled hither to be free and even here he found himself a prisoner true they had promised to let him go if he waited till daylight but perhaps they were deceiving him as he was deceiving themwhy not they thought him mad it was a ruse a stratagem to keep him quiet awhile and then bring him backrestore him to his afflicted friends his friends truly he would be too cunning for them yet and even if they meant to let him go would he accept liberty from them or any man no he was free he had a right to go and go he would that moment  he raised himself cautiously the lanthorn had burned to the socket and he could not see the men though they were not four yards off but by their regular and heavy breathing he could tell that they both slept soundly he slipped from under the plaid drew off his shoes for fear of noise among the rocks and rose what if he did make a noise what if they woke chased him brought him back by force curse the thought and gliding close to them he listened again to their heavy breathing  how could he prevent their following him  a horrible nameless temptation came over him every vein in his body throbbed fire his brain seemed to swell to bursting and ere he was aware he found himself feeling about in the darkness for a loose stone  he could not find one thank god that he could not find one but after that dreadful thought had once crossed his mind he must flee from that place ere the brand of cain be on his brow  with a cunning and activity utterly new to him he glided away like a snake downward over crags and boulders he knew not how long or how far all he knew was that he was going down down down into a dim abyss there was just light enough to discern the upper surface of a rock within arms length beyond that all was blank he seemed to be hours descending to be going down miles after miles and still he reached no level spot the mountainside was too steep for him to stand upright except at moments it seemed one uniform quarry of smooth broken slate slipping down for ever beneath his feetwhither he grew giddy and more giddy and a horrible fantastic notion seized him that he had lost his way that somehow the precipice had no bottom no end at all that he was going down some infinite abyss into the very depths of the earth and the molten roots of the mountains never to reascend he stopped trembling only to slide down again terrified he tried to struggle upward but the shale gave way beneath his feet and go he must  what was that noise above his head a falling stone were his enemies in pursuit down to the depth of hell rather than that they should take him he drove his heels into the slippery shale and rushed forward blindly springing slipping falling rolling till he stopped breathless on a jutting slab and lo below him through the thin pearly veil of cloud a dim world of dark cliffs blue lakes grey mountains with their dark heads wrapped in cloud and the straight vale of nant francon magnified in mist till it seemed to stretch for hundreds of leagues towards the rosy northeast dawning and the shining sea  with a wild shout he hurried onward in five minutes he was clear of the cloud he reached the foot of that enormous slope and hurried over rocky ways till he stopped at the top of a precipice full six hundred feet above the lonely tarn of idwal  never mind he knew where he was now he knew that there was a passage somewhere for he had once seen one from below he found it and almost ran along the boggy shore of idwal looking back every now and then at the black wall of the twll du in dread lest he should see two moving specks in hot pursuit  and now he had gained the shore of ogwen and the broad coachroad and down it he strode running at times past the roaring cataract past the enormous cliffs of the carnedds past tinymaes where nothing was stirring but a barking dog on through the sleeping streets of bethesda past the black stairs of the penrhyn quarry the huge clicking antheap was silent now save for the roar of ogwen as he swirled and bubbled down rich coffeebrown from last nights rain  on past rich woods past trim cottages gardens gay with flowers past rhododendron shrubberies broad fields of golden stubble sweet clover and grey swedes with ogwen making music far below the sun is up at last and colonel pennants grim slate castle towering above black woods glitters metallic in its rays like chaucers house of fame he stops to look back once far up the vale eight miles away beneath a roof of cloud the pass of nant francon gapes high in air between the great jaws of the carnedd and the glyder its cliffs marked with the upright white line of the waterfall he is clear of the mountains clear of that cursed place and all its cursed thoughts on past llandegai and all its roseclad cottages past yellow quarrymen walking out to their work who stare as they pass at his haggard face drenched clothes and streaming hair he does not see them one fixed thought is in his mind and that is the railway station at bangor  he is striding through bangor streets now beside the summer sea from which fresh scents of shoreweed greet him he had rather smell the smoke and gas of the strand  the station is shut he looks at the bill outside there is no train for full two hours and he throws himself worn out with fatigue upon the doorstep  now a new terror seizes him has he money enough to reach london has he his purse at all too dreadful to find himself stopped short on the very brink of deliverance a cold perspiration breaks from his forehead as he feels in every pocket yes his purse is there but he turns sick as he opens it and dare hardly look hurrah five pounds sixeight that will take him as far as paris he can walk beg the rest of the way if need be  what will he do now wander over the town and gaze vacantly at one little object and another about the house fronts one thing he will not look at and that is the bright summer sea all golden in the sun rays flecked with gay white sails from all which is bright and calm and cheerful his soul shrinks as from an impertinence he longs for the lurid gaslight of london and the roar of the strand and the everlasting stream of faces among whom he may wander free sure that no one will recognise him the disgraced the desperate  the weary hours roll on too tired to stand longer he sits down on the shafts of a cart and tries not to think it is not difficult body and mind are alike worn out and his brain seems filled with uniform dull mist  a shopdoor opens in front of him a boy comes out he sees bottles inside and shelves the look of which he knows too well  the bottleboy whistling begins to take the shutters down how often in whitbury of old had elsley done the same half amused he watched the lad and wondered how he spent his evenings and what works he read and whether he ever thought of writing poetry  and as he watched all his past life rose up before him ever since he served out medicines fifteen years agohis wild aspirations heavy labours struggles plans brief triumphs long disappointments and here was what it had all come toa failurea miserable shameful failure not that he thought of it with repentance with a single wish that he had done otherwise but only with disappointed rage yes he said bitterly to himself    we poets in our youth begin in gladness   but after come despondency and madness  this is the way of the world with all who have nobler feelings in them than will fit into its cold rules curse the world what on earth had i to do with mixing myself up in it and marrying a fine lady fool that i was i might have known from the first that she could not understand me that she would go back to her own let her go i will forget her and the world and everythingand i know how  and springing up he walked across to the druggists shop  years before elsley had tried opium and found unhappily for him that it fed his fancy without inflicting those tortures of indigestion which keep many happily for them from its magic snare he had tried it more than once of late but lucia had had a hint of the fact from thurnall and in just terror had exacted from him a solemn promise never to touch opium again elsley was a man of honour and the promise had been kept but nowi promised her and therefore i will break my promise she has broken hers and i am free  and he went in and bought his opium he took a little on the spot to allay the cravings of hunger he reserved a full dose for the railwaycarriage it would bridge over the weary gulf of time which lay between him and town  he took his secondclass place at last not without stares and whispers from those round at the wild figure which was starting for london without bag or baggage but as the clerks agreed if he was running away from his creditors it was a shame to stop him if he was running from the police they would have the more sport the longer the run at least it was no business of theirs  there was one thing more to do and he did it he wrote to campbell a short note  if as i suppose you expect from me the satisfaction of a gentleman you will find me at  adelphi i am not escaping from you but from the whole world if by shooting me you can quicken my escape you will do me the first and last favour which i am likely to ask from you  he posted his letter settled himself in a corner of the carriage and took his second dose of opium from that moment he recollected little more a confused whirl of hedges and woods rattling stations screaming and flashing trains great red towns white chalk cuttings while the everlasting roar and rattle of the carriages shaped themselves in his brain into a hundred snatches of old tunes all full of a strange merriment as if mocking at his misery striving to keep him awake and conscious of who and what he was he closed his eyes and shut out the hateful garish world but that sound he could not shut out too tired to sleep too tired even to think he could do nothing but submit to the ridiculous torment watching in spite of himself every note as one jigtune after another was fiddled by all the imps close to his ear mile after mile and county after county for all that weary day which seemed full seven years long  at euston square the porter called him several times ere he could rouse him he could hear nothing for awhile but that same imps melody even though it had stopped at last he got out staring round him shook himself awake by one strong effort and hurried away not knowing whither he went  wrapt up in self he wandered on till dark slept on a doorstep and awoke not knowing at first where he was gradually all the horror came back to him and with the horror the craving for opium wherewith to forget it  he looked round to see his whereabouts surely this must be golden square a sudden thought struck him he went to a chemists shop bought a fresh supply of his poison and taking only enough to allay the cravings of his stomach hurried tottering in the direction of drury lane     chapter xxii  fond yet not foolish   next morning only claude and campbell made their appearance at breakfast  frank came in found that valencia was not down and too excited to eat went out to walk till she should appear neither did lord scoutbush come where was he  ignorant of the whole matter he had started at four oclock to fish in the traeth mawr half for fishings sake half as he confessed to gain time for his puzzled brains before those explanations with frank headley of which he stood in mortal fear  mellot and campbell sat down together to breakfast but in silence claude saw that something had gone very wrong campbell ate nothing and looked nervously out of the window every now and then  at last bowie entered with the letters and a message there were two gentlemen from penygwryd must speak with mr mellot immediately  he went out and found wynd and naylor what they told him we know already he returned instantly and met campbell leaving the room  i have news of vavasour whispered he i have a letter from him bowie order me a car instantly for bangor i am off to london claude you and bowie will take care of my things and send them after me  major cawmill has only to command said bowie and vanished down the stairs  now claude quick read that and counsel me i ought to ask scoutbushs opinion but the poor dear fellow is out you see  claude read the note written at bangor  fight him i will not i detest the notion a soldier should never fight a duel his life is the queens and not his own and yet if the honour of the family has been compromised by my folly i must pay the penalty if scoutbush thinks it proper  so said campbell who in the oversensitiveness of his conscience had actually worked himself round during the past night into this new fancy as a chivalrous act of utter selfabasement the proud selfpossession of the man was gone and nothing but selfdistrust and shame remained  in the name of all wit and wisdom what is the meaning of all this  you do not know then what passed last night  i i can only guess that vavasour has had one of his rages  then you must know said campbell with an effort for you must explain all to scoutbush when he returns and i know no one more fit for the office and he briefly told him the story  mellot was much affected the wretched ape campbell your first thought was the true one you must not fight that cur after all its a farce you wont fire at him and he cant hit youso leave ill alone beside for scoutbushs sake her sake every ones sake the thing must be hushed up if the fellow chooses to duck under into the london mire let him lie there and forget him  no claude his pardon i must beg ere i go out to the war or i shall die with a sin upon my soul  my dear noble creature if you must go i go with you i must see fair play between you and that madman and give him a piece of my mind too while i am about it he is in my power or if not quite that i know one in whose power he is and to reason he shall be brought  no you must stay here i cannot trust scoutbushs head and these poor dear souls will have no one to look to but you i can trust you with them i know me you will perhaps never see again  you can trust me said the affectionate little painter the tears starting to his eyes as he wrung campbells hand  mind one thing if that vavasour shows his teeth there is a spell will turn him to stone use it  heaven forbid let him show his teeth it is i who am in the wrong why should i make him more my enemy than he is  be it so only if the worst comes to the worst call him not elsley vavasour but plain john briggsand see what follows  valencia entered  the post has come in oh dear major campbell is there a letter  he put the note into her hand in silence she read it and darted back to lucias room  thank god that she did not see that i was going one more pang on earth spared said campbell to himself  valencia hurried to lucias door she was holding it ajar and looking out with pale face and wild hungry eyesa letter dont be silent or i shall go mad tell me the worst is he alive  yes  she gasped and staggered against the doorpost  where why does he not come back to me asked she in a confused abstracted way  it was best to tell the truth and have it over  he has gone to london lucia he will think over it all there and be sorry for it and then all will be well again  but lucia did not hear the end of that sentence murmuring to herself to london to london she hurried back into the room  clara clara have the children had their breakfast  yes maam says clara appearing from the inner room  then help me to pack up quick your master is gone to london on business and we are to follow him immediately  and she began bustling about the room  my dearest lucia you are not fit to travel now  i shall die if i stay here die if i do nothing i must find him whispered she dont speak loud or clara will hear i can find him and nobody can but me why dont you help me to pack valencia  my dearest but what will scoutbush say when he comes home and finds you gone  what right has he to interfere i am elsleys wife am i not and may follow my husband if i like and she went on desperately collecting not her own things but elsleys  valencia watched her with tearbrimming eyes collecting all his papers counting over his clothes murmuring to herself that he would want this and that in london her sanity seemed failing her under the fixed idea that she had only to see him and set all right with a word  i will go and get you some breakfast said she at last  i want none i am too busy to eat why dont you help me  valencia had not the heart to help believing as she did that lucias journey would be as bootless as it would be dangerous to her health  i will bring you some breakfast and you must try then i will help to pack and utterly bewildered she went out and the thought uppermost in her mind wasoh that i could find frank headley  happy was it for franks love paradoxical as it may seem that it had conquered just at that moment of terrible distress valencias acceptance of him had been hasty founded rather on sentiment and admiration than on deep affection and her feeling might have faltered waned died away in selfdistrust of its own reality if giddy amusement if mere easy happiness had followed it but now the fire of affliction was branding in the thought of him upon her softened heart  living at the utmost strain of her character campbell gone her brother useless and lucia and the children depending utterly on her there was but one to whom she could look for comfort while she needed it most utterly and happy for her and for her lover that she could go to him  poor lucia thank god that i have some one who will never treat me so who will lift me up and shield me instead of crushing medear creatureoh that i may find him and her heart went out after frank with a gush of tenderness which she had never felt before  is this then love she asked herself and she found time to slip into her own room for a moment and arrange her dishevelled hair ere she entered the breakfastroom  frank was there luckily alone pacing nervously up and down he hurried up to her caught both her hands in his and gazed into her wan and haggard face with the intensest tenderness and anxiety  valencias eyes looked into the depths of his passive and confiding till they failed before the keenness of his gaze and swam in glittering mist  ah thought she sorrow is a light price to pay for the feeling of being so loved by such a man  you are tiredill what a night you must have had mellot has told me all  oh my poor sister and wildly she poured out to frank her wrath against elsley her inability to comfort lucia and all the misery and confusion of the past night  this is a sad dawning for the day of my triumph thought frank who longed to pour out his heart to her on a thousand very different matters but he was content it was enough for him that she could tell him all and confide in him a truer sign of affection than any selfish lovemaking and he asked and answered with such tenderness and thoughtfulness for poor lucia with such a deep comprehension of elsleys character pitying while he blamed that he won his reward at last  oh it would he intolerable if i had not through it all the thought and blushing crimson her head drooped on her bosom she seemed ready to drop with exhaustion  sit down sit down or you will fall said frank leading her to a chair and as he led her he whispered with fluttering heart new to its own happiness and longing to make assurance surewhat thought  she was silent still but he felt her hand tremble in his  the thought of me  she looked up in his face how beautiful and in another moment neither knew how she was clasped to his bosom  he covered her face her hair with kisses she did not move from that moment she felt that he was her husband  oh guide me counsel me pray for me sobbed she i am all alone and my poor sister she is going mad i think and i have no one to trust but you and youyou will leave me to go to those dreadful wars and then what will become of me oh stay only a few days and holding him convulsively she answered his kisses with her own  frank stood as in a dream while the room reeled round and vanished and he was alone for a moment upon earth with her and his great love  tell me said he at last trying to awaken himself to action tell me is she really going to seek him  yes selfish and forgetful that i am you must help me she will go to london nothing can stop herand it will kill her  it may drive her mad to keep her here  it will and that drives me mad also what can i choose  follow where god leads it is she after all who must reclaim him leave her in gods hands and go with her to london  but my brother  mellot or i will see him let it be me mellot shall go with you to london  oh that you were going  oh that i were i will follow though do you think that i can be long away from you but i must tell your brother i had a very different matter on which to speak to him this morning said he with a sad smile but better as it is he shall find me i hope reasonable and trustworthy in this matter perhaps enough so to have my valencia committed to me precious jewel i must learn to be a man now at least now that i have you to care for  and yet you go and leave me  valencia because god has given us to each other shall our thankoffering be to shrink cowardly from his work  he spoke more sternly than he intended to awe into obedience rather himself than her for he felt poor fellow his courage failing fast while he held that treasure in his arms  she shuddered in silence  forgive me he cried i was too harsh valencia  no she cried looking up at him with a glorious smile scold me be harsh to me it is so delicious now to be reproved by you and as she spoke she felt as if she would rather endure torture from that mans hand than bliss from any other how many strange words of lucias that new feeling explained to her words at which she had once grown angry as doting weaknesses unjust and degrading to selfrespect poor lucia she might be able to comfort her now for she had learnt to sympathise with her by experience the very opposite to hers yet there must have been a time when lucia clung to elsley as she to frank how horrible to have her eyes opened thusto be torn and flung away from the bosom where she longed to rest it could never happen to her of course her frank was true though all the world were false but poor lucia she must go to her this was mere selfishness at such a moment  you will find scoutbush then  this moment i will order the car now if you will only eat you must  and he rang the bell and then made her sit down and eat almost feeding her with his own hand that too was a new experience and one so strangely pleasant that when bowie entered and stared solemnly at the pair she only looked up smiling though blushing a little  get a car instantly said she  for mrs vavasour my lady she has ordered hers already  no for mr headley he is going to find my lord frank pour me out a cup of tea for lucia  bowie vanished mystified its no concern of mine but better tak up wi a godly meenister than a godless pawet said the worthy warrior to himself as he marched down stairs  you see that i am asserting our rights already before all the world said she looking up  i see you are not ashamed of me  ashamed of you  and now i must go to lucia  and to london  valencia began to cry like any baby but rose and carried away the tea in her hand must i go and before you come back too  is she determined to start instantly  i cannot stop her you see she has ordered the car  then go my darling my own my valencia oh a thousand things to ask you and no time to ask them in i can write said frank with an inquiring smile  write yes every daytwice a day i shall live upon those letters goodbye and out she went while frank sat himself down at the table and laid his head upon his hands stupefied with delight till bowie entered  the car sir  which who asked frank looking up as from a dream  the car sir  frank rose and walked downstairs abstractedly bowie kept close to his side  yell pardon me sir said he in a low voice but i see how it is the more blessing for you yell be pleased i trust to take more care of this jewel than others have of that one or  or youll shoot me yourself bowie said frank half amused half awed too by the stern tone of the guardsman ill give you leave to do it if i deserve it  its no my duty either as a soldier or as a valet and indeed ive that opeenion of you sir that i dont think itll need to be any ones elses duty either  and so did mr bowie signify his approbation of the new family romance and went off to assist mrs clara in getting the trunks down stairs  clara was in high dudgeon she had not yet completed her flirtation with mr bowie and felt it hard to have her one amusement in life snatched out of her hardworked hands  im sure i dont know why were moving i dont believe its business some of his tantrums i daresay i heard her walking up and down the room all last night ill swear neither she nor miss valencia have been to bed hell kill her at last the brute  its no concern of either of us that have ye got another trunk to bring down  no concern just like your hardheartedness mr bowie and as soon as im gone of course you will be flirting with these impudent welshwomen in their horrid hats  maybe yes maybe no but flirtings no marrying mrs clara  true for you sir men were deceivers ever quoth clara and flounced up stairs while bowie looked after her with a grim smile and caught her when she came down again long enough to give her a great kiss the only language which he used in wooing and that but rarely  dinna fash lassie mind your lady and the poor bairns like a godly handmaiden and ill buy the ring when the sawmon fishings over and well just be married ere i start for the crimee  the sawmon cried clara ill see you turned into a mermaid first and married to a sawmon  and ye wont do anything o the kind said bowie to himself and shouldered a valise  in ten minutes the ladies were packed into the carriage and away under mellots care frank watched valencia looking back and smiling through her tears as they rolled through the village and then got into his car and rattled down the southern road to pont aberglaslyn his hand still tingling with the last pressure of valencias     chapter xxiii  the broad stone of honour   but where has stangrave been all this while  where any given bachelor has been for any given month is difficult to say and no mans business but his own but where he happened to be on a certain afternoon in the first week of october on which he had just heard the news of alma wasupon the hills between ems and coblentz walking over a high tableland of stubbles which would be grass in england and yet with all its tillage is perhaps not worth more than english grass would be thanks to that smallfarm system much bepraised by some who know not wheat from turnips then along a road which might be a devon one cut in the hillside through authentic devonian slate where the deep chocolate soil is lodged on the top of the upright strata and a thick coat of moss and wood sedge clusters about the oakscrub roots round which the delicate and rare oakfern mingles its fronds with great blue campanulas while the white admirals and silverwashed fritillaries flit round every bramble bed and the great purple emperors come down to drink in the road puddles and sit fearless flashing off their velvet wings a blue as of that empyrean which is dark by excess of light  down again through cultivated lands corn and clover flax and beet and all the various crops with which the industrious german yeoman ekes out his little patch of soil past the thrifty husbandman himself as he guides the two milchkine in his tiny plough and stops at the furrows end to greet you with the hearty german smile and bow while the little fairhaired maiden walking beneath the shade of standard cherries walnuts and pears all grey with fruit fills the cows mouths with chicory and wild carnations and pink saintfoin and many a fragrant weed which richer england wastes  down once more into a glen but such a glen as neither england nor america has ever seen or please god ever will see glorious as it is stangrave who knew all europe well had walked the path before but he stopped then as he had done the first time in awe on the right slope up the bare slate downs up to the foot of cliffs but only half of those cliffs god has made above the grey slate ledges rise cliffs of mans handiwork pierced with a hundred square black embrasures and above them the long barrackranges of a soldiers town which a foeman stormed once when it was young but what foeman will ever storm it again transcribers note punctuation missing from the end of this sentence in original possibly question mark what conquerors foot will ever tread again upon the broad stone of honour and call ehrenbreitstein his on the left the clover and the corn range on beneath the orchard boughs up to yon knoll of chestnut and acacia tall poplar feathered larchbut what is that stonework which gleams grey beneath their stems a summerhouse for some great duke looking out over the glorious rhine vale and up the long vineyards of the bright moselle from whence he may bid his people eat drink and take their ease for they have much goods laid up for many years  bank over bank of earth and stone cleft by deep embrasures from which the great guns grin across the rich gardens studded with standard fruittrees which close the glacis to its topmost edge and there below him lie the vineyards every rockledge and narrow path of soil tossing its golden tendrils to the sun grey with ripening clusters rich with noble wine but what is that wall which winds among them up and down creeping and sneaking over every ledge and knoll of vantage ground pierced with eyeletholes backed by strange stairs and galleries of stone till it rises close before him to meet the low round tower full in his path from whose deep casemates as from dark scowling eyeholes the ugly cannoneyes stare up the glen  stangrave knows them allas far as any man can know the wards of the key which locks apart the nations the yet maiden troy of europe the greatest fortress of the world  he walks down turns into the vineyards and lies down beneath the mellow shade of vines he has no sketchbookarticles forbidden his passport is in his pocket and he speaks all tongues of german men so fearless of gendarmes and soldiers he lies down in the blazing german afternoon upon the shaly soil and watches the brighteyed lizards hunt flies along the roastingwalls and the great locusts buzz and pitch and leap green locusts with red wings and grey locusts with blue wings he notes the species for he is tired and lazy and has so many thoughts within his head that he is glad to toss them all away and give up his soul if possible to locusts and lizards vines and shade  and far below him fleets the mighty rhine rich with the memories of two thousand stormy years and on its further bank the greywalled coblentz town and the long arches of the mosellebridge and the rich flats of kaiser franz and the long poplarcrested uplands which look so gay and are so stern for everywhere between the poplarstems the sawtoothed outline of the western forts cuts the blue sky  and far beyond it all sleeps high in air the eifel with its hundred crater peaks blue mound behind blue mound melting into white haze stangrave has walked upon those hills and stood upon the craterlip of the great moselkopf and dreamed beside the laacher see beneath the ancient abbey walls and his thoughts flit across the moselle flats towards his ancient haunts as he asks himselfhow long has that old eifel lain in such soft sleep how long ere it awake again  it may awake geologists confesswhy not and blacken all the skies with smoke of tophet pouring its streams of boiling mud once more to dam the rhine whelming the works of men in flood and ash and fire why not the old earth seems so solid at first sight but look a little nearer and this is the stuff of which she is madethe wreck of past earthquakes the leavings of old floods the washings of cold cinder heapswhich are smouldering still below  stangrave knew that well enough he had climbed vesuvius etna popocatepetl he had felt many an earthquake shock and knew how far to trust the everlasting hills and was old david right he thought that day when he held the earthquake and the volcano as the truest symbols of the history of human kind and of the dealings of their maker with them all the magnificent plutonic imagery of the hebrew poets had it no meaning for men now did the lord still uncover the foundations of the world spiritual as well as physical with the breath of his displeasure was the solfatara of tophet still ordained for tyrants and did the lord still arise out of his place to shake terribly the earth or had the moral world grown as sleepy as the physical one had seemed to have done would anything awful unexpected tragical ever burst forth again from the heart of earth or from the heart of man  surprising question what can ever happen henceforth save infinite railroads and crystal palaces peace and plenty cockaigne and dilettantism to the end of time is it not full sixty whole years since the first french revolution and six whole years since the revolution of all europe bahchange is a thing of the past and tragedy a myth of our forefathers war a bad habit of old barbarians eradicated by the spread of an enlightened philanthropy men know now how to govern the world far too well to need any divine visitations much less divine punishments and stangrave was an utopian dreamer only to be excused by the fact that he had in his pocket the news that three great nations were gone forth to tear each other as of yore  nevertheless looking round upon those grim earthmounds and embrasures he could not but give the men who put them there credit for supposing that they might be wanted ah but that might be only one of the direful necessities of the decaying civilisation of the old world what a contrast to the unarmed and peaceful prosperity of his own country thank heaven new england needed no fortresses military roads or standing armies true but why that flush of contemptuous pity for the poor old world which could only hold its own by such expensive and ugly methods  he asked himself that very question a moment after angrily for he was out of humour with himself with his country and indeed with the universe in general and across his mind flashed a memorable conversation at constantinople long since during which he had made some such unwise remark to thurnall and received from him a sharp answer which parted them for years  it was natural enough that that conversation should come back to him just then for in his jealousy he was thinking of tom thurnall often enough every day and in spite of his enmity he could not help suspecting more and more that thurnall had had some right on his side of the quarrel  he had been twitting thurnall with the miserable condition of the labourers in the south of england and extolling his own country at the expense of ours tom unable to deny the fact had waxed all the more wroth at having it pressed on him and at last had burst forth  well and what right have you to crow over us on that score i suppose if you could hire a man in america for eighteenpence a day instead of a dollar and a half you would do it you americans are not accustomed to give more for a thing than its worth in the market are you  but stangrave had answered the glory of america is that you cannot get the man for less than the dollar and a half that he is too well fed too prosperous too well educated to be made a slave of  and therefore makes slaves of the niggers instead ill tell you what im sick of that shallow fallacythe glory of america do you mean by america the country or the people you boast all of you of your country as if you had made it yourselves and quite forget that god made america and america has made you  made us sir quoth stangrave fiercely enough  made you replied thurnall exaggerating his half truth from anger to what is your comfort your high feeding your very education owing but to your having a thin population a virgin soil and unlimited means of emigration what credit to you if you need no poor laws when you pack off your children as fast as they grow up to clear more ground westward what credit to your yeomen that they have read more books than our clods have while they can earn more in four hours than our poor fellows in twelve it all depends on the mere physical fact of your being in a new country and we in an old one and as for moral superiority i shant believe in that while i see the whole of the northern states so utterly given up to the almighty dollar that they leave the honour of their country to be made ducks and drakes of by a few southern slaveholders moral superiority we hold in england that an honest man is a match for three rogues if the same law holds good in the united states i leave you to settle whether northerners or southerners are the honester men  whereupon and no shame to stangrave there was a heavy quarrel and the two men had not met since  but now those words of thurnalls backed by far bitterer ones of maries were fretting stangraves heartwhat if they were true they were not the whole truth there was beside and above them all a nobleness in the american heart which could if it chose and when it chose give the lie to that bitter taunt but had it done so already  at least he himself had not if thurnall and marie were unjust to his nation they had not been unjust to him he at least had been making all his life mere outward blessings causes of selfcongratulation and not of humility he had been priding himself on wealth ease luxury cultivation without a thought that these were gods gifts and that god would require an account of them if thurnall were right was he himself too truly the typical american and bitterly enough he accused at once himself and his people  noble marie is right we boast of our nobleness better to take the only opportunity of showing it which we have had since we have become a nation heaped with every blessing which god could give beyond the reach of sorrow a check even an interference shut out from all the world in gods new eden that we might freely eat of all the trees of the garden and grow and spread and enjoy ourselves like the birds of heavengod only laid on us one duty one command to right one simple confessed conscious wrong  and what have we donewhat have even i done we have steadily deliberately cringed at the feet of the wrongdoer even while we boasted our superiority to him at every point and at last for the sake of our own selfish ease helped him to forge new chains for his victims and received as our only reward fresh insults white slaves we perhaps and not the english peasant are the white slaves at least if the irishman emigrates to england or the englishman to canada he is not hunted out with bloodhounds and delivered back to his landlord to be scourged and chained he is not practically out of the pale of law unrepresented forbidden even the use of books and even if he were there is an excuse for the old country for she was founded on no political principles but discovered what she knows step by step a sort of political topsy as claude mellot calls her who has kinder growed doing from hand to mouth what seemed best but that we who profess to start as an ideal nation on fixed ideas of justice freedom and equalitythat we should have been stultifying ever since every great principle of which we so loudly boast                                       the old jew used to say of his nation it is god that hath made us and not we ourselves we say it is we that have made ourselves while godah yes i recollect gods work is to save a soul here and a soul there and to leave america to be saved by the americans who made it we must have a broader and deeper creed than that if we are to work out our destiny the battle against middle age slavery was fought by the old catholic church which held the jewish notion and looked on the deity as the actual king of christendom and every man in it as gods own child i see nowno wonder that the battle in america has as yet been fought by the quakers who believe that there is a divine light and voice in every man while the calvinist preachers with their isolating and individualising creed have looked on with folded hands content to save a negros soul here and there whatsoever might become of the bodies and the national future of the whole negro race no wonder while such men have the teaching of the people that it is necessary still in the nineteenth century in a protestant country amid sane human beings for such a man as mr sumner to rebut in sober earnest the argument that the negro was the descendant of canaan doomed to eternal slavery by noahs curse                                       he would rouse himself he would act speak write as many a noble fellowcountryman was doing he had avoided them of old as bores and fanatics who would needs wake him from his luxurious dreams he had even hated them simply because they were more righteous than he he would be a new man henceforth  he strode down the hill through the cannonguarded vineyards among the busy groups of peasants  yes marie was right life is meant for work and not for ease to labour in danger and in dread to do a little good ere the night comes when no man can work instead of trying to realise for oneself a paradise not even bunyans shepherdparadise much less fouriers casinoparadise and perhaps least of all because most selfish and isolated of all my own heartparadisethe apotheosis of loafing as claude calls it ah tennysons palace of art is a true wordtoo true too true  art what if the most necessary human art next to the art of agriculture be after all the art of war it has been so in all ages what if i have been befooledwhat if all the anglosaxon world has been befooled by forty years of peace we have forgotten that the history of the world has been as yet written in blood that the story of the human race is the story of its heroes and its martyrsthe slayers and the slain is it not becoming such once more in europe now and what divine exemption can we claim from the law what right have we to suppose that it will be aught else as long as there are wrongs unredressed on earth as long as anger and ambition cupidity and wounded pride canker the hearts of men what if the wise mans attitude and the wise nations attitude is that of the jews rebuilding their ruined wallsthe tool in one hand and the sword in the other for the wild arabs are close outside and the time is short and the storm has only lulled awhile in mercy that wise men may prepare for the next thunderburst it is an ugly fact but i have thrust it away too long and i must accept it now and henceforth this and not luxurious broadway this and not the comfortable new england village is the normal type of human life and this is the model cityarmed industry which tills the corn and vine among the cannons mouths which never forgets their need though it may mask and beautify their terror but knows that as long as cruelty and wrong exist on earth mans destiny is to dare and suffer and if it must be so to die  yes i will face my work my danger if need be i will find marie i will tell her that i accept her quest not for her sake but for its own only i will demand the right to work at it as i think best patiently moderately wisely if i can for a fanatic i cannot be even for her sake she may hate these slaveholdersshe may have her reasonsbut i cannot i cannot deal with them as feras naturae i cannot deny that they are no worse men than i that i should have done what they are doing have said what they are saying had i been bred up as they have been with irresponsible power over the souls and bodies of human beings god i shudder at the fancy the brute that i might have beenthat i should have been  yes one thing at least i have learnt in all my experiments on poor humanitynever to see a man do a wrong thing without feeling that i could do the same in his place i used to pride myself on that once fool that i was and call it comprehensiveness i used to make it an excuse for sitting by and seeing the devil have it all his own way and call that toleration i will see now whether i cannot turn the said knowledge to a better account as common sense patience and charity and yet do work of which neither i nor my country need be ashamed  he walked down and on to the bridge of boats they opened in the centre as he reached it a steamer was passing he lounged on the rail as the boat passed through looking carelessly at the groups of tourists  two ladies were standing on the steamer close to him looking up at ehrenbreitstein was ityes it was sabina and marie by her  but ah how changed the cheeks were pale and hollow dark ringshe could see them but too plainly as the face was lifted up toward the lightwere round those great eyes bright no longer her face was listless careworn looking all the more sad and impassive by the side of sabinas as she pointed smiling and sparkling up to the fortress and seemed trying to interest marie in it but in vain  he called out he waved his hand wildly to the amusement of the officers and peasants who waited by his side and who looking first at his excited face and then at the two beautiful women were not long in making up their minds about him and had their private jests accordingly  they did not see him but turned away to look at coblentz and the steamer swept by  stangrave stamped with rageupon a prussian officers thin boot  ten thousand pardons  you are excused dear sir you are excused says the goodnatured german with a wicked smile which raises a blush on stangraves cheek your eyes were dazzled why not it is not often that one sees two such suns together in the same sky but calm yourself the boat stops at coblentz  stangrave could not well call the man of war to account for his impertinence he had had his toes half crushed and had a right to indemnify himself as he thought fit and with a hundred more apologies stangrave prepared to dart across the bridge as soon as it was closed  alas after the steamer as the fates would have it came lumbering down one of those monster timber rafts and it was a full half hour before stangrave could get across having suffered all the while the torments of tantalus as he watched the boat sweep round to the pier and discharge its freight to be scattered whither he knew not at last he got across and went in chase to the nearest hotel but they were not there thence to the next and the next till he had hunted half the hotels in the town but hunted all in vain  he is rushing wildly back again to try if he can obtain any clue at the steamboat pier through the narrow dirty street at the back of the rhine cavalier when he is stopped short by a mighty german embrace and a german kiss on either cheek as the kiss of a housemaids broom while a jolly voice shouts in english  ah my dear dear friend and you would pass me whither the hangman so fast are you running in the mud  my dear salomon but let me go i beseech you i am in search  in search cries the jolly jew bankerfor the philosophers stone you had all that man could want a week since except that search no more but come home with me and we will have a night as of the gods on olympus  my dearest fellow i am looking for two ladies  two ah rogue shall not one suffice  dont my dearest fellow i am looking for two english ladies  potz you shall find two hundred in the hotels ugly and fair but the two fairest are gone this two hours  whenwhich cries stangrave suspecting at once  sabina mellot and a sultanai thought her of the nation and would have offered my hand on the spot but madame mellot says she is a gentile  gone and you have seen them where  to bertrich they had luncheon with my mother and then started by private post  i must follow  ach lieber but it will be dark in an hour  what matter  but you shall find them tomorrow just as well as today they stay at bertrich for a fortnight more they have been there now a month and only left it last week for a pleasure tour across to the ahrthal and so back by andernach  why did they leave coblentz then in such hot haste  ah the ladies never give reasons there were letters waiting for them at our house and no sooner read but they leaped up and would forth come home now and go by the steamer tomorrow morning  impossible most hospitable of israelites  to go tonightfor see the cloudsnot a postilion will dare to leave coblentz under that quickcoming allgemein und ungeheuer henkerhundundteufelsgewitter  stangrave looked up growling and gave in a rhinestorm was rolling up rapidly  they will be caught in it  no they are far beyond its path by now while you shall endure the whole visitation and if you try to proceed pass the night in a fleapestered posthouse or in a ditch of water  so stangrave went home with herr salomon and heard from him amid clouds of latakia of wars and rumours of wars distress of nations and perplexity seen by the light not of the gospel but of the stockexchange while the storm fell without in lightning hail rain of right rhenish potency     chapter xxiv  the thirtieth of september   we must go back a week or so to england and to the last day of september the world is shooting partridges and asking nervously when it comes home what news from the crimea the flesh who serves it is bathing at margate the devil is keeping up his usual correspondence with both eaton square is a desolate wilderness where dusty sparrows alone disturb the dreams of frowzy charwomen who like anchorites amid the tombs of the thebaid fulfil the contemplative life each in her subterranean cell beneath st peters spire the cabman sleeps within his cab the horse without the waterman seated on his empty bucket contemplates the untrodden pavement between his feet and is at rest the blue butchers boy trots by with empty cart five miles an hour instead of full fifteen and stops to chat with the red postman who his occupation gone smokes with the green gatekeeper and reviles the czar along the whole north pavement of the square only one figure moves and that is major campbell  his face is haggard and anxious he walks with a quick excited step earnest enough whoever else is not for in front of lord scoutbushs house the road is laid with straw there is sickness there anxiety bitter tears lucia has not found her husband but she has lost her child  trembling campbell raises the muffled knocker and bowie appears what news today he whispers  as well as can be expected sir and as quiet as a lamb now they say but it has been a bad time and a bad man is he that caused it  a bad time and a bad man how is miss st just  just gone to lie down sir mrs clara is on the stairs if youd like to see her  no tell miss st just that i have no news yet and the major turns wearily away  clara who has seen him from above hurries down after him into the street and coaxes him to come in i am sure you have had no breakfast sir and you look so ill and worn and miss st just will be so vexed not to see you she will get up the moment she hears you are here  no my good miss clara says campbell looking down with a weary smile i should only make gloom more gloomy bowie tell his lordship that i shall be at the afternoon train tomorrow let what will happen  ay ay sir were a ready to march the major looks very ill miss clara i wish hed have taken your counsel and i wish yed take mine and marry me ere i march just to try what its like  i must mind my mistress mr bowie says clara  and how should i interfere with that as ive said twenty times when im safe in the crimea ill get the licence this day say what ye will and then you would not have the heart to let me spend two pounds twelve and sixpence for nothing  whether the last most caledonian argument conquered or not mr bowie got the licence was married before breakfast the next morning and started for the crimea at four oclock in the afternoon most astonished as he confided in the train to sergeant macarthur to see a lassie that never gave him a kind word in her life and had not been married but barely six hours greet and greet at his going till she vanished away into hystericals theyre a very unfathomable species sergeant are they women and if they were taken out o man they took the best part o adam wi them and left us to shift with the worse  but to return to campbell the last week has altered him frightfully he is no longer the stern selfpossessed warrior which he was he no longer even walks upright his cheek is pale his eye dull his whole countenance sunken together and now that the excitement of anxiety is past he draws his feet along the pavement slowly his hands clasped behind him his eyes fixed on the ground as if the life was gone from out of him and existence was a heavy weight  she is safe at least then one burden off my mind and yet had it not been better if that pure spirit had returned to him who gave it instead of waking again to fresh misery i must find that man why i have been saying so to myself for seven days past and yet no ray of light can the coward have given me a wrong address yet why give me an address at all if he meant to hide from me why i have been saying that too to myself every day for the last week over and over again the same dreary round of possibilities and suspicions however i must be quiet now if i am a man i can hear nothing before the detective comes at two how to pass the weary weary time for i am past thinkingalmost past praying though not quite thank god  he paces up still noisy piccadilly and then up silent bond street pauses to look at some strange fish on grovess counteranything to while away the time then he plods on toward the top of the street and turns into mr pillischers shop and upstairs to the microscopic clubroom there at least he can forget himself for an hour  he looks round the neat pleasant little place with its cases of curiosities and its exquisite photographs and bright brass instruments its glass vases stocked with delicate waterplants and animalcules with the sunlight gleaming through the green and purple seaweed fronds while the air is fresh and fragrant with the seaweed scent a quiet cool little hermitage of science amid that great noisy luxurious westend world at least it brings back to him the thought of the summer sea and aberalva and his shorestudies but he cannot think of that any more it is past and may god forgive him  at one of the microscopes on the slab opposite him stands a sturdy bearded man his back toward the major while the wise little german hopeless of customers is leaning over him in his shirt sleeves  but i never have seen its like it had just like a painters easel in its stomach yesterday  why its an echinus larva a sucking seaurchin hang it if i had known you hadnt seen one id have brought up halfadozen of them  may i look sir asked the major i too never have seen an echinus larva  the bearded man looks up  major campbell  mr thurnall i thought i could not be mistaken in the voice  this is too pleasant sir to renew our watery loves together here said tom but a second look at the majors face showed him that he was in no jesting mood how is the party at beddgelert i fancied you with them still  they are all in london at lord scoutbushs house in eaton square  in london at this dull time i trust nothing unpleasant has brought them here  mrs vavasour is very ill we had thoughts of sending for you as the family physician was out of town but she was out of danger thank god in a few hours now let me ask in turn after you i hope no unpleasant business brings you up three hundred miles from your practice  nothing i assure you only i have given up my aberalva practice i am going to the east  like the rest of the world  not exactly you go as a dignified soldier of her majestys i as an undignified abel drugger to dose bashibazouks  impossible and with such an opening as you had there you must excuse me but my opinion of your prudence must not be so rudely shaken  why do you not ask the question which balzacs old tourangeois judge asks whenever a culprit is brought before himwho is she  taking for granted that there was a woman at the bottom of every mishap i understand you said the major with a sad smile now let you and me walk a little together and look at the echinoid another day or when i return from sevastopol  tom went out with him a new ray of hope had crossed the majors mind his meeting with thurnall might he providential for he recollected now for the first time mellots parting hint  you knew elsley vavasour well  no man better  did you think that there was any tendency to madness in him  no more than in any other selfish vain irritable man with a strong imagination left to run riot  humph you seem to have divined his character may i ask you if you knew him before you met him at aberalva  tom looked up sharply in the majors face  you would ask what cause i have for inquiring i will tell you presently meanwhile i may say that mellot told me frankly that you had some power over him and mentioned mysteriously a namejohn briggs i thinkwhich it appears that he once assumed  if mellot thought fit to tell you anything i may frankly tell you all john briggs is his real name i have known him from childhood and then tom poured into the ears of the surprised and somewhat disgusted major all he had to tell  you have kept your secret mercifully and used it wisely sir and i and others shall be always your debtors for it now i dare tell you in turn in strictest confidence of course  i am far too poor to afford the luxury of babbling  and the major told him what we all know  i expected as much said he drily now i suppose that you wish me to exert myself in finding the man  i do  were mrs vavasour only concerned i should saynot i better that she should never set eyes on him again  better indeed said he bitterly but it is i who must see him if but for five minutes i must  major campbells wish is a command where have you searched for him  at his address at his publishers at the houses of various literary friends of his and yet no trace  has he gone to the continent  heaven knows i have inquired at every passport office for news of any one answering his description indeed i have two detectives i may tell you at this moment watching every possible place there is but one hope if he be alive can he have gone home to his native town  never anywhere but there  is there any old friend of the lower class with whom he may have taken lodgings  tom pondered  there was a fellow a noisy blackguard whom briggs was asking after this very summera fellow who went off from whitbury with some players i know briggs used to go to the theatre with him as a boywhat was his name he tried acting but did not succeed and then became a sceneshifter or something of the kind at the adelphi he has some complaint i forget what which made him an outpatient at st mumpsimuss some months every year i know that he was there this summer for i wrote to ask at briggss request and briggs sent him a sovereign through me  but what makes you fancy that he can have taken shelter with such a man and one who knows his secret  it is but a chance but he may have done it from the mere feeling of lonelinessjust to hold by some one whom he knows in this great wilderness especially a man in whose eyes he will be a great man and to whom he has done a kindness still it is the merest chance  we will take it nevertheless forlorn hope though it be  they took a cab to the hospital and with some trouble got the mans name and address and drove in search of him they had some difficulty in finding his abode for it was up an alley at the back of drury lane in the top of one of those foul old houses which hold a family in every room but by dint of knocking at one door and the other and bearing meekly much reviling consequent thereon they arrived per modum tollendi at a door which must be the right one as all the rest were wrong  does john barker live here asks thurnall putting his head in cautiously for fear of drunken irishmen who might be seized with the national impulse to slate him  whats that to you answers a shrill voice from among soapsuds and steaming rags  here is a gentleman wants to speak to him  so do a many as wont have that pleasure and would be little the better for it if they had get along with you i knows your lay  we really want to speak to him and to pay him if he will  go along im up to the something to your advantage dodge and to the mustachio dodge too do you fancy i dont know a bailiff because hes dressed like a swell  but my good woman said tom laughing  you put your crocodile foot in here and ill hit the hot water over the both of you and she caught up the pan of soapsuds  my dear soul i am a doctor belonging to the hospital which your husband goes to and have known him since he was a boy down in berkshire  you and she looked keenly at him  my name is thurnall i was a medical man once in whitbury where your husband was born  you said she again in a softened tone i knows that name well enough  you do what was your name then said tom who recognised the womans berkshire accent beneath its coat of cockneyism  never you mind im no credit to it so ill let it be but come in for the old countys sake cant offer you a chair hes pawned em all pleasant old place it was down there when i was a young girl they say its growd a grand place now wi a railroad i think many times id like to go down and die there she spoke in a rough sullen careless tone as if lifeweary  my good woman said major campbell a little impatiently can you find your husband for us  why then asked she sharply her suspicion seeming to return  if he will answer a few questions i will give him five shillings if he can find out for me what i want i will give him five pounds  shouldnt i do as well if you gi it he its little out of it i shall see but he coming home tipsy when its spent ah dear it was a sad day for me when i first fell in with they playgoers  why should she not do it as well said thurnall mrs barker do you know anything of a person named briggsjohn briggs the apothecarys son at whitbury  she laughed a harsh bitter laugh  know he yes and too much reason that was where it all begun along of that playgoing of hes and my masters  have you seen him lately asked campbell eagerly  i seen un id hit this water over the fellow and all his playacting merryandrews if ever he sot a foot here  but have you heard of him  ees said she carelessly hes round here now i heard my master say about the delphy with my master a drinking i suppose no good ill warrant  my good woman said campbell panting for breath bring me face to face with that man and ill put a fivepound note in your hand there and then  five pounds is a sight to me but its a sight more than the sight of hes worth said she suspiciously again  thats the gentlemans concern said tom the moneys yours i suppose you know the worth of it by now  ees none better but i dont want he to get hold of it hes made away with enough already and she began to think  curiously impassive people we wessex worthies when we are a little ground down with trouble you must give her time and she will do our work she wants the money but she is long past being excited at the prospect of it  whats that youre whispering asked she sharply  campbell stamped with impatience  you dont trust us yet ehthen there and he took five sovereigns from his pocket and tossed them on the table theres your money i trust you to do the work as youve been paid beforehand  she caught up the gold rang every piece on the table to see if it was sound and then  sally you go down with these gentlemen to the jonsons head and if he bent there go to the fighting cocks and if he bent there go to the duke of wellington and tell he theres two gentlemen has heard of his poetry and wants to hear un excite and then you give he a glass of liquor and praise up his nonsense and hell tell you all he knows and a sight more gi un plenty to drink itll be a saving and a charity for if he dont get it out of you he will out of me  and she returned doggedly to her washing  cant i do anything for you asked tom whose heart always yearned over a berkshire soul i have plenty of friends down at whitbury still  more than i have no sir said she sadly and with the first touch of sweetness they had yet heard in her voice ive cured my own bacon and i must eat it theres none down there minds me but them that would be ashamed of me and i couldnt go without he and they wouldnt take he in so i must just bide and she went on washing  god help her said campbell as he went downstairs  misery breeds that temper and only misery in our people i can show you as thorough gentlemen and ladies people round whitbury living on ten shillings a week as you will show me in belgravia living on five thousand a year  i dont doubt it said campbell so she couldnt go without he drunken dog as he is thus it is with them all the world over  so much the worse for them said tom cynically and for the men too they make fools of us first with our overfondness of them and then they let us make fools of ourselves with their overfondness of us  i fancy sometimes that they were all meant to be the mates of angels and stooped to men as a pis aller reversing the old story of the sons of heaven and the daughters of men  and accounting for the present degeneracy when the sons of heaven married the daughters of men their offspring were giants and men of renown now the sons of men marry the daughters of heaven and the offspring is wiggle waggle windbag and redtape  they visited one publichouse after another till the girl found for them the man they wanted a shabby soddenvisaged fellow with a wouldbe jaunty air of conscious shrewdness and vanity who stood before the bar his thumbs in his armholes and laying down the law to a group of costerboys for want of a better audience  the girl after sundry plucks at his coattail stopped him in the midst of his oration and explained her errand somewhat fearfully  mr barker bent down his head on one side to signify that he was absorbed in attention to her news and then drawing himself up once more lifted his greasy hat high in air bowed to the very floor and broke forth    most potent grave and reverend signiors   a man of war and eke a man of peace   that is if you come peaceful and if not   have we not hiren here  and the fellow put himself into a fresh attitude  we come in peace my good sir said tom first to listen to your talented effusions and next for a little private conversation on a subject on which but mr barker interrupted    to listen and to drink the muse is dry   and pegasus doth thirst for hippocrene   and fain would paintimbibe the vulgar call   or hot or cold or long or shortattendant  the bar girl who knew his humour came forward    glasses all roundthese noble knights will pay   of hottest hot and stiffest stiff thou markst me   now to your quest  and he faced round with a third attitude  do you know mr briggs asked the straightforward major he rolled his eyes to every quarter of the seventh sphere clapped his hand upon his heart and assumed an expression of angelic gratitude    my benefactor were the world a waste   a thistlewaste assnibbled goldfinchpecked   and all the men and women merely asses   i still could lay this hand upon this heart   and cry not yet alone i know a man   a man jovefronted and hyperioncurled   a gushing flushing blushing human heart  as sure as you live sir said tom if you wont talk honest prose i wont pay for the brandy and water    base is the slave who pays and baser prose   hang uninspired patter tis in verse   that angels praise and fiends in limbo curse  and asses bray i think said tom in despair do you know where mr briggs is now    and why the devil do you want to know   for thats a verse sir although somewhat slow  the two men laughed in spite of themselves  better tell the fellow the plain truth said campbell to thurnall  come out with us and i will tell you and campbell threw down the money and led him off after he had gulped down his own brandy and half toms beside  what leave the nepenthe untasted  they took him out and he tucked his arms through theirs and strutted down drury lane  the fact is siri speak to you of course in confidence as one gentleman to another  mr barker replied by a lofty and gracious bow  that his family are exceedingly distressed at his absence and his wife who as you may know is a lady of high family dangerously ill and he cannot be aware of the fact this gentleman is the medical man of her family and ii am an intimate friend we should esteem it therefore the very greatest service if you would give us any information which    weep no more gentle shepherds weep no more   for lycidas your sorrow is not dead   sunk though he be upon a garret floor   with fumes of morpheus crown about his head  fumes of morpheus crown asked thurnall    that crimson flower which crowns the sleepy god   and sweeps the soul aloft though flesh may nod  he has taken to opium said thurnall to the bewildered major what i should have expected  god help him we must save him out of that last lowest deep cried campbell where is he sir    a vow a vow i have a vow in heaven   why guide the hounds toward the trembling hare   our adonais hath drunk poison oh   what deaf and viperous murderer could crown   lifes early cup with such a draught of woe  as i live sir cried campbell losing his selfpossession in disgust at the fool you may rhyme your own nonsense as long as you will but you shant quote the adonais about that fellow in my presence  mr barker shook himself fiercely free of campbells arm and faced round at him in a fighting attitude campbell stood eyeing him sternly but at his wits end  mr barker said tom blandly will you have another glass of brandy and water or shall i call a policeman  sir sputtered he speaking prose at last this gentleman has insulted me he has called my poetry nonsense and my friend a fellow and blood shall not wipe outwhat liquor may  the hint was sufficient but ere he had drained another glass mr barker was decidedly incapable of managing his affairs much less theirs and became withal exceedingly quarrelsome returning angrily to the grievance of briggs having been called a fellow in spite of all their entreaties he talked himself into a passion and at last to campbells extreme disgust rushed out of the bar into the street  this is too vexations to have kept halfanhours company with such an animal and then to have him escape me after all a just punishment on me for pandering to his drunkenness  tom made no answer but went quietly to the door and peeped out  pay for his liquor major and follow keep a few yards behind me there will be less chance of his recognising us than if he saw us both together  why where do you think hes going  not home i can see ten to one that he will go raging off straight to briggs to put him on his guard against us just like a drunkards cunning it would be there he has turned up that side street now follow me quick oh that he may only keep his legs  they gained the bottom of that street before he had turned out of it and so through another and another till they ran him to earth in one of the courts out of st martins lane  into a doorway he went and up a stair tom stood listening at the bottom till he heard the fellow knock at a door far above and call out in a drunken tone then he beckoned to campbell and both careless of what might follow ran upstairs and pushing him aside entered the room without ceremony  their chances of being on the right scent were small enough considering that though every one was out of town there were a million and a half of people in london at that moment and unfortunately at least fifty thousand who would have considered mr john barker a desirable visitor but somehow in the excitement of the chase both had forgotten the chances against them and the probability that they would have to retire downstairs again apologising humbly to some wrathful joseph buggins whose convivialities they might have interrupted but no toms cunning had as usual played him true and as they entered the door they beheld none other than the lost elsley vavasour alias john briggs  major campbell advanced bowing hat in hand with a courteous apology on his lips  it was a low leanto garret there was a deal table and an old chair in it but no bed the windows were broken the paper hanging down in strips elsley was standing before the empty fireplace his hand in his bosom as if he had been startled by the scuffle outside he had not shaved for some days  so much tom could note but no more he saw the glance of recognition pass over elsleys face and that an ugly one he saw him draw something from his bosom and spring like a cat almost upon the table a flasha crack he had fired a pistol full in campbells face  tom was startled not at the thing but that such a man should have done it he had seen souls and too many flit out of the world by that same tiny crack in californian taverns arabian deserts australian gullies he knew all about that but he liked campbell and he breathed more freely the next moment when he saw him standing still erect a quiet smile on his face and felt the plaster dropping from the wall upon his own head the bullet had gone over the major all was right  he is not man enough for a second shot thought tom quietly while the majors eye is on him  i beg your pardon mr vavasour he heard the major say in a gentle unmoved voice for this intrusion i assure you that there is no cause for any anger on your part and i am come to entreat you to forget and forgive any conduct of mine which may have caused you to mistake either me or the lady whom i am unworthy to mention  i am glad the beggar fired at him thought tom one spice of danger and hes himself again and will overawe the poor cur by mere civility i was afraid of some abject methodist parson humility which would give the other party a handle  elsley heard him with a stupefied look like that of a trapped wild beast in which rage shame suspicion and fear were mingled with the vacant glare of the opiumeaters eye then his eye drooped beneath campbells steady gentle gaze and he looked uneasily round the room still like a trapped wild beast as if for a hole to escape by then up again but sidelong at major campbell  i assure you sir on the word of a christian and a soldier that you are labouring under an entire misapprehension for gods sake and mrs vavasours sake come back sir to those who will receive you with nothing but affection your wife has been all but dead she thinks of no one but you asks for no one but you in gods name sir what are you doing here while a wife who adores you is dying from youri do not wish to be rude sir but let me say at leastneglect  elsley looked at him still askance puzzled inquiring suddenly his great beautiful eyes opened to preternatural wideness as if trying to grasp a new thought he started shifted his feet to and fro his arms straight down by his sides his fingers clutching after something then he looked up hurriedly again at campbell and thurnall looked at him also and his face was as the face of an angel  miserable ass thought tom if he dont see innocence in that mans countenance he wouldnt see it in his own childs  elsley suddenly turned his back to them and thrust his hand into his bosom now was toms turn  in a moment he had vaulted over the table and seized elsleys wrist ere he could draw the second pistol  no my dear jack whispered he quietly once is enough in a day  not for him tom for myself moaned elsley  for neither dear lad let bygones be bygones and do you be a new man and go home to mrs vavasour  never never never never never never shrieked elsley like a baby every word increasing in intensity till the whole house rang and then threw himself into the crazy chair and dashed his head between his hands upon the table  this is a case for me major campbell i think you had better go now  you will not leave him  no sir it is a very curious psychological study and he is a whitbury man  campbell knew quite enough of the wouldbe cynical doctor to understand what all that meant he came up to elsley  mr vavasour i am going to the war from which i expect never to return if you believe me give me your hand before i go  elsley without lifting his head beat on the table with his hand  i wish to die at peace with you and all the world i am innocent in word in thought i shall not insult another person by saying that she is so if you believe me give me your hand  elsley stretched his hand his head still buried campbell took it and went silently downstairs  is he gone moaned he after a while  yes  does shedoes she care for him  good heavens how did you ever dream such an absurdity  elsley only beat upon the table  she has been ill  is ill she has lost her child  which shrieked elsley  a boy whom she should have had  elsley only beat on the table then  give me the bottle tom  what bottle  the laudanumthere in the cupboard  i shall do no such thing you are poisoning yourself  let me then i must i tell you i can live on nothing else i shall go mad if i do not have it i should have been mad by now nothing else keeps off these fitsi feel one coming now curse you give me the bottle  what fits  how do i know agony and tortureever since i got wet on that mountain  tom knew enough to guess his meaning and felt elsleys pulse and forehead  i tell you it turns every bone to redhot iron almost screamed he  neuralgia rheumatic i suppose said tom to himself well this is not the thing to cure you but you shall have it to keep you quiet and he measured him out a small dose  more i tell you more said elsley lifting up his head and looking at it  not more while you are with me  with you who the devil sent you here  john briggs john briggs if i did not mean you good should i be here now now do like a reasonable man tell me what you intend to do  what is that to you or any man said elsley writhing with neuralgia  no concern of mine of course but your poor wifeyou must see her  i cant i wontthat is not yet i tell you i cannot face the thought of her much less the sight of her and her familythat valencia id rather the earth should open and swallow me dont talk to me i say  and hiding his face in his hands he writhed with pain while thurnall stood still patiently watching him as a pointer dog does a partridge he had found his game and did not intend to lose it  i am better now quite well said he as the laudanum began to work yes ill gothat will be itgo to  at once hell give me an order for a magazine article ill earn ten pounds and then off to italy  if you want ten pounds my good fellow you can have them without racking your brains over an article elsley looked up proudly  i do not borrow sir  wellill give you five for those pistols they are of no use to you and i shall want a spare brace for the east  ah i forgot them i spent my last money on them said he with a shudder but i wont sell them to you at a fancy priceno dealings between gentleman and gentleman ill go to a shop and get for them what they are worth  very good ill go with you if you like i fancy i may get you a better price for them than you would yourself being rather a knowing one about the pretty little barkers and tom took his arm and walked him quietly down into the street  if you ever go up those kennelstairs again friend said he to himself my names not tom thurnall  they walked to a gunsmiths shop in the strand where tom had often dealt and sold the pistols for some three pounds  now then lets go into 333 and get a mutton chop  no  elsley was too shy he was not fit to be seen  come to my rooms then in the adelphi and have a wash and a shave it will make you as fresh as a lark again and then well send out for the eatables and have a quiet chat  elsley did not say no thurnall took the thing as a matter of course and he was too weak and tired to argue with him beside there was a sort of relief in the company of a man who though he knew all chatted on to him cheerily and quietly as if nothing had happened who at least treated him as a sane man from any one else he would have shrunk lest they should find him out but a companion who knew the worst at least saved him suspicion and dread  his weakness now that the collapse after passion had come on clung to any human friend the very sound of toms clear sturdy voice seemed pleasant to him after long solitude and silence at least it kept off the fiends of memory  tom anxious to keep elsleys mind employed on some subject which should not be painful began chatting about the war and its prospects elsley soon caught the cue and talked with wild energy and pathos opiumfed of the coming struggle between despotism and liberty the arising of poland and hungary and all the grand dreams which then haunted minds like his  by jove said tom you are yourself again now why dont you put all that into a book  i may perhaps said elsley proudly  and if it comes to that why not come to the war and see it for yourself a new countryone of the finest in the world new scenery new actorswhy constantinople itself is a poem yes there is another revolt of islam to be written yet why dont you become our war poet come and see the fighting for therell be plenty of it let them say what they will the old bear is not going to drop his dead donkey without a snap and a hug come along and tell people what its all really like there will be a dozen cockneys writing battle songs ill warrant who never saw a man shot in their lives not even a hare come and give us the real genuine grit of itfor if you cant who can  it is a grand thought the true war poets after all have been warriors themselves körner and alcaeus fought as well as sang and sang because they fought old homer toowho can believe that he had not hewn his way through the very battles which he describes and seen every wound every shape of agony a noble thought to go out with that army against the northern anarch singing in the van of battle as taillefer sang the song of roland before williams knights and to die like him the protomartyr of the crusade with the melody yet upon ones lips  and his face blazed up with excitement  what a handsome fellow he is after all if there were but more of him said tom to himself i wonder if hed fight though when the singingfever was off him  he took elsley upstairs into his bedroom got him washed and shaved and sent out the woman of the house for mutton chops and stout and began himself setting out the luncheon table while elsley in the room within chanted to himself snatches of poetry  the notion has taken hes composing a war song already i believe it actually was so but elsleys brain was weak and wandering and he was soon silent and motionless so long that tom opened the door and looked in anxiously  he was sitting on a chair his hands fallen on his lap the tears running down his face  well asked tom smilingly not noticing the tears how goes on the opera i heard through the door the orchestra tuning for the prelude  elsley looked up in his face with a puzzled piteous expression  do you know thurnall i fancy at moments that my mind is not what it was fancies flit from me as quickly as they come i had twenty verses five minutes ago and now i cannot recollect one  no wonder thought tom to himself my clear fellow recollect all that you have suffered with this neuralgia believe me all you want is animal strength chops and porter will bring all the verses back or better ones instead of them  he tried to make elsley eat and elsley tried himself but failed the moment the meat touched his lips he loathed it and only courtesy prevented his leaving the room to escape the smell the laudanum had done its work upon his digestion he tried the porter and drank a little then suddenly stopping he pulled out a phial dropped a heavy dose of his poison into the porter and tossed it off  sold am i said tom to himself he must have hidden the bottle as he came out of the room with me oh the cunning of those opiumeaters however it will keep him quiet just now and to eaton square i must go  you had better be quiet now my dear fellow after your dose talking will only excite you settle yourself on my bed and ill be back in an hour  so he put elsley on his bed carefully removing razors and pistols for he had still his fears of an outburst of passion then locked him in ran down into the strand threw himself into a cab for eaton square and asked for valencia  campbell had been there already so tom took care to tell nothing which he had not told expecting and rightly that he would not mention elsleys having fired at him lucia was still all but senseless too weak even to ask for elsley to attempt any meeting between her and her husband would be madness  what will you do with the unhappy man mr thurnall  keep him under my eye day and night till he is either rational again or  do you think that he mayoh my poor sister  i think that he may yet end very sadly madam there is no use concealing the truth from you all i can promise is that i will treat him as my own brother  valencia held out her fair hand to the young doctor he stooped and lifted the tips of her fingers to his lips  i am not worthy of such an honour madam i shall study to deserve it and he bowed himself out the same sturdy selfconfident tom doing right he hardly knew why save that it was all in the way of business  and now arose the puzzle what to do with elsley he had set his heart on going down to whitbury the next day he had been in england nearly six months and had not yet seen his father his heart yearned too after the old place and mark armsworth and many an old friend whom he might never see again however that fellow i must see to come what will business first and pleasure afterwards if i make him all right if i even get him out of the world decently i get the scoutbush interest on my sidethough i believe i have it already still its as well to lay people under as heavy an obligation as possible i wish miss valencia had asked me whether elsley wanted any money its expensive keeping him myself however poor thing she has other matters to think of and i dare say never knew the pleasures of an empty purse here we are threeandsixpenceeh cabman i suppose you think i was born saturday night theres three shillings now dont chaff me my excellent friend or you will find you have met your match and a leetle more  and tom hurried into his rooms and found elsley still sleeping  he set to work packing and arranging for with him every moment found its business and presently heard his patient call faintly from the next room  thurnall said he i have been a long journey i have been to whitbury once more and followed my father about his garden and sat upon my mothers knee and she taught me one text and no more over and over again she said it as she looked down at me with still sad eyes the same text which she spoke the day i left her for london i never saw her again by this my son be admonished of making of books there is no end and much study is a weariness of the flesh let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter fear god and keep his commandments for this is the whole duty of man yes i will go down to whitbury and he a little child once more i will take poor lodgings and crawl out day by day down the old lanes along the old riverbanks where i fed my soul with fair and mad dreams and reconsider it all from the beginningand then die no one need know me and if they do they need not be ashamed of me i trustashamed that a poet has risen up among them to speak words which have been heard across the globe at least they need never know my shamenever know that i have broken the heart of an angel who gave herself to me body and soulattempted the life of a man whose shoes i am not worthy to unloosenever know that i have killed my own childthat a blacker brand than cains is on my brownever knowoh my god what care i let them know all as long as i can have done with shams and affectations dreams and vain ambitions and he just my own self once more for one day and then die  and he burst into convulsive weeping  no tom do not comfort me i ought to die and i shall die i cannot face her again let her forget me and find a husband who willand be a father to the children whom i neglected oh my darlings my darlings if i could but see you once again but no you too would ask me where i had been so long you too would ask meyour innocent faces at least wouldwhy i had killed your little brotherlet me weep it out thurnall let me face it all this very misery is a comfort for it will kill me all the sooner  if you really mean to go to whitbury my poor dear fellow said tom at last i will start with you tomorrow morning for i too must go i must see my father  you will really asked elsley who began to cling to him like a child  i will indeed believe me you are right you will find friends there and admirers too i know one  you do asked he looking up  mary armsworth the bankers daughter  what that purseproud vulgar man  dont be afraid of him a truer and more delicate heart dont beat no one has more cause to say so than i he will receive you with open arms and need be told no more than is necessary while as his friend you may defy gossip and do just what you like  tom slipped out that afternoon paid elsleys pittance of rent at his old lodgings bought him a few necessary articles and lent him without saying anything a few more elsley sat all day as one in a dream moaning to himself at intervals and following tom vacantly with his eyes as he moved about the room excitement misery and opium were fast wearing out body and mind and tom put him to bed that evening as he would have put a child  tom walked out into the strand to smoke in the fresh air and think in spite of himself of that fair saint from whom he was so perversely flying gay girls slithered past him looked round at him but in vain those two great sad eyes hung in his fancy and he could see nothing else ahif she had but given him back his moneywhy what a fool he would have made of himself better as it was he was meant to be a vagabond and an adventurer to the last and perhaps to find at last the luck which had flitted away before him  he passed one of the theatre doors there was a group outside more noisy and more earnest than such groups are wont to be and ere he could pass through them a shout from within rattled the doors with its mighty pulse and seemed to shake the very walls another and anotherwhat was it fire  no it was the news of alma  and the group surged to and fro outside and talked and questioned and rejoiced and smart gents forgot their vulgar pleasures and looked for a moment as if they too could have foughthad foughtat alma and sinful girls forgot their shame and looked more beautiful than they had done for many a day as beneath the flaring gaslight their faces glowed for a while with noble enthusiasm and womans sacred pity while they questioned tom taking him for an officer as to whether he thought there were many killed  i am no officer but i have been in many a battle and i know the russians well and have seen how they fight and there is many a brave man killed and many a one more will be  oh does it hurt them much asked one poor thing  not often quoth tom  thank god thank god and she turned suddenly away and with the impulsive nature of her class burst into violent sobbing and weeping  poor thing perhaps among the men who fought and fell that day was he to whom she owed the curse of her young life and after him her lonely heart went forth once more faithful even in the lowest pit  you are strange creatures women women thought tom but i knew that many a year ago now thenthe game is growing fast and furious it seems oh that i may find myself soon in the thickest of it  so said tom thurnall and so said major campbell too that night as he prepared everything to start next morning to southampton the better the day the better the deed quoth he when a man is travelling to a better world he need not be afraid of starting on a sunday     chapter xxv  the banker and his daughter   tom and elsley are safe at whitbury at last and tom ere he has seen his father has packed elsley safe away in lodgings with an old dame whom he can trust then he asks his way to his fathers new abode a small oldfashioned house with low bay windows jutting out upon the narrow pavement  tom stops and looks in the window his father is sitting close to it in his armchair his hands upon his knees his face lifted to the sunlight with chin slightly outstretched and his pale eyes feeling for the light the expression would have been painful but for its perfect sweetness and resignation his countenance is not perhaps a strong one but its delicacy and calm and the high forehead and the long white locks are most venerable with a blind mans exquisite sense he feels toms shadow fall on him and starts and calls him by name for he has been expecting him and thinking of nothing else all the morning and takes for granted that it must be he  in another moment tom is at his fathers side what need to describe the sacred joy of those first few minutes even if it were possible but unrestrained tenderness between man and man rare as it is and as it were unaccustomed to itself has no passionate fluency no metaphor or poetry such as man pours out to woman and woman again to man all its language lies in the tones the looks the little halfconcealed gestures hints which pass themselves off modestly in jest and such was toms first interview with his father till the old isaac having felt toms head and hands again and again to be sure whether it were his very son or no made him sit down by him holding him still fast and began  now tell me tell me while jane gets you something to eat no jane you mustnt talk to master tom yet to bother about how much hes grownnonsense i must have him all to myself jane go and get him some dinner now tom as if he was afraid of losing a moment you have been a dear boy to write to me every week but there are so many questions which only word of mouth will answer and i have stored up dozens of them i want to know what a coral reef really looks like and if you saw any trepangs upon them and what sort of strata is the gold really in and you saw one of those giant rays i want a whole hours talk about the fellow andwhat an old babbler i am talking to you when you should be talking to me now begin let us have the trepangs first are they real holothurians or not  and tom began and told for a full halfhour interrupted then by some little comment of the old mans which proved how prodigious was the memory within imprisoned and forced to feed upon itself  you seem to know more about australia than i do father said tom at last  no child but mary armsworth god bless her comes down here almost every evening to read your letters to me and she has been reading to me a book of mrs lees adventures in australia which reads like a novel delicious bookto me at least why there is her step outside i do believe and her fathers with her  the lighter womans step was inaudible to tom but the heavy deliberate waddle of the banker was not he opened the housedoor and then the parlourdoor without knocking but when he saw the visitor he stopped on the threshold with outstretched arms  hillo ho who have we here our prodigal son returned with his pockets full of nuggets from the diggings oh mums the word is it as tom laid his finger on his lips come here then and lets have a look at you and he catches both toms hands in his and almost shakes them off i knew you were coming old boy mary told meshes in all the old mans secrets come along mary and see your old playfellow she has got a little fruit for the old gentleman mary where are you i always colloguing with jane  mary comes in a little dumpty body with a yellow face and a red nose the smile of an angel and a heart full of many little secrets of other peoplesand of one great one of her own which is no business of any mansand with fifty thousand pounds as her portion for she is an only child but no man will touch that fifty thousand for no one would marry me for myself says mary and no one shall marry me for my money  so she greets tom shyly and humbly without looking in his face yet very cordially and then slips away to deposit on the table a noble pineapple  a little bit of fruit from her greenhouse says the old man in a disparaging tone and oh jane bring me a saucer heres a sprat i just capered out of hemmelford millpit perhaps the doctor would like it fried for supper if its big enough not to fall through the gridiron  jane who knows mark armsworths humour brings in the largest dish in the house and mark pulls out of his basket a great threepound trout  aha my young rover old marks right hand hasnt forgot its cunning eh and this is the month for them fish all quiet now when fools go ashooting wise men go afishing eh come here and look me over how do i wear eh as like a muscovy duck as ever you young rogue do you recollect asking me at the club dinner why i was like a muscovy duck because i was a fat thing in green velveteen with a bald red head that was always waddling about the river bank ah those were days well have some more of them come up tonight and try the old 21 bin  i must have him myself tonight indeed i must mark says the doctor  all to yourself you selfish old rogue  whyno  well come down then mary and i and bring the 21 with us and hear all his cockandbull stories full of travellers lies as ever eh well ill come and smoke my pipe with you always the same old mark my lad nudging tom with his elbow one fellow comes and borrows my money and goes out and calls me a stingy old hunks because i wont let him cheat me another comes and eats my pines and drinks my port goes home and calls me a purseproud upstart because he cant match em never mind old marks old mark sound in the heart and sound in the liver just the same as thirty years ago and will be till he takes his last quietus est    and drops into his grassy nest  bye bye doctor come mary  and out he toddled with silent little mary at his heels  old mark wears well body and soul said tom  he is a noble generous fellow and as delicatehearted as a woman withal in spite of his conceit and roughness fifty and odd years now tom have we been brothers and i never found him change and brothers we shall be i trust a few years more till i see you back again from the east comfortably settled and then  dont talk of that sir please said tom quite quickly and sharply how ill poor mary looks  so they say poor child and one hears it in her voice ah tom that girl is an angel she has been to me daughter doctor clergyman eyes and library and would have been nurse too if it had not been for making old jane jealous but she is ill some love affair i suppose  how quaint it is that the father has kept all the animal vigour to himself and transmitted none to the daughter  he has not kept the soul to himself tom or the eyes either she will bring me in wild flowers and talk to me about them till i fancy i can see them as well as ever ah well it is a sweet world still tom and there are sweet souls in it a sweet world i was too fond of looking at it once i suppose so god took away my sight that i might learn to look at him and the old man lay back in his chair and covered his face with his handkerchief and was quite still awhile and tom watched him and thought that he would give all his cunning and power to be like that old man  then jane came in and laid the clotha coarse one enoughand tom picked a cold mutton bone with a steel fork and drank his pint of beer from the publichouse and lighted his fathers pipe and then his own and vowed that he had never dined so well in his life and began his travellers stories again  and in the evening mark came in with a bottle of the 21 in his coattail pocket and the three sat and chatted while mary brought out her work and stitched listening silently till it was time to lead the old man upstairs  tom put his father to bed and then made a hesitating request  there is a poor sick man whom i brought down with me sir if you could spare me halfanhour it really is a professional case he is under my charge i may say  what is it boy  well laudanum and a broken heart  exercise and ammonia for the first for the second gods grace and the grave and those latter medicines you cant exhibit my dear boy well as it is professional duty i suppose you must but dont exceed the hour i shall lie awake till you return and then you must talk me to sleep  so tom went out and homeward with mark and mary for their roads lay together and as he went he thought good to tell them somewhat of the history of john briggs alias elsley vavasour  poor fool said mark who listened in silence to the end why didnt he mind his bottles and just do what heaven sent him to do is he in want of the rhino tom  he had not five shillings left after he had paid his fare and he refuses to ask his wife for a farthing  quite rightvery proper spirit and mark walked on in silence a few minutes  i say tom a fool and his money are soon parted theres a fivepound note for him you begging insinuating dog and be hanged to you both i shall die in the workhouse at this rate  oh father you will never miss  who told you i thought i should pray dont you go giving another five pounds out of your pocketmoney behind my back maam i know your tricks of old tom ill come and see the poor beggar tomorrow with you and call him mr vavasourlord vavasour if he likesif youll warrant me against laughing in his face and the old man did laugh till he stopped and held his sides again  oh father father dont be so cruel remember how wretched the poor man is  i cant think of anything but old boluss boy turned poet why did you tell me tom you bad fellow its too much for a man at my time of life and after his dinner too  and with that he opened the little gate by the side of the grand one and turned to ask tom  wont come in boy and have one more cigar  i promised my father to be back as quickly as possible  good ladthats the plan to go on    youll be churchwarden before alls over   and so arrive at wealth and fame  instead of writing poooetry do you recollect that morning and the black draught oh dear my side  and tom heard him keckling to himself up the garden walk to his house went off to see that elsley was safe and then home and slept like a top no wonder for he would have done so the night before his execution  and what was little mary doing all the while  she had gone up to the room after telling her father with a kiss not to forget to say his prayers and then she fed her canary bird and made up the persian cats bed and then sat long at the open window gazing out over the shadowdappled lawn away to the poplars sleeping in the moonlight and the shining silent stream and the shining silent stars till she seemed to become as one of them and a quiet heaven within her eyes took counsel with the quiet heaven above and then she drew in suddenly as if stung by some random thought and shut the window a picture hung over her mantelpiecea portrait of her mother who had been a country beauty in her time she glanced at it and then at the lookingglass would she have given her fifty thousand pounds to have exchanged her face for such a face as that  she caught up her little thomas à kempis marked through and through with lines and references and sat and read steadfastly for an hour and more that was her school as it has been the school of many a noble soul and for some cause or other that stinging thought returned no more and she knelt and prayed like a little child and like a little child slept sweetly all the night and was away before breakfast the next morning after feeding the canary and the cat to old women who worshipped her as their ministering angel and said looking after her that dear miss mary pity she is so plain such a match as she might have made but shell be handsome enough when she is a blessed angel in heaven  ah true sisters of mercy whom the world sneers at as old maids if you pour out on cats and dogs and parrots a little of the love which is yearning to spend itself on children of your own flesh and blood as long as such as you walk this lower world one needs no butlers analogy to prove to us that there is another world where such as you will have a fuller and a fairer i dare not say a juster portion                                       next morning mark started with tom to call on elsley chatting and puffing all the way  ill butter him trust me nothing comforts a poor beggar like a bit of praise when hes down and all fellows that take to writing are as greedy after it as trout after the drake even if they only scribble in county newspapers ive watched them when ive been electioneering my boy  only said tom dont be angry with him if he is proud and peevish the poor fellow is all but mad with misery  poh quarrel with him whom did i ever quarrel with if he barks ill stop his mouth with a good dinner i suppose hes gentleman enough to invite  as much a gentleman as you and i not of the very first water of course still he eats like other people and dont break many glasses during a sitting think he couldnt have been a very great cad to marry a noblemans daughter  why no speaks well for him that considering his breeding he must be a very clever fellow to have caught the trick of the thing so soon  and so he is a very clever fellow too clever by half and a very finehearted fellow too in spite of his conceit and his temper but that dont prevent his being an awful fool  you speak like a book tom said old mark clapping him on the back look at me no one can say i was ever troubled with genius but i can show my money pay my way eat my dinner kill my trout hunt my hounds help a lame dog over a stile which was marks phrase for doing a generous thing and thank god for all and who wants more i should like to know but here we areyou go up first  they found elsley crouched up over the empty grate his head in his hands and a few scraps of paper by him on which he had been trying to scribble he did not look up as they came in but gave a sort of impatient halfturn as if angry at being disturbed tom was about to announce the banker but he announced himself  come to do myself the honour of calling on you mr vavasour i am sorry to see you so poorly i hope our whitbury air will set all right  you mistake me sir my name is briggs said elsley without turning his head but a moment after he looked up angrily  mr armsworth i beg your pardon sir but what brings you here are you come sir to use the rich successful mans right and lecture me in my misery  pon my word sir you must have forgotten old mark armsworth indeed if you fancy him capable of any such dirt no sir i came to pay my respects to you sir hoping that youd come up and take a family dinner i could do no less ran on the banker seeing that elsley was preparing a peevish answer considering the honour that i hear you have been to your native town a very distinguished person our friend tom tells me and we ought to be proud of you and behave to you as you deserve for i am sure we dont send too many clever fellows out of whitbury  would that you had never sent me said elsley in his bitter way  ah sir thats matter of opinion you would never have been heard of down here never have had justice done you i mean for heard of you have been theres my daughter has read your poems again and again always quoting them and very pretty they sound too poetry is not in my line of course still its a credit to a man to do anything well if he has the gift and she tells me that you have it and plenty of it and though shes no fine lady thank heaven ill back her for good sense against any woman come up sir and judge for yourself if i dont speak the truth she will be delighted to meet you and bade me say so  by this time good mark had talked himself out of breath and elsley flushing up as of old at a little praise began to stammer an excuse his nerves were so weak and his spirits so broken with late troubles  my dear sir thats the very reason i want you to come a bottle of port will cure the nerves and a pleasant chat the spirits nothing like forgetting all for a little time and then to it again with a fresh lease of strength and beat it at last like a man  too late my dear sir i must pay the penalty of my own folly said elsley really won by the mans cordiality  never too late sir while theres life left in us and he went on in a gentler tone if we all were to pay for our own follies or lie down and die when we saw them coming full cry at our heels where would any one of us be by now i have been a fool in my time young gentleman more than once or twice and that too when i was old enough to be your father and down i went and deserved what i got but my rule always wasfight fair fall soft know when youve got enough and dont cry out when youve got it but just go home train again and saybetter luck next fight and so old marks sermon ended as most of them did in somewhat socratic allegory savouring rather of the market than of the study but elsley understood him and looked up with a smile  you too are somewhat of a poet in your way i see sir  i never thought to live to hear that sir i cant doubt now that you are cleverer than your neighbours for you have found out something which they never did but you will comefor thats my business  elsley looked inquiringly at tom he had learnt now to consult his eye and lean on him like a child tom looked a stout yes and elsley said languidly  you have given me so much new and good advice in a few minutes sir that i must really do myself the pleasure of coming and hearing more  well done our side cried old mark dinner at halfpast five no london late hours here sir miss armsworth will be out of her mind when she hears youre coming  and off he went  do you think hell come up to the scratch tom  i am very much afraid his courage will fail him i will see him again and bring him up with me but now my dear mr armsworth do remember one thing that if you go on with him at your usual rate of hospitality the man will as surely be drunk as his nerves and brain are all but ruined and if he is so he will most probably destroy himself tomorrow morning  destroy himself  he will the shame of making a fool of himself just now before you will be more than he could bear so be stingy for once he will not wish for it unless you press him but if he talks and he will talk after the first halfhour he will forget himself and half a bottle will make him mad and then i wont answer for the consequences  good gracious why these poets want as tender handling as a bag of gunpowder over the fire  you speak like a book there in your turn and tom went home to his father  he returned in due time a new difficulty had arisen elsley under the excitement of expectation had gone out and deigned to buy laudanumso will an unhealthy craving degrade a manof old bolus himself who luckily did not recognise him he had taken his fullest dose and was now unable to go anywhere or do anything tom did not disturb him but went away sorely perplexed and very much minded to tell a white lie to armsworth in whose eyes this would be an offencenot unpardonable for nothing with him was unpardonable save lying or crueltybut very grievous if a man had drunk too much wine in his house he would have simply kept his eye on him afterwards as a fool who did not know when he had his quotum but laudanum drinkinginvolving too the breaking of an engagement which well managed might have been of immense use to elsleywas a very different matter so tom knew not what to say or do and not knowing determined to wait on providence smartened himself as best he could went up to the great house and found miss mary  ill tell her she will manage it somehow if she is a woman much more if she is an angel as my father says  mary looked very much shocked and grieved answered hardly a word but said at last come in while i go and see my father he came into the smart drawingroom which he could see was seldom used for mary lived in her own room her father in his countinghouse or in his den in ten minutes she came down tom thought she had been crying  i have settled it poor unhappy man we will talk of something more pleasant tell me about your shipwreck and that placeaberalva is it not what a pretty name  tom told her wondering then and wondering long afterwards how she had settled it with her father she chatted on artlessly enough till the old man came in and to dinner in capital humour without saying one word of elsley  how has the old lion been tamed thought tom the two greatest affronts you could offer him in old times were to break an engagement and to despise his good cheer he did not know what the quiet oil on the waters of such a spirit as marys can effect  the evening passed pleasantly enough till nine in chatting over old times and listening to the history of every extraordinary trout and fox which had been killed within twenty miles when the footboy entered with a somewhat scared face  please sir is mr vavasour here  here who wants him  mrs brown sir in hemmelford street says he lodges with her and has been to seek for him at dr thurnalls  i think you had better go mr thurnall said mary quietly  indeed you had boy bother poets and the day they first began to breed in whitbury such an evening spoilt have a cup of coffee no then a glass of sherry  out went tom mrs brown had been up and seen him seemingly sleeping then had heard him run downstairs hurriedly he passed her in the passage looking very wild seemed sir just like my nevys wifes brother will ford before he made away with hesself  tom goes off post haste revolving many things in a crafty heart then he steers for boluss shop bolus is at the anglers arms but his assistant is in  did a gentleman call here just now in a long cloak with a felt wideawake  yes and the assistant looks confused enough for tom to rejoin  and you sold him laudanum  whyah  and you had sold him laudanum already this afternoon you young rascal how dare you twice in six hours ill hold you responsible for the mans life  you dare call me a rascal blusters the youth terrorstricken at finding how much tom knows  i am a member of the college of surgeons says tom recovering his coolness and have just been dining with mr armsworth i suppose you know him  the assistant shook in his shoes at the name of that terrible justice of the peace and of the war also and meekly and contritely he replied  oh sir what shall i do  youre in a very neat scrape you could not have feathered your nest better says tom quietly filling his pipe and thinking as you behave now i will get you out of it or leave you toyou know what as well as i get your hat  he went out and the youth followed trembling while tom formed his plans in his mind  the wild beast goes home to his lair to die and so may he for i fear its life and death now ill try the house where he was born somewhere in water lane it is i know  and toward water lane he hurried it was a lowlying offshoot of the town leading along the water meadows with a straggling row of houses on each side the perennial haunts of fever and ague before them on each side the road and fringed with pollard willows and tall poplars ran a tiny branch of the whit to feed some mill below and spread out meanwhile into ponds and mires full of offal and duckweed and rank floating grass a thick mist hung kneedeep over them and over the gardens right and left and as tom came down on the lane from the main street above he could see the mist spreading across the watermeadows and reflecting the moonbeams like a lake and as he walked into it he felt as if he were walking down a well and he hurried down the lane looking out anxiously ahead for the long cloak  at last he came to a better sort of house that might be it he would take the chance there was a man of the middle class and two or three women standing at the gate he went up  pray sir did a medical man named briggs ever live here  what do you want to know for  whytom thought matters were too serious for delicacyi am looking for a gentleman and thought he might have come here  and so he did if you mean one in a queer hat and a cloak  how long since  why he came up our garden an hour or more ago walked right into the parlour without with your leave or by your leave and stared at us all round like one out of his mind and so away as soon as ever i asked him what he was at  which way  to the river i expect i ran out and saw him go down the lane but i was not going far by night alone with any such strange customers  lend me a lanthorn then for heavens sake  the lanthorn is lent and tom starts again down the lane  now to search at the end of the lane is a cross road parallel to the river a broad still ditch lies beyond it with a little bridge across where one gets minnows for bait then a broad watermeadow then silver whit  the bridgegate is open tom hurries across the road to it the lanthorn shows him fresh footmarks going into the meadow forward  up and down in that meadow for an hour or more did tom and the trembling youth beat like a brace of pointer dogs stumbling into gripes and over sleeping cows and more than once stopping short just in time as they were walking into some broad and deep feeder  almost in despair and after having searched down the river bank for full two hundred yards tom was on the point of returning when his eye rested on a part of the stream where the mist lay higher than usual and let the reflection of the moonlight off the water reach his eye and in the moonlight ripples close to the farther bank of the riverwhat was that black lump  tom knew the spot well the river there is very broad and very shallow flowing round low islands of gravel and turf it was very low just now too as it generally is in october there could not be four inches of water where the black lump lay but on the side nearest him the water was full knee deep  the thing whatever it was was forty yards from him and it was a cold night for wading it might be a hassock of rushes a tuft of the great waterdock a dead dog one of the hangs with which the clubwater was studded torn up and stranded but yet to tom it had not a canny look  as usual here am i getting wet dirty and miserable about matters which are not the slightest concern of mine i believe i shall end by getting hanged or shot in somebody elses place with this confounded spirit of meddling yah how cold the water is  for in he went the grumbling honest dog stepped across to the black lump and lifted it up hastily enoughfor it was elsley vavasour  drowned  no but wet through and senseless from mingled cold and laudanum  whether he had meant to drown himself and lighting on the shallow had stumbled on till he fell exhausted or whether he had merely blundered into the stream careless whither he went tom knew not and never knew for elsley himself could not recollect  tom took him in his arms carried him ashore and up through the water meadow borrowed a blanket and a wheelbarrow at the nearest cottage wrapped him up and made the offending surgeons assistant wheel him to his lodgings  he sat with him there an hour and then entered marks house again with his usual composed face to find mark and mary sitting up in great anxiety  mr armsworth does the telegraph work at this time of night  ill make it if it is wanted but whats the matter  you will indeed  gad ill go myself and kick up the stationmaster whats the matter  that if poor mrs vavasour wishes to see her husband alive she must be here in fourandtwenty hours ill tell you all presently  mary my coat and comforter cries mark jumping up  and mary a pen and ink to write the message says tom  oh cannot i be of any use says mary  no you angel  you must not call me an angel mr thurnall after all what can i do which you have not done already  tom started grace had once used to him the very same words by the by what was it in the two women which made them so like certainly neither face nor fortune something in the tones of their voices  ah if grace had marys fortune or mary graces face thought tom as he hurried back to elsley and mark rushed down to the station  elsley was conscious when he returned and only too conscious all night he screamed in agonies of rheumatic fever by the next afternoon he was failing fast his heart was affected and tom knew that he might die any hour  the evening train brings two ladies valencia and lucia at the risk of her life the poor faithful wife has come  a gentlemans carriage is waiting for them though they have ordered none and as they go through the stationroom a plain little welldressed body comes humbly up to them  are either of these ladies mrs vavasour  yes iiis he alive gasps lucia  alive and better and expecting you  betterexpecting me almost shrieks she as valencia and mary for it is she help her to the carriage mary puts them in and turns away  are you not coming too asks valencia who is puzzled  no thank you madam i am going to take a walk john you know where to drive these ladies  little mary does not think it necessary to say that she with her fathers carriage has been down to two other afternoon trains upon the chance of finding them  but why is not frank headley with them when he is needed most and why are valencias eyes more red with weeping than even her sisters sorrow need have made them  because frank headley is rolling away in a french railway on his road to marseilles and to what heaven shall find for him to do  yes he is gone eastward ho among the many will he come westward ho again among the few  they are at the door of elsleys lodgings now tom thurnall meets them there and bows them upstairs silently lucia is so weak that she has to cling to the banister a moment and then with a strong shudder the spirit conquers the flesh and she hurries up before them both  it is a small low roomvalencia had expected that but she had expected too confusion and wretchedness for a note from major campbell ere he started had told her of the condition in which elsley had been found instead she finds neatnesseven gaiety fresh damask linen comfortable furniture a vase of hothouse flowers while the air was full of cool perfumes no one is likely to tell her that mary has furnished all at toms hintwe must smarten up the place for the poor wifes sake it will take something off the shock and i want to avoid shocks for her  so tom had worked with his own hands that morning arranging the room as carefully as any woman with that true doctors forethought and consideration which often issues in the loftiest because the most unconscious benevolence  he paused at the door  will you go in whispered he to valencia in a tone which meantyou had better not  not yeti daresay he is too weak  lucia darted in and tom shut the door behind her and waited at the stairhead better thought he to let the two poor creatures settle their own concerns it must end soon in any case  lucia rushed to the bedside drew back the curtains  tom moaned elsley  not tomlucia  lucialucia st just answered he in a low abstracted voice as if trying to recollect  lucia vavasouryour lucia  elsley slowly raised himself upon his elbow and looked into her face with a sad inquiring gaze  elsleydarling elsleydont you know me  yes very well indeed better than you know me i am not vavasour at all my name is briggsjohn briggs the apothecarys son come home to whitbury to die  she did not hear or did not care for those last words  elsley i am your wifeyour own wifewho never loved any one but younever never never  yes my wife at leastcurse them that they cannot deny said he in the same abstracted voice  oh god is he mad thought she elsley speak to mei am your luciayour love  and she tore off her bonnet and threw herself beside him on the bed and clasped him in her arms murmuringyour wife who never loved any one but you  slowly his frozen heart and frozen brain melted beneath the warmth of her great love but he did not speak only he passed his weak arm round her neck and she felt that his cheek was wet with tears while she murmured on like a cooing dove the same sweet words again  call me your love once more and i shall know that all is past  then call me no more elsley love whispered he call me john briggs and let us have done with shams for ever  no you are my elsleymy vavasour and i am your wife once more and the poor thing fondled his head as it lay upon the pillow my own elsley to whom i gave myself body and soul for whom i would die now oh such a deathany death  how could i doubt youfool that i was  no it was all my fault it was all my odious temper but we will be happy now will we not  elsley smiled sadly and began babblingyes they would take a farm and he would plough and sow and be of some use before he died but promise me one thing cried he with sudden strength  what  that you will go home and burn all the poetryall the manuscripts and never let the children write a versea versewhen i am dead and his head sank back and his jaw dropped  he is dead cried the poor impulsive creature with a shriek which brought in tom and valencia  he is not dead madam but you must be very gentle with him if we are to  tom saw that there was little hope  i will do anythingonly save himsave him mr thurnall till i have atoned for all  you have little enough to atone for madam said tom as he busied himself about the sufferer he saw that all would soon be over and would have had mrs vavasour withdraw but she was so really good a nurse as long as she could control herself that he could hardly spare her  so they sat together by the sickbed side as the short hours passed into the long and the long hours into the short again and the october dawn began to shine through the shutterless window  a weary eventless night it was a night as of many years as worse and worse grew the weak frame and tom looked alternately at the heaving chest and shortening breath and rattling throat and then at the pale still face of the lady  better she should sit by thought he and watch him till she is tired out it will come on her the more gently after all he will die at sunrise as so many die  at last be began gently feeling for elsleys pulse  her eye caught his movement and she half sprang up but at a gesture from him she sank quietly on her knees holding her husbands hand in her own  elsley turned toward her once ere the film of death had fallen and looked her full in the face with his beautiful eyes full of love then the eyes paled and faded but still they sought for her painfully long after she had buried her head in the coverlet unable to bear the sight  and so vanished away elsley vavasour poet and genius into his own place  let us pray said a deep voice from behind the curtain it was mark armsworths he had come over with the first dawn to bring the ladies food had slipped upstairs to ask what news found the door open and entered in time to see the last gasp  lucia kept her head still buried and tom for the first time for many a year knelt as the old banker commended to god the soul of our dear brother just departing this life then mark glided quietly downstairs and valencia rising tried to lead mrs vavasour away  but then broke out in all its wild passion the irish temperament let us pass it over why try to earn a little credit by depicting the agony and the weakness of a sister  at last thurnall got her downstairs mark was there still having sent off for his carriage he quietly put her arm through his led her off worn out and unresisting drove her home delivered her and valencia into marys keeping and then asked tom to stay and sit with him  i hope ive no very bad conscience boy but marys busy with the poor young thing mere child she is too to go through such a night and somehow i dont like to be left alone after such a sight as that                                       tom said mark as they sat smoking in silence after breakfast in the study tom  yes sir  that was an awful deathbed tom  tom was silent  i dont mean that he died hard as we say but so young tom and i suppose poets souls are worth something like other peoplesperhaps more i cant understand em but my mary seems to and people like her who think a poet the finest thing in the world i laugh at it all when i am jolly and call it sentiment and cant but i believe that they are nearer heaven than i am though i think they dont quite know where heaven is nor where with a wicked wink in spite of the sadness of his tonewhere they themselves are either  ill tell you sir i have seen men enough diewe doctors are hardened to it but i have seen unprofessional deathsmen we didnt kill ourselves i have seen men drowned shot hanged run over and worse deaths than that sir tooand somehow i never felt any death like that mans granted he began by trying to set the world right when he hadnt yet set himself right but wasnt it some credit to see that the world was wrong  i dont know that the worlds a very good world  to you and me but there are men who have higher notions than i of what this world ought to be and for aught i know they are right that aberalva curate headley had and so had briggs in his own way i thought him once only a poor discontented devil who quarrelled with his bread and butter because he hadnt teeth to eat it with but there was more in the fellow coxcomb as he was tisnt often that i let that croaking old bogy madam might have been trouble me but i cannot help thinking that if fifteen years ago i had listened to his vapourings more and bullied him about them less he might have been here still  you wouldnt have been then well for you that you didnt catch his fever  and write verses too dont make me laugh sir on such a day as this i always comfort myself withits no business of mine but somehow i cant do so just now and tom sat silent more softened than he had been for years  lets talk of something else said mark at last you had the cholera very bad down there i hear  oh sharp but short said tom who disliked any subject which brought grace to his mind  any on my lords estate with the queer name  not a case we stopped the devil out there thanks to his lordship  so did we here we were very near in for it though i fancyat least i chose to fancy sothought it a good opportunity to clean whitbury once for all  its just like you well  well i offered the towncouncil to drain the whole town at my own expense if theyd let me have the sewage and that only made things worse for as soon as the beggars found out the sewage was worth anything they were down on me as if i wanted to do themi mark armsworthand would sooner let half the town rot with an epidemic than have reason to fancy id made any money out of them so a pretty fight i had for halfadozen meetings till i called in my lord and sir he came down by the next express like a trump all the way from town and gave them such a piece of his mindwas going to have the board of health down and turn on the government tap commissioners and all and cost em hundreds till the fellows shook in their shoesand so i conquered and here we are as clean as a nutand a fig for the choleraexcept down in waterlane which i dont know what to do with for if tradesmen will run up houses on spec in a watermeadow who can stop them there ought to be a law for it say i but i say a good many things in the twelve months that nobody minds but my dear boy if one man in a town has pluck and money he may do it itll cost him a few ive had to pay the main part myself after all but i suppose god will make it up to a man somehow thats old marks faith at least now i want to talk to you about yourself my lord comes into town today and you must see him  why then he cant help me with the bashibazouks can he  bashifiddles i say tom the more i think over it the more it wont do its throwing yourself away they say that turkish contingent is getting on terribly ill  more need of me to make them well  hang iti meanhasnt justice done it and so on the papers are full of it  well quoth tom and why should it  why man alive if england spends all this money on the men she ought to do her duty by them  i dont see that as pecksniff says if england expects every man to do his duty shes very sanguine and will be much disappointed they dont intend to do their duty by her any more than i do so why should she do her duty by them  dont intend to do your duty  im going out because englands money is necessary to me and england hires me because my skill is necessary to her i didnt think of duty when i settled to go and why should she ill get all out of her i can in the way of pay and practice and she may get all she can out of me in the way of work as for being illused i never expect to be anything else in this life im sure i dont care and im sure she dont so live and let live talk plain truth and leave bunkum for right honourables who keep their places thereby give me another weed  queer old philosopher you are but go you shant  go i will sir dont stop me ive my reasons and theyre good ones enough  the conversation was interrupted by the servantlord minchampstead was waiting at mr armsworths office  early bird his lordship and gets the worm accordingly says mark as he hurries off to attend on his ideal hero you come over to the shop in halfanhour mind  but why  confound you sir you talk of having your reasons i have mine  mark looked quite cross so tom gave way and went in due time to the bank  standing with his back to the fire in marks inner room he saw the old cotton prince  and a prince he looks like quoth tom to himself as he waited in the bank outside and looked through the glass screen how well the old man wears i wonder how many fresh thousands he has made since i saw him last seven years ago  and a very noble person lord minchampstead did look one to whom hats went off almost without their owners will tall and portly with a soldierlike air of dignity and command which was relieved by the goodnature of the countenance yet it was a goodnature which would stand no trifling the jaw was deep and broad though finely shaped the mouth firm set the nose slightly aquiline the brow of great depth and height though narrowaltogether a julius caesars type of head that of a man born to rule self and therefore to rule all he met  tom looked over his dress not forgetting like a true englishman to mark what sort of boots he wore they were boots not quite fashionable but carefully cleaned on trees trousers strapped tightly over them which had adopted the military stripe but retained the slit at the ankle which was in vogue forty years ago frock coat with a velvet collar buttoned up but not too far high and tight blue cravat below an immense shirt collar a certain care and richness of dress throughout but soberly behind the fashion while the hat was a very shabby and broken one and the whip still more shabby and broken all which indicated to tom that his lordship let his tailor and his valet dress him and though not unaware that it behoved him to set out his person as it deserved was far too fine a gentleman to trouble himself about looking fine  mark looks round sees tom and calls him in  mr thurnall i am glad to meet you sir you did me good service at pentremochyn and did it cheaply i was agreeably surprised i confess at receiving a bill for four pounds seven shillings and sixpence where i expected one of twenty or thirty  i charged according to what my time was really worth there my lord i heartily wish it had been worth more  no doubt says my lord in the blandest but the driest tone  some men would have under a sense of toms merits sent him a cheque offhand for fiveandtwenty pounds but that is not lord minchampsteads way of doing business he had paid simply the sum asked but he had set tom down in his memory as a man whom he could trust to do good work and to do it cheaply and now  you are going to join the turkish contingent  i am  you know that part of the world well i believe  intimately  and the languages spoken there  by no means all russian and tartar well turkish tolerably with a smattering of two or three circassian dialects  humph a fair list any persian  only a few words  humph if you can learn one language i presume you can learn another now mr thurnall i have no doubt that you will do your duty in the turkish contingent  tom bowed  but i must ask you if your resolution to join it is fixed  i only join it because i can get no other employment at the seat of war  humph you wish to go then in any case to the seat of war  certainly  no doubt you have sufficient reasons armsworth this puts the question in a new light  tom looked round at mark and behold his face bore a ludicrous mixture of anger and disappointment and perplexity he seemed to be trying to make signals to tom and to be afraid of doing so openly before the great man  he is as wilful and as foolish as a girl my lord and ive told him so  everybody knows his own business best armsworth mr thurnall have you any fancy for the post of queens messenger  i should esteem myself only too happy as one  they are not to be obtained now as easily as they were fifty years ago and are given as you may know to a far higher class of men than they were formerly but i shall do my best to obtain you one when an opportunity offers  tom was beginning his profusest thanks for was not his fortune made but lord minchampstead stopped him with an uplifted finger  and meanwhile there are foreign employments of which neither those who bestow them nor those who accept them are expected to talk much but for which you if i am rightly informed would be especially fitted  tom bowed and his face spoke a hundred assents  very well if you will come over to minchampstead tomorrow i will give you letters to friends of mine in town i trust that they may give you a better opportunity than the bashibazouks will of displaying that courage address and selfcommand which i understand you possess in so uncommon a degree good morning and forth the great man went  most opposite were the actions of the two whom he had left behind him  tom dances about the room hurrahing in a whisper  my fortunes made the secret service oh what bliss the thing ive always longed for  mark dashes himself desperately back in his chair and shoots his angry legs straight out almost tripping up tom  you abominable ass you have done it with a vengeance why he has been pumping me about you this month one word from you to say youd have stayed and he was going to make you agent for all his cornish property  dont he wish he may get it catch a fish climbing trees catch me staying at home when i can serve my queen and my country and find a sphere for the full development of my talents oh wont i be as wise as a serpent wont i be complimented by  himself as his best lurcher worth any ten needy poles greedy armenians traitors renegades ragtag and bobtail ill shave my head tomorrow and buy me an assortment of wigs of every hue  take care tom thurnall after pride comes a fall and he who digs a pit may fall into it himself has this mornings deathbed given you no lesson that it is as well not to cast ourselves down from where god has put us for whatsoever seemingly fine ends of ours lest doing so we tempt god once too often  your father quoted that text to john briggs here many years ago might he not quote it now to you true not one word of murmuring not even of regret or fear has passed his good old lips about your selfwilled plan he has such utter confidence in you such utter carelessness about himself such utter faith in god that he can let you go without a sigh but will you make his courage an excuse for your own rashness again beware after pride may come a fall                                       on the fourth day elsley was buried mark and tom were the only mourners lucy and valencia stayed at marks house to return next day under toms care to eaton square  the two mourners walked back sadly from the churchyard i shall put a stone over him tom he ought to rest quietly now for he had little rest enough in this life  now i want to talk to you about something when ive taken off my hatband that is for it would be hardly lucky to mention such matters with a hatband on  tom looked up wondering  tell me about his wife meanwhile what made him marry her was she a pretty woman  pretty enough i believe before she married but i hardly think he married her for her face  of course not said the old man with emphasis of course not whatever faults he had hed be too sensible for that dont you marry for a face tom i didnt  tom opened his eyes at this last assertion but humbly expressed his intention of not falling into that snare  ah you dont believe me well she was a beautiful womanid like to see her fellow now in the countyand i wont deny i was proud of her but she had ten thousand pounds tom and as for her looks why if youll believe me after wed been married three months i didnt know whether she had any looks or not what are you smiling at you young rogue  report did say that one look of mrs armsworths to the last would do more to manage mr armsworth than the opinions of the whole bench of bishops  reports a liar and youre a puppy you dont know yet whether it was a pleasant look or a cross one lad but stillwell she was an angel and kept old mark straighter than hes ever been since not that hes so very bad now though i sometimes think marys better even than her mother that girls a good girl tom  report agrees with you in that at least  fool if it didnt and as for looksi can speak to you as to my own sonwhy handsome is that handsome does  and that handsome has for you must honestly put that into the account  you think so so do i well then tomand here mark was seized with a tendency to st vituss dance and began overhauling every button on his coat twitching up his black gloves till as undertakers gloves are generally meant to do they burst in halfadozen places taking off his hat wiping his head fiercely and putting the hat on again behind before till at last he snatched his arm from toms and gripping him by the shoulder recommenced  you think so eh well i must say it so id better have it out now hatband or none what do you think of the man who married my daughter face and all  i should think quoth tom wondering who the happy man could be that he would be so lucky in possessing such a heart that he would be a fool to care about the face  then be as good as your word and take her yourself ive watched you this last week and youll make her a good husband there i have spoken let me hear no more about it  and mark half pushed tom from him and puffed on by his side highly excited  if mark had knocked the young doctor down he would have been far less astonished and far less puzzled too well thought he i fancied nothing could throw my steady old engine off the rails but i am off them now with a vengeance what to say he knew not at last  it is just like your generosity sir you have been a brother to my father and now  and now ill be a father to you old mark does nothing by halves  but sir however lucky i should be in possessing miss armsworths heart what reason have i to suppose that i do so i never spoke a word to her i neednt say that she never did to mewhich  of course she didnt and of course you didnt should like to have seen you making love to my daughter indeed no sir its my will and pleasure ive settled it and done it shall be i shall go home and tell mary and shell obey mei should like to see her do anything else hoity toity fathers must be masters sir even in these flyaway new times when young ones choose their own husbands and their own politics and their own hounds and their own religion too and be hanged to them  what did this unaccustomed bit of bluster mean for unaccustomed it was and tom knew well that mary armsworth had her own way and managed her father as completely as he managed whitbury  humph it is impossible and yet it must be this explains his being so anxious that lord minchampstead should approve of me i have found favour in the poor dear things eyes i suppose and the good old fellow knows it and wont betray her and so shams tyrant just like him butthat mary armsworth should care for him vain fellow that he was to fancy it and yet when he began to put things together little silences little looks little nothings which all together might make something he would not slander her to himself by supposing that her attentions to his father were paid for his sake but he could not forget that it was she always who read his letters aloud to the old man or that she had taken home and copied out the story of his shipwreck beside it was the only method of explaining marks conduct save on the supposition that he had suddenly been changed by the fairies in his old age instead of in the cradle as usual  it was a terrible temptation and to no man more than to thomas thurnall he was no boy to hanker after mere animal beauty he had no delicate visions or lofty aspirations and he knew no man better the plain english of fifty thousand pounds and mark armsworths daughtera good house a good consulting practice for he would take his md of course a good station in the county a good clarence with a good pair of horses good plate a good dinner with good company thereat and over and above all his father to live with him and with mary whom he loved as a daughter in luxury and peace to his lifes endwhy it was all that he had ever dreamed of three times more than he ever hoped to gainnot to mention for how oddly little dreams of selfish pleasure slip in at such momentsthat he would buy such a rosss microscope and keep such a horse for a sly byday with the whitford priors oh to see once again a fox break from coldharbour gorse  and then rose up before his imagination those drooping steadfast eyes and grace harvey the suspected the despised seemed to look through and through his inmost soul as through a home which belonged of right to her and where no other woman must dwell or could dwell for she was there and he knew it and knew that even if he never married till his dying day he should sell his soul by marrying any one but her and why should i not sell my soul asked he almost fiercely i sell my talents my time my strength id sell my life tomorrow and go to be shot for a shilling a day if it would make the old man comfortable for life and why not my soul too dont that belong to me as much as any other part of me why am i to be condemned to sacrifice my prospects in life to a girl of whose honesty i am not even sure what is this intolerable fascination witch i almost believe in mesmerism now again i say why should i not sell my soul as id sell my coat if the bargains but a good one  and if he did who would ever knownot even grace herself the secret was his and no one elses  or if they did know what matter dozens of men sell their souls every year and thrive thereon tradesmen lawyers squires popular preachers great noblemen kings and princes he would be in good company at all events and while so many live in glass houses who dare throw stones  but then curiously enough there came over him a vague dread of possible evil such as he had never felt before he had been trying for years to raise himself above the power of fortune and he had succeeded ill enough but he had never lost heart robbed shipwrecked lost in deserts cheated at cards shot in revolutions begging his bread he had always been the same unconquerable lighthearted tom whose motto was fall light and dont whimper better luck next round but now what if he played his last courtcard and fortune out of her closehidden hand laid down a trump thereon with quiet sneering smile and she would he knew somehow that he should not thrive his children would die of the measles his horses break their knees his plate be stolen his house catch fire and mark armsworth die insolvent what a fool he was to fancy such nonsense here he had been slaving all his life to keep his father and now he could keep him why he would be justified right a good son in doing the thing how hard how unjust of those upper powers in which he believed so vaguely to forbid his doing it  and how did he know that they forbid him that is too deep a question to be analysed here but this thing is noteworthy that there came next over toms mind a stranger feeling stilla fancy that if he did this thing and sold his soul he could not answer for himself thenceforth on the score of merest respectability could not answer for himself not to drink gamble squander his money neglect his father prove unfaithful to his wife that the innate capacity for blackguardism which was as strong in him as in any man might and probably would run utterly riot thenceforth he felt as if he should cast away his last anchor and drift helplessly down into utter shame and ruin it may have been very fanciful but so he felt and felt it so strongly too that in less time than i have taken to write this he had turned to mark armsworth  sir you are what i have always found you do you wish me to be what you have always found me  id be sorry to see you anything else boy  then sir i cant do this in honour i cant  are you married already thundered mark  not quite as bad as that and in spite of his agitation tom laughed but hysterically at the notion but fool i am for i am in love with another woman i am sir went he on hurriedly boy that i am and she dont even know it but if you be the man i take you for you may be angry with me but youll understand me anything but be a rogue to you and to mary and to my own self too fool ill be but rogue i wont  mark strode on in silence frightfully red in the face for full five minutes then he turned sharply on tom and catching him by the shoulder thrust him from him  therego and dont let me see or hear of you that is till i tell you go along i say humhum in a tone half of wrath and half of triumph his fathers child if you will ruin yourself i cant help it  nor i sir said tom in a really piteous tone bemoaning the day he ever saw aberalva as he watched mark stride into his own gate if i had but had common luck if i had but brought my £1500 safe home here and never seen grace and married this girl out of hand common luck is all i ask and i never get it  and tom went home sulkier than a bear but he did not let his father find out his trouble it was his last evening with the old man tomorrow he must go to london and thento scramble and twist about the world again till he died well why not a man must die somehow but its hard on the poor old father said tom  as tom was packing his scanty carpetbag next morning there was a knock at the door he looked out and saw armsworths clerk what could that mean had the old man determined to avenge the slight and to do so on his father by claiming some old debt there might be many between him and the doctor and toms heart beat fast as jane put a letter into his hand  no answer sir the clerk says  tom opened it and turned over the contents more than once ere he could believe his own eyes  it was neither more nor less than a cheque on marks london banker for just five hundred pounds  a halfsheet was wrapped round it on which were written these words  to thomas thurnall esq for behaving like a gentleman the cheque will be duly honoured at messrs smith brown and jones lombard street no acknowledgment is to be sent dont tell your father mark armsworth  queer old world it is said tom when the first burst of childish delight was over and jolly old flirt dame fortune after all if i had written this in a book now whod have believed it  father said he as he kissed the old man farewell ive a little money come in ill send you fifty from london in a day or two and lodge a hundred and fifty more with smith and co so youll be quite in clover while i am poisoning the turkeys or at some better work  the old man thanked god for his good son and only hoped that he was not straitening himself to buy luxuries for a useless old fellow  another sacred kiss on that white head and tom was away for london with a fuller purse and a more selfcontented heart too than he had known for many a year  and elsley was left behind under the grey church spire sleeping with his fathers and vexing his soul with poetry no more mark has covered him now with a fair portland slab he took claude mellot to it this winter before church time and stood over it long with a puzzled look as if dimly discovering that there were more things in heaven and earth than were dreamed of in his philosophy  wonderful fellow he was after all mary shall read us out some of his verses tonight but i say why should people be born clever only to make them all the more miserable  perhaps they learn the more papa by their sorrows said quiet little mary and so they are the gainers after all  and none of them having any better answer to give they all three went into the church to see if one could be found there  and so tom thurnall too went eastwardho to take like all the rest what god might send     chapter xxvi  too late   and how was poor grace harvey prospering the while while comfortable folks were praising her at their leisure as a heroine grace harvey was learning so she opined by fearful lessons how much of the unheroic element was still left in her the first lesson had come just a week after the yacht sailed for port madoc when the cholera had all but subsided and it came in this wise before breakfast one morning she had to go up to heales shop for some cordial her mother had passed so she said a sleepless night and come downstairs nervous and without appetite oppressed with melancholy both in the spiritual and the physical sense of the word it was not often so with her now she had escaped the cholera the remoteness of her house her care never to enter the town the purity of the water which trickled always fresh from the cliff close by and last but not least the scrupulous cleanliness which to do her justice she had always observed and in which she had trained up graceall these had kept her safe  but grace could see that her dread of the cholera was intense she even tried at first to prevent grace from entering an infected house but that proposal was answered by a look of horror which shamed her into silence and she contented herself with all but tabooing grace making her change her clothes whenever she came in refusing to sit with her almost to eat with her but over and above all this she had grown moody peevish subject to violent bursts of crying fits of superstitious depression spent sometimes whole days in reading experimental books arguing with the preachers gadding to and fro to every sermon arminian or calvinist and at last even to churchwalking in dry places poor soul seeking rest and finding none  all this betokened some malady of the mind rather than of the body but what that malady was grace dare not even try to guess perhaps it was one of the fits of religious melancholy so common in the west country like her own in fact perhaps it was all nerves her mother was growing old and had a great deal of business to worry her and so grace thrust away the horrible suspicion by little selfdeceptions  she went into the shop tom was busy upon his knees behind the counter she made her request  ah miss harvey and he sprang up it will be a pleasure to serve you once more in ones life i am just going  going where  to turkey i find this place too pleasant and too poor not work enough and certainly not pay enough so i have got an appointment as surgeon in the turkish contingent and shall be off in an hour  to turkey to the war  yes its a long time since i have seen any fighting i am quite out of practice in gunshot wounds there is the medicine goodbye you will shake hands once for the sake of our late cholera work together  grace held out her hand mechanically across the counter and he took it but she did not look into his face only she said half to herself  well better so i have no doubt you will be very useful among them  confound the icicle thought tom i really believe that she wants to get rid of me and he would have withdrawn his hand in a pet but she held it still  quaint it was those two strong natures each loving the other better than anything else on earth and yet parted by the thinnest pane of ice which a single look would have melted she longing to follow that man over the wide world slave for him die for him he longing for the least excuse for making a fool of himself and crying take me as i take you without a penny for better for worse if their eyes had but met but they did not meet and the pane of ice kept them asunder as surely as a wall of iron  was it that tom was piqued at her seeming coldness or did he expect before he made any advances that she should show that she wished at least for his respect by saying something to clear up the ugly question which lay between them or was he as i suspect so ready to melt and make a fool of himself that he must needs harden his own heart by help of the devil himself and yet there are excuses for him it would have been a sore trial to any mans temper to quit aberalva in the belief that he left fifteen hundred pounds behind him be that as it may he said carelessly after a moments pause  well farewell and by the bye about that little money matter the month of which you spoke once was up yesterday i suppose i am not worthy yet so i shall be humble and wait patiently dont hurry yourself i beg of you on my account  she snatched her hand from his without a word and rushed out of the shop  he returned to his packing whistling away as shrill as any blackbird  little did he think that graces heart was bursting as she hurried down the street covering her face in her veil as if every one would espy her dark secret in her countenance  but she did not go home to hysterics and vain tears an awful purpose had arisen in her mind under the pressure of that great agony heavens how she loved that man to be suspected by him was torture but she could bear that it was her cross she could carry it lie down on it and endure but wrong him she could notwould not it was sinful enough while he was there but doubly unbearably sinful when he was going to a foreign country when he would need every farthing he had so not for her own sake but for his she spoke to her mother when she went home and found her sitting over her bible in the little parlour vainly trying to find a text which suited her distemper  mother you have the bible before you there  yes child why what asked she looking up uneasily  grace fixed her eyes on the ground she could not look her mother in the face  do you ever read the thirtysecond psalm mother  which why not child  let us read it together then now  and grace taking up her own bible sat quietly down and read as none in that parish save she could read  blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven and whose sin is covered  blessed is the man unto whom the lord imputeth not iniquity and in whose spirit there is no guile  when i kept silence my bones waxed old through my groaning all the day long  for day and night thy hand was heavy upon me my moisture is turned to the drought of summer  i acknowledge my sin unto thee and mine iniquity have i not hid  i said i will confess my transgressions unto the lord and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin  grace stopped choked with tears which the pathos of her own voice had called up she looked at her mother there were no tears in her eyes only a dull thwart look of terror and suspicion the shaft however bravely and cunningly sped had missed its mark  poor grace her usual eloquence utterly failed her as most things do in which one is wont to trust before the pressure of a real and horrible evil she had no heart to make fine sentences to preach a brilliant sermon of commonplaces what could she say that her mother had not known long before she was born and throwing herself on her knees at her mothers feet she grasped both her hands and looked into her face imploringlymother mother mother was all that she could say but their tone meant more than all wordsreproof counsel comfort utter tenderness and undercurrent of clear deep trust bubbling up from beneath all passing suspicions however dark and foul were in it but they were vain  baser terror the parent of baser suspicion had hardened that womans heart for the while and all she answered was  get up what is this foolery  i will not i will not rise till you have told me  what  whetherand she forced the words slowly out in a low whisper whether you knowanything ofofmr thurnalls moneyhis belt  is the girl mad belt money do you take me for a thief wench  no no no only say youyou know nothing of it  psha girl go to your school and the old woman tried to rise  only say that only let me know that it is a dreama hideous dream which the devil put into my wicked wicked heartand let me know that i am the basest meanest of daughters for harbouring such a thought a moment it will be comfort bliss to what i endure only say that and i will crawl to your feet and beg for your forgivenessask you to beat me like a child as i shall deserve drive me out if you will and let me die as i shall deserve only say the word and take this fire from before my eyes which burns day and nighttill my brain is dried up with misery and shame mother mother speak  but then burst out the horrible suspicion which falsehood suspecting all others of being false as itself had engendered in that mothers heart  yes viper i see your plan do you think i do not know that you are in love with that fellow  grace started as if she had been shot and covered her face with her hands  yes and want me to betray myselfto tell a lie about myself that you may curry favour with hima penniless unbelieving  mother almost shrieked grace i can bear no more say that it is a lie and then kill me if you will  it is a lie from beginning to end what else should it be and the woman in the hurry of her passion confirmed the equivocation with an oath and then ran on as if to turn her own thoughts as well as graces into commonplaces about a poor old mother who cares for nothing but you who has worked her fingers to the bone for years to leave you a little money when she is gone i wish i were gone i wish i were out of this wretched ungrateful world i do to have my own child turn against me in my old age  grace lifted her hands from her face and looked steadfastly at her mother and behold she knew not how or why she felt that her mother had forsworn herself a strong shudder passed through her she rose and was leaving the room in silence  where are you going hussy stop screamed her mother between her teeth her rage and cruelty rising as it will with weak natures in the very act of triumphto your young man  to pray said grace quietly and locking herself into the empty schoolroom gave vent to all her feelings but not in tears  how she upbraided herselfshe had not used her strength she had not told her mother all her heart and yet how could she tell her heart how face her mother with such vague suspicions hardly supported by a single fact how argue it out against her like a lawyer and convict her to her face what daughter could do that who had human love and reverence left in her no to touch her inward witness as the quakers well and truly term it was the only method and it had failed god help me was her only cry but the help did not come yet there came over her instead a feeling of utter loneliness willis dead thurnall gone her mother estranged and like a child lost upon a great moor she looked round all heaven and earth and there was none to counsel none to guide perhaps not even god for would he help her as long as she lived in sin and was she not living in sin deadly sin as long as she knew what she was sure she knew and left the wrong unrighted  it is sometimes true the popular saying that sunshine comes after storm sometimes true or who could live but not always not even often equally true is the popular antithet that misfortunes never come single that in most human lives there are periods of trouble blow following blow wave following wave from opposite and unexpected quarters with no natural or logical sequence till all gods billows have gone over the soul  how paltry and helpless in such dark times are all theories of mere selfeducation all proud attempts like that of göthes wilhelm meister to hang selfpoised in the centre of the abyss and there organise for oneself a character by means of circumstances easy enough and graceful enough does that dream look while all the circumstances themselvesall which stands aroundare easy and graceful obliging and commonplace like the sphere of petty experiences with which göthe surrounds his insipid hero easy enough it seems for a man to educate himself without god as long as he lies comfortably on a sofa with a cup of coffee and a review but what if that daemonic element of the universe which göthe confessed and yet in his luxuriousness tried to ignore because he could not explainwhat if that broke forth over the graceful and prosperous student as it may any moment what if some thing or some person or many things or many persons one after the other questions which he must get answered then or die took him up and dashed him down again and again and again till he was ready to cry i reckoned till morning that like a lion he will break all my bones from morning till evening he will make an end of me what if he thus found himself hurled perforce amid the real universal experiences of humanity and made free in spite of himself by doubt and fear and horror of great darkness of the brotherhood of woe common alike to the simplest peasantwoman and to every great soul perhaps who has left his impress and sign manual upon the hearts of after generations jew heathen or christian men of the most opposite creeds and aims whether it be moses or socrates isaiah or epictetus augustine or mohammed dante or bernard shakspeare or bacon or göthes self no doubt though in his tremendous pride he would not confess it even to himselfeach and all of them have this one fact in commonthat once in their lives at least they have gone down into the bottomless pit and stato all infernoas the children used truly to say of dante and there out of the utter darkness have asked the question of all questionsis there a god and if there be what is he doing with me  what refuge then in selfeducation when a man feels himself powerless in the gripe of some unseen and inevitable power and knows not whether it be chance or necessity or a devouring fiend to wrap himself sternly in himself and cry i will endure though all the universe be against mehow fine it soundsbut who has done it could a man do it perfectly but for one momentcould he absolutely and utterly for one moment isolate himself and accept his own isolation as a fact he were then and there a madman or a suicide as it is his nature happily too weak for that desperate selfassertion falls back recklessly on some form more or less graceful according to the temperament of the ancient panacea let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die why should a man educate self when he knows not whither he goes what will befall him tonight no there is but one escape one chink through which we may see light one rock on which our feet may find standingplace even in the abyss and that is the belief intuitive inspired due neither to reasoning nor to study that the billows are gods billows and that though we go down to hell he is there also the belief that not we but he is educating us that these seemingly fantastic and incoherent miseries storm following earthquake and earthquake fire as if the caprice of all the demons were let loose against us have in his mind a spiritual coherence an organic unity and purpose though we see it not that sorrows do not come singly only because he is making short work with our spirits and because the more effect he sees produced by one blow the more swiftly he follows it up by another till in one great and varied crisis seemingly long to us but short enough compared with immortality our spirits may be    heated hot with burning fears   and bathed in baths of hissing tears   and battered with the strokes of doom   to shape and use  and thus perhaps it was with poor grace harvey at least happily for her she began after a while to think that it was so only after a while though there was at first a phase of repining of doubt almost of indignation against high heaven who shall judge her what blame if the crucified one writhe when the first nail is driven what blame if the stoutest turn sick and giddy at the first homethrust of that sword which pierces the joints and marrow and lays bare to self the secrets of the heart god gives poor souls time to recover their breaths ere he strikes again and if he be not angry why should we condemn  poor grace her sorrows had been thickening fast during the last few months she was schoolmistress again true but where were her children those of them whom she loved best were swept away by the cholera and could she face the remnant each in mourning for a parent or a brother that alone was grief enough for her and yet that was the lightest of all her griefs she loved tom thurnallhow much she dared not tell herself she longed to save him she had thought and not untruly during the past cholera weeks that he was softened opened to new impressions but he had avoided her more than everperhaps suspected her again more than everand now he was gone gone for ever that too was grief enough alone but darkest and deepest of all darker and deeper than the past shame of being suspected by him she loved was the shame of suspecting her own motherof believing herself as she did privy to that shameful theft and yet unable to make restitution there was the horror of all horrors the close prison which seemed to stifle her whole soul the only chink through which a breath of air seemed to come and keep her heart alive was the hope that somehow somewhere she might find that belt and restore it without her mothers knowledge  but morethe first of september was come and gone the bill for fiveandtwenty pounds was due and was not met grace choking down her honest pride went off to the grocer and with tears which he could not resist persuaded him to renew the bill for one month more and now that month was all but past and yet there was no money eight or ten people who owed mrs harvey money had died of the cholera some of course had left no effects and all hope of their working out their debts was gone some had left money behind them but it was still in the lawyers hands some of it at sea some on mortgage some in houses which must be sold till their affairs were wound upa sadly slow affair when a country attorney has a poor mans unprofitable business to transactnothing could come in to mrs harvey to and fro she went with knitted brow and heavy heart and brought home again only promises as she had done a hundred times before one day she went up to mrs heale old heale owed her thirteen pounds and more but that was not the least reason for paying his cholera patients had not paid him and whether heale had the money by him or not he was not going to pay his debts till other people paid theirs mrs harvey stormed mrs heale gave her as good as she brought and mrs harvey threatened to county court her husband whereon mrs heale en revanche dragged out the books and displayed to the poor widows horrorstruck eyes an account for medicine and attendance on her and grace which nearly swallowed up the debt poor grace was overwhelmed when her mother came home and upbraided her in her despair with being a burden was she not a burden must she not be one henceforth no she would take in needlework labour in the fields heave ballast among the coarse paupergirls on the quaypool anything rather but how to meet the present difficulty  we must sell our furniture mother  for a quarter of what its worth never girl no the lord will provide said she between her clenched teeth with a sort of hysteric chuckle the lord will provide  i believe it i believe it said poor grace but faith is weak and the day is very dark mother  dark ay and may be darker yet but the lord will provide he prepares a table in the wilderness for his saints that the world dont think of  oh mother and do you think there is any door of hope  go to bed girl go to bed and leave me to see to that find my spectacles wherever have you laid them to now ill look over the books awhile  do let me go over them for you  no you shant i suppose youll be wanting to make out your poor old mothers been cheating somebody why not if im a thief miss eh  oh mother mother dont say that again  and grace glided out meekly to her own chamber which was on the groundfloor adjoining the parlour and there spent more than one hour in prayer from which no present comfort seemed to come yet who shall say that it was all unanswered  at last her mother came upstairs and put her head in angrilywhy bent you in bed girl sitting up this way  i was praying mother says grace looking up as she knelt  praying whats the use of praying and wholl hear you if you pray what you wants a husband to keep you out of the workhouse and you wont get that by kneeling here get to bed i say or ill pull you up  grace obeyed uncomplaining but utterly shocked though she was not unacquainted with those frightful fits of morose unbelief even of fierce blasphemy to which the excitable westcountry mind is liable after having been overstrained by superstitious selfinspection and by the desperate attempt to prove itself right and safe from frames and feelings while fact and conscience proclaim it wrong  the westcountry people are apt to attribute these paroxysms to the possession of a devil and so did grace that night  trembling with terror and loving pity she lay down and began to pray afresh for that poor wild mother  at last the fear crossed her that her mother might make away with herself but a few years before another classleader in aberalva had attempted to do so and had all but succeeded the thought was intolerable she must go to her face reproaches blows anything she rose from her bed and went to the door it was fastened on the outside  a cold perspiration stood on her forehead she opened her lips to shriek to her mother but checked herself when she heard her stirring gently in the outer room her pulses throbbed too loudly at first for her to hear distinctly but she felt that it was no moment for giving way to emotion by a strong effort of will she conquered herself and then with that preternatural acuteness of sense which some women possess she could hear everything her mother was doing she heard her put on her shawl her bonnet she heard her open the front door gently it was now long past midnight whither could she be going at that hour  she heard her go gently to the left past the window and yet her footfall was all but inaudible no rain had fallen and her shoes ought to have sounded on the hard earth she must have taken them off there she was stopping just by the schooldoor now she moved again she must have stopped to put on her shoes for now grace could hear her steps distinctly down the earth bank and over the rattling shingle of the beach where was she going grace must follow  the door was fast but in a moment she had removed the table opened the shutter and the window  thank god that i stayed here on the ground floor instead of going back to my own room when major campbell left it is a providence the lord has not forsaken me yet said the sweet saint as catching up her shawl she wrapped it round her and slipping through the window crouched under the shadow of the house and looked for her mother  she was hurrying over the rocks a hundred yards off whither to drown herself in the sea no she held on along the midbeach right across the cove toward arthurs nose but why grace must know  she felt she knew not why that this strange journey that wild the lord will provide had to do with the subject of her suspicion perhaps this was the crisis perhaps all will he cleared up tonight for joy or for utter shame  the tide was low the beach was bright in the western moonlight only along the cliff foot lay a strip of shadow a quarter of a mile long till the nose like a great black wall buried the corner of the cove in darkness  along that strip of shadow she ran crouching now stumbling over a boulder now crushing her bare feet between the sharp pebbles as heedless where she stepped she kept her eye fixed on her mother as if fascinated she could see nothing else in heaven or earth but that dark figure hurrying along with a dogged determination and then stopping a moment to look round as if in fear of a pursuer and then grace lay down on the cold stones and pressed herself into the very earth and the moment her mother turned to go forward sprang up and followed  and then a true womans thought flashed across her and shaped itself into a prayer for herself she never thought but if the coast guardsman above should see her mother stop her question her god grant that he might be on the other side of the point and she hurried on again  near the nose the rocks ran high and jagged her mother held on to them passed through a narrow chasm and disappeared  grace now not fifty yards from her darted out of the shadow into the moonlight and ran breathlessly toward the spot where she had seen her mother last like anderssens little seamaiden she went every step on sharp knives across the rough beds of barnacles but she felt no pain in the greatness of her terror and her love  she crouched between the rocks a moment heard her mother slipping and splashing among the pools and glided after her like a ghosta guardian angel rathertill she saw her emerge again for a moment into the moonlight upon a strip of beach beneath the nose  it was a weird and lonely spot and a dangerous spot withal for only at low springtide could it be reached from the land and then the flood rose far up the cliff covering all the shingle and filling the mouth of a dark cavern had her mother gone to that cavern it was impossible to see so utterly was the cliff shrouded in shadow  shivering with cold and excitement grace crouched down and gazed into the gloom till her eyes swam and a hundred fantastic figures and sparks of fire seemed to dance between her and the rock sparks of fireyes but that last one was no fancy an actual flash the crackle and sputter of a match what could it mean another match was lighted and a moment after the glare of a lanthorn showed her mother entering beneath the polished arch of rock which glared lurid overhead like the gateway of the pit of fire  the light vanished into the windings of the cave and then grace hardly knowing what she did rushed up the beach and crouched down once more at the caves mouth there she sat she knew not how long listening listening like a hunted hare her whole faculties concentrated in the one sense of hearing her eyes wandering vacantly over the black saws of rock and glistening oarweed beds and bright phosphoric sea thank heaven there was not a ripple to break the silence ah what was that sound within she pressed her ear against the rock to hear more surely a rumbling as of stones rolled down and thenwas it a fancy or were her powers of hearing intensified by excitement actually equal to discern the chink of coin who knows but in another moment she had glided in silently swiftly holding her very breath and saw her mother kneeling on the ground the lanthorn by her side and in her hand the longlost belt  she did not speak she did not move she always knew in her heart of hearts that so it was but when the sin took bodily shape and was there before her very eyes it was too dreadful to speak of to act upon yet and amid the most torturing horror and disgust of that great sin rose up in her the divinest love for the sinner she feltstrange paradoxthat she had never loved her mother as she did at that moment oh that it had been i who had done it and not she and her mothers sin was to her her own sin her mothers shame her shame till all sense of her mothers guilt vanished in the light of her divine love oh that i could take her up tenderly tell her that all is forgiven and forgotten by man and godserve her as i have never served her yet nurse her to sleep on my bosom and then go forth and bear her punishment even if need be on the gallowstree and there she stood in a silent agony of tender pity drinking her portion of the cup of him who bore the sins of all the world  silently she stood and silently she turned to go to go home and pray for guidance in that dark labyrinth of confused duties her mother heard the rustle looked up and sprang to her feet with a scream dropping gold pieces on the ground  her first impulse was wild terror she was discovered by whom she knew not she clasped her evil treasure to her bosom and thrusting grace against the rock fled wildly out  mother mother shrieked grace rushing after her the shawl fell from her shoulders her mother looked back and saw the white figure  gods angel gods angel come to destroy me as he came to balaam and in the madness of her guilty fancy she saw in graces hand the fiery sword which was to smite her  another step looking backward still and she had tripped over a stone she fell and striking the back of her head against the rock lay senseless  tenderly grace lifted her up went for water to a pool near by bathed her face calling on her by every term of endearment slowly the old woman recovered her consciousness but showed it only in moans her head was cut and bleeding grace bound it up and then taking that fatal belt bound it next to her own heart never to be moved from thence till she should put it into the hands of him to whom it belonged  and then she lifted up her mother  come home darling mother and she tried to make her stand and walk  the old woman only moaned and waved her away impatiently grace put her on her feet but she fell again the lower limbs seemed all but paralysed  slowly that sweet saint lifted her and laid her on her own back and slowly she bore her homeward with aching knees and bleeding feet while before her eyes hung the picture of him who bore his cross up calvary till a solemn joy and pride in that sacred burden seemed to intertwine itself with her deep misery and fainting every moment with pain and weakness she still went on as if by supernatural strength and murmured  thou didst bear more for me and shall not i bear even this for thee  surely if blest spirits can weep and smile over the woes and heroisms of us mortal men faces brighter than the stars looked down on that fair girl that night and in loving sympathy called her too blest  at last it was over undiscovered she reached home laid her mother on the bed and tended her till morning but long ere morning dawned stupor had changed into delirium and graces ears were all on fire with words which those who have ever heard will have no heart to write  and now by one of those strange vagaries in which epidemics so often indulge appeared other symptoms and by daydawn cholera itself  heale though recovering was still too weak to be of use but happily the medical man sent down by the board of health was still in the town  grace sent for him but he shook his head after the first look the wretched womans ravings at once explained the case and made it in his eyes all but hopeless  the sudden shock to body and mind the sudden prostration of strength had brought out the disease which she had dreaded so intensely and against which she had taken so many precautions and which yet lay all the while lurking unfelt in her system  a hideous eightandforty hours followed the preachers and classleaders came to pray over the dying woman but she screamed to grace to send them away she had just sense enough left to dread that she might betray her own shame would she have the new clergyman then no she would have no oneno one could help her let her only die in peace  and grace closed the door upon all but the doctor who treated the wild sufferers wild words as the mere fancies of delirium and then grace watched and prayed till she found herself alone with the dead  she wrote a letter to thurnall  siri have found your belt and all the money i believe and trust which it contained if you will be so kind as to tell me where and how i shall send it to you you will take a heavy burden off the mind of  your obedient humble servant who trusts that you will forgive her having been unable to fulfil her promise  she addressed the letter to whitbury for thither tom had ordered his letters to be sent but she received no answer  the day after mrs harvey was buried the sale of all her effects was announced in aberalva  grace received the proceeds went round to all the creditors and paid them all which was due she had a few pounds left what to do with that she knew full well  she showed no sign of sorrow but she spoke rarely to any one a dead dull weight seemed to hang over her to preachers classleaders gossips who upbraided her for not letting them see her mother she replied by silence people thought her becoming idiotic  the day after the last creditor was paid she packed up her little box hired a cart to take her to the nearest coach and vanished from aberalva without bidding farewell to a human being even to her schoolchildren                                       vavasour had been buried more than a week mark and mary were sitting in the diningroom mark at his port and mary at her work when the footboy entered  sir theres a young woman wants to speak with you  show her in if she looks respectable said mark who had slippers on and his feet on the fender and was therefore loth to move  oh quite respectable sir as ever i see and the lad ushered in a figure dressed and veiled in deep black  well maam sit down pray and what can i do for you  can you tell me sir answered a voice of extraordinary sweetness and gentleness very firm and composed withal if mr thomas thurnall is in whitbury  thurnall he has sailed for the east a week ago may i ask your business with him can i help you in it  the black damsel paused so long that both mary and her father felt uneasy and a cloud passed over marks brow  can the boy have been playing tricks said he to himself  then sir as i hear that you have influence can you get me a situation as one of the nurses who are going out thither so i hear  get you a situation yes of course if you are competent  thank you sir perhaps if you could be so very kind as to tell me to whom i am to apply in town for i shall go thither tonight  my goodness cried mark old mark dont do things in this offhand coldblooded way let us know who you are my dear and about mr thurnall have you anything against him  she was silent  mary just step into the next room  if you please sir said the same gentle voice i had sooner that the lady should stay i have nothing against mr thurnall god knows he has rather something against me  another pause  mary rose and went up to her and took her hand  do tell us who you are and if we can do anything for you  and she looked winningly up into her face  the stranger drew a long breath and lifted her veil mary and mark both started at the beauty of the countenance which she revealedbut in a different way mark gave a grunt of approbation mary turned pale as death  i suppose that it is but right and reasonable that i should tell you at least give proof of my being an honest person for my capabilities as a nursei believe you know mrs vavasour i heard that she has been staying here  of course do you know her  a sad smile passed over her face  yes well enough at least for her to speak for me i should have asked her or miss st just to help me to a nurses place but i did not like to trouble them in their distress how is the poor lady now sir  i know who she is cried mary by a sudden inspiration is not your name harvey are you not the schoolmistress who saved mr thurnalls life who behaved so nobly in the cholera yes i knew you were come and sit down and tell me all i have so longed to know you dear creature i have felt as if you were my own sister hemr thurnall wrote often about all your heroism  grace seemed to choke down somewhat and then answered steadfastly  i did not come here my dear lady to hear such kind words but to do an errand to mr thurnall you have heard perhaps that when he was wrecked last spring he lost some money yes then it was stolen stolen she repeated with a great gasp never mind by whom not by me  you need not tell us that my dear interrupted mark  god kept it and i have it here and she pressed her hands tight over her bosom and here i must keep it till i give it into his hands if i follow him round the world and as she spoke her eyes shone in the lamplight with an unearthly brilliance which made mary shudder  mark armsworth poured a libation to the goddess of puzzledom in the shape of a glass of port which first choked him and then descended over his clean shirt front but after he had coughed himself black in the face he began  my good girl if you are grace harvey youre welcome to my roof and an honour to it say i but as for taking all that money with you across the seas and such a pretty helpless young thing as you are god help you it mustnt be and shant be and thats flat  but i must go to him said she in so naïve halfwild a fashion that mary comprehending all looked imploringly at her father and putting her arm round grace forced her into a seat  i must go sir and tell himtell him myself no one knows what i know about it  mark shook his head  could i not write to him he knows me as well as he knows his own father  grace shook her head and pressed her hand upon her heart where toms belt lay  do you think madam that after having had the dream of this belt the shape of this belt and of the money which is in it branded into my brain for monthsyears it seems likeby gods fire of shame and suspicionand seen him poor miserable fretful unbelieving for the want of ito god i cant tell even your sweet face alldo you think that now i have it in my hands i can part with it or rest till it is in his no not though i walk barefoot after him to the ends of the earth  let his father have the money then and do you take him the belt as a token if you must  thats it mary shouted mark armsworth you always come in with the right hint girl and the two combining their forces at last talked poor grace over but upon going out herself she was bent to ask his forgiveness in her mothers name was her one fixed idea he might die and not know all not have forgiven all and go she must  but it is a thousand to one against your seeing him we even dont know exactly where he is gone  grace shuddered a moment and then recovered her calmness  i did not expect this but be it so i shall meet him if god wills and if not i can still workwork  i think mary youd better take the young woman upstairs and make her sleep here tonight said mark glad of an excuse to get rid of them which when he had done he pulled his chair round in front of the fire put a foot on each hob and began rubbing his eyes vigorously  dear me dear me what a lot of good people there are in this old world to be sure ten times better than me at leastmake one ashamed of oneselfand if one isnt even good enough for this world hows one to be good enough for heaven  and mary carried grace upstairs and into her own bedroom a bed should be made up there for her it would do her good just to have anything so pretty sleeping in the same room and then she got grace supper and tried to make her talk but she was distrait reserved for a new and sudden dread had seized her at the sight of that fine house fine plate fine friends these were his acquaintances then no wonder that he would not look on such as her and as she cast her eye round the really luxurious chamber and after falteringly asking mary whether she had any brothers and sisters guessed that she must be the heiress of all that wealth she settled in her heart that tom was to marry mary and the intimate tone in which mary spoke of him to her and her innumerable inquiries about him made her more certain that it was a settled thing handsome she was not certainly but so sweet and good and that her own beauty if she was aware that she possessed any could have any weight with tom she would have considered as an insult to his sense so she made up her mind slowly but steadily that thus it was to be and every fresh proof of marys sweetness and goodness was a fresh pang to her for it showed the more how probable it was that tom loved her  therefore she answered all marys questions carefully and honestly as to a person who had a right to ask and at last went to her bed and worn out in body and mind was asleep in a moment she had not remarked the sigh which escaped mary as she glanced at that beautiful head and the long black tresses which streamed down for a moment over the white shoulders ere they were knotted back for the night and then at her own poor countenance in the glass opposite                                       it was long past midnight when grace woke she knew not how and looking up saw a light in the room and mary sitting still over a book her head resting on her hands she lay quiet and thought she heard a sob she was sure she heard tears drop on the paper she stirred and mary was at her side in a moment  did you want anything  only toto remind you maam it is not wise to sit up so late  only that said mary laughing i do that every night alone with god and i do not think he will be the farther off for your being here  one thing i had to ask said grace it would lesson my labour so if you could give me any hint of where he might be  we know as we told you as little as you his letters are to be sent to constantinople some from aberalva are gone thither already  and mine among them thought grace it is gods will madam if it would not seem forward on my partif you could tell him the truth and what i have for him and where i am in case he might wishwish to see mewhen you were writing  of course i will or my father will said mary who did not like to confess either to herself or to grace that it was very improbable that she would ever write again to tom thurnall  and so the two sweet maidens so near that moment to an explanation which might have cleared up all went on each in her ignorance for so it was to be  the next morning grace came down to breakfast modest cheerful charming mark made her breakfast with them gave her endless letters of recommendation wanted to take her to see old doctor thurnall which she declined and then sent her to the station in his own carriage paid her fare firstclass to town and somehow or other contrived with marys help that she should find in her bag two tenpound notes which she had never seen before after which he went out to his countinghouse only remarking to mary  very extraordinary young woman and very handsome too will make some man a jewel of a wife if she dont go mad or die of the hospital fever  to which mary fully assented little she guessed and little did her father that it was for graces sake that tom had refused her hand  a few days more and grace harvey also had gone eastward ho     chapter xxvii  a recent explosion in an ancient crater   it is perhaps a pity for the human race in general that some enterprising company cannot buy up the moselle not the wine but the river cut it into fivemile lengths and distribute them over europe wherever there is a demand for lovely scenery for lovely is its proper epithet it is not grand not excitingso much the better it is scenery to live and die in scenery to settle in and study a single landscape till you know every rock and walnuttree and vineleaf by heart not merely to run through in one hasty steamtrip as you now do in a long burning day which makes you not drunkbut wearywith excess of beauty besides there are two or three points so superior to the rest that having seen them one cares to see nothing more that paradise of emerald purple and azure which opens behind treis and that strange heap of oldworld houses at berncastle which have scrambled up to the top of a rock to stare at the steamer and have never been able to get down againbetween them and after them one feels like a child who after a great mouthful of pineapple jam is condemned to have poured down its throat an everlasting stream of treacle  so thought stangrave on board the steamer as he smoked his way up the shallows and wondered which turn of the river would bring him to his destination when would it all be over and he never leaped on shore more joyfully than he did at alf that afternoon to jump into a carriage and trundle up the gorge of the issbach some six lonely weary miles till he turned at last into the wooded caldron of the romerkessel and saw the little chapel crowning the central knoll with the white highroofed houses of bertrich nestling at its foot  he drives up to the handsome old kurhaus nestling close beneath heatherclad rocks upon its lawn shaded with huge horsechestnuts and set round with dahlias and geraniums and delicate tinted german stocks which fill the air with fragrance a place made only for young loverscertainly not for those black petticoated worthies each with that sham of a sham the modern tonsure pared down to a poor florins breadth among their bushy welloiled curls who sit at little tables passing the lazy day à muguetter les bourgeoises of sarrebruck and treves and sipping the fragrant josephshoferperhaps at the good bourgeois expense  past them stangrave slips angrily for that development of humanity can find no favour in his eyes being not human at all but professedly superhuman and therefore practically sometimes inhuman  he hurries into the public room seizes on the visitors book  the names are there in their own handwriting but where are they  waiters are seized and questioned the english ladies came back last night and are gone this afternoon  where are they gone  nobody recollects not even the man from whom they hired the carriage but they are not gone far their servants and their luggage are still here perhaps the herr oberbadmeister lieutenant d will know oh it will not trouble him an english gentleman der herr lieutenant will be only too happy and in ten minutes der herr lieutenant appears really only too happy and stangrave finds himself at once in the company of a soldier and a gentleman had their acquaintance been a longer one he would have recognised likewise the man of taste and of piety  i can well appreciate sir says he in return to stangraves anxious inquiries your impatience to rejoin your lovely countrywomen who have been for the last three weeks the wonder and admiration of our little paradise and whose four days absence was regarded believe me as a public calamity  i can well believe it but they are not countrywomen of mine the one lady is an englishwoman the otheri believean italian  and der herr  an american  ah a still greater pleasure sir i trust that you will carry back across the atlantic a good report of a spot all but unknown i fear to your compatriots you will meet one i think on the return of the ladies  a compatriot  yes a gentleman who arrived here this morning and who seemed from his conversation with them to belong to your noble fatherland he went out driving with them this afternoon whither i unfortunately know not ah good saint nicholasfor though i am a lutheran i must invoke him nowlook out yonder  stangrave looked and joined in the general laugh of lieutenant waiters priests and bourgeoises  for under the chestnuts strutted like him in struwelpeter as though he were a very king of ashantee sabinas black boy who had taken to himself a scarlet umbrella and a great cigar while after him came also like them in struwelpeter caspar bretzel in hand and ludwig with his hoop and all the naughty boys of bertrich town hooting and singing in chorus after the fashion of german children  the resemblance to the wellknown scene in the german childs book was perfect and as the children shouted    ein kohlpechrabenschwarzer mohr   die sonne schien ihm ins gehirn   da nahm er seinen sonnenschirm  more than one grown person joined therein  stangrave longed to catch hold of the boy and extract from him all news but the blackamoor was not quite in respectable company enough at that moment and stangrave had to wait till he strutted proudly up to the door and entered the hall with a bland smile evidently having taken the hooting as a homage to his personal appearance  ah mas stangrave glad see you sir quite a party of us now mong dese barian heathen foreigners mas thurnall he come dis mornin gone up picken bush wid de ladies he he not seen him dis tree year afore  thurnall stangraves heart sank within him his first impulse was to order a carriage and return whence he came but it would look so odd and moreover be so foolish that he made up his mind to stay and face the worst so he swallowed a hasty dinner and then wandered up the narrow valley with all his suspicions of thurnall and marie seething more fiercely than ever in his heart  some halfmile up a path led out of the main road to a wooden bridge across the stream he followed it careless whither he went and in five minutes found himself in the quaintest little woodland cavern he ever had seen  it was simply a great block of black lava crowned with brushwood and supported on walls and pillars of dutch cheeses or what should have been dutch cheeses by all laws of shape and colour had not his fingers proved to them that they were stone how they got there and what they were puzzled him for he was no geologist and finding a bench inside he sat down and speculated thereon  there was more than one doorway to the cheese cellar it stood beneath a jutting knoll and the path ran right through so that as he sat he could see up a narrow gorge to his left roofed in with trees and down into the main valley on his right where the issbach glittered clear and smooth beneath redberried mountainash and yellow leaves  there he sat and tried to forget marie in the tinkling of the streams and the sighing of the autumn leaves and the cooing of the sleepy doves while the icebird as the germans call the waterouzel sat on a rock in the river below and warbled his low sweet song and then flitted up the grassy reach to perch and sing again on the next rock above  and whether it was that he did forget marie awhile or whether he were tired as he well might have been or whether he had too rapidly consumed his bottle of red walporzheimer forgetful that it alone of german wines combines the delicacy of the rhine sun with the potency of its burgundian vinestock transplanted to the ahr by charlemagne whether it were any of these causes or whether it were not stangrave fell fast asleep in the kaisekellar and slept till it was dark at the risk of catching a great cold  how long he slept he knew not but what wakened him he knew full well voices of people approaching and voices which he recognised in a moment  sabina yes and marie too laughing merrily and among their shriller tones the voice of thurnall he had not heard it for years but considering the circumstances under which he had last heard it there was no fear of his forgetting it again  they came down the sideglen and before he could rise they had turned the sharp corner of the rock and were in the kaisekellar close to him almost touching him he felt the awkwardness of his position to keep still was perhaps to overhear and that too much to discover himself was to produce a scene and he could not trust his temper that the scene would not be an ugly one and such as women must not witness  he was relieved to find that they did not stop they were laughing about the gloom about being out so late  how jealous some one whom i know would be said sabina if he found you and tom together in this darksome den  i dont care said tom i have made up my mind to shoot him out of hand and marry marie myself shant i now my and they passed on and down to their carriage which had been waiting for them in the road below  what maries answer was or by what name thurnall was about to address her stangrave did not hear but he had heard quite enough  he rose quietly after a while and followed them  he was a dupe an ass the dupe of those bad women and of his ancient enemy it was maddening yet how could sabina be in fault she had not known marie till he himself had introduced her and he could not believe her capable of such baseness the crime must lie between the other two yet  however that might be mattered little to him now he would return order his carriage once more and depart shaking off the dust of his feet against them pah there were other women in the world and women too who would not demand of him to become a hero  he reached the kurhaus and went in but not into the public room for fear of meeting people whom he had no heart to face  he was in the passage in the act of settling his account with the waiter when thurnall came hastily out and ran against him  stangrave stood by the passage lamp so that he saw toms face at once  tom drew back begged a thousand pardons and saw stangraves face in turn  the two men looked at each other for a few seconds stangrave longed to say you intend to shoot me then try at once but he was ashamed of course to make use of words which he had so accidentally overheard  tom looked carefully at stangrave to divine his temper from his countenance it was quite angry enough to give tom excuse for saying to himself  the fellow is mad at being caught at last very well  i think sir said he quietly enough that you and i had better walk outside for a few minutes allow me to retract the apology i just made till we have had some very explicit conversation on other matters  curse his impudence thought stangrave does he actually mean to bully me into marrying her and he replied haughtily enough  i am aware of no matters on which i am inclined to be explicit with mr thurnall or on which mr thurnall has a right to be explicit with me  i am then quoth tom his suspicion increasing in turn do you wish sir to have a scene before this waiter and the whole house or will you be so kind as to walk outside with me  i must decline sir not being in the habit of holding intercourse with an actresss bully  tom did not knock him down but replied smilingly enough  i am far too much in earnest in this matter sir to be stopped by any coarse expressions waiter you may go now will you fight me tomorrow morning or will you not  i may fight a gentleman but not you  well i shall not call you a coward because i know that you are none and i shall not make a row here for a gentlemans reasons which you calling yourself a gentleman seem to have forgotten but this i will do i will follow you till you do fight me if i have to throw up my own prospects in life for it i will proclaim you wherever we meet for what you area mean and base intriguer i will insult you in kursaals and cane you on public places i will be frankensteins man to you day and night till i have avenged the wrongs of this poor girl the dust of whose feet you are not worthy to kiss off  stangrave was surprised at his tone it was certainly not that of a conscious villain but he only replied sneeringly  and pray what may give mr thurnall the right to consider himself the destined avenger of this frail beautys wrongs  i will tell you that after we have fought and somewhat more meanwhile that expression frail beauty is a fresh offence for which i should certainly cane you if she were not in the house  well drawled stangrave feigning an ostentatious yawn i believe the wise method of ridding oneself of impertinents is to grant their requests have you pistols i have none  i have both duellers and revolvers at your service  ah i think well try the revolvers then said stangrave savage from despair and disbelief in all human goodness after what has passed five or six shots apiece will be hardly outré  hardly i think said tom will you name your second  i know no one i have not been here two hours but i suppose they do not matter much  humph it is as well to have witnesses in case of accident there are a couple of roystering burschen in the public room who i think would enjoy the office both have scars on their faces so they will be au fait at the thing shall i have the honour of sending one of them to you  as you will sir my number is 34 and the two fools turned on their respective heels and walked off  at sunrise next morning tom and his second are standing on the falkenhohe at the edge of the vast circular pit blasted out by some explosion which has torn the slate into mere dust and shivers now covered with a thin coat of turf  schöne aussicht says the bursch waving his hand round in a tone which is benevolently meant to withdraw toms mind from painful considerations  very pretty prospect indeed youre sure you understand that revolver thoroughly  the bursch mutters to himself something about english nonchalance and assures thurnall that he is competently acquainted with the weapon as indeed he ought to be for having never seen one before he has been talking and thinking of nothing else since they left bertrich  and why does not tom care to look at the prospect certainly not because he is afraid he slept as soundly as ever last night and knows not what fear means but somehow the glorious view reminds him of another glorious view which he saw last summer walking by grace harveys side from tolchards farm and that subject he will sternly put away he is not sure but what it might unman even him  the likeness certainly exists for the rock being the same in both places has taken the same general form and the wanderer in rhineprussia and nassau might often fancy himself in devon or cornwall true here there is no sea and there no moselkopf raises its huge cratercone far above the uplands all golden in the level sun but that brown tannus far away or that brown hundsruck opposite with its deepwooded gorges barred with level gleams of light across black gulfs of shade might well be dartmoor or carcarrow moor itself high over aberalva town which he will see no more true in cornwall there would be no slagcliffs of the falkenley beneath his feet as black and blasted at this day as when yon orchard meadow was the mouth of hell and the southwest wind dashed the great flame against the cinder cliff behind and forged it into walls of timedefying glass but that might well be alva stream that issbach in its green gulf far below winding along toward the green gulf of the mosellehe will look at it no more lest he see grace herself come to him across the down to chide him with sacred horror for the dark deed which he has come to do  and yet he does not wish to kill stangrave he would like to wing him he must punish him for his conduct to marie punish him for last nights insult it is a necessity but a disagreeable one he would be sorry to go to the war with that mans blood upon his hand he is sorry that he is out of practice  a year ago i could have counted on hitting him where i liked i trust i shall not blunder against his vitals now however if i do he has himself to blame  the thought that stangrave may kill him never crosses his mind of course out of six shots fired at all distances from forty paces to fifteen one may hit him but as for being killed  toms heart is hardened melted again and again this summer for a moment only to freeze again he all but believes that he bears a charmed life all the miraculous escapes of his past years instead of making him believe in a living guiding protecting father have become to that proud hard heart the excuse for a deliberate though unconscious atheism his fall is surely near  at last stangrave and his second appear stangrave is haggard not from fear but from misery and rage and selfcondemnation this is the end of all his fine resolves pah what use in them what use in being a martyr in this world all men are liars and all women too  tom and stangrave stand a little apart from each other while one of the seconds paced the distance he steps out away from them across the crater floor carrying toms revolver in his hand till he reaches the required point and turns  he turns but not to come back without a gesture or an exclamation which could explain his proceedings he faces about once more and rushes up the slope as hard as legs and wind permitted  tom is confounded with astonishment either the bursch is seized with terror at the whole business or he covets the muchadmired revolver in either case he is making off with it before the owners eyes  stop hillo stop thief hes got my pistol and away goes thurnall in chase after the bursch who never looking behind never sees that he is followed while stangrave and the second bursch look on with wide eyes  now the bursch is a gymnast and a capital runner and so is tom likewise and brilliant is the race upon the falkenhohe but the victory after a while becomes altogether a question of wind for it was all uphill the crater being one of explosion and not of elevation as the geologists would say does not slope downward again save on one side from its outer lip and tom and the bursch were breasting a fair hill after they had emerged from the kessel below  now the bursch had had too much thronerhofberger the night before and possibly as burschen will in their vacations the night before that also whereby his diaphragm surrendered at discretion while his heels were yet unconquered and he suddenly felt a strong gripe and a stronger kick which rolled him over on the turf  the hapless youth who fancied himself alone upon the mountain tops roared mere incoherences and tom too angry to listen and too hurried to punish tore the revolver out of his grasp whereon one barrel exploded  i have done it now  no the ball had luckily buried itself in the ground  tom turned to rush down hill again and meet the impatient stangrave  crackwhinggg  a bullet  yes and prodigy on prodigy up the hill towards him charged as he would upon a whole army a prussian gendarme with bayonet fixed  tom sat down upon the mountainside and burst into inextinguishable laughter while the gendarme came charging up right toward his very nose  but up to his nose he charged not for his wind was short and the noise of his roaring went before him moreover he knew that tom had a revolver and was a mad englishman now he was not afraid of tom or of a whole army but he was a man of drills and of orders of rules and of precedents as a prussian gendarme ought to be and for the modes of attacking infantry cavalry and artillery man woman and child thief and poacher stray pig or even stray wolf he had drill and orders sufficient but for attacking a colts revolver none  moreover for arresting all manner of riotous burschen drunken boors french red republicans mazzinihatted italian refugees suspect polish incendiaries or other feras naturse he had precedent and regulation but for arresting a mad englishman none he held fully the opinion of his superiors that there was no saying what an englishman might not could not and would not do he was a sphinx a chimera a lunatic broke loose who took unintelligible delight in getting wet and dirty and tired and starved and all but lolled and called the same taking exercise who would see everything that nobody ever cared to see and who knew mysteriously everything about everywhere whose deeds were like his opinions utterly subversive of all constituted order in heaven and earth being probably the inhabitant of another planet possibly the man in the moon himself who had been turned out having made his native satellite too hot to hold him all that was to be done with him was to inquire whether his passport was correct and then with a due regard to selfpreservation to endure his vagaries in pitying wonder  so the gendarme paused panting and not daring to approach walked slowly and solemnly round tom keeping the point of his bayonet carefully towards him and roaring at intervals  you have murdered the young man  but i have not said tom look and see  but i saw him fall  but he has got up again and run away  so then where is your passport  that one other fact cognisable by the mind of a prussian gendarme remained as an anchor for his brains under the new and trying circumstances and he used it here quoth tom pulling it out  the gendarme stepped cautiously forward  dont be frightened ill stick it on your bayonetpoint and suiting the action to the word tom caught the bayonetpoint put the passport on it and pulled out his cigarcase  mad englishman murmured the gendarme so the passport is correct but der herr must consider himself under arrest der herr will give up his deathinstrument  by all means says tom and gives up the revolver  the gendarme takes it very cautiously meditates awhile how to carry it sticks the point of his bayonet into its muzzle and lifts it aloft  schon das kriegt has der herr any more deathinstruments  dozens says tom and begins fumbling in his pockets from whence he pulls a case of surgical instruments another of mathematical ones another of lancets and a knife with innumerable blades saws and pickers every one of which he opens carefully and then spreads the whole fearful array upon the grass before him  the gendarme scratches his head over those too plain proofs of some tremendous conspiracy  so man must have a dozen hands he is surely palmerston himself or at least hecker or mazzini murmurs he as he meditates how to stow them all  he thinks now that the revolver may be safe elsewhere and that the knife will do best on the bayonetpoint so he unships the revolver  bang goes barrel number two and the ball goes into the turf between his feet  you will shoot yourself soon at that rate says tom  so der herr speaks german like a native says the gendarme growing complimentary in his perplexity perhaps der herr would be so good as to carry his deathinstruments himself and attend on the herr polizeirath who is waiting to see him  by all means and tom picks up his tackle while the prudent gendarme reloads and tom marches down the hill the gendarme following with his bayonet disagreeably near the small of toms back  dont stumble look out for the stones or youll have that skewer through me  so der herr speaks german like a native says the gendarme civilly it is certainly der palmerston thinks he his manners are so polite  once at the crater edge and able to see into the pit the mystery is in part at least explained for there stand not only stangrave and bursch number two but a second gendarme two elderly gentlemen two ladies and a black boy  one is lieutenant d by his white moustache he is lecturing the bursch who looks sufficiently foolish the other is a portly and awfullooking personage in uniform evidently the polizeirath of those parts armed with the just terrors of the law but justice has if not her eyes bandaged at least her hands tied for on his arm hangs sabina smiling chatting entreating the polizeirath smiles bows ogles evidently a willing captive venus had disarmed rhadamanthus as she has mars so often and the sword of justice must rust in its scabbard  some distance behind them is stangrave talking in a low voice earnestly passionatelyto whom but to marie  and lastly opposite each other and like two dogs who are uncertain whether to make friends or fight are a gendarme and sabinas black boy the gendarme with shouldered musket is trying to look as stiff and cross as possible being scandalised by his superior officers defection from the path of duty and still more by the irreverence of the black boy who is dancing grinning snapping his fingers in delight at having discovered and prevented the coming tragedy  tom descends bowing courteously apologises for having been absent when the highly distinguished gentleman arrived and turning to the bursch begs him to transmit to his friend who has run away his apologies for the absurd mistake which led him to etc etc  the polizeirath looks at him with much the same blank astonishment as the gendarme had done and at last ends by lifting up his hands and bursting into an enormous german laugh and no one on earth can laugh as a german can so genially and lovingly and with such intense selfenjoyment  oh you english you english you are all mad i think nothing can shame you and nothing can frighten you potz i believe when your guards at alma walked into that battery the other day every one of them was whistling your jim crow even after he was shot dead and the jolly polizeirath laughed at his own joke till the mountain rang but you must leave the country sir indeed you must we cannot permit such conduct herei am very sorry  i entreat you not to apologise sir in any case i was going to alf by eight oclock to meet the steamer for treves i am on my way to the war in the east viâ marseilles if you would therefore be so kind as to allow the gendarme to return me that second revolver which also belongs to me  give him his pistol shouted the magistrate  potz let us be rid of him at any cost and live in peace like honest germans ah poor queen victoria what a lot to have the government of fiveandtwenty million such  not fiveandtwenty millions says sabina  that would include the ladies and we are not mad too surely your excellency  the polizeirath likes to be called your excellency of course or any other mighty title which does or does not belong to him and that sabina knows full well  ah my dear madam how do i know that the english ladies do every day here what no other dames would dare or dreamwhat then must you be at home ach your poor husbands  mr thurnall calls marie from behind mr thurnall  tom comes with a quaint dogged smile on his face  you see him mr stangrave you see the man who risked for me liberty lifewho rescued me from slavery shame suicidewho was to me a brother a father for yearswithout whose disinterested heroism you would never have set eyes on the face which you pretend to love and you repay him by suspicioninsultapologise to him sir ask his pardon now here utterly humbly or never speak to marie lavington again  tom looked first at her and then at stangrave marie was convulsed with excitement her thin cheeks were crimson her eyes flashed very flame stangrave was palecalm outwardly but evidently not within he was looking on the ground in thought so intense that he hardly seemed to hear marie poor fellow he had heard enough in the last ten minutes to bewilder any brain  at last he seemed to have strung himself for an effort and spoke without looking up  mr thurnall  sir  i have done you a great wrong  we will say no more about it sir it was a mistake and i do not wish to complicate the question my true ground of quarrel with you is your conduct to miss lavington she seems to have told you her true name so i shall call her by it  what i have done i have undone said stangrave looking up if i have wronged her i have offered to right her if i have left her i have sought her again and if i left her when i knew nothing now that i know all i ask her here before you to become my wife  tom looked inquiringly at marie  yes i have told him allall and she hid her face in her hands  well said tom mr stangrave is a very enviable person and the match in a worldly point of view is a most fortunate one for miss lavington and that stupid rascal of a gendarme has broken my revolver  but i have not accepted him cried marie and i will not unless you give me leave  tom saw stangraves brow lower and pardonably enough at this  my dear miss lavington as i have never been able to settle my own love affairs satisfactorily to myself i do not feel at all competent to settle other peoples goodbye i shall be late for the steamer and bowing to stangrave and marie he turned to go  sabina stop him cried she he is going without even a kind word  sabina whispered tom as he passed hera had businessselfish coxcomb when her beauty goes wont stand her temper and her flightiness but i know you and claude will take care of the poor thing if anything happens to me  youre wrongprejudicedindeed  tut tut tutgoodbye you sweet little sunbeam good morning gentlemen  and tom hurried up the slope and out of sight while marie burst into an agony of weeping  gone without a kind word  stangrave bit his lip not in anger but in manly selfreproach  it is my fault marie my fault he knew me too well of old and had too much reason to despise me but he shall have reason no longer he will come back and find me worthy of you and all will be forgotten again i say it i accept your quest for life and death so help me god above as i will not fail or falter till i have won justice for you and for your race marie  he conquered how could he but conquer for he was man and she was woman and he looked more noble in her eyes while he was confessing his past weakness than he had ever done in his proud assertion of strength  but she spoke no word in answer she let him take her hand pass her arm through his and lead her away as one who had a right  they walked down the hill behind the rest of the party blest but silent and pensive he with the weight of the future she with that of the past  it is very wonderful she said at last wonderful  that you can care for me oh if i had known how noble you were i should have told you all at once  perhaps i should have been as ignoble as ever said stangrave if that young english viscount had not put me on my mettle by his own nobleness  no no do not belie yourself you know what he does notwhat i would have died sooner than tell him  stangrave drew the arm closer through his and clasped the hand marie did not withdraw it  wonderful wonderful love she said quite humbly her theatric passionateness had passed    nothing was left of her   now but pure womanly  that you can love meme the slave me the scourged the scarredoh stangrave it is not muchnot much reallyonly a little mark or two  i will prize them he answered smiling through tears more than all your loveliness i will see in them gods commandment to me written not on tables of stone but on fair pure noble flesh my marie you shall have cause even to rejoice in them  i glory in them now for without them i never should have known all your worth  the next day stangrave marie and sabina were hurrying home to england while tom thurnall was hurrying to marseilles to vanish eastward ho  he has escaped once more but his heart is hardened still what will his fall be like     chapter xxviii  last christmas eve   and now two years and more are past and gone and all whose lot it was have come westward ho once more sadder and wiser men to their lives end save one or two that is from whom not even solomons pestle and mortar discipline would pound out the innate folly  frank has come home stouter and browner as well as heartier and wiser than he went forth he is valencias husband now and rector not curate of aberalva town and valencia makes him a noble rectors wife  she too has had her sad experiencesof more than absent love for when the news of inkerman arrived she was sitting by lucias deathbed and when the ghastly list came home and with it the news of scoutbush severely wounded by a musketball she had just taken her last look of the fair face and seen in fancy the fair spirit greeting in the eternal world the soul of him whom she loved unto the death she had hurried out to scutari to nurse her brother had seen there many a sightshe best knows what she saw she sent scoutbush back to the crimea to try his chance once more and then came home to be a mother to those three orphan children from whom she vowed never to part so the children went with frank and her to aberalva and valencia had learnt half a mothers duties ere she had a baby of her own  and thus to her as to all hearts has the war brought a discipline from heaven  frank shrank at first from returning to aberalva when scoutbush offered him the living on old st justs death but valencia all but commanded him so he went and behold his return was a triumph  all was understood now all forgiven all forgotten save his conduct in the cholera by the loving honest brave westcountry hearts and when the newmarried pair were rung into the town amid arches and garlands flags and bonfires the first man to welcome frank into his rectory was old tardrew  not a word of repentance or apology ever passed the old bulldogs lips he was an englishman and kept his opinions to himself but he had had his lesson like the rest two years ago in his young daughters death and frank had thenceforth no faster friend than old tardrew  frank is still as high church as ever and likes all pomp and circumstance of worship some few whims he has given up certainly for fear of giving offence but he might indulge them once more if he wished without a quarrel for now that the people understand him he does just what he likes his congregation is the best in the archdeaconry one meetinghouse is dead and the other dying his choir is admirable for valencia has had the art of drawing to her all the musical talent of the tuneful westcountry folk and all that he needs he thinks to make his parish perfect is to see grace harvey schoolmistress once more  what can have worked the change it is difficult to say unless it be that frank has found out from cholera and hospital experiences that his parishioners are beings of like passions with himself and found out too that his business is to leave the gospel of damnation to those whose hapless lot it is to earn their bread by pandering to popular superstition and to employ his independent position as a free rector in telling his people the gospel of salvationthat they have a father in heaven  little scoutbush comes down often to aberalva now and oftener to his irish estates he is going to marry the manchester lady after all and to settle down and try to be a good landlord and use for the benefit of his tenants the sharp experience of human hearts human sorrows and human duty which he gained in the crimea two years ago  and major campbell  look on cathcarts hill a stone is there which is the only earthly token of that great experience of all experiences which campbell gained two years ago  a little silk bag was found hung round his neck and lying next his heart he seemed to have expected his death for he had put a label on it  to be sent to viscount scoutbush for miss st just  scoutbush sent it home to valencia who opened it blind with tears  it was a note written seven years before but not by her by lucia ere her marriage a simple invitation to dinner in eaton square written for lady knockdown but with a postscript from lucia herself do come and i will promise not to tease you as i did last night  that was perhaps the only kind or familiar word which he had ever had from his idol and he had treasured it to the last women can love as this book sets forth but now and then men can love too if they be men as major campbell was  and trebooze of trebooze  even trebooze got his new lesson two years ago terrified into sobriety he went into the militia and soon took delight therein he worked for the first time in his life early and late at a work which was suited for him he soon learnt not to swear and rage for his men would not stand it and not to get drunk for his messmates would not stand it he got into better society and better health than he ever had had before with new selfdiscipline has come new selfrespect and he tells his wife frankly that if he keeps straight henceforth he has to thank for it his six months at aldershott  and mary  when you meet mary in heaven you can ask her there  but franks desire that grace should become his schoolmistress once more is not fulfilled  how she worked at scutari and at balaklava there is no need to tell why mark her out from the rest when all did more than nobly the lesson which she needed was not that which hospitals could teach she had learnt that already it was a deeper and more dreadful lesson still she had set her heart on finding tom on righting him on righting herself she had to learn to be content not to find him not to right him not to right herself  and she learnt it tearless uncomplaining she trusted in god and made no haste she did her work and read her bible and read too again and again at stolen moments of rest a book which some one lent her and which was to her as the finding of an unknown sister longfellows evangeline she was evangeline seeking as she sought perhaps to find as she foundno merciful god not so yet better so than not at all and often and often when a new freight of agony was landed she looked round from bed to bed if his face too might be there and once at balaklava she knew she saw him but not on a sick bed  standing beneath the window chatting merrily with a group of officers it was he could she mistake that figure though the face was turned away her head swam her pulses beat like church bells her eyes were ready to burst from their sockets butshe was assisting at an operation it was gods will and she must endure  when the operation was over she darted wildly down the stairs without a word  he was gone  without a word she came back to her work and possessed her soul in patience  inquiries indeed she made as she had a right to do but no one knew the name she questioned and caused to be questioned men from varna from sevastopol from kerteh from the circassian coast english french and sardinian pole and turk no one had ever heard the name she even found at last and questioned one of the officers who had formed that group beneath the window  oh that man he was a pole michaelowyzcki or some such name at least so he said but he suspected the man to be really a russian spy  grace knew that it was tom but she went back to her work again and in due time went home to england  home but not to aberalva she presented herself one day at mark armsworths house in whitbury and humbly begged him to obtain her a place as servant to old dr thurnall what her purpose was therein she did not explain perhaps she hardly knew herself  jane the old servant who had clung to the doctor through his reverses was growing old and feeble and was all the more jealous of an intruder but grace disarmed her  i do not want to interfere i will be under your orders i will be kitchenmaidmaidofallwork i want no wages i have brought home a little money with me enough to last me for the little while i shall be here  and by the help of mark and mary she took up her abode in the old mans house and ere a month was past she was to him as a daughter  perhaps she had told him all at least there was some deep and pure confidence between them and yet one which so perfect was graces humility did not make old jane jealous grace cooked swept washed went to and fro as jane bade her submitted to all her grumblings and tossings and then came at the old mans bidding to read to him every evening her hand in his her voice cheerful her face full of quiet light but her hair was becoming streaked with gray her face howsoever gentle was sharpened as if with continual pain no wonder for she had worn that belt next her heart for now two years and more till it had almost eaten into the heart above which it lay it gave her perpetual pain and yet that pain was a perpetual joya perpetual remembrance of him and of that walk with him from tolchards farm  mary loved herwanted to treat her as an equalto call her sister but grace drew back lovingly but humbly from all advances for she had divined marys secret with the quick eye of woman she saw how mary grew daily paler thinner sadder and knew for whom she mourned be it so mary had a right to him and she had none                                       and where was tom thurnall all the while  no man could tell  mark inquired lord minchampstead inquired great personages who had need of him at home and abroad inquired but all in vain  a few knew and told lord minchampstead who told mark in confidence that he had been heard of last in the circassian mountains about christmas 1854 but since then all was blank he had vanished into the infinite unknown  mark swore that he would come home some day but two full years were past and tom came not  the old man never seemed to regret him never mentioned his name after a while  mark he said once remember david why weep for the child i shall go to him but he will not come to me  none knew meanwhile why the old man needed not to talk of tom to his friends and neighbours it was because he and grace never talked of anything else                                       so they had lived and so they had waited till that week before last christmasday when mellot and stangrave made their appearance in whitbury and became mark armsworths guests  the week slipped on stangrave hunted on alternate days and on the others went with claude who photographed when there was sun to do it with stangrave end and whitford priory interiors and exteriors not forgetting the stangrave monuments in whitbury church and sat too for many a pleasant hour with the good doctor who took to him at once as all men did it seemed to give fresh life to the old man to listen to toms dearest friend to him as to grace he could talk openly about the lost son and live upon the memory of his prowess and his virtues and ere the week was out the doctor and grace too had heard a hundred gallant feats to tell all which would add another volume to this book  and grace stood silently by the old mans chair and drank all in without a smile without a sigh but not without full many a prayer  it is the blessed christmas eve the light is failing fast when down the high street comes the mighty romannosed rattail which carries marks portly bulk and by him stangrave on a right good horse  they shog on side by sidenot home but to the doctors house for every hunting evening marks groom meets him at the doctors door to lead the horses home while he before he will take his bath and dress brings to his blind friend the gossip of the field and details to him every joke fence find kill hap and mishap of the last six hours  the old man meanwhile is sitting quietly with claude by him talking as claude can talk they are not speaking of tom just now but the eloquent artists conversation suits well enough the temper of the good old man yearning after fresh knowledge even on the brink of the grave but too feeble now in body and in mind to do more than listen claude is telling him about the late photographic exhibition and the old man listens with a triumphant smile to wonders which he will never behold with mortal eyes at last  this is very pleasantto feel surer and surer day by day that one is not needed that science moves forward swift and sure under a higher guidance than ones own that the sacred torchrace never can stand still that he has taken the lamp out of old and failing hands only to put it into young and brave ones who will not falter till they reach the goal  then he lies back again with closed eyes waiting for more facts from claude  how beautiful says claudei must compliment you sirto see the childlike heart thus still beating fresh beneath the honours of the grey head without envy without vanity without ambition welcoming every new discovery rejoicing to see the young outstripping them  and what credit sir to us our knowledge did not belong to us but to him who made us and the universe and our sons belonged to him likewise if they be wiser than their teachers it is only because they like their teachers have made his testimonies their study when we rejoice in the progress of science we rejoice not in ourselves not in our children but in god our instructor  and all the while hidden in the gloom behind stands grace her arms folded over her bosom watching every movement of the old man and listening too to every word she can understand but little of it but she loves to hear it for it reminds her of tom thurnall above all she loves to hear about the microscope a mystery inseparable in her thoughts from him who first showed her its wonders  at last the old man speaks again  ah how delighted my boy will be when he returns to find that so much has been done during his absence  claude is silent awhile startled  you are surprised to hear me speak so confidently well i can only speak as i feel i have had for some days past a presentimentyou will think me doubtless weak for yielding to it i am not superstitious  not so said claude but i cannot deny that such things as presentiments may be possible however miraculous they may seem are they so very much more so than the daily fact of memory i can as little guess why we can remember the past as why we may not at times be able to foresee the future  true you speak if not like a physician yet like a metaphysician so you will not laugh at me and compel the weak old man and his fancy to take refuge with a girlwho is not weakgrace darling you think still that he is coming  she came forward and leaned over him  yes she half whispered he is coming soon to us or else we are soon going to him it may mean that sir perhaps it is better that it should  it matters little child if he be near as near he is i tell you mr mellot this conviction has become so intense during the last week thatthat i believe i should not be thrown off my balance if he entered at this moment i feel him so near me sir thatthat i could swear did i not know how the weak brain imitates expected sounds that i heard his footstep outside now  i heard horses footsteps says claudeah there comes stangrave and our host  i heard them but i heard my boys likewise said the old man quietly  the next minute he seemed to have forgotten the fancy as the two hunters entered and mark began openmouthed as usual  well ned in good company eh thats right mortal cold i am we shall have a white christmas i expect snows coming  what sport asked the doctor blandly  oh nothing new bothered about sidricstone till one got away at last with an old fox and over the downs into the vale i think mr stangrave liked it  mr stangrave likes the vale better than the vale likes him i have fallen into two brooks following claude to the delight of all the desperate englishmen  oh you rode straight enough sir you must pay for your fun in the valebut then you have your fun but there were a good many falls the last ton minutes ground heavy and pace awful old rattail had enough to do to hold his own saw one fellow ride bang into a pollardwillow when there was an open gate close to himcut his cheek open and lay but some one said it was only smith of ewebury so i rode on  i hope you english showed more pity to your wounded friends in the crimea quoth stangrave laughing i wanted to stop and pick him up but mr armsworth would not hear of it  oh sir if it had been a stranger like you half the field would have been round you in a minute but smith dont counthe breaks his neck on purpose three days a weekby the by doctor got a good story of him for you suspected his keepers last month slips out of bed at two in the morning into his own covers and blazes away for an hour nobody comes home to bed and tries the same thing next night not a soul comes near him next morning has up keepers watchers beaters the whole posse and now you rascals ive been poaching my own covers two nights running and youve been all drunk in bed there are your wages to the last penny and vanish ill be my own keeper henceforth and never let me see your faces again  the old doctor laughed cheerily well but did you kill your fox  all right but it was a bursterjust what i always tell mr stangrave afternoon runs are good runs pretty sure of an empty fox and a good scent after one oclock  exactly answered a fresh voice from behind and foxhunting is an epitome of human life you chop or lose your first two or three but keep up your pluck and youll run into one before sundown and i seem to have run into a whole earthful  all looked round for all knew that voice  yes there he was in bodily flesh and blood thin sallow bearded to the eyes dressed in ragged sailors clothes but tom himself  grace uttered a long low soft halflaughing cry full of the delicious agony of sudden relief a cry as of a mother when her child is born and then slipped from the room past the unheeding tom who had no eyes but for his father straight up to the old man he went took both his hands and spoke in the old cheerful voice  well my dear old daddy so you seem to have expected me and gathered i suppose all my friends to bid me welcome im afraid i have made you very anxious but it was not my fault and i knew you would be certain i should come at last eh  my son my son let me feel whether thou be my very son esau or not murmured the old man finding halfplayful expression in the words of scripture for feelings beyond his failing powers  tom knelt down and the old man passed his hands in silence over and over the forehead and face and beard while all stood silent  mark armsworth burst out blubbering like a great boy  i said so i always said so the devil could not kill him and god wouldnt  you wont go away again dear boy im getting oldandand forgetful and i dont think i could bear it again you see  tom saw that the old mans powers were failing never again as long as i live daddy said he and then looking roundi think that we are too many for my father i will come and shake hands with you all presently  no no said the doctor you forget that i cannot see you and so must only listen to you it will be a delight to hear your voice and theirsthey all love you  a few moments of breathless congratulation followed during which mark had seized tom by both his shoulders and held him admiringly at arms length  look at him mr mellot mr stangrave look at him as they said of liberty wilkes you might rob him strip him and hit him over london bridge and you find him the next day in the same place with a laced coat a sword by his side and money in his pocket but how did you come in without our knowing  i waited outside afraid of what i might hearfor how could i tell said he lowering his voice but when i saw you go in i knew all was right and followed you and when i heard my father laugh i knew that he could bear a little surprise but stangrave did you say ah this is too delightful old fellow hows marie and the children  stangrave who was very uncertain as to how tom would receive him had been about to make his amende honorable in a fashion graceful magnificent and as he expressed it afterwards laughingly to thurnall himself altogether highfalutin but what chivalrous and courtly words had arranged themselves upon the tip of his tongue were so utterly upset by toms matteroffact bonhomie and by the cool way in which he took for granted the fact of his marriage that he burst out laughing and caught both toms hands in his  it is delightful and all it needs to make it perfect is to have marie and the children here  how many asked tom  two  is she as beautiful as ever  more so i think  i dare say youre right you ought to know best certainly  you shall judge for yourself she is in london at this moment  tom says his father who has been sitting quietly his face covered in his handkerchief listening to all while holy tears of gratitude steal down his face  sir  you have not spoken to grace yet  grace cries tom in a very different tone from that in which he had yet spoken  grace harvey my boy she was in the room when you came in  grace grace what is she doing here  nursing him like an angel as she is said mark  she is my daughter now tom and has been these twelve months past  tom was silent as one astonished  if she is not she will be soon said he quietly between his clenched teeth gentlemen if youll excuse me for five minutes and see to my fatherand he walked straight out of the room closing the door behind himto find grace waiting in the passage  she was trembling from head to foot stepping to and fro her hands and face all but convulsed her left hand over her bosom clutching at her dress which seemed to have been just disarranged her right drawn back holding something her lips parted struggling to speak her great eyes opened to preternatural wideness fixed on him with an intensity of eagernesswas she mad  at last words bubbled forth there there there it isthe belt your belt take it take it i say  he stood silent and wondering she thrust it into his hand  take it i have carried it for youworn it next my heart till it has all but eaten into my heart to varna and you were not therescutari balaklava and you were not therei found it only a week afteri told you i should and you were gonecruel not to wait and mr armsworth has the moneyevery farthingand the goldhe has had it these two yearsi would give you the belt myself and now i have done it and the snake is unclasped from my heart at last at last at last  her arms dropped by her side and she burst into an agony of tears  tom caught her in his arms but she put him back and looked up in his face again  promise me she said in a low clear voice promise me this one thing only as you are a gentleman as you have a mans pity a mans gratitude in you  anything  promise me that you will never ask or seek to know who had that belt  i promise but grace  then my work is over said she in a calm collected voice amen so lettest thou thy servant depart in peace goodbye mr thurnall i must go and pack up my few things now you will forgive and forget  grace cried tom stay and he girdled her in a grasp of iron you and i never part more in this life perhaps not in all lives to come  me ilet me go i am not worthy of you  i have heard that once alreadythe only folly which ever came out of those sweet lips no grace i love you as man can love but once and you shall not refuse me you will not have the heart grace you will not dare grace for you have begun the work and you must finish it  work what work  i dont know said tom how should i i want you to tell me that  she looked up in his face puzzled his old selfconfident look seemed strangely past away  i will tell you he said because i love you i dont like to show it to them but ive been frightened grace for the first time in my life  she paused for an explanation but she did not straggle to escape from him  frightened beat run to earth myself though i talked so bravely of running others to earth just now grace ive been in prison  in prison in a russian prison oh mr thurnall  ay grace id tried everything but that and i could not stand it death was a joke to that not to be able to get outto rage up and down for hours like a wild beast long to fly at ones gaoler and tear his heart outbeat ones head against the wall in the hope of knocking ones brains outanything to get rid of that horrid notion night and day over onei cant get out  grace had never seen him so excited  but you are safe now said she soothingly oh those horrid russians  but it was not russiansif it had been i could have borne itthat was all in my bargainthe fair chance of war but to be shut up by a mistakeat the very outset tooby a boorish villain of a khan on a drunken suspiciona fellow whom i was trying to serve and who couldnt or wouldnt or darent understand meoh grace i was caught in my own trap i went out full blown with selfconceit never was any one so cunning as i was to besuch a game as i was going to play and make my fortune by itand this brute to stop me shortto make a fool of meto keep me there eighteen months threatening to cut my head off once a quarter and wouldnt understand me let me talk with the tongue of the old serpent  he didnt stop you god stopped you  youre right grace i saw that at last i found out that i had been trying for years which was the stronger god or i i found out i had been trying whether i could not do well enough without him and there i found that i could not gracecould not i felt like a child who had marched off from home fancying it can find its way and is lost at once i felt like a lost child in australia once for one moment but not as i felt in that prison for i had not heard you grace then i did not know that i had a father in heaven who had been looking after me when i fancied that i was looking after myselfi dont half believe it nowif i did i should not have lost my nerve as i have donegrace i dare hardly stir about now lest some harm should come to me i fancy at every turn what if that chimney fell what if that horse kicked outand grace you and you only can cure me of my new cowardice i said in that prison and all the way homeif i can but find herlet me but see herask herlet her teach me and i shall be sure let her teach me and i shall be brave again teach me grace and forgive me  grace was looking at him with her great soft eyes opening slowly like a startled hinds as if the wonder and delight were too great to be taken in at once the last words unlocked her lips  forgive you what do you forgive me  you it is i am the brute ever to have suspected you my conscience told me all along i was a brute and youhave you not proved it to me in this last minute graceproved to me that i am not worthy to kiss the dust from off your feet  grace lay silent in his arms but her eyes were fixed upon him her hands were folded on her bosom her lips moved as if in prayer  he put back her long tresses tenderly and looked into her deep glorious eyes  there i have told you all will you forgive my baseness and take me and teach me about this father in heaven through poverty and wealth for better for worse as my wifemy wife  she leapt up at him suddenly as if waking from a dream and wreathed her arms about his neck  oh mr thurnall my dear brave wise wonderful mr thurnall come home againhome to godand home to me i am not worthy too much happiness too much too muchbut you will forgive will you notand forgetforget  and so the old heart passed away from thomas thurnall and instead of it grew up a heart like his fathers even the heart of a little child
